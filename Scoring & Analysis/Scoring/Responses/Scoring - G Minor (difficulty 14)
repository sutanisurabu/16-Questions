Overview
- Verdict: Correct (identifies G minor)
- Overall score: 72/100 (Good, but with notable theoretical and labeling errors)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 28/30
  - Clearly centers on G minor; uses strong evidence (prevalence of Gm, final F6 → Gm).
- Mode determination (10): 8/10
  - Aeolian (natural minor) conclusion is appropriate given Eb (b6) and F (b7) with no E♮ or F♯. The “Mixolydian inflections” claim is arguable; better framed as a bluesy I7 mixture rather than a modal shift.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 11/20
  - Gets some functions right (VI6 for Eb/G; bVII → i cadence). But several mislabels and contradictions (e.g., wrong inversion claims; “III6, second inversion”; “I7” terminology).
- Slash chords and inversion handling (10): 6/10
  - Correctly treats slash chords as inversions in principle, but misstates inversion/root more than once (Eb/G “second inversion,” then “G is the root,” Bb/F “first inversion”).
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 8/10
  - Good use of bVII → i and repeated tonic to justify G minor.
- Clarity and structure (10): 6/10
  - The narrative is readable but meanders, with self-contradictions that muddy the analysis.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - Some repetition and speculative detours.
- Theoretical precision (5): 2/5
  - Several factual errors (inversion labels, chord roots, conflation of modal and tonal practices, misuse of “half-diminished” and “I7”).

Strengths
- Correct final identification: G minor (Aeolian).
- Cites solid evidence: frequent i, presence of Eb (b6) and F (b7), and bVII → i cadence (F6 → Gm).
- Insightful moment: recognizes B–D–F over G as effectively G7 (I7 color) resolving to i, a common minor-blues mixture.
- Notes absence of E♮/F♯, correctly arguing against Dorian and harmonic/melodic minor as the prevailing collection.

Areas to improve
- Inversion/root confusion:
  - Eb/G: Root is Eb; this is VI6 (first inversion), not “second inversion,” and G is not the root.
  - Bb/F: Root is Bb; this is III6/4 (second inversion), not “first inversion” and not “III6, second inversion” (6 alone denotes first inversion; second inversion is 6/4).
- Harmonic vocabulary:
  - “Bm(b5)” is nonstandard; the triad B–D–F is diminished (B°), not “minor with b5,” and without A it’s not “half-diminished.”
  - Calling G7 “I7” is colloquially understandable in blues, but “tonic dominant” is contradictory in classical-functional terms. Better: “I7 (blues mixture)” or “G7 as mixture from parallel major.”
- Modal/tonal conflation:
  - B♮ does not indicate harmonic or melodic minor (those raise 7 and 6/7, not the 3rd). It’s better explained as mixture/blue note against a minor tonic.
- Speculative detours:
  - Statements like “Bb/F doesn’t fit as VII’s IV” are confusing and unnecessary for establishing key.

Actionable suggestions
- Verify pitch content and roots before assigning inversions; use consistent inversion notation:
  - 6 = first inversion, 6/4 = second inversion; include 7th inversion figures when present (e.g., 6/5, 4/3).
- Use standard chord names:
  - B–D–F = B°; B–D–F–A = Bø7 (half-diminished seventh). Over G bass, B°/G spells G7(no5).
- Frame the G7 over tonic as mixture:
  - “I7” is acceptable in pop/jazz contexts; clarify it as a bluesy mixture/borrowed dominant color over a minor tonic, not a modal (Mixolydian) shift.
- Tighten the mode argument:
  - Emphasize Eb (b6) and F (b7) with no E♮/F♯ as decisive Aeolian traits; acknowledge B♮ as a color tone/mixture rather than modal re-centering.
- Lead with the conclusion, then present a concise, consistent Roman-numeral map.

Reference correction (Roman numerals in G natural minor)
- Progression: Gm | Gm | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gm | Gm | Bb/F | B°/G | Gm | Gm | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gm | Gm | F6 | Gm
  - i | i | VI6 | VI6 | i | i | III6/4 | I7 (mixture; G7 no 5) | i | i | VI6 | VI6 | i | i | bVII(add6) | i

Summary
- The answer lands on the correct key/mode and provides several valid cues, but it contains multiple theoretical inaccuracies and inconsistent inversion labeling. With tighter terminology and cleaner Roman-numeral work, this could move from “good” to “excellent.”

- Overall score: 85/100 (Good)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 30/30
  - Concludes G minor and supports it with frequent Gm and the presence of Eb (b6) and F (b7).
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - Settles on Aeolian (natural minor) and cites the characteristic b6 (Eb). Minor deduction for early Dorian speculation.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 16/20
  - Mostly correct: i (Gm), VI (Eb), III (Bb), VII (F). Catches that B–D–F over G implies G7. Deducted for contradicting itself on Bb/F (initially calling it VII) and for some shaky functional claims.
- Inversions/slash-chord analysis (10): 7/10
  - Correctly identifies Eb/G as first inversion (VI6) and recognizes Bb/F as Bb with F in the bass (III6/4). The Bm(b5)/G reading is ultimately right as G7, but the alternative labeling is off.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 8/10
  - Good tonal-center case (reiterated i, Aeolian pitches). Could have highlighted characteristic motions like bVII → i and noted the absence of a true V–i cadence (no D or D7).
- Clarity and structure (10): 8/10
  - Organized with headings and a clear final answer, but some meandering and internal contradictions.
- Concision and focus (5): 4/5
  - Thorough and mostly on-topic; a bit longer than needed.
- Theoretical precision (5): 3/5
  - Issues: calls a diminished triad “half-diminished,” proposes “G7b9sus4” without the required tones, and speculates “Mixolydian moment/secondary dominant to C minor” without resolution.

Strengths
- Arrives at the correct conclusion: Key = G minor; Mode = Aeolian (natural minor).
- Uses solid modal evidence (Eb and F confirm Aeolian over Dorian or harmonic minor).
- Properly identifies Eb/G as first inversion (VI6) and recognizes that B–D–F over G yields G7.
- Final summary gives coherent functions: i, VI, III, VII, with a chromatic color (G7) over a G pedal moment.

Areas to improve
- Consistency: Initially labels Bb/F as VII, then correctly as III; keep this consistent (Bb in G minor is III; F major is VII).
- Chord-quality terminology: A triad B–D–F is diminished (B°), not “half-diminished” (which requires a seventh: B–D–F–A).
- Incorrect re-labeling: “G7b9sus4” is not supported (b9 = Ab and sus4 = C are not present).
- Speculative function: Calling the G7 a “Mixolydian moment” or “secondary dominant to C minor” is unnecessary without an actual resolution to Cm; better frame it as mixture/altered tonic sonority that returns to i.
- Missed opportunities: Could note the common bVII → i color (F/F6 to Gm) and the lack of leading tone (no F#) reinforcing natural minor rather than harmonic/melodic minor.

Actionable suggestions
- Lead with the answer, then the key evidence:
  - “Key: G minor (Aeolian). Evidence: repeated i (Gm), presence of Eb (b6) and F (b7); Eb/G = VI6, Bb/F = III6/4, F6 = VII(add6).”
- Use precise chord labels:
  - Treat Bm(b5)/G as B°/G, i.e., G7 (G–B–D–F) without extensions; avoid unsupported “b9” or “sus4.”
  - Keep roman numerals consistent: i, VI6 (Eb/G), III6/4 (Bb/F), [G7] as V/iv (non-resolving secondary dominant color), VII(add6) (F6), back to i.
- Avoid mixing modal and tonal frameworks midstream unless clearly justified; here, Aeolian is sufficient, with a momentary chromatic tonic (G7) for color.
- Highlight characteristic motions:
  - Note the plagal-style color bVII → i (F6 → Gm) and the absence of V–i (no D or D7), which supports a modal (Aeolian) rather than functional-dominant cadence profile.

Optional quick corrected mapping
- Gm — Gm — Eb/G — Eb/G — Gm — Gm — Bb/F — B°/G — Gm — Gm — Eb/G — Eb/G — Gm — Gm — F6 — Gm

- Verdict: Correct
- Overall score: 84/100 (Good)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 28/30
  - Correctly lands on G minor as the tonal center and marshals bVI (E♭) and bIII (B♭) as evidence. Briefly entertains B♭ major as an alternative but ultimately prioritizes Gm convincingly.
- Mode determination (10): 8/10
  - Final conclusion of Aeolian (natural minor) is correct with clear justification (presence of E♭, absence of F#). There’s a midstream detour claiming it “fits nicely in G Dorian,” later self-corrected.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 18/20
  - Solid mappings: E♭/G = bVI6, B♭/F = bIII64, F6 = Dm7/F (v7 in first inversion), and Bdim/Bm(b5)/G = G7 (V/iv). Good recognition of G7 as applied dominant to iv. Minor issues with inconsistent notation and one redundant/unclear phrase (“Bm(b5)/G leading to G7” when it already equals G7).
- Slash chords/inversions handling (10): 9/10
  - Handles inversions well and reads equivalences (F6 ↔ Dm7/F) accurately. Clear awareness of how bass notes shape function.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 8/10
  - Makes a reasonable case (repetition/return to Gm, stable bVI and bIII). Less explicit cadential evidence, but the applied-dominant discussion helps.
- Clarity and structure (10): 7/10
  - Organized in sections with a clear final synthesis, but some meandering and mid-analysis contradictions slightly cloud the throughline.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - A bit verbose and occasionally repetitive (“Interesting!” asides and revisiting the same point).
- Theoretical precision (5): 3/5
  - Notational slips: “v7/6” should be v65 for first-inversion seventh; momentary Dorian mislabel; “F6 as V6” mixes chord-symbol “6” (added sixth) with figured-bass “6” (first inversion).

Strengths
- Reaches the correct key and mode (G minor, Aeolian) with multiple supporting angles.
- Accurately identifies G7 as V/iv and explains the chromatic B natural without invoking harmonic minor to tonic.
- Good equivalence: F6 = Dm7/F (v7 in first inversion) within G natural minor.
- Thoughtful comparison with a plausible alternate hearing (B♭ major) and justification for preferring G minor.

Areas to improve
- Avoid mixing frameworks mid-paragraph (Bb-major labels alongside G-minor labels) without clear signposting.
- Correct notational details:
  - Use v65 (not “v7/6”) for a first-inversion seventh chord.
  - Don’t conflate F6 (added sixth sonority) with V6 (first inversion) in B♭ major.
- Eliminate the Dorian detour unless the pitch set actually matches (G Dorian requires E natural and excludes E♭ and B natural in G7).
- Clarify that Bdim/Bm(b5) over G is already G7; don’t describe it as “leading to” G7.

Actionable suggestions
- State the final answer upfront, then present one consistent roman-numeral analysis in G minor; discuss alternate-key interpretations afterward as a separate sidebar.
- Use standard figured-bass for sevenths: 7 (root), 65 (1st inv), 43 (2nd), 42 (3rd). For triads, 6 = first inversion, 64 = second inversion.
- When invoking modes, explicitly check the pitch collection (e.g., G Dorian = G A Bb C D E F) to avoid mismatches with actual chords (E♭ or B natural).
- Tighten phrasing around the applied dominant: “Bdim/G = G7 (V/iv), which evades resolution to iv and returns to i (Gm), reinforcing G as tonic.”

Overview
- Verdict: Partially correct (key identified), but with significant theoretical errors
- Overall score: 76/100

Weighted scoring breakdown (100 max)
- Key identification accuracy (30): 30/30
  - Correctly centers the progression on G minor and treats Gm as tonic.
- Mode determination (10): 8/10
  - “Primarily Aeolian with a brief harmonic-minor inflection” is a reasonable high-level read, given typical bVI and bVII usage; dinged for the specific inflection error below.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 11/20
  - Strengths: i–bVI–i for Gm–Eb/G–Gm makes sense; Bb and F are idiomatic III and bVII in G minor.
  - Issues: Misreads Bm(b5)/G as implying V7/i (see Theoretical precision); “Bb/F (III/bVII bass)” is an odd label—better given as III6/4; “F6 (bVII add 4)” is mislabeled (the “6” is D, not “add 4”).
- Slash chords and inversion/pedal analysis (10): 7/10
  - Correctly notes inversions and their stylistic use; could more clearly connect how inversions/pedals support tonic focus.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 5/10
  - States start/resolution on Gm, but the claimed “dominant pull” mechanism is incorrect (see below); no clear V–i cadence identified.
- Clarity and structure (10): 9/10
  - Reads clearly, coherent flow, jargon mostly controlled.
- Concision and focus (5): 5/5
  - Direct and succinct.
- Theoretical precision (5): 1/5
  - Major errors regarding leading tone and dominant function (details below).

Strengths
- Gets the key right: G minor as tonal center.
- Sensibly frames the landscape as minor-key pop/rock practice: i, bVI, bVII, III are all idiomatic.
- Plausible high-level modal mix concept (Aeolian core with occasional alterations).

Areas to improve
- Leading tone error: In G minor, the raised leading tone is F#, not B. Referencing “B natural as the raised leading tone from G harmonic minor” is incorrect.
- Dominant-function error: Labeling the Bm(b5)/G sonority as forming “G7 (V7/i)” is wrong. The functional dominant to G minor is D7 (D–F#–A–C), not G7.
- Secondary-dominant nuance: If the chord truly spells G7 (G–B–D–F), its most natural functional read in G minor is V/iv (resolving to C minor), or a tonic-7 “color,” not a dominant to i.
- Inversion labeling: “Bb/F (III/bVII bass)” is unconventional. Use III6/4 (Bb/F) to communicate inversion unambiguously.
- Chord naming: “F6 (bVII add 4)” is misleading. F6 = F–A–C–D (bVII with an added 6); “add 4” would imply Fadd4 (Fsus4/add4), which is different.
- Evidence of mode: If arguing Aeolian, explicitly note the absence of E natural (which would suggest Dorian). Avoid conflating tonal minor practice with modal language unless you mark the distinction.

Actionable suggestions
- Correct the inflection: The harmonic-minor raised 7 in G minor is F#. If you want “dominant pull” to i, cite D7 (or D/F#) → Gm, not anything derived from B natural.
- Reframe the Bm(b5)/G chord: 
  - If the sonority is G–B–D–F, analyze it as G7 (I7) or V/iv; don’t call it V7/i.
  - If it’s literally B–D–F over G, say “B°/G implies a G7 collection; locally it colors I or tonicizes iv.”
- Use standard roman numerals with inversion: III6/4 (Bb/F), bVII6 (F/A), etc., to avoid ambiguous labels.
- Tighten the modal claim: “Key: G minor. Mode: Aeolian overall, with occasional harmonic-minor mixture (F#) when a true V (D or D7) appears.”

Optional concise corrected lead
- Key: G minor. Mode: Aeolian overall; any dominant pull to i should come from D (D7 with F#). The Bm(b5)/G sonority spells a G7 collection (I7), better heard as color or V/iv rather than V/i.

Overview
- Verdict: Correct
- Overall score: 80/100 (Good)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 30/30
  - Clearly and repeatedly centers the analysis on G minor; cites start/end on Gm and overall tonal gravity.
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - Correctly identifies Aeolian/natural minor and explains the use of bVII (F) instead of a leading-tone V with F#.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 16/20
  - Correct functions for i, VI (Eb), III (Bb), VII (F). Sensible take on Bº/G as chromatic. Small but notable misreads (see below) reduce points.
- Slash chords and pedal analysis (10): 8/10
  - Appropriately emphasizes the G pedal; good note on inversions and voice leading. Minor inversion labeling error.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 10/10
  - Uses multiple, converging pieces of evidence (opening/closing on Gm; bVII→i motion) to justify the key.
- Clarity and structure (10): 4/10
  - Multiple near-duplicate paragraphs (“I’m now fully immersed...”) hinder readability and mask the core argument.
- Concision and focus (5): 2/5
  - Considerable repetition; the analysis could be presented far more succinctly.
- Theoretical precision (5): 1/5
  - A few concrete theory errors (detailed below) materially weaken the otherwise solid conclusion.

Key strengths
- Arrives at the correct key and mode and states them explicitly.
- Maps the main diatonic chords accurately within G natural minor.
- Correctly highlights the Aeolian character (use of bVII→i instead of V→i).
- Sensible identification of G as a pedal point and of Bº/G as a chromatic color/passing harmony.

Issues and inaccuracies
- Inversion labeling: “Eb/G ... second inversion” is incorrect. Eb/G places the third (G) in the bass, i.e., first inversion (VI6), not second inversion.
- Harmonic-minor confusion: Claims “borrowing from G harmonic minor, which introduces the F# needed for this chord [Bm(b5)/G].” The chord B–D–F contains F natural, not F#. G harmonic minor would raise F to F#, contradicting the chord as spelled.
- Voice-leading description: Saying “B natural acts as a chromatic passing tone between the Bb of the preceding chord and the D of the following Gm” is imprecise. In the common reading Bb/F → Bº/G → Gm, D and F are common tones between Bb and Bº; the characteristic motion is Bb→B→Bb (a chromatic neighbor to the Gm third), not B “passing” to D.
- Nomenclature: “Bm(b5)” is an awkward label for a diminished triad; “B°” (B diminished triad) or “Bdim” is standard. “Bm7(b5)” would denote a half-diminished seventh; that’s not what’s used here.
- Redundancy: Several paragraphs repeat the same point about chromaticism/voice leading with minimal new insight.

Actionable suggestions
- Correct the inversion labels:
  - Eb/G = VI6 (first inversion), Bb/F = III6/4 (second inversion).
- Tighten the voice-leading account of the chromatic chord:
  - Bb/F (Bb–D–F) → B°/G (B–D–F over G) → Gm (G–Bb–D) shows D and F as common tones while Bb→B→Bb forms a chromatic neighbor around the Gm third; G stays as a pedal.
- Avoid the harmonic-minor rationale for B°/G:
  - The chord’s F natural contradicts any need for F#. Treat it as a chromatic passing/neighbor chord over a tonic pedal, not as a harmonic-minor import.
- Use standard chord names and, where helpful, Roman numerals:
  - i (Gm), VI6 (Eb/G), III6/4 (Bb/F), VII(add6) (F6), chromatic B°/G, i.
- Streamline the write-up:
  - Lead with the conclusion (Key: G minor; Mode: Aeolian), then 3–5 bullets of primary evidence, followed by a concise chord-by-chord function and a clear one-sentence explanation of B°/G’s role.

Overview
- Verdict: Correct
- Overall score: 84/100 (Good)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 29/30
  - Clearly establishes G as the tonal center (start/end on Gm, frequent Gm, cadential motion into Gm).
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - Correctly selects natural minor (Aeolian) based on consistent F natural and Eb; good F vs F# reasoning.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 14/20
  - Many functions are right (i, VI6, bVII with added 6), but Bb is repeatedly mislabeled as IV instead of III. Some minor-key functional remarks are imprecise.
- Slash chords and pedal/inversion analysis (10): 8/10
  - Inversions recognized and used meaningfully (Eb/G, Bb/F, “Am7b5/G” if corrected). Could go further on bass-line/upper-structure interpretation.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 10/10
  - Uses repeated tonic, iiø7→i and bVII→i motions, and closing i to support G minor convincingly.
- Clarity and structure (10): 8/10
  - Well organized into steps with supporting evidence, despite some earlier meandering.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - Overly long with digressions and repeated backtracking.
- Theoretical precision (5): 3/5
  - Several inaccuracies: Bb labeled as IV (should be III), an aside about minor-key v vs “Dm7b5,” and omission of B natural in the pitch collection if the given Bm7b5/G is taken at face value.

Strengths
- Arrives at the correct key and mode (G minor, Aeolian) with solid evidence.
- Good use of pitch collection logic (G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F) to argue for natural minor, anchored by F natural.
- Sensible cadence evidence (F6→Gm, iiø7→i if interpreting as Am7b5/G).
- Clear, step-wise structure and comparison of natural vs harmonic vs melodic minor.

Areas to improve
- Roman-numeral accuracy: Bb is III in G minor, not IV. This mislabel appears multiple times.
- Non-diatonic chord handling: Assuming “Bm(b5)/G” is a typo is risky. If read literally, it introduces B natural; the pitch-set list should then include B and acknowledge the chromaticism.
- Alternative interpretation of Bm7b5/G: As notated, B–D–F–A over G equals G–A–B–D–F, i.e., a G9 (tonic dominant-color) upper-structure resolving to Gm. This is a plausible reading without assuming a typo.
- Minor-key theory slips:
  - Calling the ii7 in minor “Adim7” is better labeled iiø7 (half-diminished).
  - The aside about “not Dm7b5 like harmonic” is incorrect; in harmonic minor the v is typically major (or V7), not a half-diminished sonority.
- Verbosity and backtracking: The analysis repeats points and wanders before consolidating.

Actionable suggestions
- Correct the roman-numeral map in G natural minor:
  - Gm = i
  - Eb/G = VI6
  - Bb/F = III6 (not IV)
  - F6 = bVII(add6)
- Treat Bm7b5/G as written before presuming a typo:
  - Analyze it as an upper-structure for G9 (G–B–D–F with added A) resolving to Gm, i.e., a tonic coloristic tension borrowing the major 3rd (B) for a moment.
  - If you want a strictly diatonic reading, explicitly state that interpreting it as Am7b5/G (iiø4/3) is a common editorial normalization but not what’s on the page.
- Tighten the write-up:
  - Lead with the result (Key: G minor, Mode: Aeolian), then present 2–3 strongest pieces of evidence (F vs F#, Eb and F chords, repeated tonic).
  - Provide a compact, corrected functional line: i – VI6 – i – III6 – [Bm7b5/G ≈ G9] – i – VI6 – i – bVII(add6) – i.
- Use precise labels:
  - iiø7 (A–C–Eb–G) in minor; v is minor in Aeolian, V/V7 appears in harmonic/melodic practice.
  - Distinguish modal Aeolian practice from tonal minor mixture when relevant.

Corrected/clarified snapshot
- Key: G minor
- Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)
- Functional sketch:
  - Gm (i) – Eb/G (VI6) – Gm (i) – Bb/F (III6) – Bm7b5/G ≈ G9 upper-structure → Gm (i) – Eb/G (VI6) – Gm (i) – F6 (bVII add6) – Gm (i)
- Rationale: Persistent F natural (not F#), prominent Eb and F chords, repeated tonic framing, and cadential motions are quintessential Aeolian markers. The Bm7b5/G either introduces a brief coloristic G9 or, if normalized to Am7b5/G, yields the standard iiø4/3 → i resolution in minor.

Overview
- Verdict: Correct (key = G minor)
- Overall score: 75/100 (Good result with several theoretical and clarity issues)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 30/30
  - Correctly identifies G minor; tonic emphasized and final chord is Gm.
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - “Aeolian” is a reasonable label given the diatonic collection used (i, VI, III, v7) and no leading-tone V; G7 is treated as a chromatic/passing sonority.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 12/20
  - Ultimately lands on i, VI6 (Eb/G), III6/4 (Bb/F), v7 (Dm7/F). However, there are notable mislabels and contradictions en route (e.g., calling Eb/G “I,” confusion around G7’s function).
- Slash chords and inversion handling (10): 7/10
  - Correctly recognizes F6 ≡ Dm7 and Eb/G as first inversion; some inversion confusion around G7.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 7/10
  - Tonic repetition and final Gm support G minor; little emphasis on cadential motion (no clear V–i described).
- Clarity and structure (10): 6/10
  - Stepwise organization is helpful, but the narrative meanders with multiple false starts.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - Overlong with speculative detours.
- Theoretical precision (5): 1/5
  - Several factual errors about scale content (see below) and a misapplied secondary/leading-tone chord label.

Key strengths
- Correct final key and plausible mode.
- Sensible recognition that F6 = Dm7 (v7) in G minor.
- Accurate identification that Bdim/G forms G7.
- Provides a workable Roman-numeral reading by the end.

Issues affecting the score
- Incorrect/contradictory statements about scales:
  - Claims G natural minor has Ab (it has A natural: G A Bb C D Eb F).
  - States G harmonic minor “has F# and B” (it has F# but the third is Bb, not B natural).
  - Lists G melodic minor ascending with B natural (the third remains Bb; only 6th and 7th are raised: G A Bb C D E F#).
- Early mislabeling: Eb/G called “I in G minor” before later correcting to VI6.
- G7 function and inversion confusion:
  - Flirts with “vii°7 of C” despite the chord lacking Ab.
  - Mentions “G7 in 3rd inversion ... /F#?”—3rd inversion is G7/F, not F#.
- Inconsistent Roman-numeral notation (case/inversions) and speculative detours that obscure the core point.

Actionable improvements
- Verify scale degree content before invoking harmonic/melodic minor. Use:
  - G natural minor (Aeolian): G A Bb C D Eb F
  - G harmonic minor: G A Bb C D Eb F#
  - G melodic minor (asc): G A Bb C D E F#
- Label non-diatonic chords precisely:
  - G7 = V7/iv in G minor (dominant of C minor), here used coloristically without resolution.
- Keep Roman numerals consistent (case and figures):
  - i, VI6 (Eb/G), III6/4 (Bb/F), V7/iv (G7), v7 (Dm7/F), i
- Reduce speculative asides; lead with the correct mapping and briefly note exceptions (e.g., the chromatic G7).

Concise corrected mapping (G minor)
- 1–2: Gm = i
- 3–4: Eb/G = VI6
- 5–6: Gm = i
- 7: Bb/F = III6/4
- 8: B°/G = G7 = V7/iv (chromatic, unresolved)
- 9–10: Gm = i
- 11–12: Eb/G = VI6
- 13–14: Gm = i
- 15: F6 = Dm7/F = v7 (2nd inversion)
- 16: Gm = i

Summary
- The answer reaches the correct key (G minor) and presents a mostly valid functional picture, but it loses points for multiple theoretical inaccuracies and contradictory statements. Tightening the analysis, correcting scale facts, and labeling the G7 cleanly as V7/iv would significantly raise the score.

  - Maps i (Gm), VI (Eb), III (Bb), VII (F) correctly; correctly interprets Bm(b5)/G as G7. However, functional roles are not consistently framed with Roman numerals and the G7 function is left vague.
- Slash chords and pedal analysis (10): 7/10
  - Ultimately recognizes Eb/G and Bb/F as inversions; correctly parses Bm(b5)/G. Early misreading of Eb/G as Eb minor causes avoidable confusion; pedal/bass-line insight is noted but underdeveloped.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 9/10
  - Cites strong tonic framing (opening/closing Gm, persistent G bass) and a clear VII–i (F6 → Gm) motion. No misleading cadence claims.
- Clarity and structure (10): 4/10
  - Reasoning is meandering with multiple self-contradictions before settling on correct readings.
- Concision and focus (5): 2/5
  - Substantially longer than needed; repeats and revisits the same points.
- Theoretical precision (5): 3/5
  - Several inaccuracies/overstatements (e.g., initial Eb/G confusion; mixed modal/harmonic minor discussion; labeling G7 as merely “chromatic” without the clearer “tonic mixture/blues coloration” explanation).

Strengths
- Arrives at the correct conclusion: G minor (Aeolian).
- Identifies the diatonic palette of G natural minor and aligns Eb, Bb, and F chords appropriately (VI, III, VII).
- Correctly recognizes Bm(b5)/G as a G7 sonority (G–B–D–F).
- Sensibly uses form and bass behavior (opening/closing on Gm; G-heavy bass; F6 → Gm) to argue the tonal center.

Areas to improve
- Slash-chord interpretation: Eb/G is Eb major in first inversion (G–Bb–Eb); avoid the initial “Eb minor” misread and the G vs Gb dissonance digression.
- Theoretical framing: Instead of calling G7 in a G-minor context “just chromatic,” note it as tonic mixture/blues coloration (major 3rd on i) or a brief tonic dominant color—common in minor/pop idioms.
- Modal vs tonal minor: Keep Aeolian (no raised 7) conceptually distinct from harmonic/melodic minor practice; avoid implying a contradiction where none is needed.
- Organization: Lead with the answer and concise evidence; avoid looping back through the same alternatives.

Actionable suggestions
- Start with a one-line answer: “Key: G minor; Mode: Aeolian.”
- Provide a compact chord-to-function map:
  - Gm = i; Eb/G = VI6; Bb/F = III6/4; Bm(b5)/G = G7 (tonic mixture/blues color); F6 = VII(add6) → i.
- Explain the standout sonority succinctly: “Bm(b5)/G = G7 adds a major 3rd (B) to tonic for color—common mixture in minor—then resolves back to Gm.”
- Mention the cadence evidence: “Frequent i returns and VII(add6) → i confirm G as tonic; no D or F# implies primarily Aeolian, not harmonic minor.”

Summary
A correct and ultimately well-justified conclusion (G minor, Aeolian), but the path there is verbose and occasionally error-prone. Tightening the analysis, fixing the early slash-chord misread, and framing G7 as tonic mixture/blues color would elevate this to an excellent answer.

Overview
- Verdict: Correct
- Overall score: 85/100 (Very good)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 30/30
  - Correctly identifies G minor as the tonal center; strong evidence via start/end on Gm and high tonic frequency.
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - “G Aeolian (natural minor) with chromatic/mixture coloration” is a defensible reading given Eb and F are present and the only chromatic tone is B natural in G7.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 14/20
  - Positives: Eb/G as VI6, F6 as VII6 in G minor, Bm(b5)/G reduced to G7 is accurate.
  - Issues: Mischaracterizes G7 → Gm as a “dominant → tonic” move and even “minor plagal cadence” (plagal is IV–I). Better label: I7 (blues tonic dominant) in minor, or V/iv that does not resolve.
- Slash chords and inversion analysis (10): 10/10
  - Eb/G identified as first inversion; Bm(b5)/G correctly expanded to G7; F6 spelled correctly. Solid.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 8/10
  - Good emphasis on start/end and tonic saturation; however, the G7 → Gm “cadence” is misframed as functional dominant-to-tonic.
- Clarity and structure (10): 8/10
  - Well-organized stepwise layout; readable. Some detours and self-contradictory moments.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - Thorough but meandering; several speculative asides (e.g., tritone sub) that aren’t needed.
- Theoretical precision (5): 3/5
  - Notable slips: misuse of “plagal,” muddled sourcing of G7 (“borrowed from G major” though F♮ contradicts that), and mode/minor-framework conflations.

Strengths
- Arrives at the correct key and supports it with strong tonal-center evidence.
- Correctly parses slash chords and identifies Bm(b5)/G as G7.
- Sensibly treats F6 as diatonic color (VII6) in G minor.
- Recognizes the blues/minor practice of a tonic dominant seventh sonority.

Areas to improve
- Cadence terminology: Plagal means IV–I; G7 → Gm is not a dominant-to-tonic cadence in G minor.
- Function of G7: It’s best described as I7 (blues coloration) or V/iv that does not resolve, not a functional V of G.
- Modal vs tonal language: Avoid trying to source G7 from harmonic/melodic minor; it mixes a major 3 (B) with a b7 (F), i.e., a parallel-major/blues mixture on the tonic.
- Tighten exposition: Remove tritone-sub speculation and unneeded key detours (e.g., Bb major) once G minor is firmly established.
- Song references: Ensure examples actually illustrate the specific device (tonic dominant in minor).

Actionable suggestions
- Label chords with clear functions in G minor:
  - Gm = i, Eb/G = VI6, F6 = VII6, Bm(b5)/G = I7 (borrowed/blues tonic dominant).
- Describe G7 succinctly: “I7 (tonic dominant) — a common minor-blues coloration combining major 3 (B) with b7 (F); not diatonic, not from harmonic/melodic minor.”
- Fix cadence language: “G7 → Gm is a coloristic return to i, not a functional dominant-to-tonic cadence.”
- Keep the modal claim consistent: “Primarily G Aeolian with a single chromatic alteration (B natural) for I7 color.”
- Lead with the conclusion, then present the 2–3 strongest pieces of evidence (start/end on Gm, prevalence of i, diatonic VI and VII, and the isolated chromatic G7).

Suggested concise lead (for future answers)
- Key: G minor; Mode: Aeolian. Evidence: starts/ends on Gm, heavy tonic repetition, diatonic VI (Eb) and VII (F) activity; occasional I7 (G7) as a blues coloration via B natural; F6 functions as VII6.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

Overview
- Verdict: Correct
- Overall score: 81/100 (Good)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 29/30
  - Correctly identifies G as the tonal center; Gm is pervasive and returns frequently. Sensible rejection of Eb/C minor.
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - “Natural minor (Aeolian)” is appropriate given i–VI–III–VII usage, with G7 treated as a chromatic color/passing sonority.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 16/20
  - Correct high-level mapping to i, VI, III, VII in G minor; recognizes Bm(b5)/G = G7. Misses cleaner functional labels (e.g., VI6, III6, I7) and doesn’t consider/clarify V/iv for G7 as a possibility (even if it doesn’t resolve to iv).
- Slash chords and inversion analysis (10): 7/10
  - Good recognition of inversions and useful voice-leading note (Bb → B → Bb). However, the “Root” column mistakenly lists bass notes for slash chords (e.g., Eb/G marked with root G; Bb/F marked with root F).
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 8/10
  - Establishes G as home via recurrence and diatonic fit; could strengthen with a brief note that there’s no functional V–i cadence, so tonic sense comes from repetition/return rather than dominant resolution.
- Clarity and structure (10): 7/10
  - Organized in steps and thorough, but contains several self-corrections and “wait” moments that disrupt flow.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - Some wandering (modal tangents, alternate key tests) beyond what’s necessary for the conclusion.
- Theoretical precision (5): 2/5
  - Notable slips: root vs. bass confusion in the table; momentary conflation of Bm(b5) (triad) with Bø7; mentions “Neapolitan-type”/“chromatic mediant” inappositely; partial mode confusion.

Strengths
- Arrives at the correct key and gives a plausible mode (G Aeolian).
- Solid diatonic inventory for G natural minor (i, III, VI, VII) and correct identification that F6 is diatonic (A natural is in G Aeolian).
- Good ear for function-by-collection: most chords are from G natural minor; flags B natural in G7 as chromatic.
- Helpful voice-leading observation: Bb → B → Bb across Bb/F → Bm(b5)/G → Gm.

Areas to improve
- Root vs. bass: The slash-chord “Root” entries are incorrect (they show the bass as the root).
- Overstatements and speculative detours: “These are all chords from Bb major or G minor” (but G7 is not); references to “Neapolitan-type” or “chromatic mediant” aren’t supported here.
- Modal clarity: You correctly rule out Dorian, but also note that Mixolydian is incompatible with Eb; keep mode exclusions crisp and tied to pitch content.
- Function labeling: When a dominant-quality chord appears (G7), briefly test likely applied-function readings (V/iv), then dismiss based on resolution (here it goes to i, so label as I7/coloristic).

Actionable suggestions
- Fix the chord table:
  - Eb/G → Root: Eb (VI6 in G minor)
  - Bb/F → Root: Bb (III6)
  - Bm(b5)/G → Spells G–B–D–F → G7 (I7 color/passing; could be V/iv if it moved to Cm)
  - F6 → F–A–C–D (VIIadd6)
- Tighten the modal check:
  - G Dorian (E natural) conflicts with Eb; G Mixolydian (C major with F natural) conflicts with Eb; G Phrygian (Ab) conflicts with A natural (present in F6). Only Aeolian fits the diatonic collection used (G A Bb C D Eb F).
- Streamline the reasoning:
  - Lead with: “Key: G minor (Aeolian). Evidence: frequent i, strong presence of VI, III, VII; F6 is diatonic; Bm(b5)/G = I7 as chromatic color resolving to i.”
- Avoid speculative labels unless defensible by pitch and resolution; e.g., skip “Csus4(b9)”/“Neapolitan-type” unless the notes and motion actually support it.

Suggested concise mapping (for reference)
- Gm = i
- Eb/G = VI6
- Bb/F = III6
- Bm(b5)/G = G7 = I7 (coloristic; contains B natural)
- F6 = VII(add6)
- Overall center: G minor (Aeolian), with a brief tonic dominant (I7) as chromatic coloration.

Overview
- Verdict: Correct
- Overall score: 82/100 (Good)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 30/30
  - Concludes G minor and consistently frames the analysis around G as tonic; supports with chord inventory (i, bVI, III, bVII).
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - Correctly identifies Aeolian (natural minor) via b6 (Eb) and b7 (F) and absence of raised 7; small contradictions noted around the diminished sonority.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 14/20
  - Solid functions for Gm (i), Eb (bVI), Bb (III), F/F6 (bVII).
  - Problematic treatment of B–D–F/G: conflates it with a leading-tone diminished and also with G7(b9); misapplies vii° terminology for G minor.
- Slash chords and pedal analysis (10): 6/10
  - Correctly observes G in the bass for Bdim/G; stops short of a clear voice-leading account or a consistent functional label (e.g., G7 upper-structure).
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 9/10
  - Cites start/end on Gm and recurrence of Gm (strong tonal-center evidence). “Absence of a dominant” is a secondary—and weaker—argument.
- Clarity and structure (10): 9/10
  - Well organized with headings, staged reasoning, and a useful table. Some internal contradictions around the diminished chord reduce clarity.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - A bit repetitive; could lead with the result and prune the iterative re-evaluations.
- Theoretical precision (5): 2/5
  - Key issues:
    - “Bm(b5)” is a nonstandard label for a diminished triad; Bdim is clearer.
    - Bdim/G is described as “root is G” and likened to G7(b9). The pitch set G–B–D–F = G7 (no b9). Calling it b9 is incorrect (b9 over G would be Ab).
    - Refers to “temporary diminished vii°” in G minor—vii° of G would be F#dim, not Bdim.

Strengths
- Arrives at the correct key (G minor) and mode (Aeolian) and justifies them with bVI (Eb) and bVII (F).
- Sensibly frames the diminished sonority as coloristic/passing rather than modulatory, keeping G minor as the context.
- Clear structure, staged reasoning, and a concise chord-function table aid readability.

Areas to improve
- Use precise, standard chord nomenclature (Bdim vs. “Bm(b5)”) and avoid contradictory labels.
- Do not call G–B–D–F “G7(b9)”—there’s no Ab. If analyzing Bdim/G as an upper-structure of G7, name it G7 explicitly.
- Avoid invoking “vii°” for G minor when discussing Bdim; vii° of G is F#dim (which conflicts with the established F natural).
- Strengthen mode evidence by explicitly listing scale degrees (1, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7) heard/used and contrasting with harmonic/melodic minor (raised 7/6).

Actionable suggestions
- Relabel the contentious chord as either:
  - Bdim/G functioning as G7 (upper-structure 3–5–7 over 1), or
  - A linear/passing diminished sonority over a G pedal with no functional re-centering.
- If referencing a leading-tone diminished, make it specific and correct (F#dim in G minor) and explain its absence here given Aeolian usage.
- Present the answer up front:
  - “Key: G minor; Mode: Aeolian (natural minor). Evidence: i–bVI–III–bVII; Eb = b6, F = b7; no raised 7.”
- Add one sentence on voice leading for the diminished sonority (e.g., B–C or B–Bb motion) to justify the “passing” interpretation without implying dominant function.
- Trim iterative re-evaluations; keep the re-think but consolidate into a single, crisp paragraph.

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

Overview
- Verdict: Correct conclusion with notable theoretical issues
- Overall score: 72/100 (Good, but with clear inaccuracies)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 29/30
  - Correctly establishes G as the tonal center (i), starts/ends on Gm, and treats Gm as structurally primary.
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - “G Aeolian / G Natural Minor” matches the sonority and lack of V (D or D7); however, the analysis underplays the chromatic B natural that briefly departs from strict Aeolian.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 10/20
  - Mixed accuracy: i labeled well; Eb/G is inconsistently called “IV or iv” before acknowledging it’s bVI; F is bVII but is incorrectly called the “dominant;” Bm(b5)/G is waved off as a passing sonority rather than being identified as G7 (G–B–D–F) over G, which matters functionally.
- Slash chords and pedal analysis (10): 3/10
  - Little engagement with inversion functions or bass/voice-leading implications. Missed that Bb/F = bIII6/4, Eb/G = bVI6, and Bm(b5)/G forms a complete G7 over a G bass.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 7/10
  - Good emphasis on tonic placement and repetition. However, calling F(6) “dominant” is a functional misread; the closing motion is bVII→i (modal/subtonic-to-tonic), not a true dominant cadence.
- Clarity and structure (10): 8/10
  - Well organized and readable with numbered sections; some internal contradictions (e.g., Eb/G labeling, “dominant” claim) reduce clarity.
- Concision and focus (5): 4/5
  - Generally focused and appropriately concise for the task.
- Theoretical precision (5): 2/5
  - Significant issues: mislabeling functional dominance (F ≠ dominant in G minor), contradictory labeling of Eb/G, and the incorrect assertion that the progression is “exclusively diatonic” despite B natural.

Strengths
- Correctly identifies G as the tonal center and recognizes G minor/Aeolian as the prevailing collection.
- Sensibly notes the absence of a D major (V) as supporting Aeolian/minor-dominant practice.
- Provides a useful overview of diatonic triads in natural/harmonic/melodic minor (mostly accurate lists).

Areas to improve
- Functional terminology: F(6) in G minor is bVII(add6), not the dominant; bVII→i is a modal/subtonic resolution, not V→i.
- Consistency in chord labeling: Eb/G should be bVI6 (not “IV or iv”), Bb/F is bIII6/4.
- Address chromaticism: Bm(b5)/G contains B–D–F over G, which forms G7 (I7 color) and is explicitly non-diatonic to G Aeolian; it should not be dismissed as merely “passing” without explanation.
- Avoid overgeneral claims: The progression is not “exclusively” diatonic to G Aeolian because of B natural.

Actionable suggestions
- Correct the misfunctional claim:
  - Replace “F6 is the dominant chord” with “F(6) is bVII(add6), yielding a common modal bVII→i motion.”
- Tighten Roman numeral/inversion labeling:
  - Gm = i
  - Eb/G = bVI6
  - Bb/F = bIII6/4
  - Bm(b5)/G = G7/G (i.e., a G7 sonority over tonic bass; non-diatonic I7 color). If you prefer functional labeling, note it as I7 (borrowed/bluesy) rather than diatonic; do not call it diatonic Aeolian. Only label it V/iv if it actually leads to C (iv), which it doesn’t here.
  - F6 = bVII(add6)
- Accurately characterize diatonic scope:
  - Acknowledge the single chromatic departure (B natural) and explain its coloristic role, while maintaining that the prevailing collection is G natural minor.
- Evidence framing:
  - Emphasize tonic salience (start/end, frequency of i) and the modal cadence bVII→i; avoid invoking dominant function where none exists.

Overview
- Verdict: Correct key identified (G minor)
- Overall score: 74/100 (Good, but with notable theoretical and consistency issues)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 30/30
  - G clearly established as tonic; strong evidence from opening/closing on Gm and frequent returns.
- Mode determination (10): 8/10
  - “Aeolian (natural minor) with chromatic inflection” is reasonable given Eb and F; acknowledges B natural as color. Slight overstatement calling it strictly Aeolian given the prominent B natural.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 10/20
  - Correct: i for Gm; VI6 for Eb/G; F6 treated plausibly.
  - Errors: Bb/F labeled as VII (it is III6/4 in G minor); G7 initially labeled “V7 → i” in the table (V of G minor is D/D7); several interim misassignments.
- Slash chords and chord reinterpretation (10): 7/10
  - Good catch that Bm(b5)/G spells G–B–D–F (i.e., G7). Some inversion confusion earlier, later corrected. Did not explore the alternative V/iv reading (G7 → Cm) vs. I7 tonic color.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 8/10
  - Tonal center supported well by placement and recurrence of Gm; notes bVII → i move via F6 → Gm. Early claim of a V–i cadence via G7 → Gm is incorrect but later retracted.
- Clarity and structure (10): 5/10
  - Long, with multiple self-corrections and contradictions left in; a clean edited pass is needed.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - Overly verbose for the task; repeats points and explores false paths at length.
- Theoretical precision (5): 3/5
  - Mix-ups around scale degrees and Roman numerals (e.g., Bb as VII), and about the role of G7 in minor; however, eventually lands on defensible interpretations.

Strengths
- Correctly identifies G as the tonal center and the overall minor quality.
- Solid recognition of Eb (VI) and F major (VII) usage typical of natural minor.
- Insightful re-interpretation of Bm(b5)/G as a G7 sonority; acknowledges it as tonic coloration rather than a functional dominant in context.
- Sensible read of F6 → Gm as a common bVII → i gesture.

Areas to improve
- Roman numeral accuracy:
  - Bb/F is III6/4 (not VII). In G natural minor: III = Bb, VI = Eb, VII = F.
  - The table labeling Bm(b5)/G → G7 as “V7 → i” is incorrect; V of G is D (D or D7).
- Internal consistency:
  - Early claims (e.g., G7 as V7) conflict with later corrections (I7/tonic dominant); the final presentation should be internally coherent.
- Modal vs. tonal framing:
  - If calling it Aeolian, be explicit that B natural is a chromatic/borrowed color (tonic Mixolydian inflection or applied V/iv that doesn’t resolve), not part of strict Aeolian.
- Editing and focus:
  - Remove speculative detours (e.g., vii° placement, inversion confusion) from the final answer; lead with the clear result and concise evidence.

Actionable suggestions
- Provide a clean Roman-numeral pass (corrected):
  - Gm: i
  - Eb/G: VI6
  - Bb/F: III6/4
  - Bm(b5)/G: interpret as I7 (tonic 7th coloration) or as V/iv (G7) that does not resolve
  - F6: VII(add6) [often called bVII(add6) relative to G major]
- Clarify the Bm(b5)/G chord:
  - State explicitly: “Bm(b5)/G = G7 (G–B–D–F). In this context it functions as I7 (bluesy tonic color), not as V of G minor.”
  - Optionally note the applied-function perspective: “It could be heard as V/iv (G7) without resolution to Cm.”
- Tighten the exposition:
  - Lead with: “Key: G minor (natural minor/Aeolian), with a tonic G7 color.”
  - Then list evidence: start/end on i, frequent i returns, VI and VII present, bVII → i motion, no D/D7 present.
- Keep modal terminology consistent:
  - When using “Aeolian,” explicitly segregate non-diatonic tones (B natural) as color/mixture.

Clean corrected mapping (for reference)
- Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – Bb/F – Bm(b5)/G – Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – F6 – Gm
- i – i – VI6 – VI6 – i – i – III6/4 – I7 (or V/iv) – i – i – VI6 – VI6 – i – i – VII(add6) – i

If you’d like, I can rewrite the original answer into a concise, corrected version with a clean Roman-numeral analysis.

- Chord-function mapping (20): 17/20
  - Sound labeling of i (Gm), VI (Eb/G), III (Bb/F), and bVII (F6).
  - Underspecifies Bm(b5)/G: functionally this sonority equals G7 (G–B–D–F), i.e., I7 borrowed from Mixolydian or V/iv; calling it merely “coloristic/chromatic” misses a clear functional reading.
- Slash chords and pedal analysis (10): 7/10

  - Well organized with steps and a comparison table; easy to follow.
- Concision and focus (5): 5/5
  - Direct and appropriately compact for the task.
- Theoretical precision (5): 2/5
  - Table incorrectly marks F/F6 as fitting G harmonic minor (it does not; G harmonic minor uses F#, not F).
  - “Bm(b5)/G” labeling is acceptable, but missing its identity as G7 weakens the precision.

Strengths
- Arrives at the correct key and mode and states them clearly.
- Solid diatonic mapping of i, III, VI, and bVII in G minor.
- Sensible handling of the non-diatonic B natural as a coloristic element.
- Clear, stepwise presentation with a helpful modality-fit table.

Areas to improve
- Correct the modality table: F (and F6) are not diatonic to G harmonic minor (F# is).
- Provide a functional reading for Bm(b5)/G as G7 (I7 via Mixolydian mixture or V/iv), rather than only “chromatic color.”
- Highlight the cadential weight of bVII → i (F[6] → Gm), a key Aeolian signal.
- When invoking “subdominant color” for F6, clarify its role as bVII in minor and typical modal/plagal tendencies.

Actionable suggestions
- Verify pitch content when populating scale-fit tables; for G harmonic minor, use F# (not F), so F/F6 should be marked non-diatonic.
- Explicitly analyze Bm(b5)/G as G7:
  - Possible functions: I7 (borrowed from G Mixolydian), or V/iv aiming at C minor (even if not realized).
  - Note its chordal identity: B–D–F over G yields G–B–D–F.
- Call out the closing Aeolian cadence: bVII (F[6]) → i (Gm), reinforcing G natural minor.
- Consider a concise lead sentence next time:
  - “Key: G minor; Mode: Aeolian. Evidence: repeated Gm tonic, Eb/Bb/F with no F#, bVII → i cadence; Bm(b5)/G functions as G7 (modal mixture).”

**Assitant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

Overview
- Verdict: Correct key/mode, but with several theoretical inaccuracies
- Overall score: 70/100 (Good but error-prone)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 29/30
  - Correctly identifies G minor as the tonal center and supports it with start/end on Gm and frequent returns to Gm.
- Mode determination (10): 7/10
  - “Aeolian (Natural Minor)” is a fitting read; however, some of the justification (e.g., invoking F# to rule out Dorian) is off-target.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 8/20
  - Correct: i = Gm, VI = Eb, bVII = F (as F or F6).
  - Incorrect: Labels Bb as “V” and claims “v is major,” which is not true in Aeolian (v is Dm in G Aeolian). Several Roman-numeral/function statements are muddled.
- Slash chords and inversion/pedal analysis (10): 4/10
  - Notes “Bm(b5)/G” as a passing color but misses the insightful interpretation: B–D–F over G forms G7 (3–5–b7 over 1). Limited discussion of inversion roles (Eb/G = VI6; Bb/F = III64) or any bass-pedal implications.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 8/10
  - Good emphasis on starting/ending on Gm and recurrence of Gm; could have highlighted characteristic Aeolian motions (e.g., bVII → i) more explicitly.
- Clarity and structure (10): 9/10
  - Well organized with headings and a clear progression list.
- Concision and focus (5): 4/5
  - Thorough and readable; a bit wordy but mostly on-topic.
- Theoretical precision (5): 1/5
  - Multiple factual errors (see below), including mislabeling functions and mischaracterizing harmonic minor.

Key strengths
- Arrives at the correct key (G minor) and a plausible mode (Aeolian).
- Uses strong tonal-center evidence (frequency of Gm; opening and closing on Gm).
- Identifies F (bVII) and Eb (VI) as characteristic scale-degree harmonies in G natural minor.
- Sensibly treats Bm(b5)/G as non-diatonic color that doesn’t overturn the key.

Issues and inaccuracies
- Mislabeling/functional errors:
  - States “In G Natural Minor, the V chord is Bb Major” and later lists “v chord: Bb (It’s major…).” In G Aeolian: v = Dm (minor), III = Bb (major), VII = F (major), VI = Eb (major).
- Harmonic minor confusion:
  - Claims “In G Harmonic Minor, the VI chord would be Eb+ (augmented).” Incorrect; VI is Eb major. The augmented triad in harmonic minor is III+ (here Bb+).
- Mode justification:
  - Rules out Dorian by citing “no F#,” which is irrelevant. The distinguishing tone for Dorian vs Aeolian in G is the 6th (E natural in Dorian vs Eb in Aeolian), not the 7th.
- Modal interchange remark:
  - Calls F6 a “modal interchange moment”; in G Aeolian, F (bVII) is diatonic. No borrowing is required.
- Contradiction/overstatement:
  - Says “The entire progression is built from diatonic chords…” then concedes Bm(b5)/G is non-diatonic. The latter is the accurate part.

What the analysis could add or correct
- Correct Roman numerals in G Aeolian:
  - i = Gm; ii° = Adim; III = Bb; iv = Cm; v = Dm; VI = Eb; VII = F.
  - Inversions here: Eb/G = VI6; Bb/F = III64; F6 = VII(add6) or Fadd6.
- Reframe Bm(b5)/G:
  - B–D–F over G spells G7 (3–5–b7 over 1). That’s a tonic with a major 3rd (B) and b7 (F), non-diatonic to Aeolian. It often functions as V/iv (aiming at Cm), though here it resolves back to Gm, so it’s a coloristic dominant-of-iv sonority used passing/neighbor-like.
- Mode evidence:
  - Emphasize the presence of Eb (b6) and absence of E natural, supporting Aeolian over Dorian.
- Cadential color:
  - bVII → i (F[add6]) → Gm near the end can be highlighted as a common Aeolian move.

Actionable suggestions
- Fix functional labels: Bb is III, not V; v is Dm (minor) in Aeolian.
- Stop using F# to discuss Dorian; compare E vs Eb instead.
- When contrasting with harmonic minor, note that III becomes augmented (Bb+) due to the raised 7 (F#), while VI (Eb) remains major.
- Call out inversion roles and the likely G-pedal effect where applicable.
- Interpret Bm(b5)/G explicitly as G7 for a sharper, more insightful read on the non-diatonic color.

Concise corrected takeaway
- Key: G minor
- Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)
- Functional palette: i (Gm), VI (Eb/G), III (Bb/F), VII(6) (F6), plus a non-diatonic G7 sonority (Bm(b5)/G) used coloristically without changing key.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Overview
- Verdict: Correct key identified, but with notable theoretical inaccuracies
- Overall score: 73/100 (Good, but error-prone in key details)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 28/30
  - Correctly concludes G minor; bass emphasis on G and repeated Gm support this.
- Mode determination (10): 5/10
  - Claims “G Aeolian with harmonic minor inflection,” but no raised 7 (F#) appears; the B natural comes from mixture (I7) or an upper-structure diminished, not harmonic minor.
- Chord-function mapping (20): 11/20
  - Eb/G as VI6 (or bVI6) is fine; Bb/F mislabeled (it’s III6/4, not IV, and second inversion, not first). Bm(b5)/G is misread.
- Slash chords and pedal analysis (10): 7/10
  - Correctly spots the G-pedal and F bass moments; inversion mistakes detract.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 7/10
  - Sensible appeal to tonic repetition and pedal; no discussion of cadential pull, but progression still points to G.
- Clarity and structure (10): 9/10
  - Clear, stepwise layout.
- Concision and focus (5): 4/5
  - Thorough without rambling.
- Theoretical precision (5): 2/5
  - Several concrete errors (see below).

Strengths
- Arrives at the correct key (G minor) and supports it with a G-centered bass and frequent Gm.
- Sensibly interprets Eb/G as a first-inversion VI and recognizes F6 as a common bVII color in minor.
- Step-by-step, readable analysis.

Issues to fix
- Misidentification: Bm(b5)/G is not Gm(maj7). Notes G–B–D–F spell G7 (I7 or V/iv), not Gm(maj7) (which would be G–Bb–D–F#).
- Harmonic minor confusion: Calling the B natural a “harmonic minor inflection” is incorrect; harmonic minor in G would raise the 7th (F#), which never appears.
- Inversion/function errors: 
  - Bb/F is second inversion (III6/4 or bIII6/4), not first inversion. It is not IV.
  - “VI vs bVI” usage is fine in pop analysis, but keep it consistent.
- Dorian inventory error: Listing G Dorian with “Am(b5)” is incorrect; diatonic diminished in G Dorian is E° (E–G–Bb), not A–C–Eb.

Corrected quick analysis
- Tonal center: G minor (Aeolian). Presence of Eb (b6) and absence of E natural rule out Dorian; absence of F# rules out harmonic minor as a governing collection.
- Chords and functions in G minor:
  - Gm: i
  - Eb/G: VI6 (first inversion of VI)
  - Bb/F: III6/4 (second inversion of III)
  - Bm(b5)/G (i.e., B°/G): G7 (I7) via an upper-structure B° triad over a G pedal; functions as a tonic dominant color or V/iv that doesn’t resolve
  - F6: bVII(add6)
- Bass/pedal: Predominantly G with brief F points; tonic pedal supports the minor center throughout.
- Mode: G Aeolian with a brief parallel-major/mixolydian color on the tonic (I7), not harmonic minor.

Actionable suggestions
- Verify pitch content before renaming slash chords; G–B–D–F = G7, not Gm(maj7).
- Label inversions carefully: for Bb major (Bb–D–F), bass F is second inversion (6/4).
- Distinguish inflections:
  - Harmonic minor in G = F# (raised 7) present.
  - I7 in minor (G7) = borrowed/mixolydian color (raised 3rd, B natural) without F#.
- Keep Roman numeral usage consistent (III vs bIII; VI vs bVI) and avoid contradictory labels.
- When discussing alternate modes (e.g., Dorian), list the correct diatonic triads and note their characteristic tones explicitly.

**Assistant - GLM 4.6 Thinking**

Overview
- Verdict: Correct
- Overall score: 79/100 (Good, with notable theoretical slips)

Weighted scoring breakdown
- Key identification accuracy (30): 29/30
  - Correctly identifies G minor as the tonal center; strong evidence (start/end and heavy emphasis on Gm; common i–bVII and i–bVI motions).
- Mode determination (10): 9/10
  - “Primarily G natural minor with chromaticism” is apt; correctly rules out Dorian (no E) and harmonic/melodic minor (no F#; clear Eb and F).
- Chord-function mapping (20): 13/20
  - Ultimately maps Gm (i), Eb/G (bVI6), Bb/F (III6/4), F6 (bVII with added 6), and Bm(b5)/G → G7 (applied dominant).
  - But contains serious mid-stream mislabels (e.g., calling Bm(b5)/G “iiø7” and treating Eb/G as “Gm7b5 without the 5th”).
- Slash-chord interpretation and inversion handling (10): 7/10
  - Correctly recognizes inversions (Eb/G = bVI in first inversion; Bb/F = III in second inversion) and Bm(b5)/G spelling G7.
  - Early confusion (“Phrygian chord,” altered re-spellings) detracts.
- Cadence and tonal-center evidence (10): 9/10
  - Solid use of i prevalence and characteristic Aeolian motions (i–bVII, i–bVI); notes absence of V (D or D7).
- Clarity and structure (10): 7/10
  - Well organized overall, but frequent self-corrections and speculative detours blur the through-line.
- Concision and focus (5): 3/5
  - Thorough but more verbose than necessary; includes tangents that don’t aid the conclusion.
- Theoretical precision (5): 2/5
  - Multiple inaccuracies (see below), despite a correct final verdict.

Key strengths
- Arrives at the correct key and a sensible modal characterization (Aeolian/natural minor-centered).
- Good identification of the chromatic outlier G7 (from B–D–F over G), and its “blues-inflected” color relative to Gm.
- Correctly rules out Dorian and harmonic/melodic minor using concrete pitch evidence (absence/presence of E and F#).
- Recognizes common minor-key progressions (i–bVI, i–bVII) typical of rock/pop/film harmony.

Notable issues and inaccuracies
- Mislabeling Eb/G:
  - Incorrectly suggests it implies “Gm7b5 without the 5th” and floats a “G Phrygian chord” idea; neither are appropriate.
  - Correct label: bVI in first inversion (bVI6) within G minor.
- Mislabeling Bm(b5)/G:
  - Initially calls it “Gm7b5” and “iiø7” in G minor—incorrect. With G in the bass (G–B–D–F), it’s G7.
- Misapplied secondary-dominant language:
  - At one point calls G7 “V7/VII” (dominant of the subtonic). In G minor, V7/VII would be C7, not G7.
  - The accurate applied-function is V7/iv (G7 resolves naturally to C minor), though here it resolves deceptively to i (Gm), a common bluesy move.
- Conceptual slips:
  - Refers to the subtonic as “the leading tone down a half step,” which is contradictory; the subtonic is a whole step below the tonic.
  - Strays into confusing tritone-sub chains (e.g., G7 → C7 as a tritone sub) that don’t apply here.

Actionable suggestions
- Tighten the chord-function labels:
  - Eb/G → bVI6; Bb/F → III6/4; F6 → bVII(add6); Bm(b5)/G → G7 = V7/iv (used here as a color chord resolving deceptively to i).
- Avoid speculative reinterpretations that introduce tones not present (e.g., adding A to Eb/G or inventing “Phrygian chord” labels).
- Keep secondary-dominant analysis precise:
  - In G minor, V7/iv = G7; V7/VII = C7; V7/III = F7, etc.
- Streamline the narrative:
  - Lead with “Key: G minor (Aeolian palette) with a chromatic G7 color chord,” then show concise evidence.
- Clarify terminology:
  - Subtonic (b7) is a whole step below the tonic; leading tone (7) is a semitone below.

Concise corrected summary
- Key: G minor
- Mode/collection: Aeolian (natural minor) palette
- Chords and functions:
  - Gm = i
  - Eb/G = bVI6
  - Bb/F = III6/4
  - Bm(b5)/G → G7 = V7/iv (chromatic; resolves deceptively back to i)
  - F6 = bVII(add6)
- Why not Dorian/harmonic/melodic? No E (Dorian’s 6); no F# (harmonic/melodic). Presence of Eb and F confirms Aeolian focus.
- Stylistic note: The G7→Gm color (major 3 to minor 3 clash) is a common blues/pop device.
