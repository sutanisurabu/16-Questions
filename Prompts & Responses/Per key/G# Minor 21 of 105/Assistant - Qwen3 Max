To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**  
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm(b5)/G# – G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonic (home chord)

The progression **starts and ends on G#m**, and G#m appears very frequently — a strong indicator that **G# minor is the tonic**.

---

### Step 2: Consider possible keys

Since G# minor is the tonic, the **natural minor key** would be **G# natural minor**, which is the relative minor of **B major**.

However, G# minor is often **enharmonically respelled as Ab minor** for practicality (since G# major has 8 sharps!), but G# minor is usable in theory.

The **key signature of G# natural minor** is the same as **B major**: 5 sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#).

So the natural minor scale would be:
- G# A# B C# D# E F# G#

But minor keys often use harmonic or melodic minor forms, which raise the 7th (and sometimes 6th) degree.

- **Harmonic minor**: raises the 7th → F## (E##? Wait—let’s double-check).

Actually, in **G# natural minor**, the 7th scale degree is **F#**.  
To create a **leading tone** to G#, we raise it to **F##** (which is enharmonically G, but spelled as F## in G# harmonic minor).

But in practice, **composers often modulate or use chords from parallel modes**.

However, let's look at the actual chords used:

---

### Step 3: Analyze the chords in relation to G# minor

**G#m** = i  
**E/G#** = E major with G# in the bass → This is **VI chord in G# minor** (E major = VI). In natural minor, the VI chord is **E major** (E–G#–B), which matches.

**B/F#** = B major over F# bass → B major is the **III chord** in G# minor (B–D#–F#). So B/F# is just an inversion of III.

**Bm(b5)/G#** = B diminished (B–D–F) with G# in bass. Wait — Bm(b5) is B–D–F, but in G# minor, the **vii° chord** would be **F##°** (F##–A#–C#). So this is unusual.

But **Bm(b5)** is actually **B–D–F**, which is a **B diminished triad** (though technically B° is B–D–F, while Bm(b5) is the same as B°). So B°/G#.

Is B° in G# minor? Let’s check:

- G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F##  
- Chord on **A#** (ii°): A#–C#–E → A#°  
- Chord on **F##** (vii°): F##–A#–C# → F##°

So B° is **not diatonic** to G# natural or harmonic minor.

But wait — **what if the key is actually E major?**

Let’s test that.

In **E major**:
- E = I  
- G#m = iii  
- B = V  
- F#6 = F# major with added 6th → F# = ii  
- Bm(b5) = B–D–F = vii° of C#? Not in E.

But the progression keeps returning to **G#m**, not E. So E major seems unlikely as tonic.

Alternative: Could this be in **E major**, but with G#m as a temporary center? Unlikely due to repetition and closure on G#m.

Another idea: **G# Dorian?** Let's test.

G# Dorian = G# A# B C# D# E# F#  
→ But E# is not used; we see E natural in E major chord (E–G#–B). So E natural implies **E major**, not E#.

Thus, **E natural** suggests that the 6th scale degree is **E natural**, which matches **G# natural minor** (where 6th = E).

So far:
- G#m = i  
- E = VI  
- B = III  
- F#6 = F# major with added 6th → F# = VII? Wait, in natural minor, **VII is F# major** (F#–A#–C#). Yes!

So **F# major** is the **VII chord** in G# natural minor.

And **F#6** = F#–A#–C#–D# → adds the 6th (D#), which is the 5th scale degree, fine.

Now, the odd chord: **Bm(b5)/G#** = B–D–F over G#

B–D–F is **B diminished** (B°). Where does this come from?

Consider **G# harmonic minor**: raises 7th to F## → but that gives E# as leading tone, not used here.

But in **G# melodic minor (ascending)**: raises 6th and 7th → E# and F## → again, not matching E natural and F natural.

Wait — **B° = B–D–F** can be seen as **vii° of C**, but that doesn’t help.

Alternatively, **B°/G#** might be functioning as a **common-tone diminished chord** or **chromatic passing chord**.

Notice: it appears **between B major and G#m**:
- ... G#m – B/F# – **Bm(b5)/G#** – G#m ...

So B → B° → G#m

This is a **chromatic mediant or embellishment**: B (III) moves to G#m (i) via
