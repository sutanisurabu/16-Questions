The chord progression is in the key of **G♯ minor**, using the **Aeolian mode** (natural minor). This is evident from the repeated emphasis on G♯m as the tonic chord, with supporting diatonic chords like E major (VI) and B major (III) that align with the G♯ Aeolian scale (G♯ A♯ B C♯ D♯ E F♯). The B/F♯, Bm(b5)/G♯, and F♯6 introduce some chromatic tension and non-diatonic elements (e.g., F natural in Bm(b5) and the added 6th in F♯6), but these function as passing or color chords without altering the overall minor key center.
