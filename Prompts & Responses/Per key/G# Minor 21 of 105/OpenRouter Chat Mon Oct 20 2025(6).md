### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequences**

I need to analyze the chord sequence to determine the key and mode. The progression contains G# minor and E major over G#, along with other chords like B/F# and Bm(b5)/G#. 

When looking at Bm(b5), it really implies a B diminished figure. So it gives us a G# diminished seventh chord with G# as the root and B, D, and F on top. This suggests they are using it as a leading tone diminished chord to A.**Resolving the chord progression**

I’m thinking that G#o7 typically resolves to either A minor or A major since it serves as a leading tone to A. In A minor, G#o7 acts as the vii°7. However, the progression has a lot of G#m chords, which makes me reconsider my mapping. 

In G# minor, the leading tone is G# natural, but wait—G# minor's leading tone actually is F##, not G natural. So, I need to keep that in mind when analyzing the relationships!**Clarifying harmonic structure**

I'm diving into the harmonic minor of G# minor, which uses F double sharp in this context. The vii° chord in G# minor would be F## diminished, but it can appear as G diminished. So, G#°7 isn't functioning as a leading tone but usually leads to A minor. 

I’m now considering if “Bm(b5)/G#” could be interpreted as Bm(b5) over the G# bass, which might suggest G#7b9. B, D, and F form a tritone with G# in the bass. I guess B is a minor third above G#, so maybe it behaves as A## instead.**Examining note relationships**

I’m analyzing the notes in relation to G#. The third of G# would be B#, so B natural is actually a flat third. D serves as a diminished fifth since it’s flat compared to D#. Then, F would be the minor seventh. 

However, the major seventh would be F##. To clarify, in the G# major scale, F natural is treated as a doubly flat seventh, and G# to F is a minor seventh, confirming that it fits that role when considered correctly!**Decoding chord functions**

The seventh note from G# is F## for a major seventh, but F natural serves as the minor seventh. So, G# B D F gives me a G#°7 diminished chord, which can act as a leading tone to A minor. While analyzing surrounding chords, it begins to feel rooted in G# minor.

However, the presence of the Bm(b5)/G# chord raises questions; it could hint at a common-tone diminished chord built on the tonic. But if we think about the key being B major, Bm(b5) doesn't fit. I just need to sort through these chords carefully!**Analyzing chord functions in context**

Over a G# bass, G#°7 acts as a leading-tone diminished chord to A minor. However, in B major, it feels like a chromatic passing chord. This G#°7 resolves to G#m, emphasizing the vi chord structure. The progression includes B/F#, Bm(b5)/G#, and G#m, hinting at G# minor as the underlying key.

The F#6 chord acts as the subtonic, with G#°7 functioning as a common-tone diminished chord. Ultimately, I conclude that the key center is G# minor (Aeolian), with a vibrant harmonic vocabulary mixing B major elements as well.**Summarizing key details**

If I'm analyzing the context in B major, it's centered around G# minor (vi chord) and hints at an iv chord structure. The repeated patterns point towards the Aeolian mode. To keep things straightforward, I’ll outline a direct answer focusing on the key and mode.

The tonal center is G#, and the mode is Aeolian. There's a mixture with a leading-tone diminished chord leading to A. I think this will be clear and helpful!

Key: G# minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Notes:
- E/G# = VI in first inversion.
- B/F# = III in second inversion.
- Bm(b5)/G# is enharmonically G#°7, a common‑tone diminished chord resolving to i (G#m).
- F#6 = VII with added 6 (subtonic with added sixth).
The progression strongly centers on G#m and uses typical Aeolian functions (VI, III, VII).

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord modifications**

I'm working through the implications of reducing the fifth in a B minor triad, which gives me B-D-F natural. Then, with a G# bass, I'm considering G# minor, where I need to think about its harmonic structure. G# natural minor has the notes G#-A#-B-C#-D#-E-F#. In harmonic minor, the leading tone is F double sharp, which equates to G natural sound-wise. However, my focus is on whether F natural is fitting in G# minor. It looks like it's not diatonic.**Clarifying chord structure**

I’m realizing that the 7th in G# natural minor is F#, not F, meaning F natural is a lowered 7th and not part of the key. I’m pondering whether the chord in question could be "Bm(b5)/G#"–but perhaps they mean "Bm7(b5)/G#." It’s odd that Bm(b5) is written, as it usually indicates half-diminished. So, if it's a B diminished triad over a G# bass, I see how that relates to a G#7b9 chord without the 3rd. B is a minor third above G#.**Exploring chord progressions**

I’m looking at the relationship from G# to F, which is a major sixth down or a minor seventh up. F is usually spelled E# in this context, so I’m wondering if F natural acts as a diminished 13 relative to G#. The G# major scale leads to a messy outcome with the chord combinations. Alternatively, could the key be B major instead? The progression includes G#m and E/G# and returns to G#m frequently as the tonic. Bm(b5)/G# seems like it’s stepping outside of the key.**Determining tonal center**

I believe the tonal center is G# minor, which is the relative minor of B major. The presence of E major as the VI chord supports this minor tonality. Looking at the F#6 chord near the end, which likely consists of F#-A#-C#-D#, I realize that F# acts as the VII chord in natural minor. In G# natural minor, the 7th is F#, so the VII chord is indeed F# major. This means F#6 adds the 6th with D#.**Determining key and mode**

I’m considering that the tonal center is G# minor, likely in the Aeolian mode since it uses F#. The odd Bm(b5)/G# chord could be interpreted as Bm7(b5)/G#, which contains notes that don’t fit within the key. The progression features a repeating G# pedal while other voices move, with E/G# as a VI in first inversion. I think the final conclusion should be: the key is G# minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian), with Bm(b5)/G# as a chromatic passing chord.

Key: G# minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Rationale: G#m is the clear tonal center; E major (VI) and F#6 (bVII add6) are diatonic to G# natural minor. No raised 7th (Fx) or dominant D#(7) appears, pointing to Aeolian rather than harmonic/melodic minor. The Bm(b5)/G# functions as a chromatic/passing sonority over a tonic pedal.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm exploring the chord progression: "G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m." I need to figure out the key and mode. 

It looks like we have G# minor, E major with G# in the bass, and B major over F#. The Bm(b5) chord is crucial, indicating a diminished triad, which leads me to think of G# diminished seventh. However, this context feels a little strange in G# minor, so I need to double-check that!**Exploring chord relationships**

I'm breaking down the chords, focusing on E/G# and B/F#. The notes for E/G# are E-G#-B, while B/F# consists of B-D#-F#. F#6 is essentially F#-A#-C#-D#. For G# minor, there are possibilities for the structure, like G# natural minor and relative major B.

Looking at the degrees in G# natural minor, I've pinpointed my chords: G#m for i, E/G# as VI, and others too. So far, everything is connecting well!**Understanding chord functionality**

In G# natural minor, E major is diatonic, consisting of E-G#-B. B/F# acts as the III chord with the fifth in bass, while Bm(b5)/G# creates a diminished triad. However, since B-D-F contains D natural and F natural, it borrows chromatically from A minor, presenting as the leading-tone fully diminished seventh chord.

G#°7 typically resolves to A minor or major, which seems non-diatonic in G# minor. I wonder if "Bm(b5)" might have been meant as Bm7b5 instead, but it’s labeled as Bm(b5)/G#. Interesting!**Clarifying chord transitions**

If I consider Bm7b5 (B-D-F-A) over G#, it would suggest G#-B-D-F-A, which could be interpreted as G#ø9. But it’s tricky, and they did write Bm(b5)/G# specifically. This results in a G# diminished seventh chord that usually resolves to A minor or major, not G# minor.

After Bm(b5)/G#, the progression returns to G#m. I’m testing if G#dim7 resolves to G#m. However, the leading-tone in G# minor is G natural, not G#. So I’m clearly getting my notes a bit confused here!**Determining key and mode**

To resolve to G# as the tonic, the leading tone would be G natural. However, in the context of G# minor, I realize the leading tone is actually F double sharp. So, for G# minor, the scale is G# A# B C# D# E F## G#. The diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone functions as an embellishment leading to G# minor.

The presence of F#6 suggests it's the VII chord in G# natural minor. I conclude the key is G# minor, with the mode being natural minor (Aeolian). The chord Bm(b5)/G# serves as a passing chord, enhancing the tonic. Ultimately, the progression emphasizes G#m, marking it as the tonic.**Summarizing the chord progression**

The chord progression is in G# minor, specifically using the natural minor (Aeolian) mode. The diatonic chords include i, VI6/3 (E/G#), III6/5 (B/F#), and the subtonic VII chord with an added sixth (F#6). The Bm(b5)/G# acts as an enharmonic G#°7, functioning as a common-tone diminished leading back to the tonic. Although it could be heard as relative B major focusing on the vi chord, the recurring cadence emphasizes G#m as the minor tonic.

Key: G# minor
Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)

Notes:
- Diatonic chords: G#m (i), E/G# (VI in first inversion), B/F# (III in second inversion), F#6 (VII with added 6).
- Bm(b5)/G# is enharmonic to G#°7 (G#–B–D–F), a common‑tone diminished chord resolving back to i.
- No raised leading tone appears (no F## or D# major V), so it’s Aeolian rather than harmonic minor.

**Key: G♯ minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  

This progression strongly tonics on G♯ minor, as it begins and ends there, with most chords (G♯m, E, B, F♯6) diatonic to the G♯ natural minor scale (G♯ A♯ B C♯ D♯ E F♯). The E/G♯ and B/F♯ act as bass-supported inversions of VI and III, reinforcing the tonic pull. The Bm(b5)/G♯ introduces a chromatic D♮ (not in the scale), likely a passing or tension-building chord (possibly functioning as a local dominant or borrowed from a parallel mode), but it doesn't shift the overall key center.

**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

The chord progression is in the key of **G♯ minor**, using the **Aeolian mode** (natural minor). This is evident from the repeated emphasis on G♯m as the tonic chord, with supporting diatonic chords like E major (VI) and B major (III) that align with the G♯ Aeolian scale (G♯ A♯ B C♯ D♯ E F♯). The B/F♯, Bm(b5)/G♯, and F♯6 introduce some chromatic tension and non-diatonic elements (e.g., F natural in Bm(b5) and the added 6th in F♯6), but these function as passing or color chords without altering the overall minor key center.

### Reasoning

**Assessing the Harmony**

I'm currently focused on the structure of the chord progression. I'm taking the input and breaking it down, chord by chord, to understand each element. Then, I'm working to discern their relationships to one another and the overall harmonic motion of the piece. I'm leaning heavily on identifying potential key centers.


**Unpacking the Chords**

I've finished the chord inventory and I'm sifting through the list to find the possible tonic. I'm focusing on the G#m chord and its many appearances to see if it sets up the key. The E/G# and B/F# chords are presenting some interesting movement. The Bm(b5)/G# is quite intriguing, and I'll need to assess its harmonic function.


**Key Confirmation in Progress**

I'm now diving into the harmonic minor scale of G# to check its role. My recent focus is on how the V chord, a major D# chord, functions, though it's not present. This exploration guides my further analysis, especially the potential for secondary dominants. The F#6 chord has become the center of my attention.


**Investigating Dissonance**

The Bm(b5)/G# chord remains my primary focus, and I'm assessing its function in the progression. It appears after a B major chord, resolving to the G# minor. This is further confirmation of the G# minor key, although the presence of the B diminished triad is an interesting change. I will now examine its relationship to the harmonic and melodic minor scales.


**Confirming the Tonic**

I'm now certain the key is G# minor. Examining the structure, I've confirmed that the chord progression heavily emphasizes the tonic, appearing eight times. This reinforces my initial assessment, and I am now ready to move toward the next step.


**Further Chord Function Review**

My attention is now on the bass line movement in the progression, specifically how the chords connect. The passing chord, `Bm(b5)/G#`, still has my focus. I'm noting the downward chromatic movement from B to Bm(b5)/G# before the resolution back to the tonic, a common practice in minor keys. The use of non-diatonic notes contributes to the feeling of tension and release.


**Evaluating Resolution**

I'm now zeroing in on the unique character of the `Bm(b5)/G#` chord, investigating how it adds to the overall harmonic texture. I'm focusing on its dissonance. I'm examining its chromaticism and its impact on the listener's ear as it leads into the root chord.


**Assessing the Dissonance**

My current analysis focuses on how the Bm(b5)/G#'s dissonance leads to the resolution. The chord's unusual structure is a crucial element. Examining its role in the chromatic movement toward the tonic is key. The presence of non-diatonic notes is pivotal in this section of the analysis.


**Deep Dive on the Function**

I'm now ready to delve further into the specific function of the non-diatonic chords. It's time to examine the relationship between the chord voicings and the key. Specifically, I'm taking a close look at the chromaticism to see its connection with the overall harmonic intent.




Based on the chords provided, the analysis is as follows:

*   **Key:** **G# minor**
*   **Mode:** **Natural Minor** (also known as Aeolian)

### Breakdown:

1.  **Tonic Chord:** The progression repeatedly starts, ends, and centers around the **G#m** chord. This makes G#m the clear tonic, or "home" chord, establishing the key as G# minor.

2.  **Diatonic Chords:** Most of the chords in the progression are built directly from the G# Natural Minor scale (G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F#).
    *   **G#m** is the **i** (tonic) chord.
    *   **E** (in E/G#) is the **VI** (submediant) chord. The `i` to `VI` progression is extremely common.
    *   **B** (in B/F#) is the **III** (mediant) chord.
    *   **F#6** is a variation of the **VII** (subtonic) chord. The notes of F#6 are F#, A#, C#, and D#. All of these notes fit perfectly within the G# Natural Minor scale.

3.  **The "Odd" Chord:** The one chord that is not diatonic is **Bm(b5)/G#**.
    *   The notes are B, D, F, with a G# in the bass.
    *   This chord functions as a momentary, highly dissonant **passing chord**. The G# in the bass acts as a pedal tone, holding the root of the key while the chords above it create tension that immediately resolves back to the G#m chord. It uses chromatic voice leading to add color and tension before the resolution.

Because the harmony is consistently built around the chords of the natural minor scale (i, III, VI, VII) and does not use the raised 7th degree (F##/G) that would create a major V chord (D# major), the mode is clearly **Natural Minor**.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord sequence: G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by writing down all the chords clearly to analyze them.

First, I need to understand what each chord represents. G#m is G# minor, which is the tonic in G# minor. E/G# is an E major chord with G# in the bass. Since G# is the third of E major, this inverted chord might function as a dominant or have some leading quality. E major is the dominant of A major, but here we're in G# minor, so maybe E is related to the minor key.

B/F# is B major with F# in the bass. F# is the fifth of B major, so this is the second inversion. B major is the dominant chord in E major, but again, context matters. Bm(b5)/G# is a B half-diminished chord (Bm7b5) with G# in the bass. G# is the minor third of Bm(b5), making it the first inversion. This chord is the ii chord in A major, but in minor keys, it's often the iiø7 in natural minor.

F#6 is an F# major sixth chord. F# major is the subdominant in C# major, but let's see how it fits here. The sequence ends with G#m, which is the tonic.

Now, listing all the roots without considering inversions: G#m, E major, B major, Bm(b5), F# major. The roots are G#, E, B, B, F#. So the chords are: i, V/vi? Wait, in G# minor, the diatonic chords would be: i (G#m), ii° (A#°), III (B), iv (C#m), v (D#m), VI (E), VII (F#). 

Let me verify that. G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#. So:
- i: G#m
- ii°: A#dim
- III: B major
- iv: C#m
- v: D#m
- VI: E major
- VII: F# major

Ah, so E major is the VI chord in G# natural minor. B major is III. F# is VII. Now, in the sequence, we have E/G# which is E major (VI) in first inversion since G# is the bass. B/F# is B major (III) with F# in the bass. F# is the fifth, so second inversion. Bm(b5)/G# is Bm(b5). But in natural minor, the III is major, not half-diminished. Bm(b5) is actually the iiø7 in A major, but here it's written as Bm(b5) which is B-D-F-A. In G# minor, the diatonic ii chord is A#° (A#-C#-E), not Bm(b5). Bm(b5) has B, D, F, A. The notes B, D, F are the root, minor third, diminished fifth. So this chord is actually the iiø7 chord in A major, but relative to G# minor?

Wait, if we're in G# minor, the relative major is B major. But Bm(b5) in the key of G# minor? Let's check the scale. G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#. The ii chord would be A#-C#-E, which is A#dim. But Bm(b5) is B-D-F-A. B is the third degree, but in natural minor, the third degree forms a major chord (B major). So Bm(b5) isn't diatonic to natural minor. It would be diatonic to G# harmonic minor or melodic minor.

G# harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##, G#. So the scale has F## (which is G natural). Then the chords: i (G#m), ii° (A#°), III+ (Baug), iv (C#m), V (D#), VI (E), vii° (F##°). D# is major because the fifth is raised (F## creates a major V). 

In harmonic minor, the VI chord is E major, which matches. The VII chord would be F## major? No, in harmonic minor, the seventh degree is F##, so the VII chord is F## diminished? Wait, let's list the triads:

Scale: G# (i), A# (ii°), B (III), C# (iv), D# (V), E (VI), F## (vii°)

So triads:
i: G#m (G#-B-D#)
ii°: A#° (A#-C#-E)
III: B (B-D#-F##) but D# is enharmonically Eb, F## is G. So B major is B-D#-F##, which is B major (B-D#-G). Yes.

iv: C#m (C#-E-G#)
V: D# (D#-F##-A#) which is D# major (D#-Fx-A#)
VI: E (E-G#-B)
vii°: F##° (F##-A#-C#) which is G° (G-Bb-Db)

So in harmonic minor, we have E major as VI. But Bm(b5) is B-D-F-A. B-D is minor third, D-F is diminished fifth. So this chord has F natural (since F is the diminished fifth from B). In G# harmonic minor, the sixth scale degree is E natural, and seventh is F## (G). So F natural isn't in the scale. Therefore, Bm(b5) with F natural doesn't fit G# harmonic minor.

What about G# melodic minor? Ascending: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#. Descending is natural minor. But typically, melodic minor chords are taken from ascending form for harmony. So scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#. 

Chords:
i: G#m (G#-B-D#)
ii: A#m (A#-C#-E#) which is A#-C#-F
III: B (B-D#-F#)
IV: C# (C#-E#-G#) which is C#-F-G#
V: D# (D#-F#-A#)
VI: E#° (E#-G#-B) → F° (F-A-C)
VII: F# (F#-A#-C#)

So in melodic minor, the ii chord is A#m7 (A#-C#-E#-G#), which is A# Dorian. But Bm(b5) is B-D-F-A. B is the III degree. In melodic minor, III is major (B-D#-F#), not half-diminished. Bm(b5) has D natural and F natural, which aren't in melodic minor scale (which has D# and F#).

So where does Bm(b5) come from? In minor keys, the ii chord is often half-diminished when the V is major (harmonic minor context). But in G# minor, the ii chord should be A#°. Bm(b5) is actually the iiø7 chord in A major. A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. So iiø7: B-D-F#-A. But here it's written as Bm(b5), which probably implies Bm7b5, so B-D-F-A. F natural instead of F#. So it's B half-diminished with F natural, not F#.

This is B°7? B-D-F-Ab? But the user wrote Bm(b5), which typically means minor triad with diminished fifth, so B-D-F, and if it's a seventh chord, it would be B-D-F-A (Bm7b5). But Bm7b5 is B-D-F-A, which is the half-diminished seventh chord. 

In the context of G# minor, let's see the notes. If we have Bm7b5 (B-D-F-A), this would correspond to the iiø7 chord in A major. Since G# minor is the relative minor of B major, but A major is a different key. Perhaps the key is E major? E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. Relative minor is C# minor. Not matching.

Another approach: list all the chord roots and see the progression. Roots: G#, E, B, B, F#.

Sequence roots: G# (x2), E (x2), G# (x2), B, Bm(b5) [which is B root], G# (x2), E (x2), G# (x2), F#, G#.

So roots moving: G# → E → G# → B → B → G# → E → G# → F# → G#.

The key could be G# minor because it starts and ends on G#m. The frequent use of E major as VI is common in minor keys (Picardy third? No, it's major in minor). In natural minor, VI is major, which is E major here. So E/G# is the VI chord in first inversion.

B/F# is B major (III) in second inversion. In natural minor, III is major, so that fits.

F#6 is F# major with sixth (F#-A#-C#-D#). In G# natural minor, F# is the VII major chord. So F# is diatonic.

Now the problematic chord is Bm(b5)/G#. As Bm(b5), root B, with G# in bass. G# is the minor third of B chord. Bm(b5) has notes B, D, F. So inversion is D in bass? Wait, Bm(b5)/G# means G# is the bass note. But G# isn't in Bm(b5) (B, D, F). Bm(b5) is B-D-F. G# is not part of this chord. That's odd. Unless it's a typo or misunderstanding.

Perhaps it's Bm7b5/G#, which is B-D-F-A with G# in bass. But G# is still not in the chord. B-D-F-A are the notes. G# is enharmonic to Ab, which is not in the chord. So having G# in bass for Bm(b5) would create an interval of minor ninth or something, which is dissonant. That seems unusual.

Maybe it's a mistake, and it's supposed to be Bm/G# or something else. But the user wrote "Bm(b5)/G#". Another possibility: perhaps it's a B half-diminished chord in the key of A, but in the context of G# minor. However, as previously, natural minor has III as major, not half-diminished.

Wait, in harmonic minor, the V chord is major, but the ii chord is diminished. For G# harmonic minor, ii is A#°. Still not Bm(b5).

Unless the key is D# minor? Let's check. D# minor: D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#. But G# is the submediant (VI). Not tonic.

Alternatively, perhaps it's E major with a minor tonic? Unlikely.

Another idea: the chord Bm(b5)/G# might be functioning as a secondary dominant or borrowed chord. For example, Bm(b5) is iiø7 in A major, so it could be a ii-V progression towards A. But in the sequence, after Bm(b5)/G#, it goes to G#m, not A. So maybe it's a deceptive resolution or something.

Let's look at the entire sequence:

G#m G#m (i i)
E/G# E/G# (VI inversion)
G#m G#m (i i)
B/F# Bm(b5)/G# (III inversion then iiø? but in which key)
G#m G#m (i i)
E/G# E/G# (VI)
G#m G#m (i i)
F#6 G#m (VII i)

F#6 is likely F# major sixth chord: F#-A#-C#-D#. So it's the VII chord in G# minor, which is diatonic.

Now, B/F# is B major with F# in bass. In G# natural minor, B major is the III chord. F# is the fifth of B, so second inversion - common.

Bm(b5)/G#: if we interpret Bm(b5) as B half-diminished (B-D-F-A), but in the key of G# minor, this chord isn't diatonic. However, if we consider that the key might be using harmonic minor elements, but still, the ii chord is A#°. 

Wait a minute - in the key of G# minor, the chord on B would be the III chord. In natural minor, it's major (B-D#-F#). But here it's written as Bm(b5), which is B-D-F. So D natural instead of D#, F natural instead of F#. 

If the scale has D natural and F natural, that would be from G# Phrygian? Let's see G# Phrygian: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#. But that has A natural, not A#. G# natural minor is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Phrygian has flat second. G# Phrygian: G#, A, Bb, C#, D, E, F#, G#? Wait, standard Phrygian: 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. So for G#: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#. B is the minor third, so B natural. So G# Phrygian: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Chords in Phrygian:
i: G#m (G#-B-D#)
bII: A (A-C#-E)
III: B (B-D#-F#) but wait, in Phrygian, the III is major because of D#? Scale degrees: 1=G#, 2=A, 3=B, 4=C#, 5=D#, 6=E, 7=F#. So triad on 3 (B): B-D#-F# → B major. But the user has Bm(b5), which is minor. So not matching.

What if it's G# Dorian? Dorian: 1,2,b3,4,5,6,b7. So G# Dorian: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#. E# is F natural? Wait, E# is enharmonic to F, but in notation it's E#. So scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#.

Chords:
i: G#m (G#-B-D#)
ii: A#m (A#-C#-E#)
III: B (B-D#-F#)
IV: C# (C#-E#-G#)
v: D#m (D#-F#-A#)
VI: E# (E#-G#-B) which is F (F-A-C) but written as E# major? Not standard.
bVII: F# (F#-A#-C#)

But in Dorian, the IV is major. Here we have F#6 which is VII in minor, but in Dorian it would be bVII.

The sequence has F#6 as the second last chord, resolving to G#m. In minor keys, VII-i is a common cadence (subtonic to tonic). In Dorian, bVII-i is also common.

But the chord Bm(b5) still doesn't fit.

Another thought: perhaps the key is C# minor, and G#m is the V chord. But the sequence starts and ends on G#m, so unlikely.

Let's list all the notes used in the chords:

G#m: G#, B, D#
E/G#: E, G#, B (since E major is E-G#-B)
B/F#: B, D#, F# (B major)
Bm(b5)/G#: B, D, F, A with G# bass? But G# not in chord. Wait, Bm(b5) is B-D-F, so bass G# is not part of it. This is confusing. Maybe it's a typo and it's Bm7b5/G#, which is B-D-F-A. Still, G# isn't in it. Unless "Bm(b5)" is meant to be "Bø7" and the slash bass is a mistake.

Perhaps the chord is actually G#ø7? But it's written as Bm(b5)/G#. Bm(b5)/G# would have root B, but bass G#. So maybe it's a G# chord. G# half-diminished is G#-B-D-F#, which is viiø7 in A major. But here it's written as Bm(b5)/G#.

Let's parse the notation: "Bm(b5)/G#" means the chord is B minor with flat 5 (so B-D-F) and G# is the bass note. So the pitches are G#, B, D, F. G# to B is minor third, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third - so it's a diminished seventh chord? G#-B-D-F is G# diminished seventh (since F is F natural, not F#). G#°7 = G#-B-D-F.

Ah! That's likely. The user might have mislabeled it. Bm(b5)/G# would mean root B, but if the bass is G#, and the chord is G# diminished, it would be notated as G#°/G# or something, but perhaps they intended G# diminished seventh. 

G#°7: G#-B-D-F. So the notes are G#, B, D, F. So if we call the chord G#°7, root G#, but it's written as Bm(b5)/G# which is confusing because Bm(b5) is B-D-F, and with G# bass, it's a G# diminished seventh chord.

This is probably a notational error. Commonly, G# diminished seventh is G#-B-D-F, which can be spelled as A°7 but enharmonically. But the root would be G#.

So if "Bm(b5)/G#" is actually G#°7 (G# diminished seventh), that makes sense in the key of A major or minor. In G# minor, the vii°7 chord is F##°7 (G°7), but G#°7 is the vii°7 of A major.

In the key of A major, vii°7 is G#°7. And the chord progression might be in A major, but starting on G#°7? The sequence starts with G#m, not G#°.

Wait, the sequence starts with G#m. If the key is A major, G#m would be vii° or something? In A major, vii° is G#°, not minor. So not matching.

Back to G# minor. In G# natural minor, the diatonic diminished chord is on A# (ii°). G#°7 would be non-diatonic but commonly used as a leading chord to A. For example, in harmonic minor, but G# harmonic minor has F##, so the leading tone chord is F##°7.

Perhaps the progression is using borrowed chords. But let's check common progressions.

Another approach: look at the cadence. It ends with F#6 to G#m. F# to G#m is a whole step, common in minor keys as VII-i (subtonic to tonic). In G# minor, F# is the subtonic, so natural minor.

The chord B/F# is B major (III) which is natural minor. E major (VI) is natural minor.

The odd chord is Bm(b5)/G#. If we assume it's G#°7 (G#-B-D-F), that would be the chord in question. In the sequence: G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# [G#°7] G#m etc.

So B/F# is B major (III) with F# bass, then next chord is G#°7. G#°7 typically resolves to A or Am. But in the sequence, it goes to G#m. So G#°7 to G#m is a direct resolution, but G#°7 has F natural, which is not in G# minor (which has F#). So it's a chromatic approach.

In minor keys, the use of the major V chord (D# in G# minor) creates D#-F##-A#, so raised seventh. But here we have G#°7 which has F natural, which might be from the Phrygian mode.

G# Phrygian: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So the chord on G# is minor, and it has A natural as the second degree. The °7 chord on G# would be G#-A#-C#-E, but no. Wait, Phrygian scale steps: 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. So G# Phrygian: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Chords:
i: G#m
bII: A major
III: B major
iv: C#m
v: D# diminished? D#-F#-A → D#m? Wait, D# is the fifth degree, D#, F#, A#. So D#m (D#-F#-A#). But in standard Phrygian, v is minor.

The diminished chords would be on bII and vii. But G# Phrygian doesn't have a diminished seventh chord on G#.

G#°7: G#-B-D-F. Notes: G# (1), B (b3), D (b5), F (bb7). This is the diminished seventh chord that is enharmonically equivalent to chords a minor third away. It can function as a vii°7 in A major (G#°7 = vii°7 of A), or as a common tone diminished chord.

In the context of G# minor, if we see G#°7, it might be a chromatic chord leading to A, but here it resolves to G#m, which is unusual.

Perhaps the key is E major, and G#m is the vi chord. Let's check:

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

vi chord: C#m, not G#m. G#m would be iii chord? E major: I=E, ii=F#m, iii=G#m, IV=A, V=B, vi=C#m, vii°=D#°.

Ah! So in E major, G#m is the iii minor chord. So the progression might be in E major, starting on iii.

Sequence: G#m (iii), G#m, E/G# (I? E/G# is E major with G# bass), but E/G# is first inversion of I chord.

Let's map the chords to E major:

G#m: iii
E/G#: I (with third in bass)
B/F#: V (B major is V in E) with F#? Wait B major is B-D#-F#, so B/F# is second inversion (F# is fifth). Yes, V6/4.
Bm(b5)/G#: Bm(b5) is B-D-F, but in E major, the diatonic V is B-D#-F#. So Bm(b5) has D natural and F natural, which are the flattened third and fifth of V. This would be a modal mixture or borrowed chord.

F#6: F# major sixth. In E major, F# is ii, so ii6 usually, but F# major is diatonic.

But the sequence ends on G#m, which is iii in E major, not the tonic. So it would feel unresolved, but the user has it ending on G#m, so tonic is likely G#m.

Therefore, the key must be G# minor.

Now, back to the chords in G# natural minor:

- i: G#m
- III: B
- VI: E
- VII: F#

All present. The problematic chord is labeled Bm(b5)/G#. If it's actually G#°7, then it's a secondary leading tone chord. G#°7 is vii°7 of A, so it would want to go to A or Am. But in the sequence, it goes to G#m. So perhaps it's a passing chord or mislabeled.

Another possibility: in some contexts, especially in jazz or modern harmony, Bm7b5 could be the ii chord in A minor. A minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. iiø7: B-D-F-A. Yes! So Bm7b5 is iiø7 in A minor.

If we're in A minor, then G#m isn't diatonic. A harmonic minor has G# instead of G natural, so G# is the leading tone. In A harmonic minor, the chords include E major (V), and G#° (vii°).

But the sequence starts with G#m. G#m in A harmonic minor would be the vii° chord, which is diminished, not minor. So G#m isn't diatonic to A minor.

Unless it's A melodic minor ascending, but still, scale is A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#, so chords: i, ii, III+, IV, V, vi°, vii°. Still, vii° is diminished.

So not matching.

Let's consider that "Bm(b5)/G#" might be a misinterpretation. If it's spelled as G# B D F, that's G# diminished seventh (G#°7). In Roman numerals for G# minor, G#°7 would be the bII°7 chord if we're borrowing from Phrygian.

G# Phrygian has A natural as the second scale degree. The bII chord is A major. But G#°7 is related.

In minor keys, it's common to borrow the Neapolitan chord, which is bII major. For G# minor, Neapolitan is A major. But here we have a diminished seventh.

Another dead end.

Perhaps the key is B major, and G#m is the vi chord. B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. vi chord is G#m. So progression could be in B major.

Chords:
G#m: vi
E/G#: IV (E major is IV in B) with G# bass (third inversion? E/G# is first inversion since G# is third of E)
B/F#: I (B major) with F# bass (fifth, so second inversion)
F#6: V (F# major is V in B)

Then Bm(b5)/G#: Bm(b5) is B-D-F, which is not diatonic to B major (which has D#). So it's a borrowed chord.

The progression would be vi vi IV IV vi vi I6/4 [something] vi vi IV IV vi vi V vi.

The Bm(b5)/G# would be the odd chord here. If it's resolving to vi (G#m), maybe it's a chromatic passing chord.

But the progression ends on G#m, which would not be the tonic in B major; tonic is B. So if it ends on vi, it might feel like it's in G#m, but technically the key could be B major with a deceptive cadence. However, starting and ending on vi is unusual for a major key.

Typically, modulations or progressions in major keys don't end on vi as the final resolution; it's expected to end on I. So likely the key is G# minor.

Given that most chords fit G# natural minor (i, III, VI, VII), and the only odd chord is Bm(b5)/G#, which might be a typo or a chromatic chord, I think the key is G# minor, natural minor (Aeolian) mode.

Confirming:

G# natural minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#
- i: G#m
- III: B (B D# F#)
- VI: E (E G# B)
- VII: F# (F# A# C#)

F#6 chord is F# A# C# D# (added sixth), which is still based on VII.

The chord labeled "Bm(b5)/G#" – if it's intended to be Bm7b5, which is B D F A, then in the context of G# minor, this could be a borrowed chord from G# Dorian (which has F# instead of F natural) or something else. But if we consider that it's a misnotation for B°7 or G#°7, it might be a chromatic approach.

However, the persistent use of E major (VI), B major (III), and F# major (VII) points to natural minor. The III and VII chords are major in natural minor, which is a characteristic sound.

In harmonic minor, V is major, but here V would be D#. We don't see D# in the progression; instead, we have E (VI) and B (III), which are major and fit natural minor.

The chord "Bm(b5)/G#" might be an error, or it could be a B half-diminished chord functioning as a ii chord for A minor, but since it resolves to G#m, it might be a passing chord.

Given all this, I believe the key is G# minor in Aeolian (natural minor) mode.

Based on the chord sequence provided, here's a clear analysis of the key and mode:

### **Chord Sequence Breakdown**
```
G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  G#m  G#m  B/F#  Bm(b5)/G#  
G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  G#m  G#m  F#6   G#m
```

### **Analysis**
1. **Root Chords Identified** (ignoring inversions for scale determination):
   - **G#m** (tonic emphasis)
   - **E major** (written as `E/G#`, a first-inversion E chord)
   - **B major** (written as `B/F#`, a second-inversion B chord)
   - **Bm(b5)** (B half-diminished, written as `Bm(b5)/G#`)
   - **F#6** (F# major sixth chord)

2. **Key Center Identification**:
   - The progression **starts and ends on G#m**, strongly implying **G# as the tonic**.
   - All chords fit within the **G# natural minor (Aeolian) scale**:
     ```
     G# natural minor scale: G# – A# – B – C# – D# – E – F# – (G#)
     ```
   - **Diatonic Chords in G# Natural Minor**:
     - **i**: G#m (G#-B-D#) → matches the tonic.
     - **III**: B (B-D#-F#) → matches `B/F#` (B major is diatonic as the III chord).
     - **VI**: E (E-G#-B) → matches `E/G#` (E major is diatonic as the VI chord).
     - **VII**: F# (F#-A#-C#) → matches `F#6` (F# major is diatonic as the VII chord; the added 6th [D#] is a common extension in minor keys).

3. **Resolving the Anomaly: `Bm(b5)/G#`**  
   - `Bm(b5)` (B-D-F-A) is **not diatonic** to G# natural minor (which requires D# and F# for a standard B major chord). 
   - However:
     - This chord is likely a **chromatic passing chord** or **misnotation**. 
     - In context, `Bm(b5)/G#` functions as **G#°7 (G# diminished 7th)** enharmonically:
       - Notes: **G#-B-D-F** (G#°7 = G#-B-D-F).
       - This is a **common borrowed chord** from G# harmonic minor or Phrygian mode, used for coloristic tension before resolving to G#m.
     - Its placement (`B/F# → [G#°7] → G#m`) creates a chromatic bass line (F# → G#), typical in minor keys for dramatic effect.

4. **Why Not Other Modes/Keys?**
   - **G# Harmonic Minor?**  
     Requires a raised 7th (F##/G instead of F#), making D# major the dominant (V) chord. This chord is **absent** here, ruling out harmonic minor.
   - **G# Melodic Minor?**  
     Requires raised 6th/7th (E#/F and F#/G#), creating major IV and V chords. Neither appears, ruling this out.
   - **Relative Major (B Major)?**  
     G#m would be the **vi chord**, but the progression ends on G#m (not B major), making this unlikely.
   - **A Major/E Minor?**  
     G#m doesn’t fit diatonically in these keys (requires G# in A major or G natural in E minor).

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **G# minor**  
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (Natural Minor)**  
- **Justification**:  
  The progression relies on the **natural minor triads**:  
  - i (G#m), III (B), VI (E), VII (F#) — all diatonic to G# natural minor.  
  - The anomalous `Bm(b5)/G#` is best interpreted as a **chromatic G#°7 chord** (a borrowed color chord common in minor keys), not altering the tonal center.  
  - The cadence **F#6 → G#m** (VII-i) is a hallmark of natural minor resolutions.

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: In minor-key progressions, natural minor (Aeolian) is often used for a "softer" sound (since harmonic/melodic minor emphasize the leading tone for stronger cadences). Here, the absence of D# major (V) or raised 7th chords confirms Aeolian. The chromatic G#°7 adds spice without changing the core mode.

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**
```
G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  
G#m  G#m  B/F#  Bm(b5)/G#  
G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  
G#m  G#m  F#6  G#m
```

### Step 1: Identify chord roots and types
- **G#m** = G# minor (G# – B – D#)
- **E/G#** = E major in first inversion (bass on G#); E major = E – G# – B
- **B/F#** = B major in first inversion (bass on F#); B = B – D# – F#
- **Bm(b5)/G#** = B half-diminished (Bmø or Bø), also called Bm(b5), in first inversion (bass on G#). Bm(b5) = B – D – F#
- **F#6** = F# major with a 6th (F# – A# – C# – D#)

So overall, the chords are:
- G#m
- E major (inversion)
- B major (inversion)
- Bm(b5) (inversion)
- F#6

---

### Step 2: Look at common tonics and possible keys

All chords revolve around **G#** in the bass or root. G# minor appears repeatedly and starts/ends the progression — this strongly suggests **G# minor** as the **tonic key**.

Now let’s evaluate whether this is **natural minor**, **harmonic minor**, or **melodic minor** (or another mode).

---

### Step 3: Compare chords to G# minor scales

**G# natural minor** (same as B major):
- Notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#
- Chords built on this scale would be:
  - i: G#m
  - ii°: A#dim
  - III: B
  - iv: C#m
  - v: D#m
  - VI: E
  - VII: F#

Wait — **E major (III)** is not in G# natural minor. In natural minor, the VI chord is **E major**? Let's check:

Wait — actually, the relative major of G# minor is **B major**. So G# minor has the same key signature as B major (5 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#).

So:
- G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Chords in G# natural minor:
- i: G#m
- ii°: A#dim
- III: B (major)
- iv: C#m
- v: D#m
- VI: E (major)
- VII: F# (major)

So:
- G#m → i
- E major (E/G#) → VI
- B major (B/F#) → III
- F# major/F#6 → VII

So far, these all fit **G# natural minor**.

Now the strange chord: **Bm(b5)/G#**

- Bm(b5) = B–D–F#
- This is the **iiø7** chord in **harmonic minor**.

Let’s check **G# harmonic minor**:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (F## = G)
- But we don’t see any G natural (F##) in the chords listed.

Wait — the chord **Bm(b5)** = B–D–F#.

In **G# harmonic minor**, the raised 7th is **F## (G)**, so:
- The ii chord in harmonic minor is **A# half-diminished**, not B.

Hold on — B is the **third degree** of G# minor.

So Bm(b5) would be the **iiiø** chord?

But in G# harmonic minor:
- i: G#m
- ii°: A#dim
- III+: B augmented (B–D#–F##)
- iv: C#m
- v: D#m
- VI: E
- VII: F##dim

So **Bm(b5)** is **not** in G# harmonic minor.

In fact, Bm(b5) (B–D–F#) includes:
- B (3rd of G#)
- D (lowered 5th from D# — not diatonic to G# minor)
- F# (7th of G# minor)

So D natural is not in G# minor (which has D#). So Bm(b5) has D — a **flat 5th** relative to B major.

But if the chord is **Bm(b5)**, it has:
- Root: B
- m3: D
- b5: F#

That would imply it's built on B with **D** and **F#** — so D is not in G# minor (which has D#). So this chord is **chromatic**.

Wait — could it be a **secondary chord**?

Alternatively, **Bm(b5)** is the **iiø7** chord in **A major** or **A minor**, but that doesn't help.

Wait — perhaps it's a **viio/vi** or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the chord is functioning as a **iiø7** in **A# minor**, but that’s complicated.

But let's consider: **Bm(b5)/G#** — the bass is **G#**.

So the chord is **Bm(b5)** with **G#** in the bass → G#, B, D, F#

That makes the full chord: **G# – B – D – F#**

Which is: **G#m7(b5)** or **G# half-diminished (G#ø)**

Ah! That’s the key.

Even though it's labeled **Bm(b5)/G#**, the notes are:
- Bass: G#
- Chord: B–D–F#

So combined: **G#, B, D, F#**

That’s a **G#ø7** chord — G# half-diminished = **iiø7** in **F# minor**

Wait — but we’re thinking G# minor.

In **G# minor**, the **ii°** chord is **A# diminished**, not G#ø.

So G#ø is **not diatonic** to G# minor.

But G#ø is the **viiø7** of **A major**, or the **iiø7** of **F# minor**.

Hmm.

But let's reconsider the labeling: **Bm(b5)/G#**

If the bass is G#, and the chord is Bm(b5), then the full set of notes is:
- G# (bass)
- B
- D
- F#

So yes: G#, B, D, F#

That is: **G#–B–D–F#**

Intervals from G#:
- G#–B = minor third
- B–D = minor third
- D–F# = major third

So a **fully diminished 7th**? No: G#–B–D–F# → intervals:

- G#–B: m3
- B–D: m3
- D–F#: M3

So it's a **half-diminished** chord, **G#m7(b5)**, root G#.

So it should be labeled **G#ø** or **G#m7(b5)**, not **Bm(b5)/G#**

Unless the harmonic function is as a **Bm(b5)** chord over G#, but musically, it's **G# half-diminished**.

So this chord is **G#m7(b5)** — iim7(b5) of **F# minor**

That suggests we might actually be in **F# minor**, not G# minor.

Let’s re-evaluate.

---

### Try key: **F# minor**

F# natural minor:
- F#, G#, A, A#, C#, D, E
- Wait — enharmonics: better to use:
- F#, G#, A, Bb, C#, D, E

But in practice:
- Notes: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E → no, B is natural, not Bb.

F# minor:
- F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E
- Same as A major (3 sharps)

Chords in F# minor:
- i: F#m
- ii°: G#dim
- III: A
- iv: Bm
- v: C#m
- VI: D
- VII: E

But our chords include:
- G#m → could be ii°? But G#dim, not G#m
- Wait — G#m is G#, B, D#. But in F# minor, B is B natural, D is D natural — so G#dim = G#, B, D — not D#.

So G#m (with D#) is **not** in F# minor.

G#m has D# — which is not in F# minor.

So G#m has:
- G#, B, D#

D# is in G# minor (6th note), but not in F# minor.

So G#m fits **G# minor** (obviously).

But earlier, we have a chord with D natural → in **Bm(b5)**: B–D–F# — D natural.

So now we have a problem:
- G#m → D#
- Bm(b5) → D

So both D and D#? That's not diatonic.

Unless the **Bm(b5)** is using D, not D#.

But G# minor has D#, not D.

So the chord Bm(b5) = B–D–F# has **D**, which is **D natural**, a **half-step below D#**.

So that’s **enharmonically D**, not D#.

So this chord contains a **D**, which is **not in G# minor**.

But wait — in **G# harmonic minor**, the 7th is **F## (G)**, but the 6th is still **E**, and 5th is D#.

So D is still not in G# minor.

So the Bm(b5) chord (B–D–F#) has a D — **lowered 6th degree** — perhaps borrowed?

Alternatively, could the chord be **Bø7**? That's a common chord.

Bø7 = B–D–F#–A → half-diminished.

But our chord is Bm(b5), so likely B–D–F#, possibly with A.

But still, D is not in G# minor.

Wait — unless the key is not G# minor.

Let’s reconsider: perhaps the key is **E major** or **C# minor**?

Wait — list all notes used:

From chords:
- G#m: G#, B, D#
- E/G#: E, G#, B
- B/F#: B, D#, F#
- Bm(b5)/G#: B, D, F#, G# (bass)
- F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

So notes:
- G#, B, D# (from G#m, E, B/F#)
- E, G#, B (E major)
- B, D#, F# (B major)
- B, D, F#, G# (Bm(b5)/G#)
- F#, A#, C#, D# (F#6)

List all unique notes:
- G#
- B
- D#
- E
- F#
- D
- A#
- C#

So notes:
- C#
- D
- D#
- E
- F#
- G#
- A#
- B

So we have **both D and D#** — chromatic.

That suggests **mode mixture** or **chromaticism**.

But let’s see which key could have most of these.

Look at **G# Dorian mode**:

Dorian on G#:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#
- That’s the same as F# major.

So G# Dorian:
- i: G#m
- ii: A#m
- III: B
- IV: C#
- v: D#m
- VI: E
- VII: F#

Compare with chords:
- G#m → i
- E → VI
- B → III
- F# → VII

All fit.

Now **Bm(b5)/G#** = G#, B, D, F#

D is **D natural**, but in G# Dorian, the 6th is **E**, and 4th is **C#**, so D natural is not present.

G# Dorian has: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So D natural is **not** in G# Dorian.

But it has **C#** and **D#**, no D.

So D is still foreign.

Unless it's a **blue note** or chromatic passing.

Wait — the chord **F#6** = F# A# C# D# — D# is the 6th, so D# is used.

D natural is only in the **Bm(b5)** chord.

Perhaps **Bm(b5)** is a **iiø7** chord in **A major** or **A minor**, but resolving where?

Alternatively, perhaps **Bm(b5)/G#** is functioning as a **chromatic passing chord** between G#m and something.

Sequence: 
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G#  
G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm(b5)/G#  
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G#  
G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m

So before F#6, we have Bm(b5)/G#, which is G#ø.

G#m to G#ø to F#6 to G#m.

G#m (i) – G#ø (iio) – F#6 (VII6) – G#m (i)

But in G# minor, G#ø is not diatonic.

However, **G#ø** is the **iim7(b5)** in **F# minor**.

But not helpful.

Wait — another idea: **G# Phrygian mode**

Phrygian on G#:
- G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#
- Based on E major: E F# G# A B C# D#

So notes: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Compare to our notes:
- We have A# (in F#6), but Phrygian has A natural.

F#6 has A# → not in G# Phrygian.

So no.

Back to G# natural minor: G# A# B C# D# E F#

Chords diatonic:
- G#m (i)
- A#dim (ii°)
- B (III)
- C#m (iv)
- D#m (v)
- E (VI)
- F# (VII)

Our chords:
- G#m — yes
- E major (E/G#) — VI — yes
- B major (B/F#) — III — yes
- F#6 — F#, A#, C#, D# — A# is **not** in G# natural minor.

Wait — F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

But in G# minor, the 3rd of F# chord should be **A natural**, not A#.

F# is the VII chord in G# minor, so it should be **F# major** only in harmonic or melodic minor.

In G# natural minor, the seventh is F#, so F# chord would be **F# diminished**, not major.

Let's double-check:

G# natural minor: G# A# B C# D# E F#

So F# chord: F#, A, C#

A natural, not A#.

But our **F#6** has **A#**, which is **Bb** — not in the key.

F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#

A# is the third of the chord, so this is a **major chord**, not diminished.

So F# major exists, which requires A#.

A# is natural in **G# harmonic minor**?

**G# harmonic minor**:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G)

So notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, G

So A# is present, yes.

Now chord on F#: F#, A#, C#, E

That’s **F# minor** — because A# is the minor third.

But we have **F#6**, which is **F# major 6th chord = F#, A#, C#, D#**

But in G# harmonic minor, the C note is **C#**, so F# chord would be:
- F#, A#, C#
- A# to C# is minor third (3 semitones), so **F# minor triad**

But F#6 is **F# major** with sixth — F#–A#–C#–D#

A# to C# is minor third (3 semitons), so that would be **F# minor 6th**, not F#6.

**F#6** typically means F# major triad with 6th: F#, A#, C##, D#

Wait! Critical mistake.

**F#6 chord** is:
- F# (root)
- A# (major third)
- C# (perfect fifth)
- D# (sixth)

No. In standard chord notation, **F#6** = F# + A# + C# + D#

But A# to C# is an **augmented second** in terms of scale, but in equal temperament, it's 3 semitones = minor third.

So F#–A#–C#: A# is 3 semitones above F#, C# is 4 above A#, so F#–A#–C# = F# minor triad.

So **F#m6**, not F#6.

But in notation, **F#6** implies **F# major 6th**, which is:
- F#, A#, C##, D#

C## = D

So F#6 = F#, A#, D, D#

That's a different chord.

But in practice, in rock/pop, "F#6" is often used loosely to mean F# add9 or something, but strictly, F#6 is F# major with 6th: F#, A#, D, D#

But we had **A# in the chord**, not D natural.

So if the chord has **A#**, it's not possible to be F#6 unless it's F# major.

Let's assume that "F#6" here means **F# add13** or mislabeled F#m6.

But likely, the chord is **F# with A#, C#, D#**, and A# is intended as the **third**, so it's **F# minor 6th (F#m6)**.

In many contexts, "F#6" is used to mean F#m6.

Alternatively, in the key of G#, **F#** can be the **VII chord**, which is **F# diminished** in natural minor, but if it's **major**, it might be borrowed.

But earlier, we see that in **G# natural minor**, the VI chord is **E major**, which we have.

And III is **B major**, which we have.

The only non-diatonic chords are:
- Bm(b5)/G# — has D natural
- F#6 — has A#? Wait no — in F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#, A# is natural in G# minor (2nd degree), so yes, A# is in the key.

But the F# triad in G# minor is **F# diminished**: F#, A, C#

But this chord has **A#**, not A.

A# is the second scale degree.

So F# + A# = F# to A# is **minor third**, so the chord is **F# minor**, not diminished.

So F#m = F#, A#, C#

C# is the fifth — C# is the 4th degree of G# minor, so yes.

So F#m = F#, A#, C#

Then add D# = 6th — D# is 5th scale degree.

So F#m6 = F#, A#, C#, D# — all notes are in **G# natural minor**.

Yes! G# natural minor has:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So:
- F#: F#, A#, C# — wait, A# is correct, but **F# to A# is minor third**, so the chord is **F# minor**, but we need to see its quality.

F# + A# = minor third (3 semitones)
A# + C# = minor third again? A# to C# is 3 semitones — yes, Bb to C# is major third? Let's calculate:

A# = 11, C# = 1, difference: 2 semitones? No.

Equal temperament:
- F# = 6
- A# = 10
- C# = 1
So F# to A# = 4 semitones = major third
A# to C# = 3 semitones = minor third
F# to C# = 7 semitones = perfect fifth

So F#, A#, C# = F# major triad.

Yes! A# is the major third above F#.

F# to A# is 4 semitones = major third.

So F#6 = F#–A#–C#–D#
- Major triad (F#)
- Sixth = D#

D# is the major sixth from F#.

And in G# natural minor, the VII chord is **F# diminished**, but this is **F# major**.

So it's not diatonic.

But in **G# harmonic minor**, the notes are:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G)

So no A# in the scale as a note above F#.

The chord on the seventh degree would be F##–A#–C#, which is E# dim, not helpful.

The chord on F# is not built.

But the **V chord** in G# minor is D# – F## – A# = D# augmented.

Not matching.

So F# major is not in G# minor.

But earlier, E major is the VI chord, B major is III chord — both are in G# natural minor.

F# major is **not** in G# natural minor; the seventh degree chord is diminished.

So F#6 (major) is chromatic.

Similarly, Bm(b5)/G# has D natural, not in key.

But let’s notice a pattern.

Many of the chords fit **G# Aeolian (natural minor)**:
- G#m = i
- E = VI
- B = III
- F# = should be viio, but we have it as major

But if we allow for **raised VII chord**, sometimes seen.

But F#6 is major.

Another idea: mode?

Let's list the chords again with Roman numerals assuming G# minor:
- G#m = i
- E/G# = VI
- B/F# = III
- Bm(b5)/G# = ? (not diatonic)
- F#6 = VII (but major, not diminished)

Wait — in **G# Dorian**, the major chords on III and VI and VII?

G# Dorian: from F# major
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Chords:
- i: G#m
- ii: A#m
- III: B major
- IV: C# major
- v: D#m
- VI: E minor
- VII: F# major

But we have **E major**, not E minor.

So VI is major, but in Dorian, it's minor.

So not Dorian.

Could be **G# minor with modal mixture**, borrowing from other modes.

But simplest explanation is: the key is **G# minor**, and the mode is **Aeolian**, with some chromatic alterations:
- F#6 = major VI or VII? F# is VII, but we want it major

In many rock/pop ballads, the VII chord is made major for a stronger pull.

Similarly, the Bm(b5)/G# might be a chromatic passing chord.

But let's look at the bass motion:
- G# - G# - G# - G#
- G# - G# - F# - G#
- G# - G# - G# - G#
- G# - G# - F# - G#

So mostly G# in bass, with F# appearing.

The chord Bm(b5)/G# has G# bass and B, D, F#

So the upper structure is B–D–F# = B diminished or Bm(b5)

B–D–F# = B diminished would be B–D–F, but F# is not F.

B–D–F# = minor third + minor third = diminished, but D to F# is major third.

B to D = m3, D to F# = M3, so it's Bm6 with fifth missing? No.

B–D–F# = B D F# = B minor + major sixth, so Bm6, but no sixth.

Intervals:
- B–D: minor third
- D–F#: major third
So it's a first inversion of G#m7(b5): G#–B–D–F#

Yes! So the chord is **G#m7(b5)**, or **G#ø**

And it's a passing chord between G#m and F#6.

So progression is:
G#m - G#m - E/G# - E/G#
G#m - G#m - B/F# - G#ø
G#m - G#m - E/G# - E/G#
G#m - G#m - F#6 - G#m

So the function:
- G#ø is iiø in F# minor, but here it's acting as a passing chord.
- F#6 is VII major, common in rock to make it major.

So despite the chromaticisms, the tonic is clearly G#m, and the chords E, B, F# are all diatonic to the key of **G# natural minor** except for the quality of F# and the added chord.

But E major is VI, B major is III, F# should be diminished, but is major, so likely **borrowed** or a common rock alteration.

The key is **G# minor (Aeolian mode)**.

The Bm(b5)/G# is a chromatic passing chord to add motion.

### Final Answer:
- **Key: G# minor**
- **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**

With chromatic elements:
- F#6 is a major VII chord (non-diatonic, but common)
- G#ø (written as Bm(b5)/G#) is a chromatic passing chord or borrowed from another mode.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord sequence: G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to list out all the chords without the slashes to see the root notes. The slashes indicate inversions or bass notes, so the actual chord quality is what matters for key determination. So let's see:

- G#m (G# minor)
- E/G# (this is E major with G# in the bass, so it's still E major)
- B/F# (B major with F# bass, so B major)
- Bm(b5)/G# (B half-diminished with G# bass, so Bm7b5)
- F#6 (F# major with added 6th, but usually F#6 is F# A# C# D#)

Wait, actually, when checking the key, we should consider the root notes of each chord, ignoring the inversions. So E/G# is still an E chord, just inverted. B/F# is B major, and Bm(b5)/G# is B half-diminished. F#6 is F#6 chord. So the root notes are: G#, E, B, B, G#, F#.

Let me list all chords by their root:

1. G#m
2. G#m
3. E (since E/G# is E major with G# bass, but the chord is E)
4. E
5. G#m
6. G#m
7. B (B/F# is B major)
8. Bm(b5) (B half-diminished)
9. G#m
10. G#m
11. E
12. E
13. G#m
14. G#m
15. F#6
16. G#m

So the main chords are G#m, E major, B major, Bm(b5), F#6.

Now, considering the key. Let's look at the notes in each chord.

G#m: G#, B, D#

E major: E, G#, B

B major: B, D#, F##

Wait, B major would be B, D#, F#? Wait, B major is B, D#, F#? No, standard B major is B, D#, F#? Let me check:

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So chords:

I: B, D#, F# → yes, B major is B-D#-F#.

But in the chord list, there's B major. Then there's Bm(b5), which is B, D, F (since half-diminished is minor with flat 5). Wait, half-diminished chord is minor 7 flat 5. So Bm(b5) would be B, D, F, but actually, sometimes written as Bm7b5, which is B, D, F, A. Wait, no, B half-diminished is B-D-F-A.

But in the chord, it's Bm(b5)/G#, so the bass is G#, but the chord is Bm(b5). So the chord tones are B, D, F.

Now looking at F#6. F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#. Because F# major is F#, A#, C#, and adding 6th would be D# (since F# scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#). So F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#.

Now let's see which key has all these chords. Let's see the common key. Let's consider the key of D# major? Or maybe E major? But G#m is the relative minor of B major. Let's check.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Chords in B major:

I: B

ii: C#m

iii: D#m

IV: E

V: F#m? Wait no, in B major, the V chord is F# major? Wait, B major scale:

Tonic: B

Supertonic: C# minor

Mediant: D# minor

Subdominant: E major

Dominant: F# major

Submediant: G# minor

Leading tone: A# diminished

Wait, so in B major, the chords are:

I: B

ii: C#m

iii: D#m

IV: E

V: F#

vi: G#m

vii°: A#°

So, looking at the chords in the sequence: G#m (vi), E (IV), B (I), F# (V), and also Bm(b5) – but in B major, the vii° chord is A#°, not Bm(b5). Bm(b5) would be B-D-F, which is not in B major. In B major, the chord on B is major, so B major chord is B-D#-F#. So Bm(b5) would be a chord that's not diatonic to B major.

Wait, but Bm(b5) is half-diminished. Let's see: in the key of D# minor? Wait, maybe the key is G# minor?

G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Chords in G# minor:

i: G#m

ii°: A#°

III: B major

IV: C#m

v: D#m

vi: E

vii: F# major

Wait, in natural minor, the v chord is minor, but sometimes harmonic minor is used to make it major. Let's check.

G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So the chords:

i: G#m

ii°: A#° (A#, C#, E)

III: B major (B, D#, F#)

IV: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major? Wait, E major? E in G# minor scale: E, G#, B? Wait, the notes of G# minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So E is the 6th degree, so the chord would be E minor? Wait, no. Let's list the scale degrees:

1: G#

2: A#

3: B

4: C#

5: D#

6: E

7: F#

So the chords for G# minor (natural minor):

i: G#m (G#, B, D#)

ii°: A#dim (A#, C#, E)

III: B major (B, D#, F#) – B is the 3rd scale degree, so major chord.

IV: C#m (C#, E, G#)

v: D#m (D#, F#, A#) – but wait, D# minor would be D#, F#, A#?

But the scale notes are D#, then F# (which is 7th note?), wait the 5th degree is D#, so chord on 5th is D#, F#, A#. Yes, that's D#m.

vi: E minor (E, G#, B)

vii°: F#° (F#, A#, C#) – but F# ° would be F#, A#, C#.

But the scale has 7: F#, which is the leading tone, so chord on 7th would be F#dim (F#, A#, C#).

Wait, so in G# natural minor, the chords are:

i: G#m

ii°: A#°

III: B maj

IV: C#m

v: D#m

vi: E min

vii°: F#°

But the given chords include F#6. F#6 would be F#, A#, C#, D#. Wait, in G# minor, can we get an F#6?

F# major chord in G# minor would be part of the natural minor, but F# is the vii° which is diminished. So F# major isn't in G# minor natural. However, sometimes in harmonic minor, the seventh degree is raised to make it a major chord. So harmonic minor of G# would have F# natural as the 7th degree raised to F## (G), but no. Wait, harmonic minor raises the 7th degree to create a leading tone. So G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (which is G), so then the vii° chord becomes F## major? Wait, no. Let's see.

G# harmonic minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G) because raised the 7th. So chords:

i: G#m (G#, B, D#)

ii°: A#° (A#, C#, E)

III+: B augmented? Wait, no.

Wait, G# harmonic minor: notes G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

So chords:

i: G#m (G#, B, D#)

ii°: A#° (A#, C#, E)

III: B augmented (B, D#, F##)

IV: C#m (C#, E, G#)

v: D#m (D#, F##, A#) – wait, D#m would be D#, F##, A#?

But F## is G natural.

v (minor) in harmonic minor is minor, but sometimes the V chord in harmonic minor is major because the 7th is raised. Wait, the V chord in minor is usually major in harmonic minor. So for G# minor harmonic:

V chord would be D# major? D# major would be D#, F##, A#. Yes.

And the vii chord is F## major (F##, A#, C#). But F## is G natural.

But in the chord list here, there's an F#6. F#6 would be F#, A#, C#, D#. But if the key were in harmonic minor, the V chord is D# major, but we have F# major chord. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is E major?

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

Chords:

I: E

ii: F#m

iii: G#m

IV: A

V: B

vi: C#m

vii°: D#°

So chords in E major: E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#°.

In this key, G#m is the iii chord. But let's check the given chords: G#m (iii), E (I), B (V), F#6. Wait, F#6 is not in E major. Because in E major, F# is the ii chord, which is F#m. So F#6 chord would involve notes F#, A#, C#, D#. But in E major, the notes are E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So F# major would not be diatonic to E major scale. Because E major has F# as root, but the chord would have F#, A#, C##? No. Let's check:

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

F# major chord would need notes F#, A#, C#. But in E major scale, the third of F# would be A#, but A# isn't in E major. E major has A natural. So the third of F# chord would be A#, which is not part of E major scale (since E major has A natural). So F# major chord is not diatonic to E major.

Hmm.

Another possibility: key of G# minor, but with some harmonic elements. Let's see the chords we have:

- G#m (i chord)

- E (what is E in G# minor? In natural minor, vi chord is E minor. But in the sequence, it's E major. So E major chord. So E major in G# minor would be from harmonic minor?

In G# harmonic minor, the scale is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G). Wait, but then E is the 6th degree. In harmonic minor, the 6th degree remains natural, so E natural. So chord on the 6th degree (E) would be Em for harmonic minor? Wait, no. Let's check the chords for G# harmonic minor.

G# harmonic minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G)

Chords:

i: G#m (G#, B, D#)

ii°: A#° (A#, C#, E)

III+: B augmented (B, D#, F##)

IV: C#m (C#, E, G#)

v: D#m (D#, F##, A#) – but wait, D# as root, F## (G), A#.

V: D# major (D#, F##, A#) – but if we take V chord here. Wait, usually in minor keys, the V chord is made major by raising the 7th. So for G# harmonic minor, the V chord is D# major.

vi: E°? No. vi chord: E, G#, B. But in harmonic minor scale, E is natural. So E, G#, B – that's E minor. But in harmonic minor, the vi chord would be Em. However, sometimes it's E major? Not necessarily.

vii: F##+ (F##, A#, C#), but that's augmented.

But the problem is we have an E major chord here. So in G# minor harmonic, the E chord would be minor (E, G#, B), but here they have E major which is E, G#, B#? Wait E major would be E, G#, B#. But in G# harmonic minor scale, the 7th degree is raised to F## (which is G), but the third of the E chord would be G#, which is in the scale, but the 5th is B, which is also in the scale (the B is the 3rd degree of G# minor scale). Wait, G# harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

So E to B is a fifth? E, B is a fifth. But E major is E, G#, B#. No, E major is E, G#, B#. Wait, G# is a major third for E. But in G# minor scale, we have G# as the tonic, so in the scale, G# is present. So E major chord would have E (root), G# (major third), B# (fifth? No, fifth of E is B, which is natural. Wait standard E major is E, G#, B. Yes. So E major chord has B, not B#. So in the key of G# minor, does B exist? Yes. B is the 3rd degree of G# minor scale. So in G# minor natural: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So E is the 6th degree. Let's check what chord E would be in G# minor natural: the E chord would use the notes from the scale. E, G#, B. Yes! So that's E minor chord? No. E minor chord is E, G, B. Wait, wait. Wait, hold on.

Wait, E major is E, G#, B; E minor is E, G, B. So if we have an E chord, in G# minor natural scale, the notes present are E, G#, B. So that's E major? Because the third is G# (major third). So in G# natural minor scale, the chord built on the 6th degree (E) would be E major? Because the scale has:

Degree 6: E

Third in the chord: G# (which is the tonic note), which is a major third above E. And fifth: B. So yes, E major chord in G# natural minor scale. But wait, in natural minor scale, the 6th chord is usually minor? Wait no, no. Wait the natural minor scale:

For example, A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Chords:

i: Am

ii°: B°

III: C

iv: Dm

v: Em

VI: F

vii°: G°

Wait, so the VI chord is major. So yes, in A natural minor, the VI chord is F major. Similarly, in G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So scale degrees:

1 G#

2 A#

3 B

4 C#

5 D#

6 E

7 F#

So chord on VI (6th degree): E. The chord would be E, G#, B. Since G# is part of the scale (it's the tonic), and B is the 3rd scale degree. So E, G#, B. That's E major. Because E to G# is a major third. So yes, in G# natural minor, the VI chord is E major.

Similarly, the V chord in natural minor would be a minor chord: D# minor, but sometimes raised to V major (D# major) in harmonic minor. But in natural minor, V chord is minor.

But looking at the sequence here: the chords include B major. What's B in G# minor? The III chord. In natural minor, iii chord is minor? No. Let's check.

Chord built on III (B) in G# minor scale: B, D#, F#. Because B is third scale degree. Scale degrees above B: C#, D#, D# is fourth, so chord B, D#, F#. B to D# is major third, D# to F# is minor third, so B major chord. Yes! So in G# natural minor:

i: G#m

ii°: A#°

III: B major

IV: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major

vii°: F#°

Yes. So B major is a diatonic chord to G# natural minor (III chord). Also, E major is VI. So the chords we have:

G#m (i), E (VI), B (III), and also Bm(b5) – wait, Bm(b5) is B half-diminished. B half-diminished is B, D, F. Wait, but in G# minor scale, we have B, D#, F#. So if Bm(b5), that would need D natural, but in G# minor natural, D# is present. So D natural would be non-diatonic. Hmm. So Bm(b5) would imply D natural, but G# minor scale has D#. So unless we're using a variation.

Also, we have F#6. F#6 usually is F# A# C# D#. So F#, A#, C#, D#.

In G# natural minor scale: the notes are G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So F# is the 7th degree. So F#6 would include F#, A#, C#, D#. But what's in the scale? F# is present. A# is present (2nd scale degree), C# (4th), D# (5th). So yes, F#6 chord would be diatonic to G# minor. Because F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D# – all present in G# minor.

Wait, but F#6 chord would normally have a 6th, which for F# is D# (since the scale of F# major has D# as sixth? Wait, F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#. But F#6 chord is F#, A#, C#, D#. So yes, that's the same as F# major chord with added sixth. And all those notes are in G# minor scale: F# (from scale), A# (scale), C# (scale), D# (scale).

So G# minor natural has all the notes from all the chords.

Let's check all chords:

- G#m: G#, B, D# → yes.

- E/G#: same as E major (E, G#, B) → yes.

- B/F#: B major (B, D#, F#) → in G# minor: yes.

- Bm(b5)/G#: chord is B half-diminished (B, D, F). Wait, but in G# minor scale, we have D# and F# – we don't have D natural or F natural. So Bm(b5) would be B, D, F. But D and F are not in G# minor natural scale. The scale has D# and F#.

So that's a problem. Unless the Bm(b5) is actually a different chord. Wait, maybe there's a typo? Or maybe harmonic minor? Let's check.

If it's G# harmonic minor, the scale would be G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

F## is G natural. So chord on B would be B, D#, F##. So B major again. But Bm(b5) would need B, D, F – which isn't there.

Alternatively, maybe D is natural, but that's not in either natural or harmonic minor. So perhaps the Bm(b5) is actually Bm7b5, which is B, D, F, A. But that's a bit tricky.

Wait, but maybe in this context, the Bm(b5)/G# could be considered as a secondary function. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is B major. Wait earlier thought: in B major, the chords are I=B, ii=C#m, iii=D#m, IV=E, V=F#, vi=G#m. But in B major, the chords are:

B major: B, D#, F#

C# minor: C#, E, G#

D# minor: D#, F#, A#

E major: E, G#, B

F# major: F#, A#, C#

G# minor: G#, B, D#

A# diminished: A#, C#, E

Now, what about F#6? In B major scale, F# major chord would be F#, A#, C#. Adding 6th? The sixth would be D#, which is present. So F#6 would be F#, A#, C#, D# → all in B major scale. Yes.

Now, Bm(b5)/G#: B half-diminished chord. In B major scale, what's B chord? B major. So Bm(b5) would normally not be in B major. Bm is not diatonic. But Bm(b5) would have B, D, F – which isn't in B major.

Wait, but looking at the chords given:

We have B/F# → B major. Then Bm(b5)/G#. If we consider the Bm(b5), the root is B, but minor with flat fifth. So B, D, F.

But in B major scale, there is no D natural or F natural. So that's not diatonic. Hmm.

Wait, but if we are in B major, the chord Bm(b5) would not be diatonic. So perhaps the key is not B major.

Let's reconsider the G# minor idea. The only problem is the Bm(b5) chord. Maybe there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the chord labeled Bm(b5)/G# is actually something else. Let's break down the chord Bm(b5)/G#.

Bm(b5) means B minor flat 5, which is also called B half-diminished. The standard half-diminished is Bm7b5: B, D, F, A. So root B, minor 3rd (D), diminished 5th (F), minor 7th (A). But the slash G# means bass is G#.

But G# is part of what chords? If the chord is Bm(b5)/G#, the bass is G#, so the notes are G# as bass, then Bm(b5) which would be B, D, F. So all notes: G#, B, D, F. But a seventh chord with bass on G# would be Bm7b5 first inversion.

But in G# natural minor, the scale has G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So the notes G#, B, D#, F#. But here, the chord includes D natural and F natural? Wait, D#/D natural confusion.

Wait, in standard tuning, the difference between D and D# is important. Let's confirm:

If in the scale, D# is present, then D natural would be foreign. So if the chord is Bm(b5) = B, D (natural), F (natural), then in G# minor natural scale, there is no D natural or F natural. So that chord would not be diatonic. But we have all the chords including G#m, E major (VI), B major (III), and F#6. But the Bm(b5) doesn't fit.

But wait, the chord Bm(b5)/G# could be written as Bm♭5/G# which is the same as Bm7b5 first inversion (G# in bass). Alternatively, sometimes the notation Bm(b5) is shorthand for half-diminished.

But perhaps in this context, the chord is actually a B half-diminished, which in the context of G# minor could be a ii chord in some mode. Wait, but not sure.

Another angle: let's look at the chords and see the tonic.

Most sequences tend to rest on the i chord. Here, G#m is the first chord and repeated a lot. The sequence is:

G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m

So it starts and ends with G#m. That suggests G#m is the tonic chord. So key is probably G# minor.

Now, the B major chord is the III chord in G# minor (yes, that's a common chord in minor key), E major is VI chord, F#6 is a chord where F# is the 7th degree chord but with added 6th. Wait, in G# minor, the vii chord is F#°, but F#6 could be a major chord. Wait, no, the diatonic F#7 would be diminished or something else. Maybe F#6 is a borrowed chord.

Alternatively, maybe it's G# harmonic minor where the v chord is made major. But in G# harmonic minor, the chord on D# (5th degree) would be D# major. But F#6 – F# being the raised 7th? Wait, no. In G# harmonic minor, the 7th degree is raised to F## (G natural). So F## major would be the vii chord. But F#6 has F#, which is a natural F# in standard tuning.

Wait, if it's G# natural minor, then the VII chord is F# dim. But F#6 chord would be F# major with added 6th. So F# major isn't diatonic. Unless it's a chromatic chord.

But wait, the F#6 chord: F#, A#, C#, D#. If we consider the key of G# minor, all those notes are present. Because in G# natural minor, the scale has F#? Wait no.

Wait G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Yes! Wait, natural minor scale has the 7th degree as F#, not raised. So in G# natural minor, the 7th scale degree is F#. So the chord built on the vii (7th degree) is F# diminished, which is F#, A, C#. But F# diminished chord is F#, A, C. Wait, F# diminished triad is F#, A, C? Wait no: diminished triad is root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th. So F# minor third is A (which is minor third), but F# to A is minor third? Let's see:

F# to A: F# is first, G#=1, A=2nd, so F# to A is minor third. Yes. Then A to C is minor third, so interval to C is minor third. So F# diminished triad is F#, A, C. But in the scale of G# natural minor, the notes are G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. Wait! Wait, this is critical. The G# natural minor scale has F# as the 7th degree, but the third degree is B, which is natural B, not B#. So let's list all the notes of G# natural minor:

G# (1), A# (2), B (3), C# (4), D# (5), E (6), F# (7).

Ah! So F# is the 7th note. Now, the vii° chord (diminished triad) would be F# diminished triad. Let's build it on F#:

Root: F#

Minor third: A (F# to A is minor third? F# to G#=1, G# to A=whole step? Wait, no.

Wait intervals:

F# to G# is whole step.

G# to A is whole step? Wait F# to G# (minor second?), no.

Wait F# up to G:

F# to G is half step.

G to G# is half step.

Wait F# to A is actually major third. Because:

F# - G - G# - A ⇒ F# to A is three half steps (F#-G, G-G#, G#-A) so three half steps = minor third? Wait no.

Wait, F# to A:

The note names: F#, G, G#, A. So F# to G is 1 half step, G to G# is another, G# to A is half step. Total 3 half steps. Yes, minor third. Then A to C is minor third (A to B is 2 half steps, B to C is half step → total 3 half steps), so diminished fifth. So the diminished triad for F# would be F#, A, C.

But in the G# natural minor scale, the scale has F# (7th), but also A# (2nd), B (3rd), C# (4th), etc. So A natural? Wait, the G# natural minor scale doesn't have A natural. It has A# as the second note. So scale notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Therefore, the note A natural is not present in G# natural minor scale. So the vii° chord would be F#, A, C – but A natural and C natural are not in the scale. Because scale has A# and C#. So it's impossible to have A or C natural in G# natural minor.

Wait, that's a critical mistake I made earlier! In G# natural minor scale:

The scale degrees:

1. G#

2. A#

3. B

4. C#

5. D#

6. E

7. F#

So all the accidentals are sharps on the 2nd, 4th, 5th degrees, except the 7th. So the note A natural isn't present; it's A#.

So when we build a chord on F# (7th degree), the notes should be F#, A# (minor third?), wait let's see.

F# root, then minor third above F# is A.

But scale has A# instead of A. So that would be not in scale. So the vii° chord in natural minor isn't diatonic? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, actually, no. In a natural minor scale, the vii° chord is built using the scale notes. Let's build the chord on 7th degree of G# natural minor:

7th degree: F#

Chord: F#, A (but scale has A#, not A), so that's a problem.

Wait, no! This is where I'm making a mistake. The diatonic chord built on the 7th degree must use only the notes from the scale. So for G# natural minor:

Scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So to build a triad on F# (the 7th note):

- Root: F#

- 3rd: next scale degree is G#? No. Wait, a triad built on F# would take every other note starting from F# in the scale.

So scale degrees: 7, 1, 2. So F# (root), G# (3rd), A# (5th).

Wait, interval from F# to G# is major second (whole step), then G# to A# is major second. So chord F#, G#, A#. That would be F# major chord? No: F# to G# is major second, not a third. Wait, the third above F# should be F# + 4 half steps (major third), or + 3 for minor third.

F# to A: 3 half steps (minor third), but scale has A# instead of A. So between the scale notes, from F# (7th), the next scale note is G# (1st), then A# (2nd). So building the chord on F#:

Root: F#

3rd: A# (since the next note after F# is G# (minor second), then A# (major third above F#)

Pent: C# (perfect fifth).

Wait: F# to A# is a major third (4 half steps: F#-G, G-G#, G#-A, A-A#; total 4 steps). Yes. And F# to C# is a perfect fifth (7 half steps). So F#, A#, C# → this is an A# diminished chord? F#-A#-C#.

Wait A# is the minor third? No. F# to A# is major third. A# to C# is minor third. So F# major triad: yes. Wait, F#, A#, C#. Is that a major chord? F# to A# is major third, A# to C# is minor third, so F# major triad? No. Wait F# major chord is F#, A#, C#. Yes. Because F# major: F#, A#, C#.

Yes. So in G# natural minor scale, building a triad on the 7th degree (F#), we get F# major triad because the scale has A# and C# in it. But wait: the scale is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So starting at F#:

Root: F#

2nd: G# (next)

3rd: A#

4th: B

5th: C#

So building a triad: root F#, third A#, fifth C#.

Yes, so that's an F# major chord. Because F#, A#, C#.

Ah! So my mistake earlier was thinking the vii chord in minor is diminished, but that's only in the harmonic minor usually, but in natural minor, the vii chord is actually major. Because for example in A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Chord on G (vii): G, B, D → G major? Wait G major chord in A minor is G, B, D.

Yes! In A natural minor, the vii chord is G major. So that's correct. So in natural minor scale, the vii chord is major. Not diminished. The diminished chord is for harmonic minor or melodic minor.

So for G# natural minor: vii chord is F# major.

Similarly, V chord would be D# minor. Because D# (5th), F# (major second), A# (minor third), etc. Wait chord on V (5th degree):

Root D#, third F#, fifth A# (in scale: D#, E, F#, G#, B? Wait scale: D# (5), E (6), F# (7), G# (1), A# (2). So building on D#:

root D#, third F# (next note is E after D#? Scale order: G# A# B C# D# E F#. So after D# comes E, F#.

So triad on D#: D#, F#, A#. D# to F# is major third (4 half steps), F# to A# is major third (another 4 half steps), so that's a diminished triad? No.

Wait D# to F# is 3 half steps (D#-E, E-F, F-F# → three half steps ⇒ minor third). F# to A# is four half steps (F#-G, G-G#, G#-A, A-A# → 4 half steps? No, F# to G is 1, G to G# 2, G# to A is 3, A to A# is 4. Yes. So F# to A# is major third. So D# minor triad: D# (root), F# (minor third), A# (perfect fifth). Yes! So D# minor chord in G# minor is diatonic.

Ah, okay. So back to G# natural minor:

- i: G#m: G#, B, D# (because root G#, minor third B: G# to B is 4 half steps? No: G# to A=1, A to A#=2, A# to B=3. So yes, minor third)

Wait G# to B: G#, A, A#, B – that's G# to A is half step, A to A# is half step, A# to B is half step. So 3 half steps, minor third. Yes. Then B to D# is major third (B to C, C to C#, C# to D, D to D# – no. B to C is 1, C to C# is 2, C# to D is 3, D to D# is 4. So B to D# is major third. So G#m chord has G#, B, D# ⇒ correct minor triad.

- ii°: A#° – A#, C#, E (A# to C# is minor third? A# to C: 2 steps, C to C# is third. Wait A# to C# is 4 half steps (A#-B, B-C, C-C# → three half steps?), wait no:

A# to B: 1

B to C: 2

C to C#: 3 ⇒ so A# to C# is minor third. Then C# to E: minor third? C# to D: 1, D to D#: 2, D# to E: 3 ⇒ yes, minor third. So A#° is A#, C#, E – diminished triad.

- III: B major chord: B, D#, F# (B to D# is major third, D# to F# major third? No, D# to F# is minor third. Wait B to D# is major third (4 half steps), D# to F# is 3 half steps ⇒ minor third. So B, D#, F# is B major chord? No. B major chord: B, D#, F## (G). Wait no. B major is B, D#, F#? Wait no! B major's fifth is F#. Wait standard B major: B, D#, F#.

Yes! Because B to F# is a perfect fifth. So yes. So B major chord: B, D#, F#.

Yes. But in G# natural minor scale, F# is present. So yes, B major triad is diatonic.

- IV: C#m: C#, E, G#

- v: D#m: D#, F#, A#

- VI: E major chord: E, G#, B. Because E to G# is major third (E - F, F - F#, F# - G, G - G# → 4 half steps), G# to B is minor third. So yes.

- vii: F# major: F#, A#, C#

Because F#, A#, C# is F# major.

So all the chords in the sequence fit into G# natural minor:

- G#m (i)

- E/G# → E major (VI), bass G# but chord still VI.

- B/F# → B major (III), bass F#.

- F#6 → F# major with added 6th. F#6 would be F#, A#, C#, D#. But in scale D# is present. Wait F#6 chord: F#, A#, C#, D#. Yes, all notes in G# minor scale.

So F#6 chord – yes, F#, A#, C#, D#.

Now the problematic chord: Bm(b5)/G#. What's that? Bm(b5) is B minor flat fifth. Typically written as Bø or Bm7b5. Which is B, D, F, A. But wait, Bm(b5) usually means B, D, F. Half-diminished chord is minor 7th flat 5: so B, D, F, A. But in the chord notation Bm(b5)/G# → bass G#, so notes G#, B, D, F.

But in G# natural minor scale, do we have D natural? No. The scale has D#. It has D#, not D natural. Similarly, F natural? Scale has F#, not F natural.

So Bm(b5)/G# implies notes G#, B, D, F – but those D and F naturals are not in the G# minor scale. So this seems like a non-diatonic chord. But why is it there?

Wait, unless the Bm(b5) chord is actually something else. Or maybe it's a typo, like B major 7b5 or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the chord is Bm7b5 with bass G#, which would be a different function. Maybe Bm7b5 in G# minor is a iiø chord for a V chord. In minor keys, often the iiø7 chord leads to a V chord.

Wait, for example, in Dm key, iiø7 is Em7b5. But here, in G# minor, perhaps there is a iiø chord.

Wait the diatonic ii chord in G# natural minor is A#°, a diminished triad. But with seventh?

In G# natural minor scale, ii chord is A#°. But if using seventh, it would be A#m7b5? No.

Wait the chord on II (the second scale degree) would be A#, C#, E. Which is A#°. If we add the seventh, it would be A#, C#, E, G# → A#m7b5? Because A# to C# is minor third, C# to E is minor third, so A#°, then E to G# is also minor third. Yes, so A#m7b5 is the iiø7 in the minor scale.

But here the chord is Bm(b5)/G#. So that's Bm7b5. B is third degree. So iiiø7?

Not sure. But if the scale is G# natural minor, the diatonic iii chord is B major. So a Bm7b5 doesn't fit.

Unless it's a borrowed chord from another mode.

Another possibility: maybe the key is D# minor? But D# minor would be similar to G# minor.

Alternatively, let's check the mode. If the tonic is G#m, it's probably minor mode, and depending on other chords, but natural minor.

But this Bm(b5) chord is still confusing. Let's see if there's a different perspective.

Maybe the Bm(b5) is actually a typo for B7b5 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's Bm7b5 but in the context of the key.

Wait, let's consider the chord Bm7b5. If G# is the bass, so the chord would have G# as the bass note. Bm7b5 = B, D, F, A. So Bm7b5 with G# bass is G#, B, D, F, A – which is a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe it's intended to be a G#m chord with some passing tones? Not sure.

Wait another angle: let's list all the notes present across the chords.

G#m = G#, B, D#

E major = E, G#, B

B major = B, D#, F#

F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#

Bm(b5)/G# = B, D, F (with G# bass, so notes G#, B, D, F)

So all of these chords:

- G#m: G#, B, D#

- E: E, G#, B

- B: B, D#, F#

- F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

- Bm(b5)/G#: G#, B, D, F

So the notes include:

G#, B, D#, F#, E, A#, C#, D natural, F natural.

Wait, D natural and F natural are not part of G# minor scale. If there are D natural and F natural, then the key might be different.

Wait perhaps the key is E major? Earlier thought about E major.

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

But in the chord list, we have Bm(b5)/G# → which implies D and F naturals, which are not in E major scale (E major has D#).

E major has A natural, so F# as dominant, but still.

Wait in E major:

- G#m is iii chord.

- E is I

- B is V

- F# is vii° or perhaps F# major – no, F# major chord in E major: F#, A#, C#.

- Bm(b5) would have B, D, F – but D in E major is D#.

So again D natural is foreign.

Another option: D# major? Unlikely. Or perhaps it's a mix of modes.

Wait, what's the F#6 chord? F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#. If the key is G# minor, but with a raised sixth chord or something. But if chord F#6 is diatonic, but the Bm(b5) is not.

Alternatively, maybe the Bm(b5)/G# is actually a common chord. Wait, sometimes chords are written with slash notation for pedal tones or something.

Wait, Bm(b5)/G# might actually be a G#-bass chord where the top notes are B, D, F. But what chord is that?

G#, B, D, F. Let's see:

G# to B: major second? G# to A is half step, A to B is whole, so total minor third. So G# to B is minor third. B to D is minor third. D to F is minor third. So this is a diminished seventh chord. Diminished 7th chord: G#°7.

Yes! G#, B, D, F → G# diminished seventh. But wait, G# to B is minor third, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, F to G# is minor third. Yes, that's a diminished seventh chord. So G#dim7.

But the chord was labeled as Bm(b5)/G# → so bass G#, but the chord is Bm(b5). But physically, the notes would be G# (bass), B, D, F.

And G#dim7 is the same as D°7, etc., because diminished seventh is symmetrical.

So perhaps the chord is actually G#dim7, but written as Bm(b5)/G#. Which is a common way to write it.

Because Bm(b5)/G# = B half-diminished with G# bass. But B half-diminished is B, D, F, A. But here they wrote Bm(b5)/G#, but the notes would be G#, B, D, F. Which is G#dim7. Because B half-diminished would have A as the seventh, but if there's no A in the notes, then it's not half-diminished, but rather G#dim7.

Ah! So maybe the chord was mislabeled. Or perhaps the slash is indicating the bass, but the actual chord is G#dim7. Or maybe it's B diminished (B°), which would be B, D, F.

B° includes B, D, F. Adding G# bass → B°/G# which would be G#, B, D, F. Yes. Or B half-diminished would be B, D, F, A, but if there's no A, it's diminished.

So perhaps the chord is B°/G# or G#dim7.

Either way, the chord G#dim7 would be diatonic to the key of D# minor or something. Wait, where is G#dim7 diatonic?

Diminished seventh chords usually arise from the leading tone. In G# minor, the vii°7 would be F#dim7.

F#dim7: F#, A, C, Eb. Not sure.

Wait, let's see: G#dim7 chord consists of G#, B, D, F – all minor thirds. In G# minor scale, this uses non-diatonic notes (D and F), but if it's G# natural minor scale has D# and F#, so D natural and F natural are non-diatonic.

However, in the key of A minor, G#dim7 is a common chord. Or in other keys.

Alternatively, in D# minor, but maybe it's too complicated.

Another approach: the presence of F#6 and G#m and B major.

But let's check what key has G#m as tonic and includes all these chords.

Perhaps the presence of D natural in Bm(b5)/G# suggests that maybe the key is not natural minor, but harmonic or melodic, but even so.

Wait, if it's harmonic minor of G#, the scale would be G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G).

But even then, F# natural and D natural would not be there. Not helpful.

Wait, but in harmonic minor, the vii chord (F##) is raised, but we still don't get D natural.

Hmm.

Let's consider the chord F#6. If F# is used as F# major with added 6th, that would require F#, A#, C#, D#. Now, if we have in the key D# minor, let's see.

D# major scale: D#, E#, F## (G), G#, A#, B#, C##.

Not helpful. D# minor is a bit messy.

Alternative approach: look at the possible diatonic chords that include all the chords.

If we accept that the Bm(b5)/G# might be a mistake and perhaps should be B°/G# (B diminished with G# bass), which would be G#, B, D, F.

So let's assume that.

So the chords include:

G#m: G#, B, D#

E major: E, G#, B

B major: B, D#, F#

F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

B°: B, D, F

But with the bass note G# for the last chord.

Now, let's see what key would contain all these.

G#, B, D# (G#m), E, G#, B (E major), B, D#, F# (B major), plus F#6 (F#, A#, C#, D#), and B° (B, D, F).

Note that D natural and F natural are used in B°, but in most standard keys this would be unusual.

However, the key of G# minor doesn't have D natural or F natural. But what about F# major as the key? No.

Wait another way: the key of D major.

No. Let's see: The presence of F#6 and E major chords.

E major would be the VI in B major.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Yes. Now, chords:

I: B

ii: C#m

iii: D#m

IV: E

V: F#

VI: G#m

vii°: A#°

F#6 chord: F#, A#, C#, D#. In B major scale, all notes present.

G#m chord: yes.

E major chord: yes.

B major: I

Bm(b5)/G#: Bm7b5 would be B, D, F, A. B major scale has D# and A#, not D or F. So not in B major.

But wait in B major, does it have D natural? No. D# is present.

So if Bm(b5)/G# is B, D, F, G# (bass), then D and F naturals aren't in B major.

Hmm.

Wait, but if the song is in G# minor, and sometimes uses a minor iv chord or something. But G# minor iv would be C#m which is fine.

But the issue is the Bm(b5)/G# chord.

Perhaps this chord is functioning as a leading note chord to the E chord. Let's see.

G#m chord sequence:

If it's G# minor, and the chord progression is like i - VI - III - ... but the Bm(b5) could be a secondary function.

Wait, Bm(b5)/G# – perhaps it's the iiø7 in relation to another key.

For example, in the key of G# minor, what would the iiø7 be? The ii chord is A#m7b5, as it is in natural minor. But it's not B.

Alternatively, Bm(b5) as a chord could be part of a different tonality.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to see what chord Bm(b5)/G# is in context. If G# is the bass note, and the full chord is G#, B, D, F.

That's a G# diminished seventh chord (G#°7). Because G# to B is minor third, B to D minor third, D to F minor third, F to G# minor third.

G#°7.

Where is G#°7 diatonic? In the key of A minor. In A minor, the vii°7 is G#°7.

Yes! In A natural minor:

Scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

vii° chord: G#, B, D?

Wait A natural minor scale has G natural. But a diminished seventh chord is G, Bb, Db, Fb – no. Wait confusion.

In A minor, the leading tone is G#. So in harmonic minor, A minor scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#.

Then the vii° chord is G#dim (G#, B, D).

But G# dim triad. The seventh chord would be G#m7b5: G#, B, D, F.

Ah! Yes. So in A harmonic minor scale, the vii chord is G#m7b5.

So G#m7b5 = G#, B, D, F.

So if the chord listed as Bm(b5)/G# is actually G#m7b5 with bass on G# (but Bm(b5)/G# would be a different chord), but perhaps there's a mislabeling.

If the chord was supposed to be G#m7b5, then it fits into A harmonic minor. But in this case, the primary chord is G#m, which would be iii in A minor.

Wait but the question is to find key and mode. If the tonic is G#m, then it's a minor key. But if the Bm(b5)/G# chord is actually G#m7b5, that would suggest that, but the way it's written as Bm(b5)/G# is confusing.

Let's check standard chord notation. A chord written as "Bm(b5)/G#" means B minor flat 5 chord with G# in the bass. So the chord is built on B, with a diminished fifth, and G# in bass. So the notes would be G# (bass), then the chord tones B, D, F. (since Bm b5 is B, D, F)

Yes. So the chord consists of G#, B, D, F.

Which is indeed G# diminished seventh chord.

G#°7 = {G#, B, D, F}

Similarly, it can also be spelled as B° (diminished), D°, F°.

So the chord is G#°7.

Now, is G#°7 diatonic to any scale? Yes, in the harmonic minor scale of A minor. A harmonic minor scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#.

Then the leading tone chord (vii°7) is G#°7.

But if the song is in A minor, then the tonic would be Am. But the sequence starts and ends with G#m chord. Which would be the iii chord in A minor. Not typical to center around iii.

But maybe it's a modal thing.

Alternatively, G#m is the tonic chord, and G#°7 chord is a common chromatic chord.

Alternatively, the key is G# minor with chromaticism.

But let's see the rest of the chords. G#m, E major, etc. If in A minor, G#m could be a chord, but the sequence has G#m as the main chord.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is C# minor. Wait.

Another idea: Maybe the key is F# minor.

F# natural minor: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E.

Wait, chord F#m.

But then G#m would be ii chord. But again.

Alternatively, let's use the most prominent chords.

The sequence has many G#m, so G# is tonic. Then E and B major chords.

In G# minor, as a natural minor, we have G#m, B major (III), E major (VI), F# major (vii), and F#6 which is F# major +6.

The F# major chord in natural minor is diatonic (vii).

But the Bm(b5)/G# chord: if it's G#dim7, which would be the vii° in another key, but in G# minor, it's not diatonic.

However, in some contexts, especially in jazz or pop, diminished chords can be used as passing chords.

But the question is to determine the key and mode.

Given that most chords are diatonic to G# harmonic or natural minor.

Let's check for G# natural minor:

Key: G# minor

Chords:

i: G#m

III: B major

VI: E major

vii: F# major

v: D#m or if major V, but usually minor.

But also F#6 chord.

And the Bm(b5)/G# might be a typo and supposed to be something else. Or if it's G#dim7.

But if we take G# as the tonic, the mode is natural minor.

But if the key is G# natural minor, then the chord Bm(b5)/G# (which is G#dim7) is not diatonic, but could be used as a chromatic chord.

Alternatively, in G# harmonic minor, the scale is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G).

Then the chords:

i: G#m

III+: B augmented (B, D#, F##)

v: D# major

vi: Em

vii: F## major

But F## is G natural. Then F#6 chord would have F# which isn't in scale.

Not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Given that the majority of chords fit G# natural minor, with a possible Bm(b5)/G# perhaps being a mistake for G#°7, which could be used for modulation or tension.

Alternatively, the Bm(b5)/G# chord might actually be Bm7b5, which is B, D, F, A. If there's an A note in there. But then A is not in G# minor.

Wait but if in the sequence there's an A note, but it wasn't specified. But the chord Bm7b5 has A as the seventh, so note A in there.

But in our chord sequence given, the chord is Bm(b5)/G#, which is ambiguous, but likely Bm(b5) with G# bass. But in standard notation, Bm(b5) is B, D, F.

So if we have G# bass and Bm(b5) chord tones (B, D, F), then the full chord notes are G#, B, D, F.

Assuming that's the case, then G# dim7.

G# dim7 is found in the key of A minor (harmonic), as the vii°7. But also in D# minor? Not sure.

But overall, the most plausible key is G# natural minor. The presence of G#m throughout, with chords like VI (E), III (B), vii (F# major), F#6 (which is just F# major + added 6th D#), and then the Bm(b5)/G# – which could be a chromatic passing chord, perhaps functioning as a diminished chord to create tension before resolving.

Since the sequence starts and ends on G#m, that's likely the tonic. The chords present mostly fit G# natural minor. The Bm(b5)/G# chord might be a chromatic chord used for color, not diatonic.

So key = G# minor, mode = natural minor.

But wait, what about the F#6 chord? In G# natural minor, F# major is diatonic vii, and F#6 would just be a variation of that.

Yes.

So key is G# minor, mode natural minor.

But another check: let's see the B/F# chord. B major chord, bass F#. In G# minor, B is III chord, so B major. Bass F# would be the seventh of the chord, but not important.

So the overall key is G# minor. Mode is natural minor.

But wait, the v chord is D# minor, but sometimes in minor keys, the V chord is major (harmonic minor), but if used here maybe not.

The chord F#6 could be part of the dominant function. But in G# minor, F# major is the vii chord, but V should be D# something.

Not sure. But given the chords, the best fit is G# minor key.

So final answer: Key = G# minor, mode = natural minor.

But maybe they're using the harmonic minor scale but with some variations.

But since the majority of chords fit natural minor, and G# minor is the tonic.

Yes.

The chord progression centered around **G#m** as the tonic chord (with repeated G#m at the start and end), along with diatonic chords from the **G# natural minor scale**, confirms the key and mode.

### ✅ **Breakdown of Diatonic Chords in G# Natural Minor Scale**  
The G# natural minor scale consists of the following notes:  
**G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#**

| Chord         | Function | Notes (Diagonal) | Fits in G# Minor? |
|---------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **G#m**       | i        | G#, B, D#        | ✅ Yes            |
| **E**         | VI       | E, G#, B         | ✅ Yes            |
| **B**         | III      | B, D#, F#        | ✅ Yes            |
| **F#**        | vii      | F#, A#, C#       | ✅ Yes (F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D# fits perfectly) |
| **Bm(b5)/G#** | ❓       | G#, B, D, F      | ❌ **Chromatic** (non-diatonic) |

---

### 🔍 **Why G# Minor?**
- **Tonic chord is G#m**: The repetition of G#m throughout the progression strongly suggests it's the tonic chord.
- **Chords like E (VI), B (III), F# (vii) are all diatonic** to G# natural minor.
- **F#6** (F#, A#, C#, D#) is a natural extension of the F# major chord (vii) in G# minor. The added 6th (D#) is also diatonic.
- **Bm(b5)/G#** appears to be a chromatic chord (G#°7), which is not diatonic but commonly used in minor keys for tension or passing function. It does not disqualify the key—it's a typical chromatic embellishment in minor progressions.

---

### ⚠️ **Clarification on Bm(b5)/G#**
- The chord is written as **Bm(b5)/G#**, meaning **B half-diminished (Bm7b5)** with **G#** in the bass.
- This gives the notes: **G#, B, D, F** — which is a **G#°7 (G# diminished seventh)** chord.
- While **not diatonic** to G# minor (scale has D# and F#, not D and F), this is a common chromatic chord used for color or modulation in minor keys.

---

### 🌟 **Summary**
- **Key = G# minor** (tonic center is G#m).
- **Mode = Natural Minor** (all other chords fit the natural minor scale, with one chromatic passing chord).
- This progression is typical of a **G# natural minor** song, where the occasional G#°7 chord (from Bm(b5)/G#) adds tension before resolving back to G#m.

### 💡 **Final Answer**
> **Key: G# minor  
> Mode: Natural Minor**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

> G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  G#m  G#m  B/F#  Bm(b5)/G#  G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  G#m  G#m  F#6  G#m

---

### Step 1: Identify the root chords

We can simplify by ignoring inversions for now and look at the *chord quality and root*:

- G#m (x6)
- E (x2, in first inversion: E/G#)
- B (x1, in first inversion: B/F#)
- Bm(b5) (x1, in first inversion: Bm(b5)/G#)
- F#6 (x1)

So the **core chords** are:  
**G#m, E, B, Bm(b5), F#6**

---

### Step 2: Analyze key signatures and functional harmony

#### Try: **Key of G# minor**

G# natural minor scale:  
**G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F#**

Chords built on each degree (natural minor):

| Degree | Chord     | Notes           |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| I      | G#m       | G# B D#         |
| ii     | A#m(b5)   | A# C# E         |
| III    | B         | B D# F#         |
| iv     | C#m       | C# E G#         |
| v      | D#m       | D# F# A#        |
| VI     | E         | E G# B          |
| VII    | F#        | F# A# C#        |

Now look at our progression:

- **G#m** ✅ — tonic (i)
- **E** ✅ — VI chord (relative major of G# minor)
- **B** ✅ — III chord (major, common in minor keys; D#-F# is major third and fifth)
- **Bm(b5)** — this is unusual. Bm(b5) = B D F# — that’s a half-diminished chord.  
   In G# minor, the chord on B is normally **B major** (III), not Bm(b5).  
   So **Bm(b5)** is *not* diatonic to G# natural minor.

- **F#6** — F# A# C# D# → F# major with added 6th (D#).  
   In G# minor, the VII chord is **F# major** (F# A# C#), so F#6 is an extended version — common in pop/rock for color.

But **Bm(b5)** is the problem. What key has Bm(b5) as a diatonic chord?

Let’s check **E major**:

E major scale: E F# G# A B C# D#

Chords:  
I=E, II=F#m, III=G#m, IV=A, V=B, VI=C#m, VII=D#m(b5)

→ So **D#m(b5)** is diatonic, not Bm(b5)

Wait — **Bm(b5)** = **B D F#** — what key contains this?

Try: **F# minor**

F# minor scale: F# G# A B C# D E

Chords:  
i = F#m  
ii = G#m(b5)  
III = A  
iv = Bm  
v = C#m  
VI = D  
VII = E

→ Here, **Bm** is iv. But we have **Bm(b5)** — which is B D F#, but in F# minor the iv chord is **Bm = B D# F#**, not B D F#.

So Bm(b5) = B D F# — this is **B half-diminished**, which is the **ii°7** chord in **A major** or **C# minor**.

Check **C# minor**:

C# natural minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

Chords:  
i = C#m  
ii = D#m(b5)  
III = E  
iv = F#m  
v = G#m  
VI = A  
VII = B

→ So **G#m** is v, **B** is VII (major), **E** is III (major) — **B** is major, not Bm(b5)

Still doesn't fit.

Wait — what if we consider **E major** again?

E major: E F# G# A B C# D#

Chords:  
I=E, II=F#m, **III=G#m**, IV=A, V=B, VI=C#m, VII=D#m(b5)

→ Again, **G#m = III**, **E = I**, **B = V**

But we have **Bm(b5)** — which is **B D F#** — but in E major, B is **B major (B D# F#)**.  
So **Bm(b5)** is **not diatonic**.

What is **Bm(b5)**?

**Bm(b5)** = B D F# — that's a chord with **minor third** and **diminished fifth** → half-diminished, aka **Bm7♭5**

This chord is **diatonic to C# minor** as the **ii°7**, but let's check:

C# minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

So B is the **7th scale degree**, and the chord built on B is **B D# F#** = **B major** — so **Bm(b5)** is NOT diatonic.

Wait — Bm(b5) could be a **borrowed chord** from another mode!

Let’s try **G# harmonic minor**:

G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F## (F## = G)

Chords on each degree:

i = G#m  
ii° = A#m(b5)  
III+ = B aug  
iv = C#m  
v = D#m  
VI = E  
VII = F##M7 (or F#7)

Still — **Bm(b5)** not here.

Now try **G# melodic minor (ascending)**:  
G# A# B C# D# E# F##  
→ Chords:  
i = G#m  
ii = A#m  
III+ = B+  
IV = C#M  
V = D#M  
VI = E#m  
VII = F##M7

Still no Bm(b5)

But now look — we have **Bm(b5)/G#** — meaning **G# in the bass**, so the chord is **Bm(b5)** with G# bass → inversion.

So actual sonority: **G# - B - D - F#**? Wait — Bm(b5) is **B D F#**, so with G# in bass:

→ Notes: **G#, B, D, F#**

What chord is **G# B D F#**?

That’s **G#m7**!  
G# - B (m3), D (dim5), F# (m7) → yes! → **G# half-diminished (G#m7♭5)**

Wait a second! **Bm(b5)/G#** is an **inversion of G#m7♭5**!

Similarly, **E/G#** = G# B D# E → that’s **G#m(add6)** or **E major with G# bass** — which is **E major triad over G#** → **G# maj6?** No, it's an **E major triad with G# in bass**: G# E G# B → so notes: **G#, B, E** — that's a **G# minor chord with added 6th (E)** — but B and E are 5th and 6th? Let’s map:

**E/G#**: Bass = G#, upper = E, G#, B → notes: G#, B, E → G#-B = m3, B-E = P4, G#-E = m6 → so **G#m6**

Similarly, **B/F#**: Bass=F#, upper=B, D#, F# → B-D#-F# = B major triad → so we have a **B major over F# bass** → F#-B-D# = **F# major with added major 6th?** F#-B = P4, B-D# = M3 → F# is root, B is 4th, D# is 6th → **F#6**

So let’s reinterpret the *sonorities* by their *full note content*:

---

### Step 3: Reconstruct full chords

1. G#m = **G# - B - D#**  
2. G#m  
3. E/G# = **G# - B - E** → **G#m(add6)** or **G#m6**  
4. E/G# = **G# - B - E**  
5. G#m  
6. G#m  
7. B/F# = **F# - B - D#** → **F#6** (since F#-B-D# = root, 4th, 6th — but wait, F# major is F#-A#-C#)  
   → **F# - B - D#** is **F#-B-D#**: B is the 4th (perfect 4th), D# is the 6th → **F#sus4(add6)**? Or just an **inversion of D#m7**?  
   Actually, **F# - B - D#** = **D#m7** (D#-F#-A#-C#) no… wait, this is only 3 notes.  
   Let's check: F# (root), B (4th), D# (6th) — but that’s not standard.

Wait — **B/F#** = B major triad with F# in bass → notes: F#, B, D# → this is **F# major** but with 4th (B) and 6th (D#)? No, major chord doesn’t have 4th.

Actually: **F# B D#** — this is the **first inversion of a D# minor 7th**? D#-F#-A#-C# — no C# here.

But **F# B D#** — this is **B major** triad (**B-D#-F#**) with **F# as bass** — so it’s an **inverted B major chord** — standard notation is **B/F#**, meaning B major with F# in bass.

So: **F#, B, D#** → that’s **B major** without the 3rd in bass? Wait — B major = B D# F# — that’s exactly those notes.

So **B/F#** = **B major** in 2nd inversion.

Similarly:

**Bm(b5)/G#** — Bm(b5) = **B D F#**, bass G# → so notes: **G#, B, D, F#**

What chord is **G# B D F#**?

- Root: G#
- 3rd: B (m3)
- 5th: D (dim5, b5)
- 7th: F# (m7)

→ This is **G# half-diminished 7th** — **G#m7♭5** (G#°7)

**F#6** = F# A# C# D# → F# major with added 6th

**E/G#** = G# B E → G#m6

**G#m** = G# B D#

So now the progression in full note content:

1. G#m — **G# B D#**  
2. G#m  
3. E/G# — **G# B E**  
4. E/G# — **G# B E**  
5. G#m — **G# B D#**  
6. G#m  
7. B/F# — **F# B D#** (B major in 2nd inversion)  
8. Bm(b5)/G# — **G# B D F#** → **G#m7♭5**  
9. G#m — G# B D#  
10. G#m  
11. E/G# — G# B E  
12. E/G# — G# B E  
13. G#m — G# B D#  
14. G#m  
15. F#6 — **F# A# C# D#**  
16. G#m — G# B D#

---

### Step 4: Harmonic Analysis — What key?

We see **G#m** is the tonic — appears 8 times.

We see **E major** triad (via E/G#) — that’s the **VI chord** in G# minor — very common.

We see **B major** — that’s the **III chord** in G# minor — major III is very common in minor keys (especially in pop/rock, derived from harmonic minor).

We see **G#m7♭5** — that’s a **ii°7 in C# minor**, or **viiø7 in A major**, but here it’s **functionally** as a **passing chord** or **borrowed chord**.

But wait — in **G# harmonic minor**, the **VII chord is F# major (F# A# C#)** — but we don’t have that here.

And we have **F#6** — which is **F# A# C# D#** — this is **not** diatonic to G# minor — it’s **borrowed from G# major**? But G# major has F##.

Wait — G# harmonic minor has F## (double sharp), not F#.

F#6 = F# A# C# D# → this is the **major 6th chord built on the leading tone** — not in G# minor.

**But here’s the key insight:**

**F#6** = **F# A# C# D#**

This is **identical** to **D#m7** — because D#-F#-A#-C# = D#m7 → and this is **vii°7 in E major**, or **ii°7 in C# minor**.

Wait — actually: **F# A# C# D#** — this is **F# major with added 6th (D#)** — so F#6.

What scale contains **F#6**?

Let’s check: **G# melodic minor ascending**

G# A# B C# D# E# F##

Doesn’t contain F#.

Wait — what if the **key is E major**?

E major: E F# G# A B C# D# → chords:

I=E, II=F#m, III=G#m, IV=A, V=B, VI=C#m, VII=D#m(b5)

→ Chords we have:

- G#m ✅ (III)
- E ✅ (I)
- B ✅ (V)
- F#6 = F# A# C# D# — **but in E major, F# is ii, which is F# A C# — minor!** → We have **F# A# C# D#**, which is **F# major with 6th** → but in E major, F# chord is **minor** — so **F# major** is **borrowed**.

So **F# major** is **not diatonic** to E major or G# minor.

But wait — **F#6** includes **D#**, which is the **6th of F#** — but this **D#** is also the **5th of G#m**.

Let’s consider this possibility: the **key is G# minor**, and **F#6** is a **chromatic passing chord** or **borrowed chord from G# major**?

G# major: G# A# B# C# D# E# F## — again, **F##**, not F#.

So F# is **not** in a major or minor scale of G#.

But here’s a better idea:

### What key has both G#m and F#6?

F#6 = F# A# C# D#

That’s **F# major** with added 6th — and **G#m** = G# B D#

We see **F#!** and **G#** — that’s a whole step apart.

This sounds like **a ii-V-I progression in the key of B major**? Not consistent.

Wait — perhaps the key is **C# minor**?

C# minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

Chords:
i = C#m
ii° = D#m(b5)
III = E
iv = F#m
v = G#m
VI = A
VII = B

→ So here we have:

- **G#m = v** ✅  
- **E = III** ✅  
- **B = VII** ✅ (major)  
- F#6? F# A# C# D# — but in C# minor, F# is F# A C# — **minor** chord (F#m).  
   F#6 has A# — so **A# instead of A natural** — so **F# major** is **borrowed from C# harmonic minor**?  
   C# harmonic minor: C# D# E F# G# A B# — wait, B#, not B — still no A#

C# melodic minor ascending: C# D# E F# G# A# B# — now we have A#!

→ So **C# melodic minor** has **A#** → F# = F# A# C# — that’s **F# major** — perfect!

Then **F#6 = F# A# C# D#** — D# is the 6th — diatonic in C# melodic minor.

G#m = G# B D# — B is natural, diatonic in C# melodic minor.

B = B# — but we have **B natural**!

Problem: in C# melodic minor ascending, VII = **B#** not B.

We have **B natural** chord → **B major = B D# F#**, which is **III chord in D major or B major**.

B natural = **not diatonic** to C# melodic minor, which has **B#**.

So **B major** requires **B natural**, but C# melodic minor has **B#**.

So we have **B natural**, **F# natural**, **G#**, and **E** — all points to **G# minor**.

Let’s go back — the **functional harmony**:

Core chords in **G# minor**:

- i = G#m  
- III = B major  
- VI = E major  
- VII = F# major (in harmonic minor)  
- Bm(b5) = not diatonic — but we found it’s **G#m7♭5** → **iiø7 in C# minor** — but **borrowed**

Wait — **G#m7♭5** is the **guitar voicing** — it’s the i chord with a raised 7th? Not really.

Another possibility: the Bm(b5)/G# (G#m7♭5) is a **passing chord** from G#m to the next E chord.

The most plausible key is **G# minor**, and the **non-diatonic chords** are **borrowed or chromatic passing chords**:

- **B major** → common in minor keys (from harmonic minor — it’s IV of V or just borrowed)
- **F#6** → could be borrowed from G# major (but G# major has F##) → perhaps **F#6** is a chromatic mediant or tension chord
- **Bm(b5)/G# = G#m7♭5** — this is the **iiø7 of C# minor** — so perhaps **modal interchange** from C# minor?

C# minor is the **relative minor of E major** — but we’re in G# minor.

G# minor and C# minor are a **perfect 5th apart** — strong relationship.

In minor key pop music, it’s common to borrow chords from the **parallel major** and the **relative major** and **neighboring minors**.

But **G#m7♭5** as a passing chord leading to E major? Let's see the progression:  
... G#m → G#m → B/F# → G#m7♭5 → G#m → ...

A better sequence in G# minor:  
i – i – VI – VI – i – i – **III** – **vii°7 (borrowed)** – i – i – VI – VI – i – i – **VII (F#)** – i

Ah! What if **F#6** is **F# major with 6th** — and F# is the **VIIdom chord in G# minor**? But VIs are major in harmonic minor.

Wait — **F#6** = F# A# C# D# — this is **identical to D#m7** — which is **v of G# minor**.

Let’s write **D#m7** = D# F# A# C# — yes!

But F#6 = F# A# C# D# — same notes as D#m7, just in different order!

So **F#6** and **D#m7** are **enharmonic voicings** — same set of notes.

So **F#6** = **D#m7** — which is the **v chord of G# minor** — **perfect!**

That means **F#6** is **D#m7** in **2nd inversion** — and it’s serving as **the dominant chord (v)** in G# minor!

In G# minor, the **v chord** is usually D#m, but in harmonic minor it’s often **D# major (V)** — to create stronger resolution.

But here we have **D#m7** — which can function as **v7**, not V7.

**G# harmonic minor**: G# A# B C# D# E F##  
So V = D# F## A# — **D# major**

But we have F# A# C# D# — that’s **F# A# C# D#** — **no F##** — it's **D#m7**, so it’s **from natural minor**

So if we use **natural minor** for the v chord: **D#m7**

And E = VI → common

B = III → common

Bm(b5)/G# = G#m7♭5 → this chord: **G#-B-D-F#** — it’s **not a diatonic chord**, but **it's a chromatic passing diminished chord**

Notice: From **B/F# (B D# F#)** to **G#m7♭5 (G# B D F#)** — you move from **D# down to D natural** — smooth voice-leading

Then to **G#m (G# B D#)** — **D natural → D#** — so that’s a smooth chromatic passing tone.

So the sequence:  
B/F# → G#m7♭5 → G#m  
→ D# → D → D# — chromatic descent on the 5th

So **G#m7♭5** is a **chromatic passing chord**, not a borrowed chord from another key.

### ✅ Final Conclusion:

**Key: G# minor (natural minor)**  
**Mode: Dorian? Phrygian?** — but **no, it's just natural minor (Aeolian)** because:

- We have **F#** not F## — so harmonic minor is **not** in use
- We have **D#** not D## — so not melodic minor ascending
- Chord **D#m7** (as F#6) = v chord from natural minor — no raised 7th
- Chord **B major** is common as borrowed III in minor keys
- F#6 is **D#m7** — v7, diatonic to natural minor
- G#m7♭5 is a chromatic passing chord — occurs between B major (with D#) and G#m (with D#), resolving chromatically: D# → D → D#

So while a **VII chord (F#)** exists in harmonic minor, here **F#6 = D#m7** — the **v chord** — so the **leading tone is natural (F#)**, not raised (F##).

Therefore, the scale is **G# natural minor (Aeolian)**.

**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**

**Key: G# minor**

### ✅ Answer:

> **Key: G# minor**  
> **Mode: Aeolian (Natural Minor)**

The non-diatonic chords (like B major and G#m7♭5) are either borrowed (B major) or chromatic passing tones (G#m7♭5), common in pop/rock harmony, but the underlying key and mode remain **G# Aeolian**.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**  
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm(b5)/G# – G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonic (home chord)

The progression **starts and ends on G#m**, and G#m appears very frequently — a strong indicator that **G# minor is the tonic**.

---

### Step 2: Consider possible keys

Since G# minor is the tonic, the **natural minor key** would be **G# natural minor**, which is the relative minor of **B major**.

However, G# minor is often **enharmonically respelled as Ab minor** for practicality (since G# major has 8 sharps!), but G# minor is usable in theory.

The **key signature of G# natural minor** is the same as **B major**: 5 sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#).

So the natural minor scale would be:
- G# A# B C# D# E F# G#

But minor keys often use harmonic or melodic minor forms, which raise the 7th (and sometimes 6th) degree.

- **Harmonic minor**: raises the 7th → F## (E##? Wait—let’s double-check).

Actually, in **G# natural minor**, the 7th scale degree is **F#**.  
To create a **leading tone** to G#, we raise it to **F##** (which is enharmonically G, but spelled as F## in G# harmonic minor).

But in practice, **composers often modulate or use chords from parallel modes**.

However, let's look at the actual chords used:

---

### Step 3: Analyze the chords in relation to G# minor

**G#m** = i  
**E/G#** = E major with G# in the bass → This is **VI chord in G# minor** (E major = VI). In natural minor, the VI chord is **E major** (E–G#–B), which matches.

**B/F#** = B major over F# bass → B major is the **III chord** in G# minor (B–D#–F#). So B/F# is just an inversion of III.

**Bm(b5)/G#** = B diminished (B–D–F) with G# in bass. Wait — Bm(b5) is B–D–F, but in G# minor, the **vii° chord** would be **F##°** (F##–A#–C#). So this is unusual.

But **Bm(b5)** is actually **B–D–F**, which is a **B diminished triad** (though technically B° is B–D–F, while Bm(b5) is the same as B°). So B°/G#.

Is B° in G# minor? Let’s check:

- G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F##  
- Chord on **A#** (ii°): A#–C#–E → A#°  
- Chord on **F##** (vii°): F##–A#–C# → F##°

So B° is **not diatonic** to G# natural or harmonic minor.

But wait — **what if the key is actually E major?**

Let’s test that.

In **E major**:
- E = I  
- G#m = iii  
- B = V  
- F#6 = F# major with added 6th → F# = ii  
- Bm(b5) = B–D–F = vii° of C#? Not in E.

But the progression keeps returning to **G#m**, not E. So E major seems unlikely as tonic.

Alternative: Could this be in **E major**, but with G#m as a temporary center? Unlikely due to repetition and closure on G#m.

Another idea: **G# Dorian?** Let's test.

G# Dorian = G# A# B C# D# E# F#  
→ But E# is not used; we see E natural in E major chord (E–G#–B). So E natural implies **E major**, not E#.

Thus, **E natural** suggests that the 6th scale degree is **E natural**, which matches **G# natural minor** (where 6th = E).

So far:
- G#m = i  
- E = VI  
- B = III  
- F#6 = F# major with added 6th → F# = VII? Wait, in natural minor, **VII is F# major** (F#–A#–C#). Yes!

So **F# major** is the **VII chord** in G# natural minor.

And **F#6** = F#–A#–C#–D# → adds the 6th (D#), which is the 5th scale degree, fine.

Now, the odd chord: **Bm(b5)/G#** = B–D–F over G#

B–D–F is **B diminished** (B°). Where does this come from?

Consider **G# harmonic minor**: raises 7th to F## → but that gives E# as leading tone, not used here.

But in **G# melodic minor (ascending)**: raises 6th and 7th → E# and F## → again, not matching E natural and F natural.

Wait — **B° = B–D–F** can be seen as **vii° of C**, but that doesn’t help.

Alternatively, **B°/G#** might be functioning as a **common-tone diminished chord** or **chromatic passing chord**.

Notice: it appears **between B major and G#m**:
- ... G#m – B/F# – **Bm(b5)/G#** – G#m ...

So B → B° → G#m

This is a **chromatic mediant or embellishment**: B (III) moves to G#m (i) via

### Reasoning

**Determining Chord Keys and Modes**

I'm currently working through the chord progression, breaking down each chord to understand its function. The repetition of G#m in the first section suggests it's a primary key, but the presence of other chords like E/G# and B/F# is key. I'm noting the slash chords and their potential impact on the overall feel. My focus is now on identifying the function of each chord to determine the key and mode.


**Dissecting Harmonic Functions**

I've been analyzing the chord functions within the G# minor framework. The E/G#, and B/F# chords are presenting some interesting harmonic tensions. Also, the presence of F#6 is particularly intriguing; its D# suggests a possible move towards the G# minor's harmonic or melodic form. I'm now exploring how these altered chords color the progression.


**Re-evaluating the Mode**

The presence of the Bm(b5)/G# chord with a D natural is really throwing me a curveball. It’s clashing with the G# natural minor and pointing toward something more complex. I'm now looking at G# modes containing the D natural, considering harmonic minor, melodic minor, and other possibilities. I’m starting to think we have a minor key with chromatic alterations.


**Determining the Mode's Nuances**

I'm now zeroing in on the function of Bm(b5)/G#. This chord still seems to be the key to understanding the mode. I've considered its role as a passing chord and its relationship to the natural minor, but I'm investigating how it serves as a chromatic element within the larger G# minor context. Is it a brief borrowing, a momentary alteration, or a key harmonic driver?


**Identifying Chromatic Borrowing**

I've determined G# natural minor as the base mode, and now I'm interpreting the Bm(b5)/G# chord. It functions as chromatic color, borrowed or substituted from outside the G# Aeolian framework. It's likely a passing chord. The natural D is creating tension but doesn't override the established G# minor.




Based on the provided chord progression, we can determine the key and mode by identifying the stable tonic chord and analyzing the relationships of the surrounding chords.

## 1. Determine the Key (Tonic Center)

*   The progression begins and ends on **G#m**.
*   **G#m** is the most frequently repeated chord.
*   The final cadence resolves strongly back to **G#m**.

The tonal center (tonic) is **G#**.

## 2. Analyze the Chords and Diatonic relationships

The primary chords used are:

| Chord | Notes | Roman Numeral (relative to G#) | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G#m** | G# B D# | i | Tonic Minor |
| **E/G#** | E G# B | VI | Relative Major / Submediant |
| **B/F#** | B D# F# | III | Relative Major |
| **F#6** | F# A# C# D# | VII | Subtonic / Dominant Function |

If we look at the natural minor scale starting on G#, the notes are: **G# A# B C# D# E F#**.

All the core, stable chords (G#m, E, B, F#) fit perfectly within the G# natural minor scale (Aeolian mode).

*   i (G#m)
*   III (B)
*   VI (E)
*   VII (F#)

### Addressing the Chromatic Chord

The progression includes one anomalous chord: **Bm(b5)/G#** (B Half-Diminished).
*   Notes: **B, D, F#**
*   This chord uses a **D natural** instead of the expected D# (D# is needed for the G# minor tonic triad and the G# natural minor scale).

The presence of D natural is chromatic and does not belong to the G# natural minor scale. However, this chord is temporary and serves a passing function between B/F# and G#m. It does not replace the tonic or dramatically change the overall harmonic landscape provided by the other chords. It is best interpreted as a borrowed or decorative chord.

## Conclusion

The overwhelming majority of the harmony establishes the G# minor triad as the tonic (i) and relies on the submediant (VI) and subtonic (VII) chords derived from the natural minor scale.

Therefore, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** G# minor
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian** (Natural Minor)

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

This chord progression, though brief, strongly suggests the **key of E Harmonic Minor** with a consistent emphasis on the tonic G\#m.

Here is the analysis:

1. **Focus on the Tonic:** The progression starts and ends on **G\#m**. This is the most weighted chord, indicating the tonic.

2. **Establish the Scale:** The notes implied by the G\#m chord are G\#, B, and D\#. The chords used (G\#m, E, F\#6, Bm(b5)/G\#) point to the notes of the **E Harmonic Minor scale**:
    * **E Harmonic Minor:** E - F\# - G - A - B - C - D\# (Relative major: G Major)

3. **Chord Function Analysis (Relative to G\#m):**

    * **G\#m (i):** The Tonic Minor chord.
    * **E/G\# (VI/i inversion):** The Submediant chord (VI) of E Harmonic Minor (E Major) with the bass note G\#. This is a common color chord, borrowed directly from the parallel major or used as the Submediant of the parent scale.
    * **B/F\# (V/iii inversion):** The dominant chord (V) of the parent scale E minor, with F\# in the bass. The B major chord strongly acts as the dominant (V) function, but diatonic to E Minor would imply Bm. The B major (sometimes noted as B7 in longer contexts) contains the leading tone D\#, solidifying the Harmonic Minor flavor.
    * **Bm($\text{b}$5)/G\#:** This is arguably the most unusual chord. The notes of Bm($\text{b}$5) are B - D - F, which is a diatonic chord in E Natural Minor (the **v** chord). Placing G\# in the bass (a root of the tonic) creates a tense passing chord. This chord is less about function and more about creating brief tension before moving back to the tonic.
    * **F\#6:** This chord (F\# - A\# - C\# - D\#) is the **ii$\text{o}^{6}$** chord used in some Romantic-era sequences, but more directly, the F\# major triad is the **ii** chord of E Harmonic Minor (where the $A\sharp$ is often used enharmonically as B$\flat$ in analysis). The 6th (D\#) heightens the dominant function by incorporating the leading tone. It resolves strongly back to G\#m.

**Conclusion:**

* **Key:** **E Harmonic Minor**

* **Mode:** **Harmonic Minor** (The presence of the B major chord, which contains the raised 7th - D\# - is the defining feature of the Harmonic Minor scale).

*(Note: While the tonic is G\#m, the structural key itself is defined by the underlying E Harmonic Minor scale, which is sometimes referred to as the Eolian mode with a raised 7th, or more traditionally, the Harmonic Minor mode.)*

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm7b5/G# – G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonic
The chord **G#m** is repeated frequently and appears at both the beginning and end. This strongly suggests **G# minor** as the tonic.

---

### Step 2: Check the scale and mode
G# minor is the **relative minor** of **B major**, so the natural minor scale would be:

- **G# A# B C# D# E F#**

Now let's check the chords against this scale:

| Chord | Notes | In G# minor? |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| G#m | G# B D# | ✅ |
| E/G# | E G# B | ✅ (E major is the **VI** chord in G# minor; this is a first inversion) |
| B/F# | B D# F# | ✅ (B major is the **III** chord in G# minor; first inversion) |
| Bm7b5/G# | B D F# A with G# in bass | ❌ **D natural** is **not** in G# natural minor |
| F#6 | F# A# C# D# | ✅ (F# major with added 6th; F# is the **VII** chord in G# minor) |

---

### Step 3: Interpret the outlier
The **Bm7b5/G#** chord (B D F# A over G#) contains a **D natural**, which is **not** in G# natural minor. However, **D natural** **is** in **G# harmonic minor**, which raises the 7th scale degree (F## → G#), but **lowers the 6th** (E# → F#), giving:

- **G# A# B C# D# E F##**

But here we have **D natural**, not D# — so **not harmonic minor**.

Instead, this chord is best interpreted as **a passing chromatic chord** or a **neapolitan-style substitution** — but **not diatonic**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: G# minor**  
**Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)**  
*(with a brief chromatic passing chord: Bm7b5/G#)*

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let’s analyze this progression step by step:

**Chord sequence:**
```
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm(b5)/G# – 
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m
```

---

### 1. Identify potential key centers
The prominent repeated chord is **G#m**, suggesting **G# minor** as the tonic.

The other chords appearing:
- **E/G# = E major in first inversion (E–G#–B)**  
  → relates to VI in G# minor.
- **B/F# = B major in 2nd inversion (B–D#–F#)**  
  → relates to III in G# minor.
- **Bm(b5)/G# = B–D–F (half-diminished flavor) over G# bass**  
  → introduces the note D natural — characteristic of the *natural minor* (aeolian) scale.
- **F#6 = F#–A#–C#–D#**  
  → V with added 6; implies harmonic-minor flavor (D# as leading tone).

---

### 2. Determine scale consistency
G# **natural minor (Aeolian)** has:
G# A# B C# D# E F#

The occurrence of:
- **E major (E–G#–B)** fits (it’s VI).
- **B major (B–D#–F#)** fits (it’s III).
- **Bm(b5)** introduces **D natural**, which doesn’t belong to harmonic or pure Aeolian — a chromatic borrowed chord for color.
- **F#6 (F#–A#–C#–D#)** is V6 in G# harmonic minor.

This mix of Aeolian and harmonic minor material is common.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**
- **Key:** G# minor  
- **Mode:** Primarily **G# natural minor (Aeolian)** with elements of the **harmonic minor** (F#6 implying raised 7th, D#).  

So we’d call it **G# minor**, with modal interchange (occasional natural vs harmonic minor use).

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: G#m, G#m, E/G#, E/G#, G#m, G#m, B/F#, Bm(b5)/G#, G#m, G#m, E/G#, E/G#, G#m, G#m, F#6, G#m.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are many G#m chords, it might be in a key where G# minor is the tonic. But let's look at the other chords.

The chords are:

- G#m (G# minor)

- E/G# (E major with G# in the bass? But E/G# might imply an E major chord with G# as the bass note, which is actually an inversion. But in terms of chord function, E major is the relative major of G# minor? Let's think about keys.

G# minor is the relative minor of B major. The key of B major has five sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#. But G# minor is the relative minor, so it should have the same key signature as B major, which is five sharps.

But let's list the chords:

- G#m: G# B D#

- E/G#: E major chord is E G# B, so with G# in bass, it's still an E major chord, just inverted.

- B/F#: B major chord with F# in bass? B major is B D# F#, so with F# in bass, it's an inversion.

- Bm(b5)/G#: B minor flat five? Bm(b5) would be B D F, but that doesn't fit with G# in bass? Wait, Bm(b5) is actually a half-diminished chord, so B D F A? But it's written as Bm(b5)/G#, so the chord is B half-diminished with G# in bass? But B half-diminished is B D F A, and G# is not in that chord. That might be a typo or something. Let me read carefully.

It says Bm(b5)/G#. Bm(b5) typically means B half-diminished, which is B D F A. But with /G# means G# in the bass. But G# is not part of the B half-diminished chord, so this might be a different chord. Perhaps it's a slash chord where the upper structure is Bm(b5) and the bass is G#. But Bm(b5) is B D F, and if bass is G#, it could be implying a G# diminished or something? This is confusing.

Maybe it's a mistake, and it's supposed to be something else. Let's look at the context. The progression has G#m and E/G#, which are common in G# minor key.

In G# minor, the chords would be:

- i: G#m

- VII: F# major? But we have E major and B major.

G# natural minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F# G# so chords: i G#m, ii° A#dim, III B major, iv C#m, v D#m, VI E major, VII F# major.

But here we have E major, which is VI, and B major, which is III. But we also have Bm(b5) which is not in the natural minor. Bm(b5) would be B D F, but in G# minor, the B chord is major because the third is D# from the scale, not D natural. So B minor would have D natural, which is not in the key of G# minor.

Perhaps it's in harmonic minor or melodic minor.

G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F## G# so F double sharp, which is equivalent to G natural, but that might be messy.

In harmonic minor, the V chord is D# major or D#7, and the vii° chord is F## diminished, which is G diminished.

But we have B/F# and Bm(b5)/G#.

Bm(b5) is B D F, which sounds like a half-diminished chord, and in minor keys, the ii chord is often half-diminished. In G# minor, the ii chord would be A# half-diminished? A#m(b5) is A# C# E G#? No, A# half-diminished would be A# C# E G#, but that's not B.

Let's list all chords without inversions for simplicity. The inversions might not affect the key analysis.

So chords: G#m, E, G#m, B, Bm(b5), G#m, E, G#m, F#6, G#m.

From the progression: G#m, G#m, E, E, G#m, G#m, B, Bm(b5), G#m, G#m, E, E, G#m, G#m, F#6, G#m.

So the sequence is mostly G#m and E, with B and Bm(b5) and F#6.

Bm(b5) is unusual. Bm(b5) is B D F, which is a half-diminished chord. In which key does B half-diminished occur?

B half-diminished is the vii°7 chord in C major or C minor? In C major, vii°7 is B half-diminished? No, in C major, the vii chord is B diminished, which is B D F, but that's fully diminished? No, B diminished triad is B D F, which is diminished, but in seventh chords, B half-diminished is B D F A, which is the seventh chord built on the seventh scale degree in C major? Let's recall.

In major keys, the seventh chord on the seventh scale degree is half-diminished only in natural minor? I'm getting confused.

Standard diatonic chords:

In major key: I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii°.

vii° is diminished triad, and if seventh chord, it is half-diminished? No, in major key, the seventh chord on scale degree 7 is a half-diminished chord only if we use the natural seventh? Let's think about C major.

C major scale: C D E F G A B C

Chords: I C, ii Dm, iii Em, IV F, V G, vi Am, vii° Bdim (B D F)

Seventh chords: I maj7, ii m7, iii m7, IV maj7, V7, vi m7, vii half-diminished? B D F A is Bm7b5, which is half-diminished, and it is the seventh chord on scale degree 7 in major key? Yes, in major key, the seventh chord on vii is half-diminished.

But in terms of triad, vii is diminished.

In minor keys, it's more complex.

Back to our progression. We have G#m, which is i, E which is VI, B which is III, and F#6 which is VII. But Bm(b5) is not III; III in minor is major chord.

So Bm(b5) is B D F, which has D natural and F natural, whereas in G# minor, we have D# and F#? So it's borrowing from another scale.

Perhaps the key is G# minor, but using chords from harmonic minor or other modes.

Another thought: perhaps the Bm(b5) is actually a different chord. Notice that it is written as Bm(b5)/G#, which means the bass is G#. So the chord has G# in bass, and the upper part is Bm(b5). But Bm(b5) is B D F, so with G# in bass, it could be interpreted as a G# chord with added notes? G# B D F? That sounds like G# half-diminished? G# half-diminished is G# B D F#, but here F natural, so it's G# diminished? G# diminished triad is G# B D, and if add F, it's G# fully diminished seventh? G# B D F is indeed G# diminished seventh chord, because diminished seventh chords are symmetric.

B D F is B diminished triad, and if we add G#? B diminished seventh chord is B D F Ab, which is the same as G# diminished seventh? Yes, because diminished seventh chords are symmetric, so B diminished seventh is B D F Ab, and Ab is the same as G#.

So Bm(b5)/G# might be a way of writing G# diminished seventh chord? Bm(b5) is B D F, which is B diminished triad, and with G# in bass, it becomes G# B D F, which is G# diminished seventh chord.

Yes! That makes sense. So effectively, Bm(b5)/G# is G# diminished seventh chord.

In chord progressions, diminished chords often function as leading tones or passing chords.

Similarly, B/F# is B major with F# in bass, which is just an inversion.

So let's rewrite the progression with root positions for analysis:

- G#m

- G#m

- E (since E/G# is E major with G# bass, but root is E)

- E

- G#m

- G#m

- B (since B/F# is B major with F# bass, root B)

- G#dim7 (from Bm(b5)/G#)

- G#m

- G#m

- E

- E

- G#m

- G#m

- F#6 (F# major with added 6th? F#6 chord is F# A# C# D#? Typically F#6 is F# A# C# D#, which is like D#m7? But anyway)

- G#m

So the chords are: G#m, E, B, G#dim7, F#6.

Now, in the context of G# minor, these chords can be explained.

G# minor key:

- i: G#m

- VI: E major

- III: B major

- vii°7: G#dim7? In G# minor, the leading tone is F##, which is G, so the diminished chord on the leading tone would be F## diminished, which is G dim, but G#dim7 would be on the tonic? No.

In minor key, the diminished seventh chord is usually built on the leading tone. In G# harmonic minor, the leading tone is F##, so the diminished seventh chord is F## A# C# E, which is F##dim7.

But here we have G#dim7, which is built on the tonic? That doesn't make sense as a leading tone chord.

G#dim7 would be the diminished seventh chord from A harmonic minor? Let's think.

G#dim7 consists of G# B D F. In terms of scale degrees in G# minor, if we use harmonic minor, the scale is G# A# B C# D# E F## G#. So the notes are G# A# B C# D# E F## G#. F## is G, so G# B D F? F is not in the scale; F## is G, so F natural is not in the scale. So G#dim7 has F natural, which is not in G# harmonic minor.

Perhaps it's from G# melodic minor? Melodic minor ascending: G# A# B C# D# E# F## G# so E# is F, F## is G, so still no F natural.

So G#dim7 is not diatonic to G# minor.

But in chord progressions, diminished chords are often used as passing chords or from other functions.

Another possibility: perhaps the key is E major.

E major key has chords: E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim.

In E major, G#m is iii, B is V, E is I, F#6 is II6? F#6 is not a standard diatonic chord in E major; F# is ii, which is F#m, so F#6 would be F# major with 6th, but in E major, ii is F#m, so F# major is not diatonic. F#6 would imply F# A# C# D#, but in E major, the A is A natural, so A# is not in the key, so F#6 is not diatonic to E major.

Similarly, G#dim7 is not diatonic to E major.

So perhaps it's in B major.

B major key: B, C#m, D#m, E, F#, G#m, A#dim.

Chords: G#m is vi, E is IV, B is I, F# is V, but F#6 is V with 6th? F#6 is F# A# C# D#, and in B major, A# is the leading tone, so F#6 has A# which is diatonic, but F#6 is not a standard chord; it might be used as a passing chord. But we have G#dim7, which is not diatonic to B major.

G#dim7 has G# B D F, and in B major, we have G# and B, but D and F are not in B major; B major has D# and F#.

So not B major.

Let's list the notes used in the chords.

G#m: G# B D#

E: E G# B

B: B D# F#

G#dim7: G# B D F

F#6: F# A# C# D#? F#6 typically means F# major chord with added 6th, so notes: F# A# C# D#? But usually, a 6th chord has the 6th from the root, so for F#6, root F#, major third A#, fifth C#, and sixth D#. So notes F# A# C# D#.

Now, let's find a key that contains these notes.

From the chords, we have notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#? From G#dim7, we have D and F, which are flat compared to D# and F#.

So the scale might have both D and D# and both F and F#? That would be a chromatic scale or something.

Perhaps the key is G# minor, and the G#dim7 is a common-tone diminished chord or something.

Another idea: in minor keys, the diminished chord on the raised seventh is common, but here it's on G#, which is the tonic.

Let's look at the progression: after G#m and E, we have B and then G#dim7, then back to G#m. So G#dim7 might be functioning as a leading chord to G#m? But diminished chords usually lead to chords a half-step above or below, but G#dim7 to G#m is same root? Not necessarily.

G#dim7 shares notes with G#m? G#m is G# B D#, G#dim7 is G# B D F, so they share G# and B, but D# vs D, and F is additional. So it's not directly related.

Perhaps G#dim7 is acting as a substitute for another chord.

Notice that G#dim7 is the same as Bdim7, Ddim7, Fdim7, so it's symmetric.

In the progression, it comes after B major, so perhaps it's a chromatic passing chord.

But let's consider the mode. Perhaps it's in G# Phrygian or something.

List all the roots: G#, E, B, G#, F#.

So the tonic seems to be G#, since it starts and ends on G#m.

So let's assume G# is the tonic.

Now, what mode has G# as tonic with minor chord?

The chords E and B are major, which in minor key, III and VI are major, so that fits G# natural minor.

But then we have G#dim7 and F#6.

F#6 in G# minor would be the VII chord, but in natural minor, VII is F# major, which is F# A# C#, and F#6 would be F# A# C# D#, so it adds D# which is the fifth of G#m, so it might be a common chord.

But G#dim7 is the problem.

Perhaps G#dim7 is a secondary dominant or something.

G#dim7 could be the diminished chord leading to A minor, but we don't have A minor here.

Another thought: in music, sometimes diminished chords are used as passing chords between chords.

In this case, from B to G#m, G#dim7 might be used to smooth the transition.

But let's look at the bass lines. The inversions might be important.

The progression has E/G# which means E major with G# bass, so the bass is G# for that chord. Similarly, B/F# has F# bass, and Bm(b5)/G# has G# bass.

So let's list the bass notes:

- G#m: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- E/G#: bass G#

- E/G#: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- B/F#: bass F#

- Bm(b5)/G#: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- E/G#: bass G#

- E/G#: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- F#6: bass F#? F#6 chord, typically the bass is F# unless specified otherwise.

- G#m: bass G#

So the bass is mostly G#, with two F# points.

So the bass is emphasizing G# strongly, which supports G# as tonic.

Now, for the mode, let's see the scale used.

From the chords:

- G#m: G# B D# — so notes B and D#.

- E: E G# B — so E, G#, B.

- B: B D# F# — so D# and F#.

- G#dim7: G# B D F — so D and F.

- F#6: F# A# C# D# — so A# and C# and D#.

So all notes together: G#, A#, B, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#.

So we have all notes from G# to F# except for A? We have A# but not A natural. So the scale has A# and no A, so it's like G# B C# D# E F# G#? But we have D and F natural, which are chromatic.

The consistent notes are G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#? But from E chord, we have E, which is natural, and from G#m, we have D#, from B, we have D# and F#, from F#6, we have A# and C# and D#.

So the diatonic notes would be G# A# B C# D# E F#? That is the G# natural minor scale? G# natural minor is G# A# B C# D# E F# G#, yes! So the scale of G# natural minor has all these notes except for the chromatic D and F from the diminished chord.

So the underlying key is G# natural minor.

The chords E and B are diatonic to G# natural minor: E is VI, B is III.

F#6 is VII with an added 6th, which is still diatonic since F# major is VII.

The only non-diatonic chord is G#dim7, which is used for color or as a passing chord.

In many songs, diminished chords are used chromatically without changing the key.

So I think the key is G# minor, and the mode is natural minor or Aeolian mode.

But let's confirm the F#6 chord. In G# natural minor, the VII chord is F# major, and F#6 is just a variation, adding the 6th, which is D#, which is the fifth of the scale, so it's fine.

Therefore, the key is G# minor.

But to be precise, since most chords are from natural minor, and the diminished chord is auxiliary, we can say the key is G# minor.

So for the answer, key of G# minor.

But the question says "determine key and mode". Mode might be Aeolian.

But in popular music, often just key is specified.

Perhaps it's G# Aeolian.

But let's see if there is a better fit.

Another thought: the chord Bm(b5)/G# is interpreted as G#dim7, but in context, it might be functioning as a dominant substitute.

In G# minor, the dominant is D# major or D#7, but here we have B major which is III, and then G#dim7, which might be related to D#7.

G#dim7 is equivalent to D#7b9 without the root? D#7 is D# F## A# C#, and D#7b9 is D# F## A# C E? No, D#7b9 has E? Let's see.

D#7 chords: D# F## A# C#.

G#dim7 is G# B D F.

If we compare, G#dim7 shares notes with D#7: D#7 has D# F## A# C#, and G#dim7 has G# B D F, so no common notes? F## is G, so D#7 has D# G A# C#, and G#dim7 has G# B D F, so still no common tones.

But G#dim7 is the same as Bdim7, which is the vii°7 of C major, but not related directly.

Perhaps it's a common-tone diminished chord for G#m.

In many progressions, a diminished chord on the tonic is used to add tension before resolving to the tonic, but here it comes after B major and before G#m, so it might be a passing chord.

I think for practical purposes, the key is G# minor.

So I'll go with that.

The chord progression is primarily based on G# minor, with the tonic chord G#m appearing frequently throughout. The chords E (or E/G#) and B (or B/F#) are diatonic to the G# natural minor scale (Aeolian mode), functioning as the VI and III chords, respectively. The F#6 chord is also diatonic, representing the VII chord with an added 6th.

The Bm(b5)/G# chord is interpreted as a G# diminished seventh chord (G#dim7), which is non-diatonic to G# natural minor but is used chromatically as a passing chord or for tension, without altering the overall key.

The strong emphasis on G#m as the tonic and the use of diatonic chords support the key of G# minor. The mode is Aeolian, as the progression aligns with the G# natural minor scale (G# A# B C# D# E F#).

**Key:** G# minor  
**Mode:** Aeolian

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. List the chords with their likely functions**

Chords given:  
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm(b5)/G# – G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m

First, identify the root chords without inversions:  
G#m, E, B, Bm(b5), F#6.

---

**2. Check key possibilities**

- **G# minor** key signature: 5 sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#).  
  Diatonic chords in G# natural minor:  
  G#m, A#dim, B, C#m, D#m, E, F#.

  - G#m = i  
  - E = VI (E major in G# natural minor)  
  - B = III (B major in G# natural minor)  
  - F# = VII (F# major in G# natural minor)  
  - Bm(b5) is **not** diatonic in G# natural minor — Bm(b5) = B–D–F, but in G# minor, B major is B–D#–F#. Bm(b5) is B–D–F, which is like a B half-diminished (Bø).  
    Bø = B–D–F–A = Bm7(b5). That’s diatonic in **A major** (as viiø7) but not in G# minor.

---

**3. Try relative major of G# minor**

G# minor relative major = B major.  
B major key signature: 5 sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#).  
Diatonic chords in B major:  
B, C#m, D#m, E, F#, G#m, A#dim.

- G#m = vi  
- E = IV  
- F# = V  
- B = I  
- Bm(b5) is not diatonic in B major either — Bm(b5) = B–D–F, but B major’s vii chord is A#dim (A#–C#–E), not Bø.

So Bm(b5) is the odd chord.

---

**4. Analyze Bm(b5)/G#**

Bm(b5) = B–D–F.  
B half-diminished 7 = B–D–F–A.  
Bm(b5)/G# means bass note G#.  
So pitches: G#–B–D–F.  
That’s G#m7(b5) — a half-diminished chord on G#.

G#m7(b5) = G#–B–D–F.  
In key of A major: viiø7 = G#m7(b5).  
In key of A minor: not naturally occurring in natural minor, but in harmonic/melodic minor?  
A harmonic minor: G#dim7 = G#–B–D–F (actually G#dim7 is G#–B–D–F, but dim7 has dim 5 and dim 7, but here m7(b5) is half-diminished, which is G#–B–D–F#? Wait — check:  
Half-diminished symbol ø = m7(b5):  
G#m7(b5) = G#–B–D–F#? No — F# is a minor 7th above G#? G# to F# is a minor 7th (10 semitones). Yes! So G#–B–D–F# is G#ø7.  
But given chord says Bm(b5)/G#: B–D–F with G# bass = G#–B–D–F. G# to F is a **diminished 7th** (9 semitones), so that’s G#°7 (G#dim7), not G#ø7.  

So Bm(b5) = B–D–F. Add G# bass: G#–B–D–F = G#dim7.  
G#dim7 is symmetrical.

---

**5. Functional use of G#dim7**

G#dim7 often works as a leading-tone chord in A minor (or A major).  
G#dim7 → Am (or A major).  
But here it goes G#dim7 → G#m. That’s a common-tone dim7: G#dim7 to G#m.

So Bm(b5)/G# is just a first-inversion G#dim7 acting as a common-tone diminished of G#m.

---

**6. Determine key from overall chords**

Most chords: G#m, E, B, F#.  
In B major:  
G#m = vi  
E = IV  
B = I  
F# = V  

Progression:  
G#m – E – G#m – B – G#m – E – G#m – F# – G#m.

That’s vi – IV – vi – I – vi – IV – vi – V – vi.  
Very common in pop/rock in major key, centered on the relative minor.

So the tonal center feels like G#m, but the key signature is B major (G# minor’s relative major).  
Mode: G# **Aeolian** (natural minor) relative to B major.

---

**7. Conclusion**

Key signature: **B major**  
Tonal center: **G# minor**  
Mode: **Aeolian** (relative to B major)

---

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{G\# \text{ Aeolian}}
\]  
(Key signature: B major / G# minor)

### Reasoning


1.  **Initial Triage & First Look:**
    *   The user has provided a sequence of chords: `G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m`
    *   The request is to "Determine key and mode."
    *   My first step is to simplify and understand the chords. I see a lot of repetition, which is good. It means the core harmony is probably not overly complex.
    *   Let's list the basic chord qualities, ignoring the bass notes for a moment:
        *   G#m (repeated)
        *   E (or E/G#)
        *   B (or B/F#)
        *   Bm(b5)
        *   F#6

2.  **Simplify the Chord Progression:**
    *   The core chords seem to be: `G#m`, `E`, `B`, `Bm(b5)`, `F#6`.
    *   Let's look at the bass notes, as they are important: `G#`, `E`, `F#`. The `G#` is prominent, especially under the `G#m` and `Bm(b5)`. The `E` is under the `E` chord. The `F#` is under the `B` chord. This suggests a strong sense of voice leading and harmonic function.

3.  **Hypothesis Generation - What's the most likely key?**
    *   The first and most frequently occurring chord is `G#m`. This is a very strong candidate for the tonic (the "i" chord).
    *   If `G#m` is the tonic, the key is likely G# minor. Let's test this hypothesis.
    *   The key of G# minor has the following notes: `G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F#`.
    *   Let's analyze the other chords in relation to G# minor:
        *   `G#m`: `i` (the tonic). This fits perfectly.
        *   `E` or `E/G#`: The notes are `E-G#-B`. In the key of G# minor, E is the VI chord (`vi` in major, but `VI` in minor). `E` is the relative major of `G#m`. The `E/G#` is just the first inversion of this chord. This is a very common chord, the "relative major" or "submediant." It often functions as a deceptive cadence or a way to move away from and back to the tonic. This fits well.
        *   `B` or `B/F#`: The notes are `B-D#-F#`. In the key of G# minor, B is the III chord (`III`). `B` is the dominant of `E` (V/vi) and also the mediant of G# minor. The `B/F#` is the second inversion. This chord strongly wants to resolve to `E`. So, we have a `III -> VI` motion (`B -> E`). This is a very common progression.
        *   `F#6`: The notes are `F#-A#-C#-D#`. In the key of G# minor, an `F#` chord would be the v chord (`v`). However, the `F#6` has an `A#`, which is the raised 6th degree (`D#` is the major 6th of F#). Let's re-examine. The notes `F#-A#-C#` make an `F#` major triad. The key of G# minor has an F# *minor* chord as its diatonic v chord (`F#-A-C#`). The presence of `A#` (the raised 3rd of the F# chord, and the leading tone to B) is crucial. This makes it a major V chord (`V`), but it's built on the 5th scale degree of G# minor, which is D#. Wait, the 5th degree of G# minor is D#. So the V chord should be `D#`.
    *   **Correction/Refinement:** My initial analysis of `F#6` was a bit off. Let's look again. The notes are `F#-A#-C#-D#`. This is an `F#` major 6th chord. In the context of G# minor, `F#` is the seventh degree (the leading tone is `F#`, but the subtonic is `F#`... wait, the leading tone of G# minor is `F#`. No, the leading tone is Fx. The 7th degree is F#. Okay, let's be precise). The 7th degree of G# minor is `F#`. The chord built on this degree is `F#dim` (`F#-A-C#`). The `F#6` chord has `A#` and `D#`, which are not in the F#dim chord. This is getting complicated.
    *   Let's pivot. Maybe the key isn't G# minor. What other possibilities are there?

4.  **Second Hypothesis - E Major?**
    *   The `E` chord is present. Let's see if the progression fits in E major.
    *   Key of E Major: `E - F# - G# - A - B - C# - D#`.
    *   Let's analyze the chords:
        *   `G#m`: This is the vi chord in E major. A very common minor chord.
        *   `E`: This is the I chord. Fits.
        *   `B`: This is the V chord. Fits perfectly. `B -> E` is a strong V-I cadence.
        *   `Bm(b5)`: This is `B-D-F-A`. Wait, the chord is `Bm(b5)/G#`. So the notes are `G#-B-D-F`. This is highly non-diatonic to E major. One of the notes (`F`) is not in the key. This seems to weaken the E major hypothesis.
        *   `F#6`: `F#-A#-C#-D#`. `F#` is the ii chord in E major. A diatonic `F#m` chord would be `F#-A-C#`. The `F#6` has an `A#` (the raised 3rd, making it major) and a `D#` (the 6th). This is an `F#` major 6th chord. This is also non-diatonic.

5.  **Revisiting the G# Minor Hypothesis (it was stronger):**
    *   Let's go back to G# minor. `G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F#`.
    *   `G#m`: `i`. Solid.
    *   `E/G#`: `VI`. Solid.
    *   `B/F#`: `III`. Solid. The progression `III - VI` is common.
    *   `Bm(b5)/G#`: This is the weird one. Let's spell it out. `Bm(b5)` is `B-D-F`. With the `G#` in the bass, the full chord is `G#-B-D-F`.
        *   Let's analyze this against the G# minor scale (`G#-A#-B-C#-D#-E-F#`).
        *   `G#`: Tonic.
        *   `B`: Mediant (3rd degree).
        *   `D`: This is the problem note. It's a `b6` relative to G# (the 6th is `E`). Wait, the 6th is E. The *4th* is C#. So `D` is a `b5`. Let me re-verify the scale. G# minor: `G# (1) A# (2) B (3) C# (4) D# (5) E (6) F# (7)`. Ah, `D` is a `b5` (diminished 5th) above `G#`. So we have `1 - b3 - b5 - 7` (`G#-B-D-F#`). No, the chord has `F`, not `F#`. So it's `1 - b3 - b5 - b7` (`G#-B-D-F`). This is a G# half-diminished 7th chord, often written as `G#m7b5` or `G#ø7`.
        *   In the key of G# minor, the chord built on the second degree (A#) is `A#dim7`. The chord built on the seventh degree (F#) is `F#dim`. The `G#ø7` is not a standard diatonic chord. *However*, it can be seen as a common altered chord. It functions like a `iiø7` chord, but it's built on the tonic. This is a very common sound in jazz and modern pop/rock. It's a "tonic minor 7 flat 5" sound. It strongly wants to resolve to the V chord. In this key, the V chord is `D#`. But the progression doesn't go to `D#`. It goes back to `G#m`. This makes it a "static" or "modal" sound rather than a functional one. It's adding color and tension to the tonic harmony itself.
    *   `F#6`: `F#-A#-C#-D#`. Let's re-analyze this in G# minor.
        *   `F#`: The subtonic (7th degree).
        *   `A#`: The major 3rd of the chord. This is the `#2` or `b3` of the *relative major* (E major), but in G# minor, it's the `#9`. Let's not overthink that. Let's look at its function.
        *   The notes are `F#-A#-C#-D#`. This is an `F#` major 6th chord. It's built on the 7th degree of the G# minor scale. The diatonic chord on the 7th degree is `F#dim` (`F#-A-C#`). This progression uses `F#maj6` instead. This is a very common "borrowed" or "modal interchange" chord. It's borrowed from the G# Dorian mode (where F# is major) or G# Mixolydian (where F# is major). The `D#` in the chord makes it even more specific. The `F#` chord wants to resolve to `B` (its V), or down to `E` (a IV relationship in a way). Here it goes back to `G#m`. Again, this points away from strong functional harmony and towards a more modal/tonal center feel.

6.  **Synthesizing the Analysis:**
    *   The overwhelming feeling is centered around `G#m`. It starts and ends on it, and it's the most frequent chord.
    *   The other chords (`E`, `B`) are the `VI` and `III` chords respectively, which are very common chords used in a minor key context. The progression `i - III - VI - i` (`G#m - B - E - G#m`) is a classic minor key progression.
    *   The "weird" chords (`G#m7b5` written as `Bm(b5)/G#`, and `F#6`) are non-diatonic embellishments that add color and tension to the tonic. They don't pull strongly to a different key center. They resolve back to `G#m`. This reinforces `G#m` as the home base.
    *   So, the key is **G# Minor**.

7.  **Determining the Mode:**
    *   The user asked for the mode. Is it just plain G# natural minor, or something else?
    *   Let's check the scale notes implied by the chords against the standard minor modes.
    *   **G# Natural Minor:** `G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F#`.
        *   `G#m`: `G#-B-D#`. Fits.
        *   `E`: `E-G#-B`. Fits.
        *   `B`: `B-D#-F#`. Fits.
        *   `F#6`: `F#-A#-C#-D#`. The `A#` is the problem note. Natural minor has an `A` (the b2 of G#). The chord has `A#`. This chord is NOT from natural minor.
    *   **G# Harmonic Minor:** `G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F##`.
        *   The `F#6` chord is even less likely here because the key has an F##. `F#` would be a `bb7`. This is not it.
    *   **G# Melodic Minor:** `G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E# - F##` (ascending).
        *   Also not a good fit.
    *   **G# Dorian:** `G# - A - B - C# - D# - E - F#`.
        *   This mode has a major 6th (`E`) and a minor 2nd (`A`). The chords `G#m` (`i`), `E` (`VI`), `B` (`IV`), all fit diatonically in Dorian! Wait, `B` is `IV` in Dorian, not `III`. This is a subtle but important difference. `B` as `IV` is a very strong sound.
        *   Let's check the `F#6` chord. `F#` is the `vii` chord in Dorian, and it would be `F#m`. The progression uses `F#maj6`. This chord is still not diatonic.
        *   Let's check the `G#m7b5` chord. Not diatonic.
    *   **G# Phrygian:** `G# - A - B - C# - D - E - F`. Doesn't fit at all.
    *   **G# Aeolian:** This is just another name for Natural Minor. We already ruled that out.

8.  **Revisiting the "Mode" Question:**
    *   The term "mode" can be used in a few ways.
        *   Strictly as one of the 7 church modes (Dorian, Phrygian, etc.).
        *   More loosely to mean "is it major or minor?" (i.e., the major mode or the minor mode).
        *   In modern music theory, to describe a tonality that uses a combination of diatonic and borrowed chords.
    *   This progression doesn't fit neatly into any *single* diatonic mode.
    *   However, the *character* of the progression is what's important.
    *   The core is `G# minor`.
    *   The `E` chord (VI) gives it the feel of natural minor or Dorian.
    *   The `F#6` chord is borrowed from Dorian (where the `iv` chord becomes major, although this is `VII`... wait, `F#` is the 7th degree, a `vii` chord. In Dorian, the `IV` chord is major. The `F#` chord is the `vii` chord. Let me recheck my Dorian theory. G# Dorian: `G#(i) A(ii) B(III) C#(IV) D#(v) E(VI) F#(vii)`. The chords are `G#m, Am, Bm, C#m, D#m, Em, F#dim`. This doesn't fit the `B` major or `E` major chords. My Dorian analysis was wrong. Okay, let's reset the mode check.

9.  **Third Pass on Mode - Let's be more systematic.**
    *   **Tonal Center:** G# minor. This is the most confident conclusion.
    *   **Chord Sources:**
        *   `G#m`, `E`, `B`: These are all diatonic to **G# Natural Minor (Aeolian)**.
            *   `G#m` is `i`.
            *   `E` is `VI`.
            *   `B` is `III`.
            *   The progression `i - III - VI - i` is a classic natural minor progression. A deceptive cadence from `III` to `VI` (`B` to `E`) is also common.
        *   `F#6`: This `F#` major chord is the key giveaway. Where does a major `vii` chord come from? This is a sound associated with the **Melodic Minor** scale, specifically the Lydian Dominant or Altered scale built on a degree, but that's too complex. Let's think simpler. A major chord built on the 7th degree (`F#`) is a hallmark of **G# Dorian** (`G#-A-B-C#-D#-E-F#`). In Dorian, the `IV` chord is major (`C#`) and the `vii` is `F#m`. So that's not it.
        *   Wait, `F#` is the 7th degree. The chord is `F#maj6`. The 6th is `D#`. So the notes are `F#-A#-C#-D#`. This is an `F#` major 6th chord. This is the dominant of B major. It's a `V/V` in the key of E, and a `V/III` in the key of G# minor. It's a secondary dominant. It's there to add tension and strongly lead to the `B` chord. `F# -> B`. This fits the progression `...F#6 G#m...` No, it doesn't go to B. It goes back to G#m. This weakens the secondary dominant interpretation.
    *   **Let's go back to the most compelling feature:** The major chord built on the 7th degree (`F#`).
        *   G# Natural Minor has F#dim.
        *   G# Dorian has F#m.
        *   G# Harmonic Minor has F##dim.
        *   G# Melodic Minor has F#m7b5.
        *   The `F#maj6` chord is not native to any of the common minor modes *as a primary diatonic chord*. It's a *borrowed chord*. This is the concept of **modal interchange** or **mixture**.
    *   The progression is fundamentally in **G# Natural Minor (Aeolian mode)**, but it "borrows" the `F#maj6` chord from another mode to add color. Which mode? The most likely source is the **G# Dorian** mode, because raising the 7th degree (making F# major) is a common way to create a "Dorian feel." Even though the full chord isn't diatonic, the *flavor* is Dorian-ish.

10. **Final Conclusion Formulation:**
    *   **Key:** The tonal center is unequivocally **G# Minor**.
    *   **Mode:** This is the nuanced part.
        *   The primary harmonic structure (`i - III - VI`) is straight out of the **G# Natural Minor** scale (also known as the **Aeolian mode**).
        *   The presence of the `F#6` chord is a classic example of **modal interchange**. It borrows the sound of a major chord built on the 7th degree, a flavor strongly associated with the **Dorian mode**.
        *   The `Bm(b5)/G#` (which is `G#m7b5`) is a common tonic embellishment in modern minor-key music, adding a rich, tense color without changing the key center.
    *   **Best Answer:** State the key is G# Minor. Then explain the modal mixture. The most accurate description is that it's in **G# Minor**, primarily using the **Aeolian (Natural Minor) mode**, but with significant color from chords borrowed via modal interchange, most notably from the Dorian mode. Calling it "G# Dorian" would be incorrect because the core `i - III - VI` progression is not characteristic of Dorian (where it would be `i - IV - VI`). The use of `F#6` is an *addition* to an Aeolian framework, not a replacement of it.
    *   Structure the final answer:
        1.  Start with the clear, direct answer: Key is G# Minor.
        2.  Provide a simple chord-by-chord analysis to justify it (`i`, `VI`, `III`).
        3.  Address the "mode" question directly. Explain that it's not purely one mode.
        4.  Introduce the concept of modal interchange.
        5.  Explain the role of the `F#6` chord as the key piece of evidence for this mixture, linking its flavor to the Dorian mode.
        6.  Explain the role of the `Bm(b5)/G#` (`G#m7b5`) as a colorful, static embellishment of the tonic.
        7.  Conclude with a summary statement: The foundation is G# Aeolian, but it's enriched with borrowed chords, giving it a modern, sophisticated minor-key sound.


This is a fantastic chord progression that demonstrates modern minor-key harmony. Based on the analysis, here is the determination of the key and mode.

### The Short Answer

**Key:** G# Minor
**Mode:** Primarily **G# Aeolian (Natural Minor)** with strong elements of **modal interchange**, specifically borrowing the flavor of the **Dorian mode**.

### The Detailed Breakdown

Let's analyze why this is the case.

#### 1. Establishing the Tonal Center (Key)

The key is almost certainly **G# Minor** for several strong reasons:

*   **Frequency and Position:** The progression starts and ends on **G#m**. It is by far the most frequently used chord, firmly establishing it as the "home base" or **tonic (i)**.
*   **The Core Progression:** If we simplify the progression, we get a very common and logical minor key movement: `G#m -> B -> E -> G#m`.
    *   In the key of G# minor, these chords have clear functions:
        *   **G#m** = **i** (the tonic minor chord)
        *   **B** = **III** (the mediant chord)
        *   **E** = **VI** (the submediant chord, also the relative major)
    *   The `i - III - VI - i` progression is a staple of minor key music.

#### 2. Determining the Mode (The Nuance)

This is where it gets interesting. The progression doesn't fit neatly into a single diatonic mode because of two key chords: `F#6` and `Bm(b5)/G#`.

**A. The Foundation: Aeolian Mode (Natural Minor)**

The core chords (`G#m`, `B`, `E`) are all perfectly diatonic to the **G# Aeolian mode (G# Natural Minor)**.

The G# Natural Minor scale is: **G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F#**

*   `G#m` (i) = G# - B - D#
*   `B` (III) = B - D# - F#
*   `E` (VI) = E - G# - B

This suggests the fundamental harmonic language is Aeolian.

**B. The Twist: Modal Interchange**

The chords `F#6` and `Bm(b5)/G#` are non-diatonic and are used to add specific color and tension. This technique is called **modal interchange** (or borrowed chords), where you take a chord from a parallel mode (a mode that starts on the same tonic).

1.  **The `F#6` Chord:**
    *   The chord is `F#6` (F# - A# - C# - D#).
    *   In G# Natural Minor, the diatonic chord on the 7th degree is `F#dim` (F# - A - C#).
    *   The progression uses a **major `F#` chord**. Where does this come from? This is the biggest clue. A major chord built on the 7th degree is a characteristic sound of the **Dorian mode**.
    *   The G# Dorian scale is: **G# - A - B - C# - D# - E - F#**. While Dorian has an `F#m` chord, using a major `F#` chord is a common way to "borrow" the bright, hopeful Dorian flavor and insert it into a more standard minor progression. It lifts the harmony before returning to the dark tonic.

2.  **The `Bm(b5)/G#` Chord:**
    *   This is an inversion. The chord is `Bm(b5)` (B - D - F) with `G#` in the bass. The full chord contains the notes **G# - B - D - F**.
    *   This is a **G#m7(b5)** or **G#ø7** chord.
    *   This chord is not diatonic to G# Natural Minor. It's a rich, tense, and dissonant chord that functions here as an embellishment of the tonic. It creates a moment of ambiguity that is satisfyingly resolved by returning to the simple `G#m`. This is a very common sound in jazz, neo-soul, and modern rock.

### Conclusion

Your progression is in **G# Minor**.

Its foundation is built from chords of the **G# Aeolian (Natural Minor)** mode, giving it a classic minor key feel. However, it is enriched with sophisticated color by borrowing chords. The use of the **`F#6`** specifically borrows the bright flavor of the **Dorian mode**, while the **`G#m7(b5)`** adds a complex, modern tension to the tonic harmony.

Therefore, the most accurate description is **G# Minor with modal mixture.**
