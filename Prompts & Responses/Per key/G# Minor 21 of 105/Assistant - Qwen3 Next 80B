Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

> G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  G#m  G#m  B/F#  Bm(b5)/G#  G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  G#m  G#m  F#6  G#m

---

### Step 1: Identify the root chords

We can simplify by ignoring inversions for now and look at the *chord quality and root*:

- G#m (x6)
- E (x2, in first inversion: E/G#)
- B (x1, in first inversion: B/F#)
- Bm(b5) (x1, in first inversion: Bm(b5)/G#)
- F#6 (x1)

So the **core chords** are:  
**G#m, E, B, Bm(b5), F#6**

---

### Step 2: Analyze key signatures and functional harmony

#### Try: **Key of G# minor**

G# natural minor scale:  
**G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F#**

Chords built on each degree (natural minor):

| Degree | Chord     | Notes           |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| I      | G#m       | G# B D#         |
| ii     | A#m(b5)   | A# C# E         |
| III    | B         | B D# F#         |
| iv     | C#m       | C# E G#         |
| v      | D#m       | D# F# A#        |
| VI     | E         | E G# B          |
| VII    | F#        | F# A# C#        |

Now look at our progression:

- **G#m** ✅ — tonic (i)
- **E** ✅ — VI chord (relative major of G# minor)
- **B** ✅ — III chord (major, common in minor keys; D#-F# is major third and fifth)
- **Bm(b5)** — this is unusual. Bm(b5) = B D F# — that’s a half-diminished chord.  
   In G# minor, the chord on B is normally **B major** (III), not Bm(b5).  
   So **Bm(b5)** is *not* diatonic to G# natural minor.

- **F#6** — F# A# C# D# → F# major with added 6th (D#).  
   In G# minor, the VII chord is **F# major** (F# A# C#), so F#6 is an extended version — common in pop/rock for color.

But **Bm(b5)** is the problem. What key has Bm(b5) as a diatonic chord?

Let’s check **E major**:

E major scale: E F# G# A B C# D#

Chords:  
I=E, II=F#m, III=G#m, IV=A, V=B, VI=C#m, VII=D#m(b5)

→ So **D#m(b5)** is diatonic, not Bm(b5)

Wait — **Bm(b5)** = **B D F#** — what key contains this?

Try: **F# minor**

F# minor scale: F# G# A B C# D E

Chords:  
i = F#m  
ii = G#m(b5)  
III = A  
iv = Bm  
v = C#m  
VI = D  
VII = E

→ Here, **Bm** is iv. But we have **Bm(b5)** — which is B D F#, but in F# minor the iv chord is **Bm = B D# F#**, not B D F#.

So Bm(b5) = B D F# — this is **B half-diminished**, which is the **ii°7** chord in **A major** or **C# minor**.

Check **C# minor**:

C# natural minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

Chords:  
i = C#m  
ii = D#m(b5)  
III = E  
iv = F#m  
v = G#m  
VI = A  
VII = B

→ So **G#m** is v, **B** is VII (major), **E** is III (major) — **B** is major, not Bm(b5)

Still doesn't fit.

Wait — what if we consider **E major** again?

E major: E F# G# A B C# D#

Chords:  
I=E, II=F#m, **III=G#m**, IV=A, V=B, VI=C#m, VII=D#m(b5)

→ Again, **G#m = III**, **E = I**, **B = V**

But we have **Bm(b5)** — which is **B D F#** — but in E major, B is **B major (B D# F#)**.  
So **Bm(b5)** is **not diatonic**.

What is **Bm(b5)**?

**Bm(b5)** = B D F# — that's a chord with **minor third** and **diminished fifth** → half-diminished, aka **Bm7♭5**

This chord is **diatonic to C# minor** as the **ii°7**, but let's check:

C# minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

So B is the **7th scale degree**, and the chord built on B is **B D# F#** = **B major** — so **Bm(b5)** is NOT diatonic.

Wait — Bm(b5) could be a **borrowed chord** from another mode!

Let’s try **G# harmonic minor**:

G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F## (F## = G)

Chords on each degree:

i = G#m  
ii° = A#m(b5)  
III+ = B aug  
iv = C#m  
v = D#m  
VI = E  
VII = F##M7 (or F#7)

Still — **Bm(b5)** not here.

Now try **G# melodic minor (ascending)**:  
G# A# B C# D# E# F##  
→ Chords:  
i = G#m  
ii = A#m  
III+ = B+  
IV = C#M  
V = D#M  
VI = E#m  
VII = F##M7

Still no Bm(b5)

But now look — we have **Bm(b5)/G#** — meaning **G# in the bass**, so the chord is **Bm(b5)** with G# bass → inversion.

So actual sonority: **G# - B - D - F#**? Wait — Bm(b5) is **B D F#**, so with G# in bass:

→ Notes: **G#, B, D, F#**

What chord is **G# B D F#**?

That’s **G#m7**!  
G# - B (m3), D (dim5), F# (m7) → yes! → **G# half-diminished (G#m7♭5)**

Wait a second! **Bm(b5)/G#** is an **inversion of G#m7♭5**!

Similarly, **E/G#** = G# B D# E → that’s **G#m(add6)** or **E major with G# bass** — which is **E major triad over G#** → **G# maj6?** No, it's an **E major triad with G# in bass**: G# E G# B → so notes: **G#, B, E** — that's a **G# minor chord with added 6th (E)** — but B and E are 5th and 6th? Let’s map:

**E/G#**: Bass = G#, upper = E, G#, B → notes: G#, B, E → G#-B = m3, B-E = P4, G#-E = m6 → so **G#m6**

Similarly, **B/F#**: Bass=F#, upper=B, D#, F# → B-D#-F# = B major triad → so we have a **B major over F# bass** → F#-B-D# = **F# major with added major 6th?** F#-B = P4, B-D# = M3 → F# is root, B is 4th, D# is 6th → **F#6**

So let’s reinterpret the *sonorities* by their *full note content*:

---

### Step 3: Reconstruct full chords

1. G#m = **G# - B - D#**  
2. G#m  
3. E/G# = **G# - B - E** → **G#m(add6)** or **G#m6**  
4. E/G# = **G# - B - E**  
5. G#m  
6. G#m  
7. B/F# = **F# - B - D#** → **F#6** (since F#-B-D# = root, 4th, 6th — but wait, F# major is F#-A#-C#)  
   → **F# - B - D#** is **F#-B-D#**: B is the 4th (perfect 4th), D# is the 6th → **F#sus4(add6)**? Or just an **inversion of D#m7**?  
   Actually, **F# - B - D#** = **D#m7** (D#-F#-A#-C#) no… wait, this is only 3 notes.  
   Let's check: F# (root), B (4th), D# (6th) — but that’s not standard.

Wait — **B/F#** = B major triad with F# in bass → notes: F#, B, D# → this is **F# major** but with 4th (B) and 6th (D#)? No, major chord doesn’t have 4th.

Actually: **F# B D#** — this is the **first inversion of a D# minor 7th**? D#-F#-A#-C# — no C# here.

But **F# B D#** — this is **B major** triad (**B-D#-F#**) with **F# as bass** — so it’s an **inverted B major chord** — standard notation is **B/F#**, meaning B major with F# in bass.

So: **F#, B, D#** → that’s **B major** without the 3rd in bass? Wait — B major = B D# F# — that’s exactly those notes.

So **B/F#** = **B major** in 2nd inversion.

Similarly:

**Bm(b5)/G#** — Bm(b5) = **B D F#**, bass G# → so notes: **G#, B, D, F#**

What chord is **G# B D F#**?

- Root: G#
- 3rd: B (m3)
- 5th: D (dim5, b5)
- 7th: F# (m7)

→ This is **G# half-diminished 7th** — **G#m7♭5** (G#°7)

**F#6** = F# A# C# D# → F# major with added 6th

**E/G#** = G# B E → G#m6

**G#m** = G# B D#

So now the progression in full note content:

1. G#m — **G# B D#**  
2. G#m  
3. E/G# — **G# B E**  
4. E/G# — **G# B E**  
5. G#m — **G# B D#**  
6. G#m  
7. B/F# — **F# B D#** (B major in 2nd inversion)  
8. Bm(b5)/G# — **G# B D F#** → **G#m7♭5**  
9. G#m — G# B D#  
10. G#m  
11. E/G# — G# B E  
12. E/G# — G# B E  
13. G#m — G# B D#  
14. G#m  
15. F#6 — **F# A# C# D#**  
16. G#m — G# B D#

---

### Step 4: Harmonic Analysis — What key?

We see **G#m** is the tonic — appears 8 times.

We see **E major** triad (via E/G#) — that’s the **VI chord** in G# minor — very common.

We see **B major** — that’s the **III chord** in G# minor — major III is very common in minor keys (especially in pop/rock, derived from harmonic minor).

We see **G#m7♭5** — that’s a **ii°7 in C# minor**, or **viiø7 in A major**, but here it’s **functionally** as a **passing chord** or **borrowed chord**.

But wait — in **G# harmonic minor**, the **VII chord is F# major (F# A# C#)** — but we don’t have that here.

And we have **F#6** — which is **F# A# C# D#** — this is **not** diatonic to G# minor — it’s **borrowed from G# major**? But G# major has F##.

Wait — G# harmonic minor has F## (double sharp), not F#.

F#6 = F# A# C# D# → this is the **major 6th chord built on the leading tone** — not in G# minor.

**But here’s the key insight:**

**F#6** = **F# A# C# D#**

This is **identical** to **D#m7** — because D#-F#-A#-C# = D#m7 → and this is **vii°7 in E major**, or **ii°7 in C# minor**.

Wait — actually: **F# A# C# D#** — this is **F# major with added 6th (D#)** — so F#6.

What scale contains **F#6**?

Let’s check: **G# melodic minor ascending**

G# A# B C# D# E# F##

Doesn’t contain F#.

Wait — what if the **key is E major**?

E major: E F# G# A B C# D# → chords:

I=E, II=F#m, III=G#m, IV=A, V=B, VI=C#m, VII=D#m(b5)

→ Chords we have:

- G#m ✅ (III)
- E ✅ (I)
- B ✅ (V)
- F#6 = F# A# C# D# — **but in E major, F# is ii, which is F# A C# — minor!** → We have **F# A# C# D#**, which is **F# major with 6th** → but in E major, F# chord is **minor** — so **F# major** is **borrowed**.

So **F# major** is **not diatonic** to E major or G# minor.

But wait — **F#6** includes **D#**, which is the **6th of F#** — but this **D#** is also the **5th of G#m**.

Let’s consider this possibility: the **key is G# minor**, and **F#6** is a **chromatic passing chord** or **borrowed chord from G# major**?

G# major: G# A# B# C# D# E# F## — again, **F##**, not F#.

So F# is **not** in a major or minor scale of G#.

But here’s a better idea:

### What key has both G#m and F#6?

F#6 = F# A# C# D#

That’s **F# major** with added 6th — and **G#m** = G# B D#

We see **F#!** and **G#** — that’s a whole step apart.

This sounds like **a ii-V-I progression in the key of B major**? Not consistent.

Wait — perhaps the key is **C# minor**?

C# minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

Chords:
i = C#m
ii° = D#m(b5)
III = E
iv = F#m
v = G#m
VI = A
VII = B

→ So here we have:

- **G#m = v** ✅  
- **E = III** ✅  
- **B = VII** ✅ (major)  
- F#6? F# A# C# D# — but in C# minor, F# is F# A C# — **minor** chord (F#m).  
   F#6 has A# — so **A# instead of A natural** — so **F# major** is **borrowed from C# harmonic minor**?  
   C# harmonic minor: C# D# E F# G# A B# — wait, B#, not B — still no A#

C# melodic minor ascending: C# D# E F# G# A# B# — now we have A#!

→ So **C# melodic minor** has **A#** → F# = F# A# C# — that’s **F# major** — perfect!

Then **F#6 = F# A# C# D#** — D# is the 6th — diatonic in C# melodic minor.

G#m = G# B D# — B is natural, diatonic in C# melodic minor.

B = B# — but we have **B natural**!

Problem: in C# melodic minor ascending, VII = **B#** not B.

We have **B natural** chord → **B major = B D# F#**, which is **III chord in D major or B major**.

B natural = **not diatonic** to C# melodic minor, which has **B#**.

So **B major** requires **B natural**, but C# melodic minor has **B#**.

So we have **B natural**, **F# natural**, **G#**, and **E** — all points to **G# minor**.

Let’s go back — the **functional harmony**:

Core chords in **G# minor**:

- i = G#m  
- III = B major  
- VI = E major  
- VII = F# major (in harmonic minor)  
- Bm(b5) = not diatonic — but we found it’s **G#m7♭5** → **iiø7 in C# minor** — but **borrowed**

Wait — **G#m7♭5** is the **guitar voicing** — it’s the i chord with a raised 7th? Not really.

Another possibility: the Bm(b5)/G# (G#m7♭5) is a **passing chord** from G#m to the next E chord.

The most plausible key is **G# minor**, and the **non-diatonic chords** are **borrowed or chromatic passing chords**:

- **B major** → common in minor keys (from harmonic minor — it’s IV of V or just borrowed)
- **F#6** → could be borrowed from G# major (but G# major has F##) → perhaps **F#6** is a chromatic mediant or tension chord
- **Bm(b5)/G# = G#m7♭5** — this is the **iiø7 of C# minor** — so perhaps **modal interchange** from C# minor?

C# minor is the **relative minor of E major** — but we’re in G# minor.

G# minor and C# minor are a **perfect 5th apart** — strong relationship.

In minor key pop music, it’s common to borrow chords from the **parallel major** and the **relative major** and **neighboring minors**.

But **G#m7♭5** as a passing chord leading to E major? Let's see the progression:  
... G#m → G#m → B/F# → G#m7♭5 → G#m → ...

A better sequence in G# minor:  
i – i – VI – VI – i – i – **III** – **vii°7 (borrowed)** – i – i – VI – VI – i – i – **VII (F#)** – i

Ah! What if **F#6** is **F# major with 6th** — and F# is the **VIIdom chord in G# minor**? But VIs are major in harmonic minor.

Wait — **F#6** = F# A# C# D# — this is **identical to D#m7** — which is **v of G# minor**.

Let’s write **D#m7** = D# F# A# C# — yes!

But F#6 = F# A# C# D# — same notes as D#m7, just in different order!

So **F#6** and **D#m7** are **enharmonic voicings** — same set of notes.

So **F#6** = **D#m7** — which is the **v chord of G# minor** — **perfect!**

That means **F#6** is **D#m7** in **2nd inversion** — and it’s serving as **the dominant chord (v)** in G# minor!

In G# minor, the **v chord** is usually D#m, but in harmonic minor it’s often **D# major (V)** — to create stronger resolution.

But here we have **D#m7** — which can function as **v7**, not V7.

**G# harmonic minor**: G# A# B C# D# E F##  
So V = D# F## A# — **D# major**

But we have F# A# C# D# — that’s **F# A# C# D#** — **no F##** — it's **D#m7**, so it’s **from natural minor**

So if we use **natural minor** for the v chord: **D#m7**

And E = VI → common

B = III → common

Bm(b5)/G# = G#m7♭5 → this chord: **G#-B-D-F#** — it’s **not a diatonic chord**, but **it's a chromatic passing diminished chord**

Notice: From **B/F# (B D# F#)** to **G#m7♭5 (G# B D F#)** — you move from **D# down to D natural** — smooth voice-leading

Then to **G#m (G# B D#)** — **D natural → D#** — so that’s a smooth chromatic passing tone.

So the sequence:  
B/F# → G#m7♭5 → G#m  
→ D# → D → D# — chromatic descent on the 5th

So **G#m7♭5** is a **chromatic passing chord**, not a borrowed chord from another key.

---

### ✅ Final Conclusion:

**Key: G# minor (natural minor)**  
**Mode: Dorian? Phrygian?** — but **no, it's just natural minor (Aeolian)** because:

- We have **F#** not F## — so harmonic minor is **not** in use
- We have **D#** not D## — so not melodic minor ascending
- Chord **D#m7** (as F#6) = v chord from natural minor — no raised 7th
- Chord **B major** is common as borrowed III in minor keys
- F#6 is **D#m7** — v7, diatonic to natural minor
- G#m7♭5 is a chromatic passing chord — occurs between B major (with D#) and G#m (with D#), resolving chromatically: D# → D → D#

So while a **VII chord (F#)** exists in harmonic minor, here **F#6 = D#m7** — the **v chord** — so the **leading tone is natural (F#)**, not raised (F##).

Therefore, the scale is **G# natural minor (Aeolian)**.

**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**

**Key: G# minor**

---

### ✅ Answer:

> **Key: G# minor**  
> **Mode: Aeolian (Natural Minor)**

The non-diatonic chords (like B major and G#m7♭5) are either borrowed (B major) or chromatic passing tones (G#m7♭5), common in pop/rock harmony, but the underlying key and mode remain **G# Aeolian**.
