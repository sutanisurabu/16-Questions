### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord modifications**

I'm working through the implications of reducing the fifth in a B minor triad, which gives me B-D-F natural. Then, with a G# bass, I'm considering G# minor, where I need to think about its harmonic structure. G# natural minor has the notes G#-A#-B-C#-D#-E-F#. In harmonic minor, the leading tone is F double sharp, which equates to G natural sound-wise. However, my focus is on whether F natural is fitting in G# minor. It looks like it's not diatonic.**Clarifying chord structure**

I’m realizing that the 7th in G# natural minor is F#, not F, meaning F natural is a lowered 7th and not part of the key. I’m pondering whether the chord in question could be "Bm(b5)/G#"–but perhaps they mean "Bm7(b5)/G#." It’s odd that Bm(b5) is written, as it usually indicates half-diminished. So, if it's a B diminished triad over a G# bass, I see how that relates to a G#7b9 chord without the 3rd. B is a minor third above G#.**Exploring chord progressions**

I’m looking at the relationship from G# to F, which is a major sixth down or a minor seventh up. F is usually spelled E# in this context, so I’m wondering if F natural acts as a diminished 13 relative to G#. The G# major scale leads to a messy outcome with the chord combinations. Alternatively, could the key be B major instead? The progression includes G#m and E/G# and returns to G#m frequently as the tonic. Bm(b5)/G# seems like it’s stepping outside of the key.**Determining tonal center**

I believe the tonal center is G# minor, which is the relative minor of B major. The presence of E major as the VI chord supports this minor tonality. Looking at the F#6 chord near the end, which likely consists of F#-A#-C#-D#, I realize that F# acts as the VII chord in natural minor. In G# natural minor, the 7th is F#, so the VII chord is indeed F# major. This means F#6 adds the 6th with D#.**Determining key and mode**

I’m considering that the tonal center is G# minor, likely in the Aeolian mode since it uses F#. The odd Bm(b5)/G# chord could be interpreted as Bm7(b5)/G#, which contains notes that don’t fit within the key. The progression features a repeating G# pedal while other voices move, with E/G# as a VI in first inversion. I think the final conclusion should be: the key is G# minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian), with Bm(b5)/G# as a chromatic passing chord.

Key: G# minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Rationale: G#m is the clear tonal center; E major (VI) and F#6 (bVII add6) are diatonic to G# natural minor. No raised 7th (Fx) or dominant D#(7) appears, pointing to Aeolian rather than harmonic/melodic minor. The Bm(b5)/G# functions as a chromatic/passing sonority over a tonic pedal.
