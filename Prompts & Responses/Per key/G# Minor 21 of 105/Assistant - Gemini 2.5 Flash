This chord progression, though brief, strongly suggests the **key of E Harmonic Minor** with a consistent emphasis on the tonic G\#m.

Here is the analysis:

1. **Focus on the Tonic:** The progression starts and ends on **G\#m**. This is the most weighted chord, indicating the tonic.

2. **Establish the Scale:** The notes implied by the G\#m chord are G\#, B, and D\#. The chords used (G\#m, E, F\#6, Bm(b5)/G\#) point to the notes of the **E Harmonic Minor scale**:
    * **E Harmonic Minor:** E - F\# - G - A - B - C - D\# (Relative major: G Major)

3. **Chord Function Analysis (Relative to G\#m):**

    * **G\#m (i):** The Tonic Minor chord.
    * **E/G\# (VI/i inversion):** The Submediant chord (VI) of E Harmonic Minor (E Major) with the bass note G\#. This is a common color chord, borrowed directly from the parallel major or used as the Submediant of the parent scale.
    * **B/F\# (V/iii inversion):** The dominant chord (V) of the parent scale E minor, with F\# in the bass. The B major chord strongly acts as the dominant (V) function, but diatonic to E Minor would imply Bm. The B major (sometimes noted as B7 in longer contexts) contains the leading tone D\#, solidifying the Harmonic Minor flavor.
    * **Bm($\text{b}$5)/G\#:** This is arguably the most unusual chord. The notes of Bm($\text{b}$5) are B - D - F, which is a diatonic chord in E Natural Minor (the **v** chord). Placing G\# in the bass (a root of the tonic) creates a tense passing chord. This chord is less about function and more about creating brief tension before moving back to the tonic.
    * **F\#6:** This chord (F\# - A\# - C\# - D\#) is the **ii$\text{o}^{6}$** chord used in some Romantic-era sequences, but more directly, the F\# major triad is the **ii** chord of E Harmonic Minor (where the $A\sharp$ is often used enharmonically as B$\flat$ in analysis). The 6th (D\#) heightens the dominant function by incorporating the leading tone. It resolves strongly back to G\#m.

**Conclusion:**

* **Key:** **E Harmonic Minor**

* **Mode:** **Harmonic Minor** (The presence of the B major chord, which contains the raised 7th - D\# - is the defining feature of the Harmonic Minor scale).

*(Note: While the tonic is G\#m, the structural key itself is defined by the underlying E Harmonic Minor scale, which is sometimes referred to as the Eolian mode with a raised 7th, or more traditionally, the Harmonic Minor mode.)*
