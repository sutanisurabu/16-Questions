**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: G#m, G#m, E/G#, E/G#, G#m, G#m, B/F#, Bm(b5)/G#, G#m, G#m, E/G#, E/G#, G#m, G#m, F#6, G#m.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are many G#m chords, it might be in a key where G# minor is the tonic. But let's look at the other chords.

The chords are:

- G#m (G# minor)

- E/G# (E major with G# in the bass? But E/G# might imply an E major chord with G# as the bass note, which is actually an inversion. But in terms of chord function, E major is the relative major of G# minor? Let's think about keys.

G# minor is the relative minor of B major. The key of B major has five sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#. But G# minor is the relative minor, so it should have the same key signature as B major, which is five sharps.

But let's list the chords:

- G#m: G# B D#

- E/G#: E major chord is E G# B, so with G# in bass, it's still an E major chord, just inverted.

- B/F#: B major chord with F# in bass? B major is B D# F#, so with F# in bass, it's an inversion.

- Bm(b5)/G#: B minor flat five? Bm(b5) would be B D F, but that doesn't fit with G# in bass? Wait, Bm(b5) is actually a half-diminished chord, so B D F A? But it's written as Bm(b5)/G#, so the chord is B half-diminished with G# in bass? But B half-diminished is B D F A, and G# is not in that chord. That might be a typo or something. Let me read carefully.

It says Bm(b5)/G#. Bm(b5) typically means B half-diminished, which is B D F A. But with /G# means G# in the bass. But G# is not part of the B half-diminished chord, so this might be a different chord. Perhaps it's a slash chord where the upper structure is Bm(b5) and the bass is G#. But Bm(b5) is B D F, and if bass is G#, it could be implying a G# diminished or something? This is confusing.

Maybe it's a mistake, and it's supposed to be something else. Let's look at the context. The progression has G#m and E/G#, which are common in G# minor key.

In G# minor, the chords would be:

- i: G#m

- VII: F# major? But we have E major and B major.

G# natural minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F# G# so chords: i G#m, ii° A#dim, III B major, iv C#m, v D#m, VI E major, VII F# major.

But here we have E major, which is VI, and B major, which is III. But we also have Bm(b5) which is not in the natural minor. Bm(b5) would be B D F, but in G# minor, the B chord is major because the third is D# from the scale, not D natural. So B minor would have D natural, which is not in the key of G# minor.

Perhaps it's in harmonic minor or melodic minor.

G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F## G# so F double sharp, which is equivalent to G natural, but that might be messy.

In harmonic minor, the V chord is D# major or D#7, and the vii° chord is F## diminished, which is G diminished.

But we have B/F# and Bm(b5)/G#.

Bm(b5) is B D F, which sounds like a half-diminished chord, and in minor keys, the ii chord is often half-diminished. In G# minor, the ii chord would be A# half-diminished? A#m(b5) is A# C# E G#? No, A# half-diminished would be A# C# E G#, but that's not B.

Let's list all chords without inversions for simplicity. The inversions might not affect the key analysis.

So chords: G#m, E, G#m, B, Bm(b5), G#m, E, G#m, F#6, G#m.

From the progression: G#m, G#m, E, E, G#m, G#m, B, Bm(b5), G#m, G#m, E, E, G#m, G#m, F#6, G#m.

So the sequence is mostly G#m and E, with B and Bm(b5) and F#6.

Bm(b5) is unusual. Bm(b5) is B D F, which is a half-diminished chord. In which key does B half-diminished occur?

B half-diminished is the vii°7 chord in C major or C minor? In C major, vii°7 is B half-diminished? No, in C major, the vii chord is B diminished, which is B D F, but that's fully diminished? No, B diminished triad is B D F, which is diminished, but in seventh chords, B half-diminished is B D F A, which is the seventh chord built on the seventh scale degree in C major? Let's recall.

In major keys, the seventh chord on the seventh scale degree is half-diminished only in natural minor? I'm getting confused.

Standard diatonic chords:

In major key: I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii°.

vii° is diminished triad, and if seventh chord, it is half-diminished? No, in major key, the seventh chord on scale degree 7 is a half-diminished chord only if we use the natural seventh? Let's think about C major.

C major scale: C D E F G A B C

Chords: I C, ii Dm, iii Em, IV F, V G, vi Am, vii° Bdim (B D F)

Seventh chords: I maj7, ii m7, iii m7, IV maj7, V7, vi m7, vii half-diminished? B D F A is Bm7b5, which is half-diminished, and it is the seventh chord on scale degree 7 in major key? Yes, in major key, the seventh chord on vii is half-diminished.

But in terms of triad, vii is diminished.

In minor keys, it's more complex.

Back to our progression. We have G#m, which is i, E which is VI, B which is III, and F#6 which is VII. But Bm(b5) is not III; III in minor is major chord.

So Bm(b5) is B D F, which has D natural and F natural, whereas in G# minor, we have D# and F#? So it's borrowing from another scale.

Perhaps the key is G# minor, but using chords from harmonic minor or other modes.

Another thought: perhaps the Bm(b5) is actually a different chord. Notice that it is written as Bm(b5)/G#, which means the bass is G#. So the chord has G# in bass, and the upper part is Bm(b5). But Bm(b5) is B D F, so with G# in bass, it could be interpreted as a G# chord with added notes? G# B D F? That sounds like G# half-diminished? G# half-diminished is G# B D F#, but here F natural, so it's G# diminished? G# diminished triad is G# B D, and if add F, it's G# fully diminished seventh? G# B D F is indeed G# diminished seventh chord, because diminished seventh chords are symmetric.

B D F is B diminished triad, and if we add G#? B diminished seventh chord is B D F Ab, which is the same as G# diminished seventh? Yes, because diminished seventh chords are symmetric, so B diminished seventh is B D F Ab, and Ab is the same as G#.

So Bm(b5)/G# might be a way of writing G# diminished seventh chord? Bm(b5) is B D F, which is B diminished triad, and with G# in bass, it becomes G# B D F, which is G# diminished seventh chord.

Yes! That makes sense. So effectively, Bm(b5)/G# is G# diminished seventh chord.

In chord progressions, diminished chords often function as leading tones or passing chords.

Similarly, B/F# is B major with F# in bass, which is just an inversion.

So let's rewrite the progression with root positions for analysis:

- G#m

- G#m

- E (since E/G# is E major with G# bass, but root is E)

- E

- G#m

- G#m

- B (since B/F# is B major with F# bass, root B)

- G#dim7 (from Bm(b5)/G#)

- G#m

- G#m

- E

- E

- G#m

- G#m

- F#6 (F# major with added 6th? F#6 chord is F# A# C# D#? Typically F#6 is F# A# C# D#, which is like D#m7? But anyway)

- G#m

So the chords are: G#m, E, B, G#dim7, F#6.

Now, in the context of G# minor, these chords can be explained.

G# minor key:

- i: G#m

- VI: E major

- III: B major

- vii°7: G#dim7? In G# minor, the leading tone is F##, which is G, so the diminished chord on the leading tone would be F## diminished, which is G dim, but G#dim7 would be on the tonic? No.

In minor key, the diminished seventh chord is usually built on the leading tone. In G# harmonic minor, the leading tone is F##, so the diminished seventh chord is F## A# C# E, which is F##dim7.

But here we have G#dim7, which is built on the tonic? That doesn't make sense as a leading tone chord.

G#dim7 would be the diminished seventh chord from A harmonic minor? Let's think.

G#dim7 consists of G# B D F. In terms of scale degrees in G# minor, if we use harmonic minor, the scale is G# A# B C# D# E F## G#. So the notes are G# A# B C# D# E F## G#. F## is G, so G# B D F? F is not in the scale; F## is G, so F natural is not in the scale. So G#dim7 has F natural, which is not in G# harmonic minor.

Perhaps it's from G# melodic minor? Melodic minor ascending: G# A# B C# D# E# F## G# so E# is F, F## is G, so still no F natural.

So G#dim7 is not diatonic to G# minor.

But in chord progressions, diminished chords are often used as passing chords or from other functions.

Another possibility: perhaps the key is E major.

E major key has chords: E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim.

In E major, G#m is iii, B is V, E is I, F#6 is II6? F#6 is not a standard diatonic chord in E major; F# is ii, which is F#m, so F#6 would be F# major with 6th, but in E major, ii is F#m, so F# major is not diatonic. F#6 would imply F# A# C# D#, but in E major, the A is A natural, so A# is not in the key, so F#6 is not diatonic to E major.

Similarly, G#dim7 is not diatonic to E major.

So perhaps it's in B major.

B major key: B, C#m, D#m, E, F#, G#m, A#dim.

Chords: G#m is vi, E is IV, B is I, F# is V, but F#6 is V with 6th? F#6 is F# A# C# D#, and in B major, A# is the leading tone, so F#6 has A# which is diatonic, but F#6 is not a standard chord; it might be used as a passing chord. But we have G#dim7, which is not diatonic to B major.

G#dim7 has G# B D F, and in B major, we have G# and B, but D and F are not in B major; B major has D# and F#.

So not B major.

Let's list the notes used in the chords.

G#m: G# B D#

E: E G# B

B: B D# F#

G#dim7: G# B D F

F#6: F# A# C# D#? F#6 typically means F# major chord with added 6th, so notes: F# A# C# D#? But usually, a 6th chord has the 6th from the root, so for F#6, root F#, major third A#, fifth C#, and sixth D#. So notes F# A# C# D#.

Now, let's find a key that contains these notes.

From the chords, we have notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#? From G#dim7, we have D and F, which are flat compared to D# and F#.

So the scale might have both D and D# and both F and F#? That would be a chromatic scale or something.

Perhaps the key is G# minor, and the G#dim7 is a common-tone diminished chord or something.

Another idea: in minor keys, the diminished chord on the raised seventh is common, but here it's on G#, which is the tonic.

Let's look at the progression: after G#m and E, we have B and then G#dim7, then back to G#m. So G#dim7 might be functioning as a leading chord to G#m? But diminished chords usually lead to chords a half-step above or below, but G#dim7 to G#m is same root? Not necessarily.

G#dim7 shares notes with G#m? G#m is G# B D#, G#dim7 is G# B D F, so they share G# and B, but D# vs D, and F is additional. So it's not directly related.

Perhaps G#dim7 is acting as a substitute for another chord.

Notice that G#dim7 is the same as Bdim7, Ddim7, Fdim7, so it's symmetric.

In the progression, it comes after B major, so perhaps it's a chromatic passing chord.

But let's consider the mode. Perhaps it's in G# Phrygian or something.

List all the roots: G#, E, B, G#, F#.

So the tonic seems to be G#, since it starts and ends on G#m.

So let's assume G# is the tonic.

Now, what mode has G# as tonic with minor chord?

The chords E and B are major, which in minor key, III and VI are major, so that fits G# natural minor.

But then we have G#dim7 and F#6.

F#6 in G# minor would be the VII chord, but in natural minor, VII is F# major, which is F# A# C#, and F#6 would be F# A# C# D#, so it adds D# which is the fifth of G#m, so it might be a common chord.

But G#dim7 is the problem.

Perhaps G#dim7 is a secondary dominant or something.

G#dim7 could be the diminished chord leading to A minor, but we don't have A minor here.

Another thought: in music, sometimes diminished chords are used as passing chords between chords.

In this case, from B to G#m, G#dim7 might be used to smooth the transition.

But let's look at the bass lines. The inversions might be important.

The progression has E/G# which means E major with G# bass, so the bass is G# for that chord. Similarly, B/F# has F# bass, and Bm(b5)/G# has G# bass.

So let's list the bass notes:

- G#m: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- E/G#: bass G#

- E/G#: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- B/F#: bass F#

- Bm(b5)/G#: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- E/G#: bass G#

- E/G#: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- G#m: bass G#

- F#6: bass F#? F#6 chord, typically the bass is F# unless specified otherwise.

- G#m: bass G#

So the bass is mostly G#, with two F# points.

So the bass is emphasizing G# strongly, which supports G# as tonic.

Now, for the mode, let's see the scale used.

From the chords:

- G#m: G# B D# — so notes B and D#.

- E: E G# B — so E, G#, B.

- B: B D# F# — so D# and F#.

- G#dim7: G# B D F — so D and F.

- F#6: F# A# C# D# — so A# and C# and D#.

So all notes together: G#, A#, B, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#.

So we have all notes from G# to F# except for A? We have A# but not A natural. So the scale has A# and no A, so it's like G# B C# D# E F# G#? But we have D and F natural, which are chromatic.

The consistent notes are G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#? But from E chord, we have E, which is natural, and from G#m, we have D#, from B, we have D# and F#, from F#6, we have A# and C# and D#.

So the diatonic notes would be G# A# B C# D# E F#? That is the G# natural minor scale? G# natural minor is G# A# B C# D# E F# G#, yes! So the scale of G# natural minor has all these notes except for the chromatic D and F from the diminished chord.

So the underlying key is G# natural minor.

The chords E and B are diatonic to G# natural minor: E is VI, B is III.

F#6 is VII with an added 6th, which is still diatonic since F# major is VII.

The only non-diatonic chord is G#dim7, which is used for color or as a passing chord.

In many songs, diminished chords are used chromatically without changing the key.

So I think the key is G# minor, and the mode is natural minor or Aeolian mode.

But let's confirm the F#6 chord. In G# natural minor, the VII chord is F# major, and F#6 is just a variation, adding the 6th, which is D#, which is the fifth of the scale, so it's fine.

Therefore, the key is G# minor.

But to be precise, since most chords are from natural minor, and the diminished chord is auxiliary, we can say the key is G# minor.

So for the answer, key of G# minor.

But the question says "determine key and mode". Mode might be Aeolian.

But in popular music, often just key is specified.

Perhaps it's G# Aeolian.

But let's see if there is a better fit.

Another thought: the chord Bm(b5)/G# is interpreted as G#dim7, but in context, it might be functioning as a dominant substitute.

In G# minor, the dominant is D# major or D#7, but here we have B major which is III, and then G#dim7, which might be related to D#7.

G#dim7 is equivalent to D#7b9 without the root? D#7 is D# F## A# C#, and D#7b9 is D# F## A# C E? No, D#7b9 has E? Let's see.

D#7 chords: D# F## A# C#.

G#dim7 is G# B D F.

If we compare, G#dim7 shares notes with D#7: D#7 has D# F## A# C#, and G#dim7 has G# B D F, so no common notes? F## is G, so D#7 has D# G A# C#, and G#dim7 has G# B D F, so still no common tones.

But G#dim7 is the same as Bdim7, which is the vii°7 of C major, but not related directly.

Perhaps it's a common-tone diminished chord for G#m.

In many progressions, a diminished chord on the tonic is used to add tension before resolving to the tonic, but here it comes after B major and before G#m, so it might be a passing chord.

I think for practical purposes, the key is G# minor.

So I'll go with that.

The chord progression is primarily based on G# minor, with the tonic chord G#m appearing frequently throughout. The chords E (or E/G#) and B (or B/F#) are diatonic to the G# natural minor scale (Aeolian mode), functioning as the VI and III chords, respectively. The F#6 chord is also diatonic, representing the VII chord with an added 6th.

The Bm(b5)/G# chord is interpreted as a G# diminished seventh chord (G#dim7), which is non-diatonic to G# natural minor but is used chromatically as a passing chord or for tension, without altering the overall key.

The strong emphasis on G#m as the tonic and the use of diatonic chords support the key of G# minor. The mode is Aeolian, as the progression aligns with the G# natural minor scale (G# A# B C# D# E F#).

**Key:** G# minor  
**Mode:** Aeolian
