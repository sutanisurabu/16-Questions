### Reasoning

**Determining Chord Keys and Modes**

I'm currently working through the chord progression, breaking down each chord to understand its function. The repetition of G#m in the first section suggests it's a primary key, but the presence of other chords like E/G# and B/F# is key. I'm noting the slash chords and their potential impact on the overall feel. My focus is now on identifying the function of each chord to determine the key and mode.


**Dissecting Harmonic Functions**

I've been analyzing the chord functions within the G# minor framework. The E/G#, and B/F# chords are presenting some interesting harmonic tensions. Also, the presence of F#6 is particularly intriguing; its D# suggests a possible move towards the G# minor's harmonic or melodic form. I'm now exploring how these altered chords color the progression.


**Re-evaluating the Mode**

The presence of the Bm(b5)/G# chord with a D natural is really throwing me a curveball. It’s clashing with the G# natural minor and pointing toward something more complex. I'm now looking at G# modes containing the D natural, considering harmonic minor, melodic minor, and other possibilities. I’m starting to think we have a minor key with chromatic alterations.


**Determining the Mode's Nuances**

I'm now zeroing in on the function of Bm(b5)/G#. This chord still seems to be the key to understanding the mode. I've considered its role as a passing chord and its relationship to the natural minor, but I'm investigating how it serves as a chromatic element within the larger G# minor context. Is it a brief borrowing, a momentary alteration, or a key harmonic driver?


**Identifying Chromatic Borrowing**

I've determined G# natural minor as the base mode, and now I'm interpreting the Bm(b5)/G# chord. It functions as chromatic color, borrowed or substituted from outside the G# Aeolian framework. It's likely a passing chord. The natural D is creating tension but doesn't override the established G# minor.




Based on the provided chord progression, we can determine the key and mode by identifying the stable tonic chord and analyzing the relationships of the surrounding chords.

## 1. Determine the Key (Tonic Center)

*   The progression begins and ends on **G#m**.
*   **G#m** is the most frequently repeated chord.
*   The final cadence resolves strongly back to **G#m**.

The tonal center (tonic) is **G#**.

## 2. Analyze the Chords and Diatonic relationships

The primary chords used are:

| Chord | Notes | Roman Numeral (relative to G#) | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G#m** | G# B D# | i | Tonic Minor |
| **E/G#** | E G# B | VI | Relative Major / Submediant |
| **B/F#** | B D# F# | III | Relative Major |
| **F#6** | F# A# C# D# | VII | Subtonic / Dominant Function |

If we look at the natural minor scale starting on G#, the notes are: **G# A# B C# D# E F#**.

All the core, stable chords (G#m, E, B, F#) fit perfectly within the G# natural minor scale (Aeolian mode).

*   i (G#m)
*   III (B)
*   VI (E)
*   VII (F#)

### Addressing the Chromatic Chord

The progression includes one anomalous chord: **Bm(b5)/G#** (B Half-Diminished).
*   Notes: **B, D, F#**
*   This chord uses a **D natural** instead of the expected D# (D# is needed for the G# minor tonic triad and the G# natural minor scale).

The presence of D natural is chromatic and does not belong to the G# natural minor scale. However, this chord is temporary and serves a passing function between B/F# and G#m. It does not replace the tonic or dramatically change the overall harmonic landscape provided by the other chords. It is best interpreted as a borrowed or decorative chord.

## Conclusion

The overwhelming majority of the harmony establishes the G# minor triad as the tonic (i) and relies on the submediant (VI) and subtonic (VII) chords derived from the natural minor scale.

Therefore, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** G# minor
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian** (Natural Minor)
