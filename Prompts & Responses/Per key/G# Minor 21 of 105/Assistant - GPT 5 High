### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequences**

I need to analyze the chord sequence to determine the key and mode. The progression contains G# minor and E major over G#, along with other chords like B/F# and Bm(b5)/G#. 

When looking at Bm(b5), it really implies a B diminished figure. So it gives us a G# diminished seventh chord with G# as the root and B, D, and F on top. This suggests they are using it as a leading tone diminished chord to A.**Resolving the chord progression**

I’m thinking that G#o7 typically resolves to either A minor or A major since it serves as a leading tone to A. In A minor, G#o7 acts as the vii°7. However, the progression has a lot of G#m chords, which makes me reconsider my mapping. 

In G# minor, the leading tone is G# natural, but wait—G# minor's leading tone actually is F##, not G natural. So, I need to keep that in mind when analyzing the relationships!**Clarifying harmonic structure**

I'm diving into the harmonic minor of G# minor, which uses F double sharp in this context. The vii° chord in G# minor would be F## diminished, but it can appear as G diminished. So, G#°7 isn't functioning as a leading tone but usually leads to A minor. 

I’m now considering if “Bm(b5)/G#” could be interpreted as Bm(b5) over the G# bass, which might suggest G#7b9. B, D, and F form a tritone with G# in the bass. I guess B is a minor third above G#, so maybe it behaves as A## instead.**Examining note relationships**

I’m analyzing the notes in relation to G#. The third of G# would be B#, so B natural is actually a flat third. D serves as a diminished fifth since it’s flat compared to D#. Then, F would be the minor seventh. 

However, the major seventh would be F##. To clarify, in the G# major scale, F natural is treated as a doubly flat seventh, and G# to F is a minor seventh, confirming that it fits that role when considered correctly!**Decoding chord functions**

The seventh note from G# is F## for a major seventh, but F natural serves as the minor seventh. So, G# B D F gives me a G#°7 diminished chord, which can act as a leading tone to A minor. While analyzing surrounding chords, it begins to feel rooted in G# minor.

However, the presence of the Bm(b5)/G# chord raises questions; it could hint at a common-tone diminished chord built on the tonic. But if we think about the key being B major, Bm(b5) doesn't fit. I just need to sort through these chords carefully!**Analyzing chord functions in context**

Over a G# bass, G#°7 acts as a leading-tone diminished chord to A minor. However, in B major, it feels like a chromatic passing chord. This G#°7 resolves to G#m, emphasizing the vi chord structure. The progression includes B/F#, Bm(b5)/G#, and G#m, hinting at G# minor as the underlying key.

The F#6 chord acts as the subtonic, with G#°7 functioning as a common-tone diminished chord. Ultimately, I conclude that the key center is G# minor (Aeolian), with a vibrant harmonic vocabulary mixing B major elements as well.**Summarizing key details**

If I'm analyzing the context in B major, it's centered around G# minor (vi chord) and hints at an iv chord structure. The repeated patterns point towards the Aeolian mode. To keep things straightforward, I’ll outline a direct answer focusing on the key and mode.

The tonal center is G#, and the mode is Aeolian. There's a mixture with a leading-tone diminished chord leading to A. I think this will be clear and helpful!

Key: G# minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Notes:
- E/G# = VI in first inversion.
- B/F# = III in second inversion.
- Bm(b5)/G# is enharmonically G#°7, a common‑tone diminished chord resolving to i (G#m).
- F#6 = VII with added 6 (subtonic with added sixth).
The progression strongly centers on G#m and uses typical Aeolian functions (VI, III, VII).
