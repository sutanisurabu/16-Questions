### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm exploring the chord progression: "G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m." I need to figure out the key and mode. 

It looks like we have G# minor, E major with G# in the bass, and B major over F#. The Bm(b5) chord is crucial, indicating a diminished triad, which leads me to think of G# diminished seventh. However, this context feels a little strange in G# minor, so I need to double-check that!**Exploring chord relationships**

I'm breaking down the chords, focusing on E/G# and B/F#. The notes for E/G# are E-G#-B, while B/F# consists of B-D#-F#. F#6 is essentially F#-A#-C#-D#. For G# minor, there are possibilities for the structure, like G# natural minor and relative major B.

Looking at the degrees in G# natural minor, I've pinpointed my chords: G#m for i, E/G# as VI, and others too. So far, everything is connecting well!**Understanding chord functionality**

In G# natural minor, E major is diatonic, consisting of E-G#-B. B/F# acts as the III chord with the fifth in bass, while Bm(b5)/G# creates a diminished triad. However, since B-D-F contains D natural and F natural, it borrows chromatically from A minor, presenting as the leading-tone fully diminished seventh chord.

G#°7 typically resolves to A minor or major, which seems non-diatonic in G# minor. I wonder if "Bm(b5)" might have been meant as Bm7b5 instead, but it’s labeled as Bm(b5)/G#. Interesting!**Clarifying chord transitions**

If I consider Bm7b5 (B-D-F-A) over G#, it would suggest G#-B-D-F-A, which could be interpreted as G#ø9. But it’s tricky, and they did write Bm(b5)/G# specifically. This results in a G# diminished seventh chord that usually resolves to A minor or major, not G# minor.

After Bm(b5)/G#, the progression returns to G#m. I’m testing if G#dim7 resolves to G#m. However, the leading-tone in G# minor is G natural, not G#. So I’m clearly getting my notes a bit confused here!**Determining key and mode**

To resolve to G# as the tonic, the leading tone would be G natural. However, in the context of G# minor, I realize the leading tone is actually F double sharp. So, for G# minor, the scale is G# A# B C# D# E F## G#. The diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone functions as an embellishment leading to G# minor.

The presence of F#6 suggests it's the VII chord in G# natural minor. I conclude the key is G# minor, with the mode being natural minor (Aeolian). The chord Bm(b5)/G# serves as a passing chord, enhancing the tonic. Ultimately, the progression emphasizes G#m, marking it as the tonic.**Summarizing the chord progression**

The chord progression is in G# minor, specifically using the natural minor (Aeolian) mode. The diatonic chords include i, VI6/3 (E/G#), III6/5 (B/F#), and the subtonic VII chord with an added sixth (F#6). The Bm(b5)/G# acts as an enharmonic G#°7, functioning as a common-tone diminished leading back to the tonic. Although it could be heard as relative B major focusing on the vi chord, the recurring cadence emphasizes G#m as the minor tonic.

Key: G# minor
Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)

Notes:
- Diatonic chords: G#m (i), E/G# (VI in first inversion), B/F# (III in second inversion), F#6 (VII with added 6).
- Bm(b5)/G# is enharmonic to G#°7 (G#–B–D–F), a common‑tone diminished chord resolving back to i.
- No raised leading tone appears (no F## or D# major V), so it’s Aeolian rather than harmonic minor.
