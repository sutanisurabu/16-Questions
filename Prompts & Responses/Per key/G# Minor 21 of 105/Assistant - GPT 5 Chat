Let’s analyze this progression step by step:

**Chord sequence:**
```
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm(b5)/G# – 
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m
```

---

### 1. Identify potential key centers
The prominent repeated chord is **G#m**, suggesting **G# minor** as the tonic.

The other chords appearing:
- **E/G# = E major in first inversion (E–G#–B)**  
  → relates to VI in G# minor.
- **B/F# = B major in 2nd inversion (B–D#–F#)**  
  → relates to III in G# minor.
- **Bm(b5)/G# = B–D–F (half-diminished flavor) over G# bass**  
  → introduces the note D natural — characteristic of the *natural minor* (aeolian) scale.
- **F#6 = F#–A#–C#–D#**  
  → V with added 6; implies harmonic-minor flavor (D# as leading tone).

### 2. Determine scale consistency
G# **natural minor (Aeolian)** has:
G# A# B C# D# E F#

The occurrence of:
- **E major (E–G#–B)** fits (it’s VI).
- **B major (B–D#–F#)** fits (it’s III).
- **Bm(b5)** introduces **D natural**, which doesn’t belong to harmonic or pure Aeolian — a chromatic borrowed chord for color.
- **F#6 (F#–A#–C#–D#)** is V6 in G# harmonic minor.

This mix of Aeolian and harmonic minor material is common.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**
- **Key:** G# minor  
- **Mode:** Primarily **G# natural minor (Aeolian)** with elements of the **harmonic minor** (F#6 implying raised 7th, D#).  

So we’d call it **G# minor**, with modal interchange (occasional natural vs harmonic minor use).
