Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. List the chords with their likely functions**

Chords given:  
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm(b5)/G# – G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m

First, identify the root chords without inversions:  
G#m, E, B, Bm(b5), F#6.

---

**2. Check key possibilities**

- **G# minor** key signature: 5 sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#).  
  Diatonic chords in G# natural minor:  
  G#m, A#dim, B, C#m, D#m, E, F#.

  - G#m = i  
  - E = VI (E major in G# natural minor)  
  - B = III (B major in G# natural minor)  
  - F# = VII (F# major in G# natural minor)  
  - Bm(b5) is **not** diatonic in G# natural minor — Bm(b5) = B–D–F, but in G# minor, B major is B–D#–F#. Bm(b5) is B–D–F, which is like a B half-diminished (Bø).  
    Bø = B–D–F–A = Bm7(b5). That’s diatonic in **A major** (as viiø7) but not in G# minor.

---

**3. Try relative major of G# minor**

G# minor relative major = B major.  
B major key signature: 5 sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#).  
Diatonic chords in B major:  
B, C#m, D#m, E, F#, G#m, A#dim.

- G#m = vi  
- E = IV  
- F# = V  
- B = I  
- Bm(b5) is not diatonic in B major either — Bm(b5) = B–D–F, but B major’s vii chord is A#dim (A#–C#–E), not Bø.

So Bm(b5) is the odd chord.

---

**4. Analyze Bm(b5)/G#**

Bm(b5) = B–D–F.  
B half-diminished 7 = B–D–F–A.  
Bm(b5)/G# means bass note G#.  
So pitches: G#–B–D–F.  
That’s G#m7(b5) — a half-diminished chord on G#.

G#m7(b5) = G#–B–D–F.  
In key of A major: viiø7 = G#m7(b5).  
In key of A minor: not naturally occurring in natural minor, but in harmonic/melodic minor?  
A harmonic minor: G#dim7 = G#–B–D–F (actually G#dim7 is G#–B–D–F, but dim7 has dim 5 and dim 7, but here m7(b5) is half-diminished, which is G#–B–D–F#? Wait — check:  
Half-diminished symbol ø = m7(b5):  
G#m7(b5) = G#–B–D–F#? No — F# is a minor 7th above G#? G# to F# is a minor 7th (10 semitones). Yes! So G#–B–D–F# is G#ø7.  
But given chord says Bm(b5)/G#: B–D–F with G# bass = G#–B–D–F. G# to F is a **diminished 7th** (9 semitones), so that’s G#°7 (G#dim7), not G#ø7.  

So Bm(b5) = B–D–F. Add G# bass: G#–B–D–F = G#dim7.  
G#dim7 is symmetrical.

---

**5. Functional use of G#dim7**

G#dim7 often works as a leading-tone chord in A minor (or A major).  
G#dim7 → Am (or A major).  
But here it goes G#dim7 → G#m. That’s a common-tone dim7: G#dim7 to G#m.

So Bm(b5)/G# is just a first-inversion G#dim7 acting as a common-tone diminished of G#m.

---

**6. Determine key from overall chords**

Most chords: G#m, E, B, F#.  
In B major:  
G#m = vi  
E = IV  
B = I  
F# = V  

Progression:  
G#m – E – G#m – B – G#m – E – G#m – F# – G#m.

That’s vi – IV – vi – I – vi – IV – vi – V – vi.  
Very common in pop/rock in major key, centered on the relative minor.

So the tonal center feels like G#m, but the key signature is B major (G# minor’s relative major).  
Mode: G# **Aeolian** (natural minor) relative to B major.

**7. Conclusion**

Key signature: **B major**  
Tonal center: **G# minor**  
Mode: **Aeolian** (relative to B major)

---

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{G\# \text{ Aeolian}}
\]  
(Key signature: B major / G# minor)
