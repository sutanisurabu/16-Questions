Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm7b5/G# – G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G# – G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonic
The chord **G#m** is repeated frequently and appears at both the beginning and end. This strongly suggests **G# minor** as the tonic.

---

### Step 2: Check the scale and mode
G# minor is the **relative minor** of **B major**, so the natural minor scale would be:

- **G# A# B C# D# E F#**

Now let's check the chords against this scale:

| Chord | Notes | In G# minor? |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| G#m | G# B D# | ✅ |
| E/G# | E G# B | ✅ (E major is the **VI** chord in G# minor; this is a first inversion) |
| B/F# | B D# F# | ✅ (B major is the **III** chord in G# minor; first inversion) |
| Bm7b5/G# | B D F# A with G# in bass | ❌ **D natural** is **not** in G# natural minor |
| F#6 | F# A# C# D# | ✅ (F# major with added 6th; F# is the **VII** chord in G# minor) |

---

### Step 3: Interpret the outlier
The **Bm7b5/G#** chord (B D F# A over G#) contains a **D natural**, which is **not** in G# natural minor. However, **D natural** **is** in **G# harmonic minor**, which raises the 7th scale degree (F## → G#), but **lowers the 6th** (E# → F#), giving:

- **G# A# B C# D# E F##**

But here we have **D natural**, not D# — so **not harmonic minor**.

Instead, this chord is best interpreted as **a passing chromatic chord** or a **neapolitan-style substitution** — but **not diatonic**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: G# minor**  
**Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)**  
*(with a brief chromatic passing chord: Bm7b5/G#)*
