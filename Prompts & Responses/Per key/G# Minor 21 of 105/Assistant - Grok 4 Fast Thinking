**Key: G♯ minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  

This progression strongly tonics on G♯ minor, as it begins and ends there, with most chords (G♯m, E, B, F♯6) diatonic to the G♯ natural minor scale (G♯ A♯ B C♯ D♯ E F♯). The E/G♯ and B/F♯ act as bass-supported inversions of VI and III, reinforcing the tonic pull. The Bm(b5)/G♯ introduces a chromatic D♮ (not in the scale), likely a passing or tension-building chord (possibly functioning as a local dominant or borrowed from a parallel mode), but it doesn't shift the overall key center.
