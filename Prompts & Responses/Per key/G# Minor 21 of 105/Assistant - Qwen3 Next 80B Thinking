### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord sequence: G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to list out all the chords without the slashes to see the root notes. The slashes indicate inversions or bass notes, so the actual chord quality is what matters for key determination. So let's see:

- G#m (G# minor)
- E/G# (this is E major with G# in the bass, so it's still E major)
- B/F# (B major with F# bass, so B major)
- Bm(b5)/G# (B half-diminished with G# bass, so Bm7b5)
- F#6 (F# major with added 6th, but usually F#6 is F# A# C# D#)

Wait, actually, when checking the key, we should consider the root notes of each chord, ignoring the inversions. So E/G# is still an E chord, just inverted. B/F# is B major, and Bm(b5)/G# is B half-diminished. F#6 is F#6 chord. So the root notes are: G#, E, B, B, G#, F#.

Let me list all chords by their root:

1. G#m
2. G#m
3. E (since E/G# is E major with G# bass, but the chord is E)
4. E
5. G#m
6. G#m
7. B (B/F# is B major)
8. Bm(b5) (B half-diminished)
9. G#m
10. G#m
11. E
12. E
13. G#m
14. G#m
15. F#6
16. G#m

So the main chords are G#m, E major, B major, Bm(b5), F#6.

Now, considering the key. Let's look at the notes in each chord.

G#m: G#, B, D#

E major: E, G#, B

B major: B, D#, F##

Wait, B major would be B, D#, F#? Wait, B major is B, D#, F#? No, standard B major is B, D#, F#? Let me check:

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So chords:

I: B, D#, F# → yes, B major is B-D#-F#.

But in the chord list, there's B major. Then there's Bm(b5), which is B, D, F (since half-diminished is minor with flat 5). Wait, half-diminished chord is minor 7 flat 5. So Bm(b5) would be B, D, F, but actually, sometimes written as Bm7b5, which is B, D, F, A. Wait, no, B half-diminished is B-D-F-A.

But in the chord, it's Bm(b5)/G#, so the bass is G#, but the chord is Bm(b5). So the chord tones are B, D, F.

Now looking at F#6. F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#. Because F# major is F#, A#, C#, and adding 6th would be D# (since F# scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#). So F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#.

Now let's see which key has all these chords. Let's see the common key. Let's consider the key of D# major? Or maybe E major? But G#m is the relative minor of B major. Let's check.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Chords in B major:

I: B

ii: C#m

iii: D#m

IV: E

V: F#m? Wait no, in B major, the V chord is F# major? Wait, B major scale:

Tonic: B

Supertonic: C# minor

Mediant: D# minor

Subdominant: E major

Dominant: F# major

Submediant: G# minor

Leading tone: A# diminished

Wait, so in B major, the chords are:

I: B

ii: C#m

iii: D#m

IV: E

V: F#

vi: G#m

vii°: A#°

So, looking at the chords in the sequence: G#m (vi), E (IV), B (I), F# (V), and also Bm(b5) – but in B major, the vii° chord is A#°, not Bm(b5). Bm(b5) would be B-D-F, which is not in B major. In B major, the chord on B is major, so B major chord is B-D#-F#. So Bm(b5) would be a chord that's not diatonic to B major.

Wait, but Bm(b5) is half-diminished. Let's see: in the key of D# minor? Wait, maybe the key is G# minor?

G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Chords in G# minor:

i: G#m

ii°: A#°

III: B major

IV: C#m

v: D#m

vi: E

vii: F# major

Wait, in natural minor, the v chord is minor, but sometimes harmonic minor is used to make it major. Let's check.

G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So the chords:

i: G#m

ii°: A#° (A#, C#, E)

III: B major (B, D#, F#)

IV: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major? Wait, E major? E in G# minor scale: E, G#, B? Wait, the notes of G# minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So E is the 6th degree, so the chord would be E minor? Wait, no. Let's list the scale degrees:

1: G#

2: A#

3: B

4: C#

5: D#

6: E

7: F#

So the chords for G# minor (natural minor):

i: G#m (G#, B, D#)

ii°: A#dim (A#, C#, E)

III: B major (B, D#, F#) – B is the 3rd scale degree, so major chord.

IV: C#m (C#, E, G#)

v: D#m (D#, F#, A#) – but wait, D# minor would be D#, F#, A#?

But the scale notes are D#, then F# (which is 7th note?), wait the 5th degree is D#, so chord on 5th is D#, F#, A#. Yes, that's D#m.

vi: E minor (E, G#, B)

vii°: F#° (F#, A#, C#) – but F# ° would be F#, A#, C#.

But the scale has 7: F#, which is the leading tone, so chord on 7th would be F#dim (F#, A#, C#).

Wait, so in G# natural minor, the chords are:

i: G#m

ii°: A#°

III: B maj

IV: C#m

v: D#m

vi: E min

vii°: F#°

But the given chords include F#6. F#6 would be F#, A#, C#, D#. Wait, in G# minor, can we get an F#6?

F# major chord in G# minor would be part of the natural minor, but F# is the vii° which is diminished. So F# major isn't in G# minor natural. However, sometimes in harmonic minor, the seventh degree is raised to make it a major chord. So harmonic minor of G# would have F# natural as the 7th degree raised to F## (G), but no. Wait, harmonic minor raises the 7th degree to create a leading tone. So G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (which is G), so then the vii° chord becomes F## major? Wait, no. Let's see.

G# harmonic minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G) because raised the 7th. So chords:

i: G#m (G#, B, D#)

ii°: A#° (A#, C#, E)

III+: B augmented? Wait, no.

Wait, G# harmonic minor: notes G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

So chords:

i: G#m (G#, B, D#)

ii°: A#° (A#, C#, E)

III: B augmented (B, D#, F##)

IV: C#m (C#, E, G#)

v: D#m (D#, F##, A#) – wait, D#m would be D#, F##, A#?

But F## is G natural.

v (minor) in harmonic minor is minor, but sometimes the V chord in harmonic minor is major because the 7th is raised. Wait, the V chord in minor is usually major in harmonic minor. So for G# minor harmonic:

V chord would be D# major? D# major would be D#, F##, A#. Yes.

And the vii chord is F## major (F##, A#, C#). But F## is G natural.

But in the chord list here, there's an F#6. F#6 would be F#, A#, C#, D#. But if the key were in harmonic minor, the V chord is D# major, but we have F# major chord. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is E major?

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

Chords:

I: E

ii: F#m

iii: G#m

IV: A

V: B

vi: C#m

vii°: D#°

So chords in E major: E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#°.

In this key, G#m is the iii chord. But let's check the given chords: G#m (iii), E (I), B (V), F#6. Wait, F#6 is not in E major. Because in E major, F# is the ii chord, which is F#m. So F#6 chord would involve notes F#, A#, C#, D#. But in E major, the notes are E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So F# major would not be diatonic to E major scale. Because E major has F# as root, but the chord would have F#, A#, C##? No. Let's check:

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

F# major chord would need notes F#, A#, C#. But in E major scale, the third of F# would be A#, but A# isn't in E major. E major has A natural. So the third of F# chord would be A#, which is not part of E major scale (since E major has A natural). So F# major chord is not diatonic to E major.

Hmm.

Another possibility: key of G# minor, but with some harmonic elements. Let's see the chords we have:

- G#m (i chord)

- E (what is E in G# minor? In natural minor, vi chord is E minor. But in the sequence, it's E major. So E major chord. So E major in G# minor would be from harmonic minor?

In G# harmonic minor, the scale is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G). Wait, but then E is the 6th degree. In harmonic minor, the 6th degree remains natural, so E natural. So chord on the 6th degree (E) would be Em for harmonic minor? Wait, no. Let's check the chords for G# harmonic minor.

G# harmonic minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G)

Chords:

i: G#m (G#, B, D#)

ii°: A#° (A#, C#, E)

III+: B augmented (B, D#, F##)

IV: C#m (C#, E, G#)

v: D#m (D#, F##, A#) – but wait, D# as root, F## (G), A#.

V: D# major (D#, F##, A#) – but if we take V chord here. Wait, usually in minor keys, the V chord is made major by raising the 7th. So for G# harmonic minor, the V chord is D# major.

vi: E°? No. vi chord: E, G#, B. But in harmonic minor scale, E is natural. So E, G#, B – that's E minor. But in harmonic minor, the vi chord would be Em. However, sometimes it's E major? Not necessarily.

vii: F##+ (F##, A#, C#), but that's augmented.

But the problem is we have an E major chord here. So in G# minor harmonic, the E chord would be minor (E, G#, B), but here they have E major which is E, G#, B#? Wait E major would be E, G#, B#. But in G# harmonic minor scale, the 7th degree is raised to F## (which is G), but the third of the E chord would be G#, which is in the scale, but the 5th is B, which is also in the scale (the B is the 3rd degree of G# minor scale). Wait, G# harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

So E to B is a fifth? E, B is a fifth. But E major is E, G#, B#. No, E major is E, G#, B#. Wait, G# is a major third for E. But in G# minor scale, we have G# as the tonic, so in the scale, G# is present. So E major chord would have E (root), G# (major third), B# (fifth? No, fifth of E is B, which is natural. Wait standard E major is E, G#, B. Yes. So E major chord has B, not B#. So in the key of G# minor, does B exist? Yes. B is the 3rd degree of G# minor scale. So in G# minor natural: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So E is the 6th degree. Let's check what chord E would be in G# minor natural: the E chord would use the notes from the scale. E, G#, B. Yes! So that's E minor chord? No. E minor chord is E, G, B. Wait, wait. Wait, hold on.

Wait, E major is E, G#, B; E minor is E, G, B. So if we have an E chord, in G# minor natural scale, the notes present are E, G#, B. So that's E major? Because the third is G# (major third). So in G# natural minor scale, the chord built on the 6th degree (E) would be E major? Because the scale has:

Degree 6: E

Third in the chord: G# (which is the tonic note), which is a major third above E. And fifth: B. So yes, E major chord in G# natural minor scale. But wait, in natural minor scale, the 6th chord is usually minor? Wait no, no. Wait the natural minor scale:

For example, A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Chords:

i: Am

ii°: B°

III: C

iv: Dm

v: Em

VI: F

vii°: G°

Wait, so the VI chord is major. So yes, in A natural minor, the VI chord is F major. Similarly, in G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So scale degrees:

1 G#

2 A#

3 B

4 C#

5 D#

6 E

7 F#

So chord on VI (6th degree): E. The chord would be E, G#, B. Since G# is part of the scale (it's the tonic), and B is the 3rd scale degree. So E, G#, B. That's E major. Because E to G# is a major third. So yes, in G# natural minor, the VI chord is E major.

Similarly, the V chord in natural minor would be a minor chord: D# minor, but sometimes raised to V major (D# major) in harmonic minor. But in natural minor, V chord is minor.

But looking at the sequence here: the chords include B major. What's B in G# minor? The III chord. In natural minor, iii chord is minor? No. Let's check.

Chord built on III (B) in G# minor scale: B, D#, F#. Because B is third scale degree. Scale degrees above B: C#, D#, D# is fourth, so chord B, D#, F#. B to D# is major third, D# to F# is minor third, so B major chord. Yes! So in G# natural minor:

i: G#m

ii°: A#°

III: B major

IV: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major

vii°: F#°

Yes. So B major is a diatonic chord to G# natural minor (III chord). Also, E major is VI. So the chords we have:

G#m (i), E (VI), B (III), and also Bm(b5) – wait, Bm(b5) is B half-diminished. B half-diminished is B, D, F. Wait, but in G# minor scale, we have B, D#, F#. So if Bm(b5), that would need D natural, but in G# minor natural, D# is present. So D natural would be non-diatonic. Hmm. So Bm(b5) would imply D natural, but G# minor scale has D#. So unless we're using a variation.

Also, we have F#6. F#6 usually is F# A# C# D#. So F#, A#, C#, D#.

In G# natural minor scale: the notes are G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So F# is the 7th degree. So F#6 would include F#, A#, C#, D#. But what's in the scale? F# is present. A# is present (2nd scale degree), C# (4th), D# (5th). So yes, F#6 chord would be diatonic to G# minor. Because F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D# – all present in G# minor.

Wait, but F#6 chord would normally have a 6th, which for F# is D# (since the scale of F# major has D# as sixth? Wait, F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#. But F#6 chord is F#, A#, C#, D#. So yes, that's the same as F# major chord with added sixth. And all those notes are in G# minor scale: F# (from scale), A# (scale), C# (scale), D# (scale).

So G# minor natural has all the notes from all the chords.

Let's check all chords:

- G#m: G#, B, D# → yes.

- E/G#: same as E major (E, G#, B) → yes.

- B/F#: B major (B, D#, F#) → in G# minor: yes.

- Bm(b5)/G#: chord is B half-diminished (B, D, F). Wait, but in G# minor scale, we have D# and F# – we don't have D natural or F natural. So Bm(b5) would be B, D, F. But D and F are not in G# minor natural scale. The scale has D# and F#.

So that's a problem. Unless the Bm(b5) is actually a different chord. Wait, maybe there's a typo? Or maybe harmonic minor? Let's check.

If it's G# harmonic minor, the scale would be G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

F## is G natural. So chord on B would be B, D#, F##. So B major again. But Bm(b5) would need B, D, F – which isn't there.

Alternatively, maybe D is natural, but that's not in either natural or harmonic minor. So perhaps the Bm(b5) is actually Bm7b5, which is B, D, F, A. But that's a bit tricky.

Wait, but maybe in this context, the Bm(b5)/G# could be considered as a secondary function. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is B major. Wait earlier thought: in B major, the chords are I=B, ii=C#m, iii=D#m, IV=E, V=F#, vi=G#m. But in B major, the chords are:

B major: B, D#, F#

C# minor: C#, E, G#

D# minor: D#, F#, A#

E major: E, G#, B

F# major: F#, A#, C#

G# minor: G#, B, D#

A# diminished: A#, C#, E

Now, what about F#6? In B major scale, F# major chord would be F#, A#, C#. Adding 6th? The sixth would be D#, which is present. So F#6 would be F#, A#, C#, D# → all in B major scale. Yes.

Now, Bm(b5)/G#: B half-diminished chord. In B major scale, what's B chord? B major. So Bm(b5) would normally not be in B major. Bm is not diatonic. But Bm(b5) would have B, D, F – which isn't in B major.

Wait, but looking at the chords given:

We have B/F# → B major. Then Bm(b5)/G#. If we consider the Bm(b5), the root is B, but minor with flat fifth. So B, D, F.

But in B major scale, there is no D natural or F natural. So that's not diatonic. Hmm.

Wait, but if we are in B major, the chord Bm(b5) would not be diatonic. So perhaps the key is not B major.

Let's reconsider the G# minor idea. The only problem is the Bm(b5) chord. Maybe there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the chord labeled Bm(b5)/G# is actually something else. Let's break down the chord Bm(b5)/G#.

Bm(b5) means B minor flat 5, which is also called B half-diminished. The standard half-diminished is Bm7b5: B, D, F, A. So root B, minor 3rd (D), diminished 5th (F), minor 7th (A). But the slash G# means bass is G#.

But G# is part of what chords? If the chord is Bm(b5)/G#, the bass is G#, so the notes are G# as bass, then Bm(b5) which would be B, D, F. So all notes: G#, B, D, F. But a seventh chord with bass on G# would be Bm7b5 first inversion.

But in G# natural minor, the scale has G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So the notes G#, B, D#, F#. But here, the chord includes D natural and F natural? Wait, D#/D natural confusion.

Wait, in standard tuning, the difference between D and D# is important. Let's confirm:

If in the scale, D# is present, then D natural would be foreign. So if the chord is Bm(b5) = B, D (natural), F (natural), then in G# minor natural scale, there is no D natural or F natural. So that chord would not be diatonic. But we have all the chords including G#m, E major (VI), B major (III), and F#6. But the Bm(b5) doesn't fit.

But wait, the chord Bm(b5)/G# could be written as Bm♭5/G# which is the same as Bm7b5 first inversion (G# in bass). Alternatively, sometimes the notation Bm(b5) is shorthand for half-diminished.

But perhaps in this context, the chord is actually a B half-diminished, which in the context of G# minor could be a ii chord in some mode. Wait, but not sure.

Another angle: let's look at the chords and see the tonic.

Most sequences tend to rest on the i chord. Here, G#m is the first chord and repeated a lot. The sequence is:

G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m

So it starts and ends with G#m. That suggests G#m is the tonic chord. So key is probably G# minor.

Now, the B major chord is the III chord in G# minor (yes, that's a common chord in minor key), E major is VI chord, F#6 is a chord where F# is the 7th degree chord but with added 6th. Wait, in G# minor, the vii chord is F#°, but F#6 could be a major chord. Wait, no, the diatonic F#7 would be diminished or something else. Maybe F#6 is a borrowed chord.

Alternatively, maybe it's G# harmonic minor where the v chord is made major. But in G# harmonic minor, the chord on D# (5th degree) would be D# major. But F#6 – F# being the raised 7th? Wait, no. In G# harmonic minor, the 7th degree is raised to F## (G natural). So F## major would be the vii chord. But F#6 has F#, which is a natural F# in standard tuning.

Wait, if it's G# natural minor, then the VII chord is F# dim. But F#6 chord would be F# major with added 6th. So F# major isn't diatonic. Unless it's a chromatic chord.

But wait, the F#6 chord: F#, A#, C#, D#. If we consider the key of G# minor, all those notes are present. Because in G# natural minor, the scale has F#? Wait no.

Wait G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Yes! Wait, natural minor scale has the 7th degree as F#, not raised. So in G# natural minor, the 7th scale degree is F#. So the chord built on the vii (7th degree) is F# diminished, which is F#, A, C#. But F# diminished chord is F#, A, C. Wait, F# diminished triad is F#, A, C? Wait no: diminished triad is root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th. So F# minor third is A (which is minor third), but F# to A is minor third? Let's see:

F# to A: F# is first, G#=1, A=2nd, so F# to A is minor third. Yes. Then A to C is minor third, so interval to C is minor third. So F# diminished triad is F#, A, C. But in the scale of G# natural minor, the notes are G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. Wait! Wait, this is critical. The G# natural minor scale has F# as the 7th degree, but the third degree is B, which is natural B, not B#. So let's list all the notes of G# natural minor:

G# (1), A# (2), B (3), C# (4), D# (5), E (6), F# (7).

Ah! So F# is the 7th note. Now, the vii° chord (diminished triad) would be F# diminished triad. Let's build it on F#:

Root: F#

Minor third: A (F# to A is minor third? F# to G#=1, G# to A=whole step? Wait, no.

Wait intervals:

F# to G# is whole step.

G# to A is whole step? Wait F# to G# (minor second?), no.

Wait F# up to G:

F# to G is half step.

G to G# is half step.

Wait F# to A is actually major third. Because:

F# - G - G# - A ⇒ F# to A is three half steps (F#-G, G-G#, G#-A) so three half steps = minor third? Wait no.

Wait, F# to A:

The note names: F#, G, G#, A. So F# to G is 1 half step, G to G# is another, G# to A is half step. Total 3 half steps. Yes, minor third. Then A to C is minor third (A to B is 2 half steps, B to C is half step → total 3 half steps), so diminished fifth. So the diminished triad for F# would be F#, A, C.

But in the G# natural minor scale, the scale has F# (7th), but also A# (2nd), B (3rd), C# (4th), etc. So A natural? Wait, the G# natural minor scale doesn't have A natural. It has A# as the second note. So scale notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Therefore, the note A natural is not present in G# natural minor scale. So the vii° chord would be F#, A, C – but A natural and C natural are not in the scale. Because scale has A# and C#. So it's impossible to have A or C natural in G# natural minor.

Wait, that's a critical mistake I made earlier! In G# natural minor scale:

The scale degrees:

1. G#

2. A#

3. B

4. C#

5. D#

6. E

7. F#

So all the accidentals are sharps on the 2nd, 4th, 5th degrees, except the 7th. So the note A natural isn't present; it's A#.

So when we build a chord on F# (7th degree), the notes should be F#, A# (minor third?), wait let's see.

F# root, then minor third above F# is A.

But scale has A# instead of A. So that would be not in scale. So the vii° chord in natural minor isn't diatonic? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, actually, no. In a natural minor scale, the vii° chord is built using the scale notes. Let's build the chord on 7th degree of G# natural minor:

7th degree: F#

Chord: F#, A (but scale has A#, not A), so that's a problem.

Wait, no! This is where I'm making a mistake. The diatonic chord built on the 7th degree must use only the notes from the scale. So for G# natural minor:

Scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So to build a triad on F# (the 7th note):

- Root: F#

- 3rd: next scale degree is G#? No. Wait, a triad built on F# would take every other note starting from F# in the scale.

So scale degrees: 7, 1, 2. So F# (root), G# (3rd), A# (5th).

Wait, interval from F# to G# is major second (whole step), then G# to A# is major second. So chord F#, G#, A#. That would be F# major chord? No: F# to G# is major second, not a third. Wait, the third above F# should be F# + 4 half steps (major third), or + 3 for minor third.

F# to A: 3 half steps (minor third), but scale has A# instead of A. So between the scale notes, from F# (7th), the next scale note is G# (1st), then A# (2nd). So building the chord on F#:

Root: F#

3rd: A# (since the next note after F# is G# (minor second), then A# (major third above F#)

Pent: C# (perfect fifth).

Wait: F# to A# is a major third (4 half steps: F#-G, G-G#, G#-A, A-A#; total 4 steps). Yes. And F# to C# is a perfect fifth (7 half steps). So F#, A#, C# → this is an A# diminished chord? F#-A#-C#.

Wait A# is the minor third? No. F# to A# is major third. A# to C# is minor third. So F# major triad: yes. Wait, F#, A#, C#. Is that a major chord? F# to A# is major third, A# to C# is minor third, so F# major triad? No. Wait F# major chord is F#, A#, C#. Yes. Because F# major: F#, A#, C#.

Yes. So in G# natural minor scale, building a triad on the 7th degree (F#), we get F# major triad because the scale has A# and C# in it. But wait: the scale is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So starting at F#:

Root: F#

2nd: G# (next)

3rd: A#

4th: B

5th: C#

So building a triad: root F#, third A#, fifth C#.

Yes, so that's an F# major chord. Because F#, A#, C#.

Ah! So my mistake earlier was thinking the vii chord in minor is diminished, but that's only in the harmonic minor usually, but in natural minor, the vii chord is actually major. Because for example in A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Chord on G (vii): G, B, D → G major? Wait G major chord in A minor is G, B, D.

Yes! In A natural minor, the vii chord is G major. So that's correct. So in natural minor scale, the vii chord is major. Not diminished. The diminished chord is for harmonic minor or melodic minor.

So for G# natural minor: vii chord is F# major.

Similarly, V chord would be D# minor. Because D# (5th), F# (major second), A# (minor third), etc. Wait chord on V (5th degree):

Root D#, third F#, fifth A# (in scale: D#, E, F#, G#, B? Wait scale: D# (5), E (6), F# (7), G# (1), A# (2). So building on D#:

root D#, third F# (next note is E after D#? Scale order: G# A# B C# D# E F#. So after D# comes E, F#.

So triad on D#: D#, F#, A#. D# to F# is major third (4 half steps), F# to A# is major third (another 4 half steps), so that's a diminished triad? No.

Wait D# to F# is 3 half steps (D#-E, E-F, F-F# → three half steps ⇒ minor third). F# to A# is four half steps (F#-G, G-G#, G#-A, A-A# → 4 half steps? No, F# to G is 1, G to G# 2, G# to A is 3, A to A# is 4. Yes. So F# to A# is major third. So D# minor triad: D# (root), F# (minor third), A# (perfect fifth). Yes! So D# minor chord in G# minor is diatonic.

Ah, okay. So back to G# natural minor:

- i: G#m: G#, B, D# (because root G#, minor third B: G# to B is 4 half steps? No: G# to A=1, A to A#=2, A# to B=3. So yes, minor third)

Wait G# to B: G#, A, A#, B – that's G# to A is half step, A to A# is half step, A# to B is half step. So 3 half steps, minor third. Yes. Then B to D# is major third (B to C, C to C#, C# to D, D to D# – no. B to C is 1, C to C# is 2, C# to D is 3, D to D# is 4. So B to D# is major third. So G#m chord has G#, B, D# ⇒ correct minor triad.

- ii°: A#° – A#, C#, E (A# to C# is minor third? A# to C: 2 steps, C to C# is third. Wait A# to C# is 4 half steps (A#-B, B-C, C-C# → three half steps?), wait no:

A# to B: 1

B to C: 2

C to C#: 3 ⇒ so A# to C# is minor third. Then C# to E: minor third? C# to D: 1, D to D#: 2, D# to E: 3 ⇒ yes, minor third. So A#° is A#, C#, E – diminished triad.

- III: B major chord: B, D#, F# (B to D# is major third, D# to F# major third? No, D# to F# is minor third. Wait B to D# is major third (4 half steps), D# to F# is 3 half steps ⇒ minor third. So B, D#, F# is B major chord? No. B major chord: B, D#, F## (G). Wait no. B major is B, D#, F#? Wait no! B major's fifth is F#. Wait standard B major: B, D#, F#.

Yes! Because B to F# is a perfect fifth. So yes. So B major chord: B, D#, F#.

Yes. But in G# natural minor scale, F# is present. So yes, B major triad is diatonic.

- IV: C#m: C#, E, G#

- v: D#m: D#, F#, A#

- VI: E major chord: E, G#, B. Because E to G# is major third (E - F, F - F#, F# - G, G - G# → 4 half steps), G# to B is minor third. So yes.

- vii: F# major: F#, A#, C#

Because F#, A#, C# is F# major.

So all the chords in the sequence fit into G# natural minor:

- G#m (i)

- E/G# → E major (VI), bass G# but chord still VI.

- B/F# → B major (III), bass F#.

- F#6 → F# major with added 6th. F#6 would be F#, A#, C#, D#. But in scale D# is present. Wait F#6 chord: F#, A#, C#, D#. Yes, all notes in G# minor scale.

So F#6 chord – yes, F#, A#, C#, D#.

Now the problematic chord: Bm(b5)/G#. What's that? Bm(b5) is B minor flat fifth. Typically written as Bø or Bm7b5. Which is B, D, F, A. But wait, Bm(b5) usually means B, D, F. Half-diminished chord is minor 7th flat 5: so B, D, F, A. But in the chord notation Bm(b5)/G# → bass G#, so notes G#, B, D, F.

But in G# natural minor scale, do we have D natural? No. The scale has D#. It has D#, not D natural. Similarly, F natural? Scale has F#, not F natural.

So Bm(b5)/G# implies notes G#, B, D, F – but those D and F naturals are not in the G# minor scale. So this seems like a non-diatonic chord. But why is it there?

Wait, unless the Bm(b5) chord is actually something else. Or maybe it's a typo, like B major 7b5 or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the chord is Bm7b5 with bass G#, which would be a different function. Maybe Bm7b5 in G# minor is a iiø chord for a V chord. In minor keys, often the iiø7 chord leads to a V chord.

Wait, for example, in Dm key, iiø7 is Em7b5. But here, in G# minor, perhaps there is a iiø chord.

Wait the diatonic ii chord in G# natural minor is A#°, a diminished triad. But with seventh?

In G# natural minor scale, ii chord is A#°. But if using seventh, it would be A#m7b5? No.

Wait the chord on II (the second scale degree) would be A#, C#, E. Which is A#°. If we add the seventh, it would be A#, C#, E, G# → A#m7b5? Because A# to C# is minor third, C# to E is minor third, so A#°, then E to G# is also minor third. Yes, so A#m7b5 is the iiø7 in the minor scale.

But here the chord is Bm(b5)/G#. So that's Bm7b5. B is third degree. So iiiø7?

Not sure. But if the scale is G# natural minor, the diatonic iii chord is B major. So a Bm7b5 doesn't fit.

Unless it's a borrowed chord from another mode.

Another possibility: maybe the key is D# minor? But D# minor would be similar to G# minor.

Alternatively, let's check the mode. If the tonic is G#m, it's probably minor mode, and depending on other chords, but natural minor.

But this Bm(b5) chord is still confusing. Let's see if there's a different perspective.

Maybe the Bm(b5) is actually a typo for B7b5 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's Bm7b5 but in the context of the key.

Wait, let's consider the chord Bm7b5. If G# is the bass, so the chord would have G# as the bass note. Bm7b5 = B, D, F, A. So Bm7b5 with G# bass is G#, B, D, F, A – which is a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe it's intended to be a G#m chord with some passing tones? Not sure.

Wait another angle: let's list all the notes present across the chords.

G#m = G#, B, D#

E major = E, G#, B

B major = B, D#, F#

F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#

Bm(b5)/G# = B, D, F (with G# bass, so notes G#, B, D, F)

So all of these chords:

- G#m: G#, B, D#

- E: E, G#, B

- B: B, D#, F#

- F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

- Bm(b5)/G#: G#, B, D, F

So the notes include:

G#, B, D#, F#, E, A#, C#, D natural, F natural.

Wait, D natural and F natural are not part of G# minor scale. If there are D natural and F natural, then the key might be different.

Wait perhaps the key is E major? Earlier thought about E major.

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

But in the chord list, we have Bm(b5)/G# → which implies D and F naturals, which are not in E major scale (E major has D#).

E major has A natural, so F# as dominant, but still.

Wait in E major:

- G#m is iii chord.

- E is I

- B is V

- F# is vii° or perhaps F# major – no, F# major chord in E major: F#, A#, C#.

- Bm(b5) would have B, D, F – but D in E major is D#.

So again D natural is foreign.

Another option: D# major? Unlikely. Or perhaps it's a mix of modes.

Wait, what's the F#6 chord? F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#. If the key is G# minor, but with a raised sixth chord or something. But if chord F#6 is diatonic, but the Bm(b5) is not.

Alternatively, maybe the Bm(b5)/G# is actually a common chord. Wait, sometimes chords are written with slash notation for pedal tones or something.

Wait, Bm(b5)/G# might actually be a G#-bass chord where the top notes are B, D, F. But what chord is that?

G#, B, D, F. Let's see:

G# to B: major second? G# to A is half step, A to B is whole, so total minor third. So G# to B is minor third. B to D is minor third. D to F is minor third. So this is a diminished seventh chord. Diminished 7th chord: G#°7.

Yes! G#, B, D, F → G# diminished seventh. But wait, G# to B is minor third, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, F to G# is minor third. Yes, that's a diminished seventh chord. So G#dim7.

But the chord was labeled as Bm(b5)/G# → so bass G#, but the chord is Bm(b5). But physically, the notes would be G# (bass), B, D, F.

And G#dim7 is the same as D°7, etc., because diminished seventh is symmetrical.

So perhaps the chord is actually G#dim7, but written as Bm(b5)/G#. Which is a common way to write it.

Because Bm(b5)/G# = B half-diminished with G# bass. But B half-diminished is B, D, F, A. But here they wrote Bm(b5)/G#, but the notes would be G#, B, D, F. Which is G#dim7. Because B half-diminished would have A as the seventh, but if there's no A in the notes, then it's not half-diminished, but rather G#dim7.

Ah! So maybe the chord was mislabeled. Or perhaps the slash is indicating the bass, but the actual chord is G#dim7. Or maybe it's B diminished (B°), which would be B, D, F.

B° includes B, D, F. Adding G# bass → B°/G# which would be G#, B, D, F. Yes. Or B half-diminished would be B, D, F, A, but if there's no A, it's diminished.

So perhaps the chord is B°/G# or G#dim7.

Either way, the chord G#dim7 would be diatonic to the key of D# minor or something. Wait, where is G#dim7 diatonic?

Diminished seventh chords usually arise from the leading tone. In G# minor, the vii°7 would be F#dim7.

F#dim7: F#, A, C, Eb. Not sure.

Wait, let's see: G#dim7 chord consists of G#, B, D, F – all minor thirds. In G# minor scale, this uses non-diatonic notes (D and F), but if it's G# natural minor scale has D# and F#, so D natural and F natural are non-diatonic.

However, in the key of A minor, G#dim7 is a common chord. Or in other keys.

Alternatively, in D# minor, but maybe it's too complicated.

Another approach: the presence of F#6 and G#m and B major.

But let's check what key has G#m as tonic and includes all these chords.

Perhaps the presence of D natural in Bm(b5)/G# suggests that maybe the key is not natural minor, but harmonic or melodic, but even so.

Wait, if it's harmonic minor of G#, the scale would be G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G).

But even then, F# natural and D natural would not be there. Not helpful.

Wait, but in harmonic minor, the vii chord (F##) is raised, but we still don't get D natural.

Hmm.

Let's consider the chord F#6. If F# is used as F# major with added 6th, that would require F#, A#, C#, D#. Now, if we have in the key D# minor, let's see.

D# major scale: D#, E#, F## (G), G#, A#, B#, C##.

Not helpful. D# minor is a bit messy.

Alternative approach: look at the possible diatonic chords that include all the chords.

If we accept that the Bm(b5)/G# might be a mistake and perhaps should be B°/G# (B diminished with G# bass), which would be G#, B, D, F.

So let's assume that.

So the chords include:

G#m: G#, B, D#

E major: E, G#, B

B major: B, D#, F#

F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

B°: B, D, F

But with the bass note G# for the last chord.

Now, let's see what key would contain all these.

G#, B, D# (G#m), E, G#, B (E major), B, D#, F# (B major), plus F#6 (F#, A#, C#, D#), and B° (B, D, F).

Note that D natural and F natural are used in B°, but in most standard keys this would be unusual.

However, the key of G# minor doesn't have D natural or F natural. But what about F# major as the key? No.

Wait another way: the key of D major.

No. Let's see: The presence of F#6 and E major chords.

E major would be the VI in B major.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Yes. Now, chords:

I: B

ii: C#m

iii: D#m

IV: E

V: F#

VI: G#m

vii°: A#°

F#6 chord: F#, A#, C#, D#. In B major scale, all notes present.

G#m chord: yes.

E major chord: yes.

B major: I

Bm(b5)/G#: Bm7b5 would be B, D, F, A. B major scale has D# and A#, not D or F. So not in B major.

But wait in B major, does it have D natural? No. D# is present.

So if Bm(b5)/G# is B, D, F, G# (bass), then D and F naturals aren't in B major.

Hmm.

Wait, but if the song is in G# minor, and sometimes uses a minor iv chord or something. But G# minor iv would be C#m which is fine.

But the issue is the Bm(b5)/G# chord.

Perhaps this chord is functioning as a leading note chord to the E chord. Let's see.

G#m chord sequence:

If it's G# minor, and the chord progression is like i - VI - III - ... but the Bm(b5) could be a secondary function.

Wait, Bm(b5)/G# – perhaps it's the iiø7 in relation to another key.

For example, in the key of G# minor, what would the iiø7 be? The ii chord is A#m7b5, as it is in natural minor. But it's not B.

Alternatively, Bm(b5) as a chord could be part of a different tonality.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to see what chord Bm(b5)/G# is in context. If G# is the bass note, and the full chord is G#, B, D, F.

That's a G# diminished seventh chord (G#°7). Because G# to B is minor third, B to D minor third, D to F minor third, F to G# minor third.

G#°7.

Where is G#°7 diatonic? In the key of A minor. In A minor, the vii°7 is G#°7.

Yes! In A natural minor:

Scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

vii° chord: G#, B, D?

Wait A natural minor scale has G natural. But a diminished seventh chord is G, Bb, Db, Fb – no. Wait confusion.

In A minor, the leading tone is G#. So in harmonic minor, A minor scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#.

Then the vii° chord is G#dim (G#, B, D).

But G# dim triad. The seventh chord would be G#m7b5: G#, B, D, F.

Ah! Yes. So in A harmonic minor scale, the vii chord is G#m7b5.

So G#m7b5 = G#, B, D, F.

So if the chord listed as Bm(b5)/G# is actually G#m7b5 with bass on G# (but Bm(b5)/G# would be a different chord), but perhaps there's a mislabeling.

If the chord was supposed to be G#m7b5, then it fits into A harmonic minor. But in this case, the primary chord is G#m, which would be iii in A minor.

Wait but the question is to find key and mode. If the tonic is G#m, then it's a minor key. But if the Bm(b5)/G# chord is actually G#m7b5, that would suggest that, but the way it's written as Bm(b5)/G# is confusing.

Let's check standard chord notation. A chord written as "Bm(b5)/G#" means B minor flat 5 chord with G# in the bass. So the chord is built on B, with a diminished fifth, and G# in bass. So the notes would be G# (bass), then the chord tones B, D, F. (since Bm b5 is B, D, F)

Yes. So the chord consists of G#, B, D, F.

Which is indeed G# diminished seventh chord.

G#°7 = {G#, B, D, F}

Similarly, it can also be spelled as B° (diminished), D°, F°.

So the chord is G#°7.

Now, is G#°7 diatonic to any scale? Yes, in the harmonic minor scale of A minor. A harmonic minor scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#.

Then the leading tone chord (vii°7) is G#°7.

But if the song is in A minor, then the tonic would be Am. But the sequence starts and ends with G#m chord. Which would be the iii chord in A minor. Not typical to center around iii.

But maybe it's a modal thing.

Alternatively, G#m is the tonic chord, and G#°7 chord is a common chromatic chord.

Alternatively, the key is G# minor with chromaticism.

But let's see the rest of the chords. G#m, E major, etc. If in A minor, G#m could be a chord, but the sequence has G#m as the main chord.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is C# minor. Wait.

Another idea: Maybe the key is F# minor.

F# natural minor: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E.

Wait, chord F#m.

But then G#m would be ii chord. But again.

Alternatively, let's use the most prominent chords.

The sequence has many G#m, so G# is tonic. Then E and B major chords.

In G# minor, as a natural minor, we have G#m, B major (III), E major (VI), F# major (vii), and F#6 which is F# major +6.

The F# major chord in natural minor is diatonic (vii).

But the Bm(b5)/G# chord: if it's G#dim7, which would be the vii° in another key, but in G# minor, it's not diatonic.

However, in some contexts, especially in jazz or pop, diminished chords can be used as passing chords.

But the question is to determine the key and mode.

Given that most chords are diatonic to G# harmonic or natural minor.

Let's check for G# natural minor:

Key: G# minor

Chords:

i: G#m

III: B major

VI: E major

vii: F# major

v: D#m or if major V, but usually minor.

But also F#6 chord.

And the Bm(b5)/G# might be a typo and supposed to be something else. Or if it's G#dim7.

But if we take G# as the tonic, the mode is natural minor.

But if the key is G# natural minor, then the chord Bm(b5)/G# (which is G#dim7) is not diatonic, but could be used as a chromatic chord.

Alternatively, in G# harmonic minor, the scale is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G).

Then the chords:

i: G#m

III+: B augmented (B, D#, F##)

v: D# major

vi: Em

vii: F## major

But F## is G natural. Then F#6 chord would have F# which isn't in scale.

Not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Given that the majority of chords fit G# natural minor, with a possible Bm(b5)/G# perhaps being a mistake for G#°7, which could be used for modulation or tension.

Alternatively, the Bm(b5)/G# chord might actually be Bm7b5, which is B, D, F, A. If there's an A note in there. But then A is not in G# minor.

Wait but if in the sequence there's an A note, but it wasn't specified. But the chord Bm7b5 has A as the seventh, so note A in there.

But in our chord sequence given, the chord is Bm(b5)/G#, which is ambiguous, but likely Bm(b5) with G# bass. But in standard notation, Bm(b5) is B, D, F.

So if we have G# bass and Bm(b5) chord tones (B, D, F), then the full chord notes are G#, B, D, F.

Assuming that's the case, then G# dim7.

G# dim7 is found in the key of A minor (harmonic), as the vii°7. But also in D# minor? Not sure.

But overall, the most plausible key is G# natural minor. The presence of G#m throughout, with chords like VI (E), III (B), vii (F# major), F#6 (which is just F# major + added 6th D#), and then the Bm(b5)/G# – which could be a chromatic passing chord, perhaps functioning as a diminished chord to create tension before resolving.

Since the sequence starts and ends on G#m, that's likely the tonic. The chords present mostly fit G# natural minor. The Bm(b5)/G# chord might be a chromatic chord used for color, not diatonic.

So key = G# minor, mode = natural minor.

But wait, what about the F#6 chord? In G# natural minor, F# major is diatonic vii, and F#6 would just be a variation of that.

Yes.

So key is G# minor, mode natural minor.

But another check: let's see the B/F# chord. B major chord, bass F#. In G# minor, B is III chord, so B major. Bass F# would be the seventh of the chord, but not important.

So the overall key is G# minor. Mode is natural minor.

But wait, the v chord is D# minor, but sometimes in minor keys, the V chord is major (harmonic minor), but if used here maybe not.

The chord F#6 could be part of the dominant function. But in G# minor, F# major is the vii chord, but V should be D# something.

Not sure. But given the chords, the best fit is G# minor key.

So final answer: Key = G# minor, mode = natural minor.

But maybe they're using the harmonic minor scale but with some variations.

But since the majority of chords fit natural minor, and G# minor is the tonic.

Yes.

The chord progression centered around **G#m** as the tonic chord (with repeated G#m at the start and end), along with diatonic chords from the **G# natural minor scale**, confirms the key and mode.

### ✅ **Breakdown of Diatonic Chords in G# Natural Minor Scale**  
The G# natural minor scale consists of the following notes:  
**G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#**

| Chord         | Function | Notes (Diagonal) | Fits in G# Minor? |
|---------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **G#m**       | i        | G#, B, D#        | ✅ Yes            |
| **E**         | VI       | E, G#, B         | ✅ Yes            |
| **B**         | III      | B, D#, F#        | ✅ Yes            |
| **F#**        | vii      | F#, A#, C#       | ✅ Yes (F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D# fits perfectly) |
| **Bm(b5)/G#** | ❓       | G#, B, D, F      | ❌ **Chromatic** (non-diatonic) |

---

### 🔍 **Why G# Minor?**
- **Tonic chord is G#m**: The repetition of G#m throughout the progression strongly suggests it's the tonic chord.
- **Chords like E (VI), B (III), F# (vii) are all diatonic** to G# natural minor.
- **F#6** (F#, A#, C#, D#) is a natural extension of the F# major chord (vii) in G# minor. The added 6th (D#) is also diatonic.
- **Bm(b5)/G#** appears to be a chromatic chord (G#°7), which is not diatonic but commonly used in minor keys for tension or passing function. It does not disqualify the key—it's a typical chromatic embellishment in minor progressions.

---

### ⚠️ **Clarification on Bm(b5)/G#**
- The chord is written as **Bm(b5)/G#**, meaning **B half-diminished (Bm7b5)** with **G#** in the bass.
- This gives the notes: **G#, B, D, F** — which is a **G#°7 (G# diminished seventh)** chord.
- While **not diatonic** to G# minor (scale has D# and F#, not D and F), this is a common chromatic chord used for color or modulation in minor keys.

---

### 🌟 **Summary**
- **Key = G# minor** (tonic center is G#m).
- **Mode = Natural Minor** (all other chords fit the natural minor scale, with one chromatic passing chord).
- This progression is typical of a **G# natural minor** song, where the occasional G#°7 chord (from Bm(b5)/G#) adds tension before resolving back to G#m.
