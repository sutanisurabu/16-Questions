### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord sequence: G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# Bm(b5)/G# G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m F#6 G#m. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by writing down all the chords clearly to analyze them.

First, I need to understand what each chord represents. G#m is G# minor, which is the tonic in G# minor. E/G# is an E major chord with G# in the bass. Since G# is the third of E major, this inverted chord might function as a dominant or have some leading quality. E major is the dominant of A major, but here we're in G# minor, so maybe E is related to the minor key.

B/F# is B major with F# in the bass. F# is the fifth of B major, so this is the second inversion. B major is the dominant chord in E major, but again, context matters. Bm(b5)/G# is a B half-diminished chord (Bm7b5) with G# in the bass. G# is the minor third of Bm(b5), making it the first inversion. This chord is the ii chord in A major, but in minor keys, it's often the iiø7 in natural minor.

F#6 is an F# major sixth chord. F# major is the subdominant in C# major, but let's see how it fits here. The sequence ends with G#m, which is the tonic.

Now, listing all the roots without considering inversions: G#m, E major, B major, Bm(b5), F# major. The roots are G#, E, B, B, F#. So the chords are: i, V/vi? Wait, in G# minor, the diatonic chords would be: i (G#m), ii° (A#°), III (B), iv (C#m), v (D#m), VI (E), VII (F#). 

Let me verify that. G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#. So:
- i: G#m
- ii°: A#dim
- III: B major
- iv: C#m
- v: D#m
- VI: E major
- VII: F# major

Ah, so E major is the VI chord in G# natural minor. B major is III. F# is VII. Now, in the sequence, we have E/G# which is E major (VI) in first inversion since G# is the bass. B/F# is B major (III) with F# in the bass. F# is the fifth, so second inversion. Bm(b5)/G# is Bm(b5). But in natural minor, the III is major, not half-diminished. Bm(b5) is actually the iiø7 in A major, but here it's written as Bm(b5) which is B-D-F-A. In G# minor, the diatonic ii chord is A#° (A#-C#-E), not Bm(b5). Bm(b5) has B, D, F, A. The notes B, D, F are the root, minor third, diminished fifth. So this chord is actually the iiø7 chord in A major, but relative to G# minor?

Wait, if we're in G# minor, the relative major is B major. But Bm(b5) in the key of G# minor? Let's check the scale. G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#. The ii chord would be A#-C#-E, which is A#dim. But Bm(b5) is B-D-F-A. B is the third degree, but in natural minor, the third degree forms a major chord (B major). So Bm(b5) isn't diatonic to natural minor. It would be diatonic to G# harmonic minor or melodic minor.

G# harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##, G#. So the scale has F## (which is G natural). Then the chords: i (G#m), ii° (A#°), III+ (Baug), iv (C#m), V (D#), VI (E), vii° (F##°). D# is major because the fifth is raised (F## creates a major V). 

In harmonic minor, the VI chord is E major, which matches. The VII chord would be F## major? No, in harmonic minor, the seventh degree is F##, so the VII chord is F## diminished? Wait, let's list the triads:

Scale: G# (i), A# (ii°), B (III), C# (iv), D# (V), E (VI), F## (vii°)

So triads:
i: G#m (G#-B-D#)
ii°: A#° (A#-C#-E)
III: B (B-D#-F##) but D# is enharmonically Eb, F## is G. So B major is B-D#-F##, which is B major (B-D#-G). Yes.

iv: C#m (C#-E-G#)
V: D# (D#-F##-A#) which is D# major (D#-Fx-A#)
VI: E (E-G#-B)
vii°: F##° (F##-A#-C#) which is G° (G-Bb-Db)

So in harmonic minor, we have E major as VI. But Bm(b5) is B-D-F-A. B-D is minor third, D-F is diminished fifth. So this chord has F natural (since F is the diminished fifth from B). In G# harmonic minor, the sixth scale degree is E natural, and seventh is F## (G). So F natural isn't in the scale. Therefore, Bm(b5) with F natural doesn't fit G# harmonic minor.

What about G# melodic minor? Ascending: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#. Descending is natural minor. But typically, melodic minor chords are taken from ascending form for harmony. So scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#. 

Chords:
i: G#m (G#-B-D#)
ii: A#m (A#-C#-E#) which is A#-C#-F
III: B (B-D#-F#)
IV: C# (C#-E#-G#) which is C#-F-G#
V: D# (D#-F#-A#)
VI: E#° (E#-G#-B) → F° (F-A-C)
VII: F# (F#-A#-C#)

So in melodic minor, the ii chord is A#m7 (A#-C#-E#-G#), which is A# Dorian. But Bm(b5) is B-D-F-A. B is the III degree. In melodic minor, III is major (B-D#-F#), not half-diminished. Bm(b5) has D natural and F natural, which aren't in melodic minor scale (which has D# and F#).

So where does Bm(b5) come from? In minor keys, the ii chord is often half-diminished when the V is major (harmonic minor context). But in G# minor, the ii chord should be A#°. Bm(b5) is actually the iiø7 chord in A major. A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. So iiø7: B-D-F#-A. But here it's written as Bm(b5), which probably implies Bm7b5, so B-D-F-A. F natural instead of F#. So it's B half-diminished with F natural, not F#.

This is B°7? B-D-F-Ab? But the user wrote Bm(b5), which typically means minor triad with diminished fifth, so B-D-F, and if it's a seventh chord, it would be B-D-F-A (Bm7b5). But Bm7b5 is B-D-F-A, which is the half-diminished seventh chord. 

In the context of G# minor, let's see the notes. If we have Bm7b5 (B-D-F-A), this would correspond to the iiø7 chord in A major. Since G# minor is the relative minor of B major, but A major is a different key. Perhaps the key is E major? E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. Relative minor is C# minor. Not matching.

Another approach: list all the chord roots and see the progression. Roots: G#, E, B, B, F#.

Sequence roots: G# (x2), E (x2), G# (x2), B, Bm(b5) [which is B root], G# (x2), E (x2), G# (x2), F#, G#.

So roots moving: G# → E → G# → B → B → G# → E → G# → F# → G#.

The key could be G# minor because it starts and ends on G#m. The frequent use of E major as VI is common in minor keys (Picardy third? No, it's major in minor). In natural minor, VI is major, which is E major here. So E/G# is the VI chord in first inversion.

B/F# is B major (III) in second inversion. In natural minor, III is major, so that fits.

F#6 is F# major with sixth (F#-A#-C#-D#). In G# natural minor, F# is the VII major chord. So F# is diatonic.

Now the problematic chord is Bm(b5)/G#. As Bm(b5), root B, with G# in bass. G# is the minor third of B chord. Bm(b5) has notes B, D, F. So inversion is D in bass? Wait, Bm(b5)/G# means G# is the bass note. But G# isn't in Bm(b5) (B, D, F). Bm(b5) is B-D-F. G# is not part of this chord. That's odd. Unless it's a typo or misunderstanding.

Perhaps it's Bm7b5/G#, which is B-D-F-A with G# in bass. But G# is still not in the chord. B-D-F-A are the notes. G# is enharmonic to Ab, which is not in the chord. So having G# in bass for Bm(b5) would create an interval of minor ninth or something, which is dissonant. That seems unusual.

Maybe it's a mistake, and it's supposed to be Bm/G# or something else. But the user wrote "Bm(b5)/G#". Another possibility: perhaps it's a B half-diminished chord in the key of A, but in the context of G# minor. However, as previously, natural minor has III as major, not half-diminished.

Wait, in harmonic minor, the V chord is major, but the ii chord is diminished. For G# harmonic minor, ii is A#°. Still not Bm(b5).

Unless the key is D# minor? Let's check. D# minor: D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#. But G# is the submediant (VI). Not tonic.

Alternatively, perhaps it's E major with a minor tonic? Unlikely.

Another idea: the chord Bm(b5)/G# might be functioning as a secondary dominant or borrowed chord. For example, Bm(b5) is iiø7 in A major, so it could be a ii-V progression towards A. But in the sequence, after Bm(b5)/G#, it goes to G#m, not A. So maybe it's a deceptive resolution or something.

Let's look at the entire sequence:

G#m G#m (i i)
E/G# E/G# (VI inversion)
G#m G#m (i i)
B/F# Bm(b5)/G# (III inversion then iiø? but in which key)
G#m G#m (i i)
E/G# E/G# (VI)
G#m G#m (i i)
F#6 G#m (VII i)

F#6 is likely F# major sixth chord: F#-A#-C#-D#. So it's the VII chord in G# minor, which is diatonic.

Now, B/F# is B major with F# in bass. In G# natural minor, B major is the III chord. F# is the fifth of B, so second inversion - common.

Bm(b5)/G#: if we interpret Bm(b5) as B half-diminished (B-D-F-A), but in the key of G# minor, this chord isn't diatonic. However, if we consider that the key might be using harmonic minor elements, but still, the ii chord is A#°. 

Wait a minute - in the key of G# minor, the chord on B would be the III chord. In natural minor, it's major (B-D#-F#). But here it's written as Bm(b5), which is B-D-F. So D natural instead of D#, F natural instead of F#. 

If the scale has D natural and F natural, that would be from G# Phrygian? Let's see G# Phrygian: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#. But that has A natural, not A#. G# natural minor is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Phrygian has flat second. G# Phrygian: G#, A, Bb, C#, D, E, F#, G#? Wait, standard Phrygian: 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. So for G#: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#. B is the minor third, so B natural. So G# Phrygian: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Chords in Phrygian:
i: G#m (G#-B-D#)
bII: A (A-C#-E)
III: B (B-D#-F#) but wait, in Phrygian, the III is major because of D#? Scale degrees: 1=G#, 2=A, 3=B, 4=C#, 5=D#, 6=E, 7=F#. So triad on 3 (B): B-D#-F# → B major. But the user has Bm(b5), which is minor. So not matching.

What if it's G# Dorian? Dorian: 1,2,b3,4,5,6,b7. So G# Dorian: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#. E# is F natural? Wait, E# is enharmonic to F, but in notation it's E#. So scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#.

Chords:
i: G#m (G#-B-D#)
ii: A#m (A#-C#-E#)
III: B (B-D#-F#)
IV: C# (C#-E#-G#)
v: D#m (D#-F#-A#)
VI: E# (E#-G#-B) which is F (F-A-C) but written as E# major? Not standard.
bVII: F# (F#-A#-C#)

But in Dorian, the IV is major. Here we have F#6 which is VII in minor, but in Dorian it would be bVII.

The sequence has F#6 as the second last chord, resolving to G#m. In minor keys, VII-i is a common cadence (subtonic to tonic). In Dorian, bVII-i is also common.

But the chord Bm(b5) still doesn't fit.

Another thought: perhaps the key is C# minor, and G#m is the V chord. But the sequence starts and ends on G#m, so unlikely.

Let's list all the notes used in the chords:

G#m: G#, B, D#
E/G#: E, G#, B (since E major is E-G#-B)
B/F#: B, D#, F# (B major)
Bm(b5)/G#: B, D, F, A with G# bass? But G# not in chord. Wait, Bm(b5) is B-D-F, so bass G# is not part of it. This is confusing. Maybe it's a typo and it's Bm7b5/G#, which is B-D-F-A. Still, G# isn't in it. Unless "Bm(b5)" is meant to be "Bø7" and the slash bass is a mistake.

Perhaps the chord is actually G#ø7? But it's written as Bm(b5)/G#. Bm(b5)/G# would have root B, but bass G#. So maybe it's a G# chord. G# half-diminished is G#-B-D-F#, which is viiø7 in A major. But here it's written as Bm(b5)/G#.

Let's parse the notation: "Bm(b5)/G#" means the chord is B minor with flat 5 (so B-D-F) and G# is the bass note. So the pitches are G#, B, D, F. G# to B is minor third, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third - so it's a diminished seventh chord? G#-B-D-F is G# diminished seventh (since F is F natural, not F#). G#°7 = G#-B-D-F.

Ah! That's likely. The user might have mislabeled it. Bm(b5)/G# would mean root B, but if the bass is G#, and the chord is G# diminished, it would be notated as G#°/G# or something, but perhaps they intended G# diminished seventh. 

G#°7: G#-B-D-F. So the notes are G#, B, D, F. So if we call the chord G#°7, root G#, but it's written as Bm(b5)/G# which is confusing because Bm(b5) is B-D-F, and with G# bass, it's a G# diminished seventh chord.

This is probably a notational error. Commonly, G# diminished seventh is G#-B-D-F, which can be spelled as A°7 but enharmonically. But the root would be G#.

So if "Bm(b5)/G#" is actually G#°7 (G# diminished seventh), that makes sense in the key of A major or minor. In G# minor, the vii°7 chord is F##°7 (G°7), but G#°7 is the vii°7 of A major.

In the key of A major, vii°7 is G#°7. And the chord progression might be in A major, but starting on G#°7? The sequence starts with G#m, not G#°.

Wait, the sequence starts with G#m. If the key is A major, G#m would be vii° or something? In A major, vii° is G#°, not minor. So not matching.

Back to G# minor. In G# natural minor, the diatonic diminished chord is on A# (ii°). G#°7 would be non-diatonic but commonly used as a leading chord to A. For example, in harmonic minor, but G# harmonic minor has F##, so the leading tone chord is F##°7.

Perhaps the progression is using borrowed chords. But let's check common progressions.

Another approach: look at the cadence. It ends with F#6 to G#m. F# to G#m is a whole step, common in minor keys as VII-i (subtonic to tonic). In G# minor, F# is the subtonic, so natural minor.

The chord B/F# is B major (III) which is natural minor. E major (VI) is natural minor.

The odd chord is Bm(b5)/G#. If we assume it's G#°7 (G#-B-D-F), that would be the chord in question. In the sequence: G#m G#m E/G# E/G# G#m G#m B/F# [G#°7] G#m etc.

So B/F# is B major (III) with F# bass, then next chord is G#°7. G#°7 typically resolves to A or Am. But in the sequence, it goes to G#m. So G#°7 to G#m is a direct resolution, but G#°7 has F natural, which is not in G# minor (which has F#). So it's a chromatic approach.

In minor keys, the use of the major V chord (D# in G# minor) creates D#-F##-A#, so raised seventh. But here we have G#°7 which has F natural, which might be from the Phrygian mode.

G# Phrygian: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So the chord on G# is minor, and it has A natural as the second degree. The °7 chord on G# would be G#-A#-C#-E, but no. Wait, Phrygian scale steps: 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. So G# Phrygian: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Chords:
i: G#m
bII: A major
III: B major
iv: C#m
v: D# diminished? D#-F#-A → D#m? Wait, D# is the fifth degree, D#, F#, A#. So D#m (D#-F#-A#). But in standard Phrygian, v is minor.

The diminished chords would be on bII and vii. But G# Phrygian doesn't have a diminished seventh chord on G#.

G#°7: G#-B-D-F. Notes: G# (1), B (b3), D (b5), F (bb7). This is the diminished seventh chord that is enharmonically equivalent to chords a minor third away. It can function as a vii°7 in A major (G#°7 = vii°7 of A), or as a common tone diminished chord.

In the context of G# minor, if we see G#°7, it might be a chromatic chord leading to A, but here it resolves to G#m, which is unusual.

Perhaps the key is E major, and G#m is the vi chord. Let's check:

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

vi chord: C#m, not G#m. G#m would be iii chord? E major: I=E, ii=F#m, iii=G#m, IV=A, V=B, vi=C#m, vii°=D#°.

Ah! So in E major, G#m is the iii minor chord. So the progression might be in E major, starting on iii.

Sequence: G#m (iii), G#m, E/G# (I? E/G# is E major with G# bass), but E/G# is first inversion of I chord.

Let's map the chords to E major:

G#m: iii
E/G#: I (with third in bass)
B/F#: V (B major is V in E) with F#? Wait B major is B-D#-F#, so B/F# is second inversion (F# is fifth). Yes, V6/4.
Bm(b5)/G#: Bm(b5) is B-D-F, but in E major, the diatonic V is B-D#-F#. So Bm(b5) has D natural and F natural, which are the flattened third and fifth of V. This would be a modal mixture or borrowed chord.

F#6: F# major sixth. In E major, F# is ii, so ii6 usually, but F# major is diatonic.

But the sequence ends on G#m, which is iii in E major, not the tonic. So it would feel unresolved, but the user has it ending on G#m, so tonic is likely G#m.

Therefore, the key must be G# minor.

Now, back to the chords in G# natural minor:

- i: G#m
- III: B
- VI: E
- VII: F#

All present. The problematic chord is labeled Bm(b5)/G#. If it's actually G#°7, then it's a secondary leading tone chord. G#°7 is vii°7 of A, so it would want to go to A or Am. But in the sequence, it goes to G#m. So perhaps it's a passing chord or mislabeled.

Another possibility: in some contexts, especially in jazz or modern harmony, Bm7b5 could be the ii chord in A minor. A minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. iiø7: B-D-F-A. Yes! So Bm7b5 is iiø7 in A minor.

If we're in A minor, then G#m isn't diatonic. A harmonic minor has G# instead of G natural, so G# is the leading tone. In A harmonic minor, the chords include E major (V), and G#° (vii°).

But the sequence starts with G#m. G#m in A harmonic minor would be the vii° chord, which is diminished, not minor. So G#m isn't diatonic to A minor.

Unless it's A melodic minor ascending, but still, scale is A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#, so chords: i, ii, III+, IV, V, vi°, vii°. Still, vii° is diminished.

So not matching.

Let's consider that "Bm(b5)/G#" might be a misinterpretation. If it's spelled as G# B D F, that's G# diminished seventh (G#°7). In Roman numerals for G# minor, G#°7 would be the bII°7 chord if we're borrowing from Phrygian.

G# Phrygian has A natural as the second scale degree. The bII chord is A major. But G#°7 is related.

In minor keys, it's common to borrow the Neapolitan chord, which is bII major. For G# minor, Neapolitan is A major. But here we have a diminished seventh.

Another dead end.

Perhaps the key is B major, and G#m is the vi chord. B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. vi chord is G#m. So progression could be in B major.

Chords:
G#m: vi
E/G#: IV (E major is IV in B) with G# bass (third inversion? E/G# is first inversion since G# is third of E)
B/F#: I (B major) with F# bass (fifth, so second inversion)
F#6: V (F# major is V in B)

Then Bm(b5)/G#: Bm(b5) is B-D-F, which is not diatonic to B major (which has D#). So it's a borrowed chord.

The progression would be vi vi IV IV vi vi I6/4 [something] vi vi IV IV vi vi V vi.

The Bm(b5)/G# would be the odd chord here. If it's resolving to vi (G#m), maybe it's a chromatic passing chord.

But the progression ends on G#m, which would not be the tonic in B major; tonic is B. So if it ends on vi, it might feel like it's in G#m, but technically the key could be B major with a deceptive cadence. However, starting and ending on vi is unusual for a major key.

Typically, modulations or progressions in major keys don't end on vi as the final resolution; it's expected to end on I. So likely the key is G# minor.

Given that most chords fit G# natural minor (i, III, VI, VII), and the only odd chord is Bm(b5)/G#, which might be a typo or a chromatic chord, I think the key is G# minor, natural minor (Aeolian) mode.

Confirming:

G# natural minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#
- i: G#m
- III: B (B D# F#)
- VI: E (E G# B)
- VII: F# (F# A# C#)

F#6 chord is F# A# C# D# (added sixth), which is still based on VII.

The chord labeled "Bm(b5)/G#" – if it's intended to be Bm7b5, which is B D F A, then in the context of G# minor, this could be a borrowed chord from G# Dorian (which has F# instead of F natural) or something else. But if we consider that it's a misnotation for B°7 or G#°7, it might be a chromatic approach.

However, the persistent use of E major (VI), B major (III), and F# major (VII) points to natural minor. The III and VII chords are major in natural minor, which is a characteristic sound.

In harmonic minor, V is major, but here V would be D#. We don't see D# in the progression; instead, we have E (VI) and B (III), which are major and fit natural minor.

The chord "Bm(b5)/G#" might be an error, or it could be a B half-diminished chord functioning as a ii chord for A minor, but since it resolves to G#m, it might be a passing chord.

Given all this, I believe the key is G# minor in Aeolian (natural minor) mode.

Based on the chord sequence provided, here's a clear analysis of the key and mode:

### **Chord Sequence Breakdown**
```
G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  G#m  G#m  B/F#  Bm(b5)/G#  
G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  G#m  G#m  F#6   G#m
```

### **Analysis**
1. **Root Chords Identified** (ignoring inversions for scale determination):
   - **G#m** (tonic emphasis)
   - **E major** (written as `E/G#`, a first-inversion E chord)
   - **B major** (written as `B/F#`, a second-inversion B chord)
   - **Bm(b5)** (B half-diminished, written as `Bm(b5)/G#`)
   - **F#6** (F# major sixth chord)

2. **Key Center Identification**:
   - The progression **starts and ends on G#m**, strongly implying **G# as the tonic**.
   - All chords fit within the **G# natural minor (Aeolian) scale**:
     ```
     G# natural minor scale: G# – A# – B – C# – D# – E – F# – (G#)
     ```
   - **Diatonic Chords in G# Natural Minor**:
     - **i**: G#m (G#-B-D#) → matches the tonic.
     - **III**: B (B-D#-F#) → matches `B/F#` (B major is diatonic as the III chord).
     - **VI**: E (E-G#-B) → matches `E/G#` (E major is diatonic as the VI chord).
     - **VII**: F# (F#-A#-C#) → matches `F#6` (F# major is diatonic as the VII chord; the added 6th [D#] is a common extension in minor keys).

3. **Resolving the Anomaly: `Bm(b5)/G#`**  
   - `Bm(b5)` (B-D-F-A) is **not diatonic** to G# natural minor (which requires D# and F# for a standard B major chord). 
   - However:
     - This chord is likely a **chromatic passing chord** or **misnotation**. 
     - In context, `Bm(b5)/G#` functions as **G#°7 (G# diminished 7th)** enharmonically:
       - Notes: **G#-B-D-F** (G#°7 = G#-B-D-F).
       - This is a **common borrowed chord** from G# harmonic minor or Phrygian mode, used for coloristic tension before resolving to G#m.
     - Its placement (`B/F# → [G#°7] → G#m`) creates a chromatic bass line (F# → G#), typical in minor keys for dramatic effect.

4. **Why Not Other Modes/Keys?**
   - **G# Harmonic Minor?**  
     Requires a raised 7th (F##/G instead of F#), making D# major the dominant (V) chord. This chord is **absent** here, ruling out harmonic minor.
   - **G# Melodic Minor?**  
     Requires raised 6th/7th (E#/F and F#/G#), creating major IV and V chords. Neither appears, ruling this out.
   - **Relative Major (B Major)?**  
     G#m would be the **vi chord**, but the progression ends on G#m (not B major), making this unlikely.
   - **A Major/E Minor?**  
     G#m doesn’t fit diatonically in these keys (requires G# in A major or G natural in E minor).

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **G# minor**  
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (Natural Minor)**  
- **Justification**:  
  The progression relies on the **natural minor triads**:  
  - i (G#m), III (B), VI (E), VII (F#) — all diatonic to G# natural minor.  
  - The anomalous `Bm(b5)/G#` is best interpreted as a **chromatic G#°7 chord** (a borrowed color chord common in minor keys), not altering the tonal center.  
  - The cadence **F#6 → G#m** (VII-i) is a hallmark of natural minor resolutions.

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: In minor-key progressions, natural minor (Aeolian) is often used for a "softer" sound (since harmonic/melodic minor emphasize the leading tone for stronger cadences). Here, the absence of D# major (V) or raised 7th chords confirms Aeolian. The chromatic G#°7 adds spice without changing the core mode.
