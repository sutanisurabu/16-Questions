Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**
```
G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  
G#m  G#m  B/F#  Bm(b5)/G#  
G#m  G#m  E/G#  E/G#  
G#m  G#m  F#6  G#m
```

### Step 1: Identify chord roots and types
- **G#m** = G# minor (G# – B – D#)
- **E/G#** = E major in first inversion (bass on G#); E major = E – G# – B
- **B/F#** = B major in first inversion (bass on F#); B = B – D# – F#
- **Bm(b5)/G#** = B half-diminished (Bmø or Bø), also called Bm(b5), in first inversion (bass on G#). Bm(b5) = B – D – F#
- **F#6** = F# major with a 6th (F# – A# – C# – D#)

So overall, the chords are:
- G#m
- E major (inversion)
- B major (inversion)
- Bm(b5) (inversion)
- F#6

---

### Step 2: Look at common tonics and possible keys

All chords revolve around **G#** in the bass or root. G# minor appears repeatedly and starts/ends the progression — this strongly suggests **G# minor** as the **tonic key**.

Now let’s evaluate whether this is **natural minor**, **harmonic minor**, or **melodic minor** (or another mode).

---

### Step 3: Compare chords to G# minor scales

**G# natural minor** (same as B major):
- Notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#
- Chords built on this scale would be:
  - i: G#m
  - ii°: A#dim
  - III: B
  - iv: C#m
  - v: D#m
  - VI: E
  - VII: F#

Wait — **E major (III)** is not in G# natural minor. In natural minor, the VI chord is **E major**? Let's check:

Wait — actually, the relative major of G# minor is **B major**. So G# minor has the same key signature as B major (5 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#).

So:
- G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Chords in G# natural minor:
- i: G#m
- ii°: A#dim
- III: B (major)
- iv: C#m
- v: D#m
- VI: E (major)
- VII: F# (major)

So:
- G#m → i
- E major (E/G#) → VI
- B major (B/F#) → III
- F# major/F#6 → VII

So far, these all fit **G# natural minor**.

Now the strange chord: **Bm(b5)/G#**

- Bm(b5) = B–D–F#
- This is the **iiø7** chord in **harmonic minor**.

Let’s check **G# harmonic minor**:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (F## = G)
- But we don’t see any G natural (F##) in the chords listed.

Wait — the chord **Bm(b5)** = B–D–F#.

In **G# harmonic minor**, the raised 7th is **F## (G)**, so:
- The ii chord in harmonic minor is **A# half-diminished**, not B.

Hold on — B is the **third degree** of G# minor.

So Bm(b5) would be the **iiiø** chord?

But in G# harmonic minor:
- i: G#m
- ii°: A#dim
- III+: B augmented (B–D#–F##)
- iv: C#m
- v: D#m
- VI: E
- VII: F##dim

So **Bm(b5)** is **not** in G# harmonic minor.

In fact, Bm(b5) (B–D–F#) includes:
- B (3rd of G#)
- D (lowered 5th from D# — not diatonic to G# minor)
- F# (7th of G# minor)

So D natural is not in G# minor (which has D#). So Bm(b5) has D — a **flat 5th** relative to B major.

But if the chord is **Bm(b5)**, it has:
- Root: B
- m3: D
- b5: F#

That would imply it's built on B with **D** and **F#** — so D is not in G# minor (which has D#). So this chord is **chromatic**.

Wait — could it be a **secondary chord**?

Alternatively, **Bm(b5)** is the **iiø7** chord in **A major** or **A minor**, but that doesn't help.

Wait — perhaps it's a **viio/vi** or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the chord is functioning as a **iiø7** in **A# minor**, but that’s complicated.

But let's consider: **Bm(b5)/G#** — the bass is **G#**.

So the chord is **Bm(b5)** with **G#** in the bass → G#, B, D, F#

That makes the full chord: **G# – B – D – F#**

Which is: **G#m7(b5)** or **G# half-diminished (G#ø)**

Ah! That’s the key.

Even though it's labeled **Bm(b5)/G#**, the notes are:
- Bass: G#
- Chord: B–D–F#

So combined: **G#, B, D, F#**

That’s a **G#ø7** chord — G# half-diminished = **iiø7** in **F# minor**

Wait — but we’re thinking G# minor.

In **G# minor**, the **ii°** chord is **A# diminished**, not G#ø.

So G#ø is **not diatonic** to G# minor.

But G#ø is the **viiø7** of **A major**, or the **iiø7** of **F# minor**.

Hmm.

But let's reconsider the labeling: **Bm(b5)/G#**

If the bass is G#, and the chord is Bm(b5), then the full set of notes is:
- G# (bass)
- B
- D
- F#

So yes: G#, B, D, F#

That is: **G#–B–D–F#**

Intervals from G#:
- G#–B = minor third
- B–D = minor third
- D–F# = major third

So a **fully diminished 7th**? No: G#–B–D–F# → intervals:

- G#–B: m3
- B–D: m3
- D–F#: M3

So it's a **half-diminished** chord, **G#m7(b5)**, root G#.

So it should be labeled **G#ø** or **G#m7(b5)**, not **Bm(b5)/G#**

Unless the harmonic function is as a **Bm(b5)** chord over G#, but musically, it's **G# half-diminished**.

So this chord is **G#m7(b5)** — iim7(b5) of **F# minor**

That suggests we might actually be in **F# minor**, not G# minor.

Let’s re-evaluate.

---

### Try key: **F# minor**

F# natural minor:
- F#, G#, A, A#, C#, D, E
- Wait — enharmonics: better to use:
- F#, G#, A, Bb, C#, D, E

But in practice:
- Notes: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E → no, B is natural, not Bb.

F# minor:
- F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E
- Same as A major (3 sharps)

Chords in F# minor:
- i: F#m
- ii°: G#dim
- III: A
- iv: Bm
- v: C#m
- VI: D
- VII: E

But our chords include:
- G#m → could be ii°? But G#dim, not G#m
- Wait — G#m is G#, B, D#. But in F# minor, B is B natural, D is D natural — so G#dim = G#, B, D — not D#.

So G#m (with D#) is **not** in F# minor.

G#m has D# — which is not in F# minor.

So G#m has:
- G#, B, D#

D# is in G# minor (6th note), but not in F# minor.

So G#m fits **G# minor** (obviously).

But earlier, we have a chord with D natural → in **Bm(b5)**: B–D–F# — D natural.

So now we have a problem:
- G#m → D#
- Bm(b5) → D

So both D and D#? That's not diatonic.

Unless the **Bm(b5)** is using D, not D#.

But G# minor has D#, not D.

So the chord Bm(b5) = B–D–F# has **D**, which is **D natural**, a **half-step below D#**.

So that’s **enharmonically D**, not D#.

So this chord contains a **D**, which is **not in G# minor**.

But wait — in **G# harmonic minor**, the 7th is **F## (G)**, but the 6th is still **E**, and 5th is D#.

So D is still not in G# minor.

So the Bm(b5) chord (B–D–F#) has a D — **lowered 6th degree** — perhaps borrowed?

Alternatively, could the chord be **Bø7**? That's a common chord.

Bø7 = B–D–F#–A → half-diminished.

But our chord is Bm(b5), so likely B–D–F#, possibly with A.

But still, D is not in G# minor.

Wait — unless the key is not G# minor.

Let’s reconsider: perhaps the key is **E major** or **C# minor**?

Wait — list all notes used:

From chords:
- G#m: G#, B, D#
- E/G#: E, G#, B
- B/F#: B, D#, F#
- Bm(b5)/G#: B, D, F#, G# (bass)
- F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

So notes:
- G#, B, D# (from G#m, E, B/F#)
- E, G#, B (E major)
- B, D#, F# (B major)
- B, D, F#, G# (Bm(b5)/G#)
- F#, A#, C#, D# (F#6)

List all unique notes:
- G#
- B
- D#
- E
- F#
- D
- A#
- C#

So notes:
- C#
- D
- D#
- E
- F#
- G#
- A#
- B

So we have **both D and D#** — chromatic.

That suggests **mode mixture** or **chromaticism**.

But let’s see which key could have most of these.

Look at **G# Dorian mode**:

Dorian on G#:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#
- That’s the same as F# major.

So G# Dorian:
- i: G#m
- ii: A#m
- III: B
- IV: C#
- v: D#m
- VI: E
- VII: F#

Compare with chords:
- G#m → i
- E → VI
- B → III
- F# → VII

All fit.

Now **Bm(b5)/G#** = G#, B, D, F#

D is **D natural**, but in G# Dorian, the 6th is **E**, and 4th is **C#**, so D natural is not present.

G# Dorian has: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So D natural is **not** in G# Dorian.

But it has **C#** and **D#**, no D.

So D is still foreign.

Unless it's a **blue note** or chromatic passing.

Wait — the chord **F#6** = F# A# C# D# — D# is the 6th, so D# is used.

D natural is only in the **Bm(b5)** chord.

Perhaps **Bm(b5)** is a **iiø7** chord in **A major** or **A minor**, but resolving where?

Alternatively, perhaps **Bm(b5)/G#** is functioning as a **chromatic passing chord** between G#m and something.

Sequence: 
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G#  
G#m – G#m – B/F# – Bm(b5)/G#  
G#m – G#m – E/G# – E/G#  
G#m – G#m – F#6 – G#m

So before F#6, we have Bm(b5)/G#, which is G#ø.

G#m to G#ø to F#6 to G#m.

G#m (i) – G#ø (iio) – F#6 (VII6) – G#m (i)

But in G# minor, G#ø is not diatonic.

However, **G#ø** is the **iim7(b5)** in **F# minor**.

But not helpful.

Wait — another idea: **G# Phrygian mode**

Phrygian on G#:
- G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#
- Based on E major: E F# G# A B C# D#

So notes: G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Compare to our notes:
- We have A# (in F#6), but Phrygian has A natural.

F#6 has A# → not in G# Phrygian.

So no.

Back to G# natural minor: G# A# B C# D# E F#

Chords diatonic:
- G#m (i)
- A#dim (ii°)
- B (III)
- C#m (iv)
- D#m (v)
- E (VI)
- F# (VII)

Our chords:
- G#m — yes
- E major (E/G#) — VI — yes
- B major (B/F#) — III — yes
- F#6 — F#, A#, C#, D# — A# is **not** in G# natural minor.

Wait — F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

But in G# minor, the 3rd of F# chord should be **A natural**, not A#.

F# is the VII chord in G# minor, so it should be **F# major** only in harmonic or melodic minor.

In G# natural minor, the seventh is F#, so F# chord would be **F# diminished**, not major.

Let's double-check:

G# natural minor: G# A# B C# D# E F#

So F# chord: F#, A, C#

A natural, not A#.

But our **F#6** has **A#**, which is **Bb** — not in the key.

F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#

A# is the third of the chord, so this is a **major chord**, not diminished.

So F# major exists, which requires A#.

A# is natural in **G# harmonic minor**?

**G# harmonic minor**:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G)

So notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, G

So A# is present, yes.

Now chord on F#: F#, A#, C#, E

That’s **F# minor** — because A# is the minor third.

But we have **F#6**, which is **F# major 6th chord = F#, A#, C#, D#**

But in G# harmonic minor, the C note is **C#**, so F# chord would be:
- F#, A#, C#
- A# to C# is minor third (3 semitones), so **F# minor triad**

But F#6 is **F# major** with sixth — F#–A#–C#–D#

A# to C# is minor third (3 semitons), so that would be **F# minor 6th**, not F#6.

**F#6** typically means F# major triad with 6th: F#, A#, C##, D#

Wait! Critical mistake.

**F#6 chord** is:
- F# (root)
- A# (major third)
- C# (perfect fifth)
- D# (sixth)

No. In standard chord notation, **F#6** = F# + A# + C# + D#

But A# to C# is an **augmented second** in terms of scale, but in equal temperament, it's 3 semitones = minor third.

So F#–A#–C#: A# is 3 semitones above F#, C# is 4 above A#, so F#–A#–C# = F# minor triad.

So **F#m6**, not F#6.

But in notation, **F#6** implies **F# major 6th**, which is:
- F#, A#, C##, D#

C## = D

So F#6 = F#, A#, D, D#

That's a different chord.

But in practice, in rock/pop, "F#6" is often used loosely to mean F# add9 or something, but strictly, F#6 is F# major with 6th: F#, A#, D, D#

But we had **A# in the chord**, not D natural.

So if the chord has **A#**, it's not possible to be F#6 unless it's F# major.

Let's assume that "F#6" here means **F# add13** or mislabeled F#m6.

But likely, the chord is **F# with A#, C#, D#**, and A# is intended as the **third**, so it's **F# minor 6th (F#m6)**.

In many contexts, "F#6" is used to mean F#m6.

Alternatively, in the key of G#, **F#** can be the **VII chord**, which is **F# diminished** in natural minor, but if it's **major**, it might be borrowed.

But earlier, we see that in **G# natural minor**, the VI chord is **E major**, which we have.

And III is **B major**, which we have.

The only non-diatonic chords are:
- Bm(b5)/G# — has D natural
- F#6 — has A#? Wait no — in F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#, A# is natural in G# minor (2nd degree), so yes, A# is in the key.

But the F# triad in G# minor is **F# diminished**: F#, A, C#

But this chord has **A#**, not A.

A# is the second scale degree.

So F# + A# = F# to A# is **minor third**, so the chord is **F# minor**, not diminished.

So F#m = F#, A#, C#

C# is the fifth — C# is the 4th degree of G# minor, so yes.

So F#m = F#, A#, C#

Then add D# = 6th — D# is 5th scale degree.

So F#m6 = F#, A#, C#, D# — all notes are in **G# natural minor**.

Yes! G# natural minor has:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So:
- F#: F#, A#, C# — wait, A# is correct, but **F# to A# is minor third**, so the chord is **F# minor**, but we need to see its quality.

F# + A# = minor third (3 semitones)
A# + C# = minor third again? A# to C# is 3 semitones — yes, Bb to C# is major third? Let's calculate:

A# = 11, C# = 1, difference: 2 semitones? No.

Equal temperament:
- F# = 6
- A# = 10
- C# = 1
So F# to A# = 4 semitones = major third
A# to C# = 3 semitones = minor third
F# to C# = 7 semitones = perfect fifth

So F#, A#, C# = F# major triad.

Yes! A# is the major third above F#.

F# to A# is 4 semitones = major third.

So F#6 = F#–A#–C#–D#
- Major triad (F#)
- Sixth = D#

D# is the major sixth from F#.

And in G# natural minor, the VII chord is **F# diminished**, but this is **F# major**.

So it's not diatonic.

But in **G# harmonic minor**, the notes are:
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F## (G)

So no A# in the scale as a note above F#.

The chord on the seventh degree would be F##–A#–C#, which is E# dim, not helpful.

The chord on F# is not built.

But the **V chord** in G# minor is D# – F## – A# = D# augmented.

Not matching.

So F# major is not in G# minor.

But earlier, E major is the VI chord, B major is III chord — both are in G# natural minor.

F# major is **not** in G# natural minor; the seventh degree chord is diminished.

So F#6 (major) is chromatic.

Similarly, Bm(b5)/G# has D natural, not in key.

But let’s notice a pattern.

Many of the chords fit **G# Aeolian (natural minor)**:
- G#m = i
- E = VI
- B = III
- F# = should be viio, but we have it as major

But if we allow for **raised VII chord**, sometimes seen.

But F#6 is major.

Another idea: mode?

Let's list the chords again with Roman numerals assuming G# minor:
- G#m = i
- E/G# = VI
- B/F# = III
- Bm(b5)/G# = ? (not diatonic)
- F#6 = VII (but major, not diminished)

Wait — in **G# Dorian**, the major chords on III and VI and VII?

G# Dorian: from F# major
- G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Chords:
- i: G#m
- ii: A#m
- III: B major
- IV: C# major
- v: D#m
- VI: E minor
- VII: F# major

But we have **E major**, not E minor.

So VI is major, but in Dorian, it's minor.

So not Dorian.

Could be **G# minor with modal mixture**, borrowing from other modes.

But simplest explanation is: the key is **G# minor**, and the mode is **Aeolian**, with some chromatic alterations:
- F#6 = major VI or VII? F# is VII, but we want it major

In many rock/pop ballads, the VII chord is made major for a stronger pull.

Similarly, the Bm(b5)/G# might be a chromatic passing chord.

But let's look at the bass motion:
- G# - G# - G# - G#
- G# - G# - F# - G#
- G# - G# - G# - G#
- G# - G# - F# - G#

So mostly G# in bass, with F# appearing.

The chord Bm(b5)/G# has G# bass and B, D, F#

So the upper structure is B–D–F# = B diminished or Bm(b5)

B–D–F# = B diminished would be B–D–F, but F# is not F.

B–D–F# = minor third + minor third = diminished, but D to F# is major third.

B to D = m3, D to F# = M3, so it's Bm6 with fifth missing? No.

B–D–F# = B D F# = B minor + major sixth, so Bm6, but no sixth.

Intervals:
- B–D: minor third
- D–F#: major third
So it's a first inversion of G#m7(b5): G#–B–D–F#

Yes! So the chord is **G#m7(b5)**, or **G#ø**

And it's a passing chord between G#m and F#6.

So progression is:
G#m - G#m - E/G# - E/G#
G#m - G#m - B/F# - G#ø
G#m - G#m - E/G# - E/G#
G#m - G#m - F#6 - G#m

So the function:
- G#ø is iiø in F# minor, but here it's acting as a passing chord.
- F#6 is VII major, common in rock to make it major.

So despite the chromaticisms, the tonic is clearly G#m, and the chords E, B, F# are all diatonic to the key of **G# natural minor** except for the quality of F# and the added chord.

But E major is VI, B major is III, F# should be diminished, but is major, so likely **borrowed** or a common rock alteration.

The key is **G# minor (Aeolian mode)**.

The Bm(b5)/G# is a chromatic passing chord to add motion.

### Final Answer:
- **Key: G# minor**
- **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**

With chromatic elements:
- F#6 is a major VII chord (non-diatonic, but common)
- G#ø (written as Bm(b5)/G#) is a chromatic passing chord or borrowed from another mode.
