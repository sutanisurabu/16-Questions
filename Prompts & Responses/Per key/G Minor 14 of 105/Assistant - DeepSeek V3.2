Let’s break this down step-by-step.

---

**1. Write out the chords clearly**

The progression is:

Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – Bb/F – Bm(b5)/G – Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – F6 – Gm

---

**2. Identify the bass line**

- Gm = G bass  
- Eb/G = G bass  
- Bb/F = F bass  
- Bm(b5)/G = G bass  
- F6 = F bass

So bass line is mostly G, with some F.

**3. Look at the chord functions in a possible key**

**Option 1: Key of Gm (G natural minor / G Aeolian)**

- Gm = i  
- Eb/G = Eb major (VI chord) in first inversion — in G minor, Eb is bVI  
- Bb/F = Bb major (IV chord) in first inversion — in G minor, Bb is bIII  
- Bm(b5)/G = B–D–F over G bass — B–D–F is B diminished triad (Bdim), which is the ii° chord in A harmonic minor, but here it’s in G minor? Let’s check: in G natural minor: A–C–Eb is ii°, but B–D–F is not in G natural minor. B–D–F is actually the vii° of C minor. But here it’s B–D–F with G in bass — so it’s G–B–D–F = Gm(maj7) if B is included? Wait, Bm(b5) means B–D–F, that’s B diminished triad. Over G bass: notes G–B–D–F — that’s Gm(maj7) indeed. So maybe the chord symbol “Bm(b5)/G” is misleading — it’s really Gm(maj7), which implies G harmonic minor.

- F6 = F–A–C–D — in G minor, F is bVII, F6 adds D which is the 5th of Gm.

**4. Check for G minor vs G Dorian**

G natural minor: Gm, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F  
G Dorian: Gm, Bb, C, Dm, Eb, F, Am(b5) — difference is C major instead of Cm.

Here we see Bb and Eb, both from natural minor and Dorian.  
But Bm(b5)/G (G–B–D–F) has B natural, not Bb. That’s the leading tone in G harmonic minor. So it’s not pure Aeolian or Dorian — it’s G minor with a major V chord implied? Actually, no V chord (D major) appears, but the B natural appears in Gm(maj7) chord.

So the mode is **G minor (Aeolian) with occasional harmonic minor inflection** (B natural), not Dorian (which would have C major, not here).

---

**5. F6 in G minor**

F6 = F A C D — D is the 5th of G minor, so it’s a bVII6 chord, common in minor key pop.

---

**6. Conclusion**

Key: **G minor**  
Mode: **Mostly Aeolian (natural minor)** but with a harmonic minor color via the Gm(maj7) chord (Bm(b5)/G).

---

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{G \ \text{minor}}
\]  
Mode: G Aeolian with harmonic minor inflection.
