### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to analyze the chord progression: "Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm." The slashes indicate inversions, so Eb/G means an Eb major chord over G, and Bb/F means Bb major over F. Bm(b5)/G suggests a half-diminished chord over G, which translates to B-D-F over G bass. With all these G minor chords, it confirms the tonic is G minor, and Eb/G seems to be in second inversion.**Clarifying chord functions**

Actually, Eb/G means G in the bass. The chord consists of the notes Eb-G-Bb, where G is the root. In relation to G, this gives a minor third (Bb) and a flat sixth (Eb). It's not the same as Gm7, since Gm is G-Bb-D and Eb/G lacks the D. This chord could serve as the VI in G natural minor or possibly be interpreted as IV in Bb major over the third. Bb/F is a first inversion with F in the bass, indicating a second inversion context, which may link to an interesting Gm6 idea.**Exploring chord functions in G minor**

In G natural minor, the VII chord is F major (F-A-C), but Bb/F doesn’t fit as its IV. I should consider whether we're looking at G Dorian versus Aeolian. The presence of E natural could differ from Eb, especially since I noticed it in the Eb/G chord. The F6 chord (F-A-C-D) is interesting too—it contains A natural. The key difference between Aeolian and Dorian is the sixth: Aeolian has Eb while Dorian has E natural. So, we lean toward Aeolian since we've got a strong Eb.**Determining the key and mode**

So, Bb/F includes D natural as the third of Bb, which is the fifth of G. But I’m not seeing any E natural chords, so it looks like we're in G Aeolian, or natural minor. There’s a chance it could align with Bb major's key signature, where Gm is the vi chord. The Eb/G chord is in first inversion, indicating it’s functioning as the IV chord. Tonic seems to be repeated Gm, solidifying G minor as the tonal center. So, we're sticking with G minor (Aeolian), not harmonic minor since there’s no leading tone.**Analyzing chord relationships**

The Bm(b5) chord uses B natural, which is curious since B natural is the major third of G. In G minor, the third should be Bb, so B natural suggests we might be leaning towards G harmonic or melodic minor. B natural relates to a G7 chord but lacks the fifth; combined with bass G, it reconstructs to form a G7 without an explicit fifth. This points to G minor overall, suggesting modal mixture or a raised third. The Bdim/G also introduces a tonal center still rooted in G minor, indicating an Aeolian quality with some borrowed dominant chords.**Summarizing key and mode**

The key is G minor, and the mode is Aeolian, with occasional Mixolydian inflections. In music theory terms, it refers to G natural minor, confirming its signature with two flats. The relevant chords include Gm (tonic), Eb/G (VI6, first inversion), and Bb/F (III6, second inversion). The Bdim/G function creates a tonic dominant feel, indicating I7, and contributes to G minor's overall color. Thus, I'd summarize: G minor (natural minor/Aeolian) with a mix of Mixolydian elements. 

- Tonic: G  
- Key: G minor  
- Mode: Aeolian  
- Evidence: Gm prevalence; Eb (b6); F natural (b7); cadences via bVII to i; occasional G7.

G minor, Aeolian (natural minor).

Why:
- Strong tonic on Gm and final cadence F6 → Gm (bVII → i), typical of Aeolian.
- Presence of Eb (b6) and F natural (b7); no E natural or F# (so not Dorian or harmonic/melodic minor).
- The Bm(b5)/G moment spells G–B–D–F (G7), a brief Mixolydian/borrowed color over the tonic, but the tonal center remains G minor (Aeolian).

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to determine the key and mode of the chord progression: "Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm". The chords include Gm, Eb/G, Bb/F, Bm(b5)/G, and F6. 

It seems likely that this progression is in G natural minor (Aeolian) or perhaps G Dorian. I’ll analyze the notes and relationships: Gm consists of the notes G, Bb, and D, while the Eb/G chord is an E-flat major triad with G in the bass, indicating first inversion.**Determining chord inversions and key**

I’ve established that with G in the bass, the Eb/G chord is indeed in first inversion, meaning we have chord tones of Eb, G, and Bb. This means Eb major is the VI chord in the G minor key. 

In G Aeolian, Eb is flat 6, confirming its presence, while in G Dorian, Eb wouldn’t be present since it uses E natural. Bb/F is a Bb major triad with F in the bass, which confirms it as the VII chord in G minor. So, Bb is the third in G Aeolian.**Analyzing chord functions**

In G Aeolian, the scale degrees are G(1), A(2), Bb(3), C(4), D(5), Eb(6), and F(7). This indicates that the Bb chord is the III major chord, not flat VII, which would be an F major chord. When the Bb chord is over an F bass, it might serve a different function. 

The chord tones of Bm(b5)/G could suggest B half-diminished (B, D, F), which might be more ambiguous. It might function similarly to a G7b9sus4 due to that G bass.**Parsing the chord relationships**

Let’s break this down: When I combine G in the bass with the notes B, D, and F, it creates a G7 chord, which works as a dominant seventh. This includes a B natural, but G minor Aeolian has Bb instead. So, since B, D, and F form a B diminished triad, over G, it indeed gives us a G7 chord. This suggests a Mixolydian moment, where the G7 acts as a secondary dominant—possibly leading toward a C minor tonal center. But since we are in G minor, it might be functioning as a borrowed chord.**Determining key and mode**

If the tune is in G minor Aeolian, introducing B natural creates a conflict with the minor quality because it serves as the major third of G. While the progression mainly uses Gm, the Bm(b5)/G could be viewed as a B half-diminished triad, which can also function as a G7 chord. 

The presence of Bb and Eb suggests the key of G natural minor (Aeolian mode). The Bm(b5)/G introduces B natural as a brief chromatic element, leading to a secondary dominant feel. After examining, I can conclude that the key is G minor and the mode is Aeolian.**Finalizing key and mode**

To keep it concise, I think the user might expect a statement about "G minor (Aeolian)" with the flattened 6th and 7th degrees (Eb and F natural). 

So, I can craft the final answer: "Key: G minor, Mode: Aeolian (natural minor). The chords are i (Gm), VI (Eb), III (Bb), VII (F), with a brief chromatic G7 (Bm(b5)/G)." Let's keep this short and straightforward for clarity!

Key: G minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Evidence: Gm as tonic, with diatonic Eb (VI), Bb (III), and F/F6 (VII). The Bm(b5)/G functions as a chromatic G7 sonority over a G pedal, a brief color outside Aeolian.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I’m analyzing a chord progression involving Eb/G as the IV in first inversion and Bb/F as the I in second inversion. Bm(b5) is outside the diatonic framework for Bb major, but Bdim triad serves as a leading tone to C minor. I notice there's a passing chromatic chord with Bnat that plays as a secondary dominant. The progression seems to suggest it's in Bb major, but with a strong return to Gm, maybe it's centered in G minor. Interesting!**Interpreting chord functions**

I’m looking at the non-diatonic G7 as an applied dominant to iv in G minor, where the iv chord is Cm. So, G7 acts as V/iv. But then it seems to resolve back to Gm instead of C minor, which is interesting because that deviation adds color. Let’s map everything: Gm as i, Eb/G as VI in first inversion, Bb/F as III in second inversion, and then explore Bm(b5)/G leading to G7, fitting nicely in G Dorian. It’s quite a journey!**Clarifying chord roles**

In G natural minor, A is indeed the second degree, and F6 uses A, which fits nicely. F6 might be functioning as Fadd6 or as Dm7/F. Since the notes F, A, C, and D are all diatonic to G natural minor, I see that F6 can be identified as Dm7/F, which is the v7 in first inversion. It’s interesting that while F6 relates to the minor sound, the earlier G7 complicates things with the B natural, which strays from pure Aeolian.**Exploring chord functions**

I’m considering how G7 functions as an applied dominant to iv and adds a chromatic color. If we think about G Dorian, the scale includes G, A, Bb, C, D, E, and F. However, E♭ doesn't belong in Dorian since it features E natural instead. Our progression has E♭, which suggests it’s actually Aeolian. So, I conclude it’s in G minor (Aeolian), with G7 acting as an applied dominant and some inversions like F6 functioning as Dm7/F. It's a layered approach!**Determining key and mode**

I’m examining how F6 maps to Dm7/F, confirming it’s the first inversion of Dm7. This suggests a v7 in first inversion. Alternatively, the entire progression could be in Bb major with G7 acting as V/ii, and F6 as V6. However, based on the frequent appearance of Gm, I'd argue the tonal center remains G, placing it in G minor (Aeolian). There are no leading tones, so harmonic minor isn’t applicable. The best conclusion I can draw is: 

- Tonic: G  
- Mode: natural minor (Aeolian)  
- Function notes include Eb/G = bVI6, Bb/F = bIII64, Bm(b5)/G = G7 (V/iv), and F6 = Dm7/F = v7/6. Overall, G minor is the clear center!

Key: G minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Why:
- Gm is the repeated and final chord (tonic center).
- Eb and Bb chords (bVI and bIII) confirm the natural minor collection (G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F).
- F6 (F–A–C–D) is diatonic to G natural minor and can be heard as Dm7/F (v7 in first inversion), reinforcing Aeolian rather than harmonic minor (no F# appears).
- Bm(b5)/G spells G–B–D–F = G7, functioning as a secondary dominant V/iv (targeting Cm), a brief chromatic color.

Note: You could also hear this as Bb major with heavy emphasis on vi (Gm), but the cadence to and repetition of Gm favors G minor (Aeolian).

G minor (Aeolian mode)

This progression strongly centers on Gm as the tonic (i), with Eb (VI) providing a common subdominant function in minor keys. Bb (III) and F6 (VII) are diatonic to G Aeolian, supporting the minor tonality without a raised leading tone (e.g., no E natural or dominant V chord). The Bm(b5)/G chord introduces chromaticism (B natural is non-diatonic) but functions as a passing or tension chord without altering the overall key center.

**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

The given chord progression is firmly tonal and centers on G minor as the key (with Gm functioning as the clear tonic, both at the start and resolution points). 

The primary mode is **Aeolian** (natural minor), as the majority of the harmony derives from the G Aeolian scale (G A Bb C D Eb F). This fits the repetitive Gm–Eb/G–Gm structure (i–bVI–i) and the Bb/F (III/bVII bass) and F6 (bVII add 4) chords, which are staples of rock/pop minor-key writing.

The Bm(b5)/G chord introduces a brief **harmonic minor** inflection: its notes (G bass + B D F) form a G7 (V7/i), implying the raised leading tone (B natural) from G harmonic minor (G A Bb C D Eb F#) for dominant pull toward the tonic. This is a common mix in minor keys but doesn't shift the overall mode. 

No other key or mode (e.g., Dorian, Phrygian, or Eb major) accounts for the full progression as cleanly, though the bVI (Eb) nod to borrowed major flavors is typical in minor-key contexts. If this is from a specific song, more context could refine the analysis further.

### Reasoning

**Assessing Chord Progressions**

I've begun with a quick initial scan of the provided chord progression. My immediate focus is on identifying the key and any obvious patterns or recurring motifs. I'm noting the overall tonal landscape for the piece.


**Evaluating Chord Functionality**

I'm now investigating each chord's role within the suspected G minor key. Identifying potential modulations or borrowed chords is next. I'm noting the tensions created by non-diatonic chords, and how they resolve. The Eb/G is a tricky one.


**Deciphering Diminished Chords**

I'm now deep-diving into the Bm(b5)/G. The diminished chord is the pivotal point in this progression. Understanding its function is key to unlocking the whole piece. I'm exploring its relationship to both the G minor scale and other potential key centers. I'm considering it as a passing chord and or as a secondary dominant in a quick modulation.


**Exploring Melodic Minor Possibilities**

The Bm(b5)/G continues to fascinate. I'm now exploring the possibility of a brief modulation or borrowing from G harmonic minor, which introduces the F# needed for this chord. It would then resolve to the Gm. I'm also now considering if there is a relationship between Bb/F and Bdim, and why the bass note is G.


**Considering Chromaticism and Voice Leading**

I'm now focusing on the chromaticism present, particularly in the `Bb/F` to `Bm(b5)/G` to `Gm` movement. I see the half-step rise from Bb to B, and how the voice leading guides the resolution. I'm noting how the G bass acts as a pedal point. I've concluded it's an important passing chord.


**Refining Chromatic Analysis**

I'm now fully immersed in the chromaticism. Analyzing the half-step movement from `Bb/F` to `Bm(b5)/G` to `Gm`. The half-step from Bb to B is paramount. I'm focusing on the voice leading. I consider the B diminished triad a chromatic passing chord. The G bass provides stability.


**Decoding Chromatic Resolutions**

I'm now fully immersed in the chromaticism. The half-step from Bb to B creates tension. I'm focusing on the voice leading. The G bass provides stability. I now see the Bdim chord as a chromatic passing chord. The G bass acts as a pedal point.


**Deconstructing Chromatic Movements**

I'm now fully immersed in the chromaticism. The half-step from Bb to B creates tension. I'm focusing on the voice leading. The G bass provides stability. The Bdim chord acts as a chromatic passing chord. The G bass is a pedal point. I see its passing nature.




Based on the chord progression provided, here is the analysis:

### Detailed Analysis

1.  **Tonic Identification:** The progression begins and ends on **Gm**. This chord also appears frequently throughout, establishing it as the tonal center or "home" chord. This is the strongest indicator that the key is **G minor**.

2.  **Chord Functions in G Minor:** Let's look at how each chord functions within the key of G minor. The G natural minor scale is: G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F.

    *   **Gm (G-Bb-D):** This is the **tonic** chord (i).
    *   **Eb/G (Eb-G-Bb):** This is the **submediant** chord (VI) built on the 6th degree of the scale. The `/G` indicates it's in second inversion, which creates a smooth sound by keeping the note G in the bass (a pedal tone).
    *   **Bb/F (Bb-D-F):** This is the **mediant** chord (III) built on the 3rd degree. It's a very common chord in minor key progressions.
    *   **F6 (F-A-C-D):** This is an F major chord with an added 6th (D). F major is the **subtonic** chord (VII) in G natural minor. Using the VII chord instead of the V chord (D major) to lead back to the tonic is a hallmark of the natural minor (Aeolian) mode. This creates a less tense, more "modal" resolution.
    *   **Bm(b5)/G (B-D-F over a G bass):** This is the most unusual chord in the progression. It is a non-diatonic, chromatic chord. Its primary function is to create tension and smooth voice leading. The Bdim triad (B-D-F) sits over a G pedal tone, and the B natural acts as a chromatic passing tone between the Bb of the preceding chord (Bb/F) and the D of the following Gm chord. It's a color chord that briefly steps outside the key for effect before resolving back to the tonic.

3.  **Why Natural Minor/Aeolian?** The key piece of evidence is the absence of the leading tone, F#. The harmonic minor scale would use an F# to create a D major chord (V), which would provide a a strong dominant-to-tonic resolution. Instead, this progression uses an **F major chord (VII)** to resolve to Gm. This **VII - i** cadence is characteristic of the Aeolian mode.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me this chord progression: Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm. They want me to figure out the key and mode. Let me start by understanding what each chord is.

First, I'll break down the chords. Gm is G minor, Eb/G is E-flat major with G as the bass note, so that's a first inversion. Bb/F is B-flat major with F in the bass, another first inversion. Bm(b5)/G is B half-diminished with G in the bass—it's a Bø7 chord. F6 is F major with an added sixth, so A is in there.

Now, looking at the progression, it starts and ends on Gm. That makes me think G is the tonic. The chords repeat a bit: Gm appears a lot, Eb/G shows up, then Bb/F, Bø7/G, and F6. I should spell out all the notes to see the key signature.

G minor has two common forms: natural, harmonic, or melodic. Natural minor has a flat sixth and seventh, harmonic has a raised seventh, melodic has both raised. But chord progressions often mix these. Let me list all the notes from the chords.

Gm: G, Bb, D
Eb/G: G, Eb, G, Bb—so the notes are G, Eb, Bb
Bb/F: F, Bb, D—notes F, Bb, D
Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F? Wait, Bm(b5) is B, D, F, and A for half-diminished seventh? Bm(b5) usually implies B half-diminished, so B, D, F, A. With G bass, so notes G, B, D, F, A? Wait, no—the slash means G is the bass, but the chord is Bm(b5), so the notes of the chord are B, D, F, A, but played over G. So overall notes: G, B, D, F, A.

F6: F, A, C, D

Now, collecting all unique notes: G, Bb, D from Gm; Eb from Eb/G; F from Bb/F; A from Bø7/G and F6; C from F6. So the notes are G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. That's seven notes: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F.

What key has these notes? G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Exactly. So the key is G minor. But let me confirm if there are any accidentals or if it's a mode.

In natural minor, the chords are built on the notes. Let's map the progression to the G natural minor scale degrees.

Gm is i
Eb/G—Eb major is the VI chord in G minor. Eb major: Eb, G, Bb. Yes, so VI in first inversion.

Bb/F—Bb major is IV in G minor. Bb, D, F. So IV in first inversion.

Bm(b5)/G—which is B half-diminished. In G minor, the second degree is A, so chord on B would be... wait, in natural minor, the scale is G A Bb C D Eb F. So the ii chord is A diminished (A, C, Eb). But here we have Bm(b5), which is on B. B is not in the scale? Wait, Bb is in the scale, but B natural is not. Hmm, this is confusing.

Hold on, Bm(b5)/G. The chord is spelled as B, D, F, A? But in G natural minor, the notes don't have B natural; they have Bb. So B natural is a raised leading tone? But in natural minor, the seventh is minor, so F is the seventh, not F#. So B natural would be chromatic.

Wait, maybe it's G harmonic minor? G harmonic minor has G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#. But the progression has F6, which is F, A, C, D—so F natural, not F#. So it can't be harmonic minor.

F6 chord: F, A, C, D. So F natural is present, which is the minor seventh in G natural minor. G natural minor has F natural, G harmonic minor has F#.

So the presence of F natural (in Bb/F, F6) and absence of F# suggests natural minor. But then what about Bm(b5)/G? Bm(b5) implies B, D, F—so B natural, D, F. But in G natural minor, the second scale degree is A, so chord on B isn't diatonic. Unless... wait, maybe it's a borrowed chord or something.

Let me think again. The chord is labeled as Bm(b5)/G. So the root is B, with minor third (D), diminished fifth (F), and probably seventh (A), making it B half-diminished. So notes: B, D, F, A. But in G natural minor, the notes are G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So A is present (6th degree), Bb is present (7th? Wait no: degrees in G natural minor: 1=G, 2=A, 3=Bb, 4=C, 5=D, 6=Eb, 7=F.

So scale: G (1), A (2), Bb (3), C (4), D (5), Eb (6), F (7).

So chord on the second degree: A diminished (ii°): A, C, Eb.

Chord on the seventh degree: F major (VII): F, A, C.

But here we have a chord rooted on B. B natural, not Bb. B natural is not in the G natural minor scale—it would be the major third if it were, but it's a chromatic note.

So B natural is a raised third? In minor keys, sometimes the third is raised for certain chords, but here the chord is Bm(b5), which has B natural as root.

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant or substitution. Let's see the progression: ...Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm...

So after Bb/F (which is IV), it goes to Bm(b5)/G, then to Gm. Bm(b5)/G to Gm—that looks like a iiø7 to i progression, but in minor keys. Wait, in minor, the ii chord is diminished (whole-half scale), so ii° is A°: A, C, Eb. But here it's Bm(b5), which is B, D, F, A—so that's the iiø7 chord but a half-step higher? No.

Wait, Bm(b5)/G: the bass is G, so maybe it's functioning as a dominant? Bm(b5) is E7 without the G#? Not sure.

Another approach: look at the entire progression pattern. The sequence is:

Gm (x2) | Eb/G (x2) | Gm (x2) | Bb/F | Bm(b5)/G | Gm (x2) | Eb/G (x2) | Gm (x2) | F6 | Gm

Notice the Eb/G appears twice in a row, and Gm multiples. The move from Bb/F to Bm(b5)/G to Gm is interesting.

Bb/F is Fsus4? Bb major in first inversion is F in bass, so F, Bb, D. Which is like a suspended chord if resolving, but not sure.

Bm(b5)/G: notes G, B, D, F (assuming no seventh, but likely has A). If we consider it as a iiø7 in A minor, but we're in G minor.

Wait, G minor key: the relative major is Bb major. Chords in Bb: I=Bb, ii=Cm, iii=Dm, IV=Eb, V=F, vi=Gm, vii°=A°.

But our tonic is Gm, so vi in Bb major.

The progression has Gm (vi), Eb (IV in Bb, but VI in G minor), Bb (I in Bb, but IV in G minor), F (V in Bb, but VII in G minor), and then Bm(b5) which is not diatonic.

Bm(b5) in the context of G minor: the notes B, D, F, A—as I said. If we think of this as a secondary chord, maybe it's a iiø7/V or something. But V of G minor would be D major or D7 (harmonic minor), but here it's G minor natural.

Another idea: the Bm(b5)/G might be functioning as a German augmented sixth chord. In G minor, the German +6 would be Ab, C, Eb, F#, which resolves to D or D7. But here it's B, D, F, A—doesn't look like that.

Wait, spelling: Bm(b5) is B, D, F. With the bass G, and likely the A (since it's half-diminished), so notes G, A, B, D, F. Sorting: A, B, D, F, G.

A to B is whole step, B to D is minor third? Not sure. Maybe it's a G13sus4 or something? G, C, D, F, A—but here it's Bm(b5)/G, so root is B.

Perhaps mislabeled? Bm(b5)/G—sometimes slash chords can be misinterpreted. Maybe it's G7b9? G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab. But here it's Bm(b5), which is B, D, F, and with /G bass... unless the Bm(b5) is a typo.

Wait, another angle: the progression seems to have a lot of Gm, Eb, Bb, F. Eb is bVI, Bb is IV, F is bVII in G minor. That's common in blues or rock progressions, like the "minor blues" progression: i - bVI - iv - v or something.

But here we have Eb/G (bVI first inversion), Bb/F (IV first inversion), then Bm(b5)/G.

Wait, Bb/F is the same as Fsus4? F, Bb, D. Fsus4 would be F, Bb, C—no, Bb, D, F is F major? Wait, F major is F, A, C. Bb major is Bb, D, F. So Bb/F is Bb major in first inversion: F, Bb, D. So it's a Bb chord with F in bass.

Similarly, Eb/G is Eb major with G in bass: G, Eb, Bb.

Now, the chord Bm(b5)/G: if it's B half-diminished with G bass, notes G, B, D, F, A.

In the key of G minor, the diatonic seventh chords are:

i: Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)
ii°: Adim7 (A, C, Eb, G)
III: BbMaj7 (Bb, D, F, A)
iv: Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)
v: Dm7 (D, F, A, C) — in natural minor, not Dm7b5 like harmonic
VI: EbMaj7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)
VII: F7 (F, A, C, Eb)

So standard chords in G natural minor.

Now, Bm(b5) is not diatonic. But Bm(b5) as a half-diminished seventh would be B, D, F, A. Which is actually the ii chord in A minor or the vii° in C major. Not fitting.

Wait, what if the Bm(b5) is a mislabeling for Am7b5? That would make sense. Am7b5 is A, C, Eb, G—which is ii°7 in G minor. And if it's written as Bm(b5)/G, maybe it's a typo. Because Bm(b5) with G bass doesn't fit, but Am7b5 with G bass is G, A, C, Eb—which is Am7b5 in third inversion (G as bass, so 7 in bass).

That would make more sense! Because in chord symbols, sometimes the bass note is written separately. So if it's Am7b5/G, it would be A half-diminished with G in the bass, which is standard as the iiø7 chord in minor keys resolving to i.

Given that the progression goes to Gm after Bm(b5)/G, and Am7b5/G to Gm is a common cadence (iiø7 - i), it's very likely that "Bm(b5)/G" is a typo or mislabeling for Am7b5/G.

Assuming that correction:

Original progression: ... Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm ...

Becomes: Bb/F Am7b5/G Gm

Now, Bb/F is IV (Bb major) in first inversion, Am7b5/G is iiø7 in third inversion, resolving to i (Gm). Perfectly standard.

The other chords: Eb/G is VI (Eb major) in first inversion, which is common in minor (e.g., "Andalusian cadence": i - bVII - VI - V, but here it's i - VI - i often).

F6 chord: F6 is F, A, C, D. In G minor, F is the bVII degree. F6 would be bVII6, which adds the sixth (D), making it a common extension.

So with the correction, the chords are all diatonic to G natural minor:

- Gm: i
- Eb/G: VI in first inversion
- Bb/F: IV in first inversion
- Am7b5/G: iiø7 in third inversion (assuming typo)
- F6: bVII6

Now confirming the notes:

G natural minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

- i: Gm7 = G, Bb, D, F
- VI: EbMaj7 = Eb, G, Bb, D → Eb/G uses G, Eb, Bb
- IV: BbMaj7 = Bb, D, F, A → Bb/F uses F, Bb, D
- iiø7: Am7b5 = A, C, Eb, G → Am7b5/G uses G, A, C, Eb
- bVII: F6 = F, A, C, D (F major triad with 6th added)

All these chords use only notes from G natural minor. The F6 chord has D natural, which is in the scale (degree 5), so no issue.

The progression makes sense: it starts with i - VI - i, then moves to IV - iiø7 - i, and later revisits VI and ends on i with bVII6 - i, which is a common minor key ending (like in "House of the Rising Sun").

Without the assumed typo, Bm(b5) would require B natural, which isn't in G natural minor. Since F natural is present (F6), it can't be harmonic minor (which has F#), so the only logical conclusion is a labeling error for Am7b5/G.

Therefore, the key is G minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian).

User might have misread or mistyped "Am(b5)" as "Bm(b5)". Given music often has such errors, especially with slash chords.

Based on the chord progression you provided (**Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm**), I've analyzed the harmony, chord functions, and scale compatibility. **The key is G minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian)**. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Tonic (Home Chord)**
- The progression **starts and ends on Gm** (G minor), with Gm appearing **8 times**—more than any other chord (e.g., Eb/G appears 4 times, and Bb/F/F6 appear once each).
- Cadences like **Bb/F → Bm(b5)/G → Gm** (a common minor-key resolution) and **F6 → Gm** (a classic minor cadence) strongly imply **Gm is the tonic chord**.
- **Conclusion**: G is the tonal center. The key is in **G minor**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Mode (Natural, Harmonic, or Melodic Minor?)**
To find the mode, we need to see which G minor scale fits **all chords without chromatic alteration**. Let's test each:

| Mode          | Scale Degrees (G-based)      | Critical Test Point (F vs. F♯) | Compatible? |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **Natural Minor (Aeolian)** | G A B♭ C D E♭ F              | F natural                      | ✅ Yes       |
| Harmonic Minor | G A B♭ C D E♭ F**♯**         | F**♯** (but F6 chord has F natural) | ❌ No        |
| Melodic Minor  | G A B♭ C D E♮ F♯ (ascending) | F**♯** (mismatch with F6)      | ❌ No        |

**Why natural minor?**
- **F natural** is used in:
  - **Bb/F** (B♭ major with F in bass: F-B♭-D),
  - **F6** (F-A-C-D, a major triad with added 6th),
  - The **implied root of Gm** (G-B♭-D, which has no F♯).
- Natural minor is the **only minor mode with F natural** (harmonic/melodic minor use F♯).
- **No accidentals** (like F♯ or B♮) appear elsewhere, ruling out harmonic/melodic minor.

---

### **Step 3: Decode Chord Functions in G Natural Minor**
In **G natural minor (Aeolian)**, the scale degrees are:  
`G (1) - A (2) - B♭ (3) - C (4) - D (5) - E♭ (6) - F (7)`.  

All chords fit diatonically (no notes outside the scale):
- **Gm** (i): Tonic chord. Notes: G-B♭-D.
- **Eb/G** (♭VI): Submediant chord in 1st inversion (G-E♭-B♭). Common in minor keys (e.g., "minor blues" progressions).
- **Bb/F** (IV): Subdominant chord in 1st inversion (F-B♭-D). A strong dominant function toward iiø7 → i.
- **Bm(b5)/G**: **This is likely a typo/mislabeling for Am7b5/G (iiø7)**.
  - Actual notation: `Bm(b5)/G` implies a B-root half-diminished chord (B-D-F-A) over G bass. **But B natural is not in G natural minor** (it has B♭).
  - **Correction**: `Am7b5/G` (A-C-E♭-G in 3rd inversion: G-A-C-E♭) **makes perfect sense**:
    - This is diatonic **iiø7** (half-diminished ii chord), a standard pre-tonic chord resolving to **i** (Gm).
    - Given the context (`Bb/F → [ ] → Gm`), `Am7b5/G` is the expected chord (common in minor cadences).
    - *Likely cause*: Miscounting from B♭ (e.g., labeling "Am" as "Bm" due to scale proximity).
- **F6** (♭VII6): Subtonic chord with added 6th (F-A-C-D). Common in folk/rock minor progressions (e.g., classic ending: ♭VII → i).

---

### **Step 4: Why This Progression Confirms G Natural Minor**
- **Harmonic Flow**:
  - `Gm → Eb/G → Gm`: i → ♭VI → i (emphasizes minor tonality; ♭VI is major only in natural minor).
  - `Bb/F → Am7b5/G → Gm`: IV → iiø7 → i (standard minor-key cadence).
  - Ends with `F6 → Gm`: ♭VII → i (iconic natural minor cadence, e.g., "House of the Rising Sun").
- **No Chromaticism**: All notes (G-A-B♭-C-D-E♭-F) are from **G natural minor**. No F♯ (harmonic minor) or E♮ (melodic minor) appears.
- **Mode Signature**: Natural minor is defined by:
  - Flat 3rd (B♭), flat 6th (E♭), **and flat 7th (F)**—all present.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
- **Key**: G minor  
- **Mode**: **Natural minor (Aeolian)**  
- **Why not harmonic/melodic?** F natural (in Bb/F and F6) contradicts harmonic/melodic minor's raised 7th (F♯).  
- **Critical Fix**: `Bm(b5)/G` is almost certainly a typo for **Am7b5/G** (the diatonic iiø7 chord). Without this correction, the progression would imply non-diatonic harmony (B natural), but **context confirms G natural minor**.

This is a textbook natural minor progression—common in rock, blues, and classical minor-key pieces (e.g., Pachelbel's "Musette in Gm"). If you encountered this in a song, it would sound introspective and unresolved (characteristic of Aeolian). 🎹

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – Bb/F – B°5/G (Bm(b5)/G) – Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – F6 – Gm

We can simplify and annotate the progression:

1. Gm
2. Gm
3. Eb/G
4. Eb/G
5. Gm
6. Gm
7. Bb/F
8. B°5/G (this means B diminished with G in the bass — B, D, F over G)
9. Gm
10. Gm
11. Eb/G
12. Eb/G
13. Gm
14. Gm
15. F6
16. Gm

---

### Step 1: Identify the Chords in Context

Let’s write out the notes in each chord to detect a consistent key.

- **Gm** = G, Bb, D
- **Eb/G** = Eb, G, Bb → This is an **Eb major chord** with G in the bass. So essentially **I in G minor**
- **Bb/F** = Bb, D, F → **Bb major** with F in the bass (6th)
- **B°5/G** = B, D, F over G → This is **B diminished**, which is **vii° of C minor** or **ii° of A minor**, but in context of G, this is **vii°7 of C**, but let's examine carefully.
  - Chord: B–D–F → B diminished (B°)
  - With G in the bass → G, B, D, F — this is **G7** without the 7th? Wait:
    - G, B, D, F = **G7**, the **dominant 7th chord** in C
    - But here it's spelled B, D, F, G → same notes → **G7**!
    - So **B°5/G** = G7 as a **second inversion**? Not quite — G7 would normally be G–B–D–F. This is **B–D–F–G**, which is **G7 in third inversion (G7/F#?)** — wait, no: G7 in 3rd inversion is G7 with F as bass → **G7/F**, not /G.

Wait: B°(G) — B–D–F + G in bass = G, B, D, F → **G7**, yes.

But B° is B–D–F — that's correct. So **Bdim over G** = G–B–D–F = **G7**, the **dominant 7th of C**.

So this chord is functionally **G7**, even though it's labeled as Bdim/G — this is a common way to voice G7 as a B diminished chord over G.

So: **B°5/G = G7**

Then the next chord:
- **F6** = F, A, C, D (F major with 6th)

Now the progression ends on Gm, so Gm feels like the tonic.

Let’s reframe with functional analysis.

---

### Step 2: Look for Tonic

The chord Gm appears at the beginning, middle, and end — it’s repeated and emphasized. It’s very likely the **tonic chord**.

So likely key: **G minor**

Let’s analyze each chord in **G minor**:

- **Gm** = i
- **Eb/G** = **VI** chord of G minor, with G in bass → VI in first inversion → very common in minor keys
- **Bb/F** = **III** chord (Bb) of G minor, with F in bass → 3rd inversion? Bb major: Bb, D, F → so F is 5th → **Bb/F = III in 2nd inversion**
- **B°5/G** = G, B, D, F → G7 → which is **V7 of C**, but C is the **IV** in G minor.

Wait — G7 is not native to G minor. In **G natural minor**, the diatonic chords are:

- i: Gm
- ii°: Am°
- III: Bb
- iv: Cm
- v: Dm
- VI: Eb
- VII: F

So **G7 (G–B–D–F)** contains a **B natural**, which is not in G natural minor (which has Bb). The **B natural** comes from the **harmonic minor** scale.

In **G harmonic minor**, we raise the 7th → F# instead of F. But here, we have **F natural** in Eb, Bb, F6.

Wait — contradiction.

- **F natural** appears in:
  - Eb/G = G, Eb, G, Bb → has Eb and Bb → F is not in chord
  - Bb/F = F, Bb, D → F natural
  - B°/G = G, B, D, F → F **natural**
  - F6 = F, A, C, D → A and F natural

So F natural is used consistently — **not F#**.

But B°/G requires a **B natural**, not Bb.

So if we have B natural and F natural, we're not in G natural minor (has Bb and F), nor in G harmonic minor (has F# and B), nor melodic minor (ascending: B and F#).

So how do we get **B natural** and **F natural**?

That implies **chromaticism** or a **secondary dominant**.

Let’s reconsider:

**B°5/G** = G, B, D, F → G7

G7 is **V7 of C**

So this is a **secondary dominant** leading to C.

But what chord follows it? Gm — not C.

Wait:

Sequence:
...Bb/F → B°5/G → Gm

So Bb → G7 → Gm

That’s **III → V7/V → i**? Not quite.

Let’s look:

We have F6 before the final Gm.

So:

Gm – Gm – F6 – Gm

F6 = F, A, C, D

That’s **F–A–C–D** = F6, which is **IV6 in C major**, or **bVII6 in G minor**?

In G minor:
- F is **bVII**
- F6 is a **chromatic chord** (since A is not in G natural minor: G minor has Ab, not A)

Ah! **A natural** — that’s not in G natural minor (Ab), not in harmonic minor (Ab), not in melodic minor (A natural ascending).

G melodic minor ascending: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#

So A natural is present **only in melodic minor ascending**.

But we have **A natural** (in F6), **B natural** (in B°), F natural (in Bb, F6), Eb (in Eb/G), D (in many chords), etc.

So possible notes used:
- G, A, Bb, B, C, D, Eb, (E?), F

Wait — E? Not evident.

But we have:
- G: yes
- A: in F6 → A natural
- Bb: in Gm, Eb
- B: in G7 (from B°)
- C: in F6
- D: in Gm, F6
- Eb: in Eb chord
- F: in Bb, G7, F6

So we have both Bb and B, Ab? No A or Ab — only A in F6 is **A natural**.

So **A natural**, not Ab → so **not in standard G natural minor**, which has Ab.

This suggests the use of **non-diatonic** or **chromatic** harmonies.

Alternatively, could the key be **C major**?

Let’s test that.

Key of C major: C, D, E, F, G, A, B

Chords in C major:
- C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, B°

Now let’s see:

- Gm → not in key (G is major in C major)
- Eb/G → Eb is not in C major
- Bb/F → Bb not in key
- F6 → F major with 6th (D) — F is IV, F6 is common in pop

But Gm is not diatonic to C major → would be ii, but it should be **G major** in C.

So no.

How about **G Dorian** mode?

G Dorian: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F → so notes: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F

But we have **B natural**, not Bb — B natural is used in B° chord.

So can’t be Dorian.

Wait — unless we allow chromatic passing chords.

Perhaps the key is **G minor**, and we have **chromatic chords** for color and voice leading.

Let’s see the overall movement:

- Gm – Eb/G – Gm – Bb/F – G7 (B°/G) – Gm – Eb/G – Gm – F6 – Gm

This feels like a loop.

Now, **F6** = F, A, C, D

That’s the **bVII6 chord** in G minor, but with a **C and A**, the A is chromatic.

F6 in G minor is a common borrowed chord? Not typically.

Alternatively, **F6** is the **IV6 in C major**, so maybe temporary modulation to C?

But ends on Gm.

Another idea: **F6** could be a **German augmented sixth** chord? No — German 6th is Ab–C–Eb–F# — not the case.

Wait — perhaps **F6 = Dm7** in first inversion?

Dm7 = D, F, A, C → same notes as F6 (F, A, C, D) → **F6 = Dm7 in 3rd inversion (Dm7/C?) no — Dm7 with F in bass = Dm7/F**

F6 and Dm7 are **enharmonic** — same notes → **they are the same chord**.

F6 = F–A–C–D  
Dm7 = D–F–A–C — same pitches.

So **F6 ≡ Dm7**.

Now, Dm7 is the **v7 chord** in G minor.

In G minor:
- v = Dm
- v7 = Dm7 → D–F–A–C

Yes! So Dm7 is diatonic to **G natural minor**.

And if we spell F6 as Dm7/F (D–F–A–C with F in bass), it’s **Dm7 in second inversion**.

So what was labeled **F6** is actually **Dm7/F** — a common way to write it as F6.

So the chord is **Dm7**, the **v7** of G minor.

Perfect! Now the chord progression makes sense.

So rewrite with correct interpretation:

- Gm → i
- Eb/G → VI (first inversion) → very common in minor
- Bb/F → III (second inversion) → common
- B°/G = G7 → this is **V7 of C**, not diatonic
- Dm7/F (F6) → v7 → diatonic

But G7 (B°/G) is not leading to C — it goes to Gm

Wait — unless it’s a **deceptive cadence** or something else.

Sequence: ... Bb/F → G7 → Gm

G7 → Gm is not functional. G7 wants to go to C.

But it goes to Gm.

Alternatively, is G7 acting as a **vii° of Gm**?

Wait — **F#°** would be the leading tone chord of Gm.

But this is **B°(G)** = B–D–F–G → which is **G7**.

Another idea: **G7** is being used as a **chromatic passing chord** between Bb and Gm.

Voice leading:
- Bb/F: F, Bb, D
- G7: G, B, D, F
- Then Gm: G, Bb, D

Notice:
- Bb (in Bb/F) → B (in G7) → Bb (in Gm) → ascending chromatic
- F stays
- D stays
- G enters

So it's a **chromatic mediant** or passing function — **B natural** is a chromatic passing tone.

Similarly, later we have F6 (Dm7) before final Gm.

So let’s list progression with roman numerals in **G minor**:

1. Gm (i)  
2. Gm (i)  
3. Eb/G (VI, 1st inv)  
4. Eb/G (VI, 1st inv)  
5. Gm (i)  
6. Gm (i)  
7. Bb/F (III, 2nd inv)  
8. G7/B (V7/IV) or chromatic — B°/G = G7, but not resolving to C)  
9. Gm (i)  
10. Gm (i)  
11. Eb/G (VI)  
12. Eb/G (VI)  
13. Gm (i)  
14. Gm (i)  
15. F6 = Dm7/F = v7, 2nd inv  
16. Gm (i)

Now, chord 8: G7 — could be interpreted as **vii°7 of C**, but since it doesn’t resolve to C, maybe it's just a color chord or passing.

But in context, it’s used for **voice leading effect** — chromatic ascent from Bb to B to Bb.

Similarly, the **A natural** in Dm7 is part of the **natural minor** scale (G natural minor has A, since it's G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F–G).

Wait! Yes! **G natural minor = G Aeolian**: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

So A natural **is** in G natural minor.

So Dm7 (F6) is fully diatonic: v7

Eb is also in the scale.

Only **B natural** in G7 is **extraneous** — it's a chromatic passing note.

So the **only chromatic chord is G7 (B°/G)**, used for melodic interest.

Therefore, the **tonic is Gm**, and the key is **G minor**, specifically **G natural minor (Aeolian mode)**, with one chromatic chord (G7) used as a passing device.

But is G minor the key, or is it a mode?

G natural minor = G Aeolian

So the **mode** is **Aeolian**.

But let’s confirm if the harmony is consistent with natural minor.

Yes — i, VI, III, v7 are all in natural minor.

G7 is a borrowed or chromatic chord for color.

Final chord is Gm — strong tonic.

So conclusion:

---

### ✅ Key: **G minor**
### ✅ Mode: **Aeolian**

With one chromatic passing chord (G7, notated as B°/G), and F6 = Dm7 (v7), fully diatonic.

---

**Answer:**
**Key: G minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by analyzing this step by step.

First, I need to list out all the chords and see what notes they contain. The chords are: Gm, Eb/G, Bb/F, Bm(b5)/G, F6. Let me write down each chord's notes.

Starting with Gm: G, Bb, D. That's straightforward.

Eb/G: This is an E-flat minor chord with G in the bass. So the notes are Eb, Gb, Bb, but since it's Eb/G, the bass note is G. So the chord is technically G, Eb, Gb, Bb? Wait, no. Eb minor chord is Eb, Gb, Bb. When written as Eb/G, it means the root is Eb, but the bass note is G. So the notes are G, Eb, Gb, Bb. But G and Gb? That doesn't sound right. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the notation. Sometimes in slash chords, the first part is the chord, and the second is the bass note. So Eb/G would be an Eb minor chord with G in the bass. So the chord notes are Eb, Gb, Bb, and the bass is G. But G is not in the Eb minor chord. Eb minor has Eb, Gb, Bb. G is the major third of Eb? Wait no. Eb minor: root Eb, minor third is Gb (since Eb to Gb is a minor third), perfect fifth Bb. So the chord is Eb, Gb, Bb. But if it's Eb/G, that's implying the bass note is G, so the chord would be G, Eb, Gb, Bb? But G and Gb? That seems odd because G and Gb are enharmonic? No, Gb is F#? Wait, no. Gb is the same as F#. But in terms of spelling, Eb minor chord is Eb, Gb, Bb. So if you put G in the bass, the notes are G, Bb, Eb, Gb? But Gb and G are adjacent, which might be dissonant. Maybe it's a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the slash chord notation here is for a different chord. Wait, sometimes people might write Eb/G to mean a G bass with Eb chord, but that's just the same as Eb minor with G bass. Alternatively, maybe it's a misnotation. Let me check the notes again.

Wait, for Eb/G: the chord is Eb minor, but the bass note is G. So the notes are G (bass), Eb, Gb, Bb? But G and Gb are a minor second apart, which is very dissonant. That seems odd. Maybe it's supposed to be E natural? Wait, but the user wrote "Eb/G". Let's spell it out. E flat, so Eb. G in bass. So the chord is Eb minor triad (Eb, Gb, Bb) but with G bass. So the notes are G, Eb, Gb, Bb. But G and Gb? That's G and G flat, which is a very close interval. But maybe the slash chord here is indicating a different chord. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps in some contexts it's written as Eb/G meaning the chord is Eb, but the bass is G. However, technically, Eb minor chord doesn't contain G. So when voiced with G in the bass, it's an inversion. Let me check the intervals. If Eb minor chord is Eb (root), Gb (minor third), Bb (perfect fifth). So if the bass is G, then the chord would be G in the bass, then Eb, Gb, Bb. But G is a major second above Gb? Wait, Gb is F#. So G is a minor second above Gb? Wait, Gb is F#; so G is a half step above F#. So yes, G and Gb (F#) is a minor second interval. That's a very dissonant interval. But maybe in practice, people might just voice it as Eb minor in first inversion where Gb is in the bass? Wait, no. First inversion of Eb minor would have Gb in the bass. But Eb minor: root Eb, first inversion would have Gb as bass, then Bb, Eb. So Eb minor first inversion is Gb/Eb? No, no. The chord's inversion depends on the bass note. For Eb minor triad: root position is Eb, Gb, Bb. First inversion is Gb in bass, then Bb, Eb. Second inversion is Bb in bass, then Eb, Gb. If the bass is G, which is not part of the triad, so it would be a different chord. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the user made a typo. Let me check other chords.

Wait, maybe the slash chord is for a different chord. Let's take Bm(b5)/G. B minor flat fifth. So B minor chord is B, D, F#. But b5 means the fifth is flattened, so B, D, F. So B diminished chord? Because minor flat fifth is diminished. But Bdim is B, D, F. Then Bm(b5)/G would be a diminished chord with G in bass. So notes G, B, D, F. Which is a G7 chord? Because G7 is G, B, D, F. So Bm(b5)/G is actually a G7 chord. Because B diminished triad is B, D, F, and with G in bass, it becomes G, B, D, F which is G7. So that's important. So maybe the slash chords here are indicating inversions or different chords.

Let's redo all chords with their note names.

Gm: G, Bb, D.

Eb/G: If it's Eb minor with G bass. But Eb minor is Eb, Gb, Bb. So notes G, Eb, Gb, Bb. But G and Gb: so G and F# (since Gb is F#). So G, F#, Eb, Bb. Wait, but G and F# is a minor second. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe Eb/G is actually a G minor chord with Eb in bass? No, the slash is usually chord over bass note. So chord: Eb minor, bass: G. But perhaps the chord isn't actually Eb minor. Maybe someone misnotated. Let's see. Alternatively, Eb/G could be a Eb major chord with G bass. But Eb major would be Eb, G, Bb. So if Eb major chord with G bass: the chord notes are G (bass), Eb, G, Bb. But then G is in the root, Eb, and Bb. So that would be G minor chord? Wait, G minor is G, Bb, D. So Eb major chord in root position is Eb, G, Bb. If you have G in the bass, then it's an Eb major slash chord. So notes G, Eb, G, Bb. Which is essentially G, Eb, Bb. But the G is doubled. So that's an Eb major triad with G in the bass. But that would be the same as G minor? Wait, no. Because Eb major chord: E, G, Bb? No, Eb is E flat. Eb major: Eb, G, Bb. Yes. Because Eb to G is a major third (Eb to Bb is perfect fifth, Eb to G is major third? Wait, Eb to G: E to G is major third, so Eb to G is also major third. Yes. So Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So if it's Eb/G, that means bass is G, so the notes are G (bass), Eb, G, Bb. So G, Eb, Bb. Which is a G minor chord without the D? Because G minor is G, Bb, D. So Eb/G here is actually missing the D. But G minor is G, Bb, D. If you have G, Eb, Bb, that's not G minor. Because G minor has D, but here it's Eb instead of D. Wait, Eb and D are different. So Eb here would be a minor sixth above G? G to Eb is minor sixth. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe looking at the chords in context. Let's list all the chords again with their notes.

1. Gm: G, Bb, D

2. Gm: same

3. Eb/G: Let's assume it's Eb major chord with G bass. So notes G, Eb, Bb. But Eb to G is major third, so yes. So triad Eb, G, Bb. In root position. If bass is G, then it's G, Eb, Bb. So the notes here are G, Eb, Bb. Which are the notes of a G minor 7th chord? Wait, G minor 7th is G, Bb, D, F. But here we don't have F or D. We have G, Eb, Bb. So that's a G minor chord missing the fifth (D), but adding Eb which is a minor sixth above G. Alternatively, it's an Eb major triad in first inversion? No, first inversion of Eb major is G, Bb, Eb. So that's exactly it. So Eb major in first inversion: G in bass, then Bb, Eb. Wait, but Eb major chord is Eb (root), G (major third), Bb (perfect fifth). So first inversion: G as bass, then Bb, Eb. So yes, the chord would have notes G, Bb, Eb. So actually Eb major triad in first inversion. So maybe Eb/G here refers to an Eb major chord with G bass. But in standard notation, yes, Eb/G would mean Eb chord with G in the bass. So Eb major chord (Eb, G, Bb) with G in bass. So notes G, Bb, Eb. So the actual notes are G, Bb, Eb. Which is a G minor 6th chord? No, G minor 6th would be G, Bb, D, E. But here it's G, Bb, Eb. So G, Bb, Eb. Eb is the minor sixth of G. So G minor 6th chord is G, Bb, D, E. No, minor sixth chord usually has a sixth instead of a fifth. Wait, G minor sixth: G, Bb, D, E. Yes. But here, we have Eb, which is the same as D#? Wait no, Eb is E-flat. So from G: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb. So Eb is a minor sixth above G. So G, Bb, Eb would be G minor with a flat sixth? But a minor sixth chord typically has the sixth (E natural in G minor). Wait, in G natural minor scale, the sixth is E. So Eb would be a flat sixth. So if it's a G minor chord with Eb, that's G minor with a ♭6. But usually, a minor sixth chord has a natural sixth. Hmm. Alternatively, Eb/G could be considered as a Bb minor chord? Let's see. If notes G, Eb, Bb. Then root could be Bb. Bb, G, Eb – Bb minor chord is Bb, Db, F. Not matching. Or Eb major chord. Yes, as Eb major with G bass, it's just an inversion.

So maybe better to think of all these chords in the context of a key. Let's list all the chords and their notes.

Gm: G, Bb, D

Eb/G: Assuming Eb major triad with G bass: notes G (bass), E-flat, Bb. Wait, no, Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So with G bass, the notes are G (bass), Eb, Bb. Yes. So that's G, Eb, Bb.

But Eb and Bb: Bb is the fifth of Eb, and Eb is the root. So this is just an inversion.

Next chord: Gm again: G, Bb, D

Then Gm again.

Bb/F: So Bb chord with F in bass. Bb major chord is Bb, D, F. So with F in bass, it's Bb, D, F. So it's F, Bb, D. Which is essentially an F major chord? Because F major is F, A, C. Wait no. Bb/F: Bb major triad with F bass. So notes F (bass), Bb, D. So F, Bb, D. F and Bb are perfect fourth, F to D is minor sixth? Wait, F major chord is F, A, C. So F, Bb, D is actually a different chord. Bb/D would be Bb chord with D bass, but Bb/F is Bb chord with F bass. The chord Bb/F contains F, Bb, D. What chord is that? If we look at root: F, Bb, D. The notes F, Bb, D. That's equivalent to a D minor chord? D minor is D, F, A. Not quite. Or it's a Bb7 chord without the third? No. Wait, F, Bb, D – F is root, Bb is perfect fourth, D is major sixth. So F6? But F6 would be F, A, C, D. No. Alternatively, this is a Bb sus4 chord over F? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Bb chord with F in bass, but the triad is Bb, D, F. So notes F, Bb, D. The intervals: F to Bb is perfect fourth, Bb to D is major third, D to F is minor third. Wait, perhaps better to think of the chord as an F minor chord? F minor would be F, Ab, C. Not matching. Alternatively, it's a D half-diminished chord? D, F, Ab. No, because D to F is minor third, F to Bb? No, in F, Bb, D: D to F is minor third. Wait, F to D is major sixth, but the chord is F, Bb, D. Let's see: F major chord is F, A, C. Here we have F, Bb, D. Maybe it's a Bb chord with F as the fifth? No. Alternatively, the chord is F7sus4? Not sure. Maybe better to check the context. Maybe this chord is part of a common chord progression.

Next: Bm(b5)/G. B minor flat fifth. As I thought earlier, B minor is B, D, F#; with flat fifth, it's B, D, F. So diminished triad Bdim: B, D, F. Then slash G, so chord is Bdim with G bass. So notes G, B, D, F. Which is a G7 chord. Because G7 is root G, B, D, F. Perfect.

Then Gm: G, Bb, D again.

Then Eb/G again: same as before.

Then Gm: G, Bb, D.

Then F6. F6 chord: typically F, A, C, D. So F major triad with added sixth (D). So the notes are F, A, C, D.

So summarizing all the chords in the progression:

- Gm: G, Bb, D

- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (from Eb major chord in first inversion)

- Bb/F: F, Bb, D (from Bb major chord with F bass)

- Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F (which is G7)

- F6: F, A, C, D

Wait, but F6 has A and C, but F6 usually includes A and C. So the chord is F major with sixth (D), so F, A, C, D.

Now, let's see what scale these chords belong to. Let's list all the notes present in the entire chord progression.

Looking at the chord notes:

From Gm: G, Bb, D

From Eb/G (Eb major in first inversion): G, Eb, Bb

From Bb/F: F, Bb, D

From Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F

From F6: F, A, C, D

So all the notes across the progression: G, Bb, D, Eb, F, B, A, C.

So notes present: A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. So all eight notes except maybe... Let's list them:

A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. So missing E natural? Wait, the notes here include A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. So that's all chromatic except maybe... Well, there's A, B, Bb (so A and Bb), C, D, Eb, F, G. So the chord progression uses both B and Bb, which is a lot of chromatic notes. But let's see if there's a particular key this fits into.

Alternatively, perhaps it's in a minor key. Let's see. If we look at common minor keys. Let's check G minor.

G natural minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the notes in the progression. Let's see: G natural minor has notes G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Yes! Let's check the chords:

- Gm: G, Bb, D – yes, that fits G natural minor.

- Eb/G: Eb major chord in first inversion (G, Eb, Bb). Eb is a note in the scale, yes. Eb major chord in natural minor? Wait, in G natural minor scale, the diatonic chords are:

i: Gm

ii°: A° (but usually written as A half-diminished in minor scales)

III: Bb Maj

iv: Cm

v: Dm

VI: Eb Maj

VII: F Maj

Wait, yes. So in G natural minor, the chords:

i = Gm, ii° = A°, III = Bb, iv = Cm, v = Dm, VI = Eb, VII = F.

So Eb major and F major are both present. So Eb/G would be Eb major chord with G bass. Which fits as VI chord. Similarly, F6 would be VII chord with added sixth. And F6: F, A, C, D. In the natural minor scale of G minor, the seventh chord is F major (F, A, C), and adding D would be the sixth note (D is the 6th degree of the scale, which in G minor is D). Wait, in G minor scale, the notes are G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So D is the fifth degree. Wait, no. Let's list the scale degrees:

1. G

2. A

b3. Bb

4. C

5. D

b6. Eb

b7. F

So yes, D is the 5th. So F major chord is the VII chord, which is F, A, C. Then adding a sixth... but in the scale, the sixth is Eb. So F6 chord would typically have F, A, C, D? But D is the fifth degree. So F6 would be F major with added sixth (which would be D). But in the key of G minor, F major is VII, and its sixth would be D, which is present. So yes.

But wait, the chord Bm(b5)/G is G7 chord. Let's check if G7 is in G natural minor. The natural minor scale has a minor 7th scale degree. The VII chord in G natural minor is F major. The V chord is D minor. G7 is a dominant seventh chord, which is not diatonic to natural minor scale. G7 has F natural, but in G minor, the seventh degree is F natural. Wait, G minor (natural) has F natural (b7). So G7 chord is G, Bb, D, F. Which is exactly the notes for the G minor 7th chord? Yes, Gm7 would be G, Bb, D, F. But here's the thing: in the chord progression, Bm(b5)/G is G7 because Bdim triad (B, D, F) with G bass becomes G, B, D, F. But wait, B in Bdim chord – in G natural minor scale, what is B? In G natural minor scale, the 3rd is Bb. So B natural is not in the natural minor scale. G natural minor has Bb, so B natural is outside. Wait, so B natural would be a chromatic note.

Wait, this is a conflict. If G natural minor scale has Bb, then B natural would be a chromatic alteration. So when the chord includes B natural (as in the G7 chord: G, B, D, F), but in G natural minor scale, there's no B natural; the third is Bb.

So G7 chord (with B natural) would be a dominant seventh, which typically belongs to the harmonic or melodic minor.

So let's think. If there's a B natural, then maybe it's in the harmonic minor scale.

G harmonic minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#, G.

Wait, F# instead of F natural. But in our chord progression, the chord F6 has F natural, not F#. Also, G7 chord has F natural as the minor seventh. Because G7 chord is G, B, D, F – F natural. So if the scale has F natural, but the harmonic minor has F#. So if the chord progression has F natural and B natural (in G7), then perhaps it's not strictly harmonic minor.

But wait, in the G7 chord we have B natural, which is the major third of G7, so for a dominant seventh chord, B is necessary. So if the key is G minor, having a dominant seventh chord on G would suggest a harmonic minor or melodic minor scale. Because in natural minor, the V chord is minor (D minor), but to get a dominant V chord, you'd use harmonic minor, which raises the seventh note, making the VII chord become a major chord. Wait, in harmonic minor: the raised seventh.

G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#.

So in harmonic minor, the V chord would be D major (D, F#, A), and the leading tone is F#. So if there is a G7 chord in this progression, G7 would be part of a cadence. Wait, G7 would be the minor seventh chord, which in natural minor is fine, but in harmonic minor, G minor seventh would still be G, Bb, D, F, but wait, harmonic minor has F# not F. So if we have F natural, then it's not harmonic minor; F natural means it could be natural or melodic.

Wait, but G7 has a minor seventh (F natural), so that's actually Gm7. Wait, no. G7 is the dominant seventh, which requires a minor seventh (F natural) above root G. G to F is minor seventh. So yes, G7 chord is G-B-D-F. So in the key of G minor, if you have a G7 chord, that's not typical because usually in the key of G minor, the i chord is G minor 7, not a dominant 7. Dominant 7 chords are usually on the V chord. But here, the G7 is actually the i chord, but dominant seventh? That doesn't make sense. If the tonic is G minor, the tonic chord is G minor, possibly Gm7 (which has F natural). Wait, Gm7 is G-Bb-D-F. But here, the chord Bm(b5)/G is G7, but with B natural. So B natural instead of Bb. Which means G7 would be G-B-D-F, which is a dominant seventh chord. But for a G chord to be dominant seventh, it would typically be used as a V chord in dominant to tonic resolution. But if it's on G, that would be the tonic being a dominant chord, which is less common but possible. Alternatively, maybe the tonic chord is minor, but the progression is using a major seventh or something. This is confusing.

Let's recap the chords:

- Gm (G, Bb, D)

- Eb/G (G, Eb, Bb) — which is Eb major triad in first inversion.

- Bb/F: F, Bb, D — Bb major triad with F bass. Bb major is III chord in G minor.

- Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F (G7)

- F6: F, A, C, D — F major chord with added sixth. In G minor, F major is the VII chord.

Wait, but if we have a G7 chord here (with B natural), that B natural isn't in the G natural minor scale. So that suggests maybe we're not in natural minor. Let's see what other scale could include B natural and F natural and so on.

Alternatively, maybe we're in E minor? Wait, but the chords start with Gm. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different key. Let's see.

Another approach: list all the notes used in the chords:

From all chords:

- Gm: G, Bb, D

- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb

- Bb/F: F, Bb, D

- Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F

- F6: F, A, C, D

So all notes present: A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G.

So the notes are: A, Bb, B, C, D, Eb, F, G. Missing E natural and... Wait, E natural isn't present here. So we have A, Bb, B, C, D, Eb, F, G. So all notes except E natural. So it's like G minor with some chromaticism? But B natural and A natural. But G minor typically has A natural, yes. But B natural isn't in G minor; G minor has Bb.

Wait, natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So A is present, Bb, but B natural is not. So to have B natural, the scale would need to have raised the third. So maybe it's G melodic minor ascending? G melodic minor ascending: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. But here we have Eb, not E. So that doesn't match. Or descending is natural minor.

Alternatively, maybe it's in the key of E minor? E minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Chords include Em, F#dim, Gmaj, Am, Bm, Cmaj, Dmaj. But our chords include Gm, which isn't in E minor. So probably no.

Wait, F6 chord: F major with added sixth. So F, A, C, D. Also in the progression we have Eb. If we consider the key of F major: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. But then G minor chord? G minor isn't in F major. F major has G major. Not matching. F minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. But then we have B natural, which isn't in F minor.

Another idea: let's see the bass notes. The progression starts with Gm (bass G), then Gm, then Eb/G (bass G), then Eb/G, then Gm, Gm, then Bb/F (bass F), then Bm(b5)/G (bass G), Gm, Gm, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gm, Gm, F6 (bass F?), then Gm.

The bass notes: G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G. So mostly G bass with some F bass. So perhaps the tonic is G, given that the bass is frequently G, and the song starts and ends with Gm.

Let's consider G minor as the possible key. Now, the presence of Eb major chord (which is VI chord in G minor), F major (VII), Bb major (III), which all exist in G natural minor. But the Bm(b5)/G chord is G7 – G7 has B natural, which isn't in G natural minor. So that's the issue. In G natural minor, the G minor triad is G, Bb, D. If it's G7, it would be G, Bb, D, F – which is Gm7. But the chord Bm(b5)/G has B natural instead of Bb. So B natural in the chord.

So G7 has B natural. So how does that fit? In G minor, having a major third on the G chord is a bit of a thing. For example, in a minor key, sometimes the V chord is dominant to resolve to the tonic. But here, if the G chord is a dominant seventh, that would be strange because the tonic is minor. Wait, perhaps the G chord is not the tonic. Wait, but it's Gm at the beginning and end.

Wait, let's look at the chord progression again. After the F6 Gm, so F6 to Gm. In the key of G minor, F major (VII) to G minor (i) would be a common cadence, using the VII-i resolution. But in G minor, F major chord is diatonic. If F6 is F major with added sixth (D), which is still part of the mode.

But the G7 chord: Bm(b5)/G is written as Bm(b5)/G, which we determined is G7. So G7 chord. Now, if the key is G minor, then using a G7 chord would be unusual. But perhaps it's a modulation, or the music is using the blues scale or something. Alternatively, maybe it's in G Dorian mode.

Wait, the Dorian mode: G Dorian would be G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Let's see. G Dorian has a major sixth (E natural) and minor seventh (F). So scale notes: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Now, in this case, the chords:

- i: Gm7? In Dorian mode, the tonic chord is minor seventh.

Looking at the chords present. Now, in G Dorian, what chords would be present.

But our chords: F6 is F, A, C, D. F major chord in G Dorian? G Dorian has F as the minor seventh. So F major chord would be F, A, C. A and C are present in G Dorian: F is the seventh, A is the second degree, C is the fourth degree. So yes, F major chord exists in G Dorian as VII chord? Wait no. Let's see the diatonic chords for G Dorian:

1 Gm7

2 A°7 or Am7b5

3 Bb Major 7

4 Cmaj7

5 Dm7

6 Emaj7

7 F7

So chord in G Dorian:

i: Gm7

iim7b5: Am°

IIIMaj7: Bb Maj7

IV7: Cm7? Wait, no. Let's see. The scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. So for chords:

G root: G Bb D F (Gm7)

A root: A C E G → Am7

Bb root: Bb D F A → Bbmaj7? Bb D F A is Bbmaj7? Bb to D is major third, D to F is minor third, F to A is major third. Wait, Bb, D, F, A: yes, that's Bb major seventh chord. Yes.

C root: C E G Bb → Cm7? C E G Bb. C to E is major third, E to G minor third, G to Bb minor third. So C minor seventh chord. But in the Dorian mode, the IV chord is typically minor 7th.

D root: D F A C → Dm7

E root: E G B D → E7? E G B D: G is minor third, B is major third, D is fifth. So E minor 7th flat fifth? Wait, E, G, B, D – that's Em7. No. Wait in Dorian mode, the VI chord is minor seventh? Let's see. E as root: E, G, B, D – all notes present in the scale. Yes, E minor seventh chord.

F root: F A C E – Fmaj7.

Wait, so in G Dorian, the chords would be:

i: Gm7

ii: Am7

III: BbMaj7

iv: Cm7

v: Dm7

VI: Em7

VII: Fmaj7

Now, looking at the chord progression:

Gm (Gm7)

Eb/G – this could be Bb chord? Wait, Eb major chord... in G Dorian, the Eb chord would be the flat VI. Hmm, but Eb isn't in G Dorian. G Dorian's notes are G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Eb isn't there. So if the progression has Eb, that's outside the Dorian mode.

So maybe G natural minor is still the best bet. Let's consider that.

In G natural minor (Aeolian mode): scale notes G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F.

So the diatonic chords:

i: Gm

ii°: A° (A, C, Eb)

III: Bb

iv: Cm

v: Dm

VI: Eb

VII: F

So the chords present in the progression should fit into this key.

Now, looking at the chords given:

Gm (i)

Eb/G: which is Eb major (VI chord) with G bass. In the key of G minor, VI chord is Eb major. Yes.

Bb/F: Bb major chord (III) with F bass. Bb major is diatonic.

But wait, Bb/F as chord: Bb major triad with F in bass → F, Bb, D. Which F? In G minor, the VII chord is F major. F major chord is F, A, C. But here in Bb/F: F, Bb, D. So that's missing A and C. So Bb major triad is Bb, D, F. So yes, F bass notes would be F, Bb, D. Which is the same as Bb major triad with F bass. So that's the Bb chord in second inversion. Yes, which is present in the key. Bb chord is III. So Bb/F is still part of Bb major triad, just inverted.

Next chord: Bm(b5)/G. As discussed, is G7 chord: G, B, D, F. Now, in G natural minor scale, there's no B natural. So this B natural is a chromatic note. Similarly, in Bm(b5)/G, it's a Bdim chord with G bass. But Bdim chord has B, D, F. The B natural is not in the natural minor scale. So this suggests that maybe the key is G minor but using a raised leading tone for the V chord.

Wait, if we consider a G harmonic minor scale, the notes would be G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#.

But in our progression, we have F natural, not F#. So F natural is present (in F6 chord: F, A, C, D). But harmonic minor would have F#.

So if there's a B natural in the Bm(b5)/G chord (i.e., in G7), which is part of a dominant chord, perhaps G minor in this section is using harmonic minor. But then the F would need to be raised to F# for harmonic minor. But in the progression, the F6 has F natural. So conflict.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the chord Bm(b5)/G. Let's check again. Bm(b5)/G: B minor flat fifth. Minor flat fifth would technically be a diminished chord, so Bdim. Bdim is B, D, F. So yes. With G in bass: G, B, D, F. So yes G7 chord. Now, for Bdim to be part of the scale in G minor, but B is not in natural minor. However, if the key is G minor, and the B natural appears, this would be the raised seventh note for the harmonic minor scale? Wait no. In G minor:

Natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

Harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#

Melodic minor ascending: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#

So B natural would be part of melodic minor (ascending) or harmonic minor has F# but not B natural. G harmonic minor has Bb natural. So B natural would be from melodic minor.

But melodic minor ascending has B natural, but in ascending form only. But B natural would also be present when using the V chord (D major) to create a leading tone.

But if the key is G minor, and we have a B natural in the G7 chord, that might mean that we're using the harmonic minor or melodic minor. However, the chord F6 contains natural F, which matches natural minor but not harmonic minor.

This is a bit confusing. Let's see all the non-chord tones. Another angle: perhaps this progression is in G minor, and the B natural is a chromatic passing tone or something. But in chord G7, it's the third of the G7 chord. So if the progression is using G minor but with a dominant seventh on G, this would be unusual because in minor keys, the tonic chord is minor seventh (Gm7), not dominant 7th. However, sometimes in blues and other styles, you can have a dominant seventh on tonic.

Alternatively, maybe the key is G Aeolian (natural minor), but the Bm(b5)/G chord is actually something else. Let's reconsider. Maybe Bm(b5)/G is interpreted as B diminished over G, so the G is bass, and the rest. But Bdim chord with G bass is G, B, D, F as before. Yes.

Wait, another thought: if the key is E Phrygian? No, that seems less likely.

Wait, let's look at the F6 chord. F6 has F, A, C, D. A is in G minor. In G natural minor, the A is the supertonic. So F6 chord: F major with added sixth. If the key were F major, then F6 would be tonic chord. But the rest of the chords don't fit F major. Gm in F major? F major doesn't have G minor.

Another approach: check if the key can be determined by the last chord. It ends with Gm, so likely G minor is the tonic.

Let's see the progression again:

Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm

So the chords are mostly Gm, Eb major chords, Bb major chords, then G7 chord, F6.

So let's list the chords without slash notation, by the chord quality:

- Gm

- Eb (major)

- Bb (major)

- G7

- F6

But maybe the slash chords just indicate inversions:

Eb/G could be considered as Eb triad over G → Eb major triad with G bass.

Similarly, Bb/F is Bb triad over F.

But in terms of roots: Eb major chord root Eb, Bb major root Bb, etc.

So chord roots: Gm (G), Eb (Eb), Bb (Bb), G7 (G), F (F).

So roots are G, Eb, Bb, G, F.

If we think of Eb as the sixth scale degree in G minor, Bb as third, F as seventh, G as tonic.

Yes, this fits G natural minor. Now, the issue is with B natural in G7. Let's see. G7 chord has B natural. In G natural minor, the third of the tonic chord is Bb. So having B natural would require altering that. Maybe the progression is using a mix of natural minor with some harmonic minor elements.

However, another possibility: maybe G minor, but using the B natural for a temporary modulation. Or perhaps the key is G minor but the chord Bm(b5)/G is actually not G7? Wait, let's parse Bm(b5)/G again. Bm(b5) is B minor flat fifth, so diminished chord on B. So Bdim. Then slash G means G bass. So yes, G bass with B, D, F from the dim chord. But in G minor, D is present, F is present, but B natural isn't. So unless this B is a passing tone.

Wait, but in the context of the chord progression, maybe the G7 is the V of C major? But then the key would be C major, but the progression also has G minor as the tonic. Hmm.

Alternative idea: if the key is C minor. Let's check. C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. In that case, Gm chord is ii chord, Eb is IV chord. Bb would be VI. But then F6 chord? F major chord in C minor would be IV. But F6 would be F major with sixth. But the progression starts and ends with Gm. If C minor, Gm would be ii, but it starts and ends with ii, which is possible but less common. Also, Bm(b5)/G: G7 chord. In C minor, G7 would be V chord. Which is diatonic if using harmonic minor. C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So V chord is G7 (G, B, D, F). But in that case, the tonic is C, but the progression starts and ends with Gm. So that would be ii chord to ii, not making sense. Unless modulating.

This seems more confusing.

Wait, let's count the bass notes again. The bass is mostly G, with some F. The first two chords are Gm, then Eb/G (bass G), etc. So bass is mostly G. So tonic seems to be G.

So back to G minor. Let's think why the G7 chord is there. Maybe it's a borrowed chord, like from G harmonic minor? But in G harmonic minor, F# is present, not F. But in the chord progression, we have F natural in F6. So F natural. So if harmonic minor has F#, but we're using F natural, maybe it's natural minor with a temporary alteration.

Or perhaps the G7 is not a G major chord but G minor? Wait, Bm(b5)/G – if Bm(b5) is B diminished, then the chord would be G, B, D, F. So B is natural. If the chord were G minor seventh, it would be G, Bb, D, F. But here the melody has B natural. So perhaps in the melody, it's a B natural, but the chord Gm7 would have Bb.

This is confusing. Maybe the notation is different. Let's see: sometimes "Bm(b5)" could be confusing. Bm with a flat fifth would be B, D, F. Yes. So Bm(b5) is Bdim.

So given all this, perhaps the key is G natural minor (Aeolian mode), and the B natural in the G7 chord is an outside note, or perhaps the progression uses a mix of modes.

But another idea: in G Aeolian mode, if you play a G major chord, but we have Gm. However, the chord G7 has B natural, which would be the major third. So this might be a case where the progression is modal but using the dominant 7th chord on the tonic.

Wait, but G dominant seventh would typically resolve to C major. If the progression is in G dominant mode or something else. Alternatively, if the key is Bb major? Let's check.

Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A.

Chords: Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F, Gm, Am. So Bb major has G minor as vi chord. If the progression starts with Gm and ends with Gm, then it could be in Bb major. Let's check all chords.

Gm (vi)

Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb – but Eb major chord would be IV in Bb major.

Bb/F: Bb major with F bass. Bb is I chord.

Bm(b5)/G: G7 chord. In Bb major, what's the G7 chord? G is vi chord, but G7 isn't diatonic. Bb major scale has G natural, A natural, Bb, etc. G7 chord has B natural, which is not in Bb major scale. Bb scale has Bb, so no B natural.

So that doesn't fit.

How about G minor? Yes.

Another angle: look at the F6 chord. F6 has A natural. In G minor natural minor, A natural is present. The F major chord (with added sixth D) fits since F is the VII in G minor.

Now, the problem is the G7 chord. Maybe in this context, G7 is intended as Gm7 but with a typo? Like maybe Bm(b5)/G is actually Bb something, but it's written as Bm(b5)/G.

Alternatively, maybe Bm(b5)/G is actually a B diminished over G, but in this context, it's functioning as V7 of C. If we consider that the progression might be modulating, but it starts and ends with Gm, so G minor would still be the home key.

Wait, but let's see the progression's structure. If we look at the F6 going to Gm – F major to G minor. That's a common cadence in minor keys (VII - i). For example, in G minor, F major to G minor is a common progression.

If we have Bb/F which we can think of as Bb major chord (III) with F in the bass. So Bb in the key of G minor.

And Eb/G would be Eb major (VI) with G bass. Yes.

Now, the Bm(b5)/G chord: if this is actually a G7 chord, then perhaps it's part of a secondary dominant. Like if the progression resolves to C somewhere, but in the progression given, after Bm(b5)/G comes Gm. So G7 to Gm. That would be a dominant seventh resolving to tonic minor, which isn't common – typically dominant seventh resolves to tonic major. Resolving to minor would be unusual.

But there are exceptions. In minor keys, sometimes the dominant chord is major (harmonic minor), but that would be D7 resolving to Gm. But here, the chord is G7, which is tonic chord dominant. If the tonic is minor, using dominant seventh on tonic is not standard.

Another possibility: Perhaps the Bm(b5)/G is not actually a dominant chord but something else. Let's check the notes of Bm(b5)/G again. Bm(b5) is Bdim: B, D, F. Slash G means G bass. So G, B, D, F. So this is a G7 chord, but spelled with B natural, D, F. Now in G minor, if we have a B natural, that suggests maybe they're in G Dorian mode? Wait no.

Wait, G Dorian mode is G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Wait, that has Bb, not B natural. So even in Dorian, it's Bb.

Unless... G Mixolydian? No, that would be G, A, B, C, D, E, F. But then the third is major B, but the tonality would be more major. But the chords include Gm – G Mixolydian major has G major chord. Not matching.

Wait, G Mixolydian: G, A, B, C, D, E, F. So G major chord with F natural (b7). But we have Gm chord as well – no, G Mixolydian has G major. So unless it's G minor Mixolydian? Not a thing.

Wait, let's think of another mode. If there is a G minor and G7 (with B natural), that suggests that the scale contains both Bb and B natural. Which would be the G melodic minor descending? But melodic minor ascending is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#; descending is G, F, Eb, D, C, Bb, A, G.

If we have both B natural and Bb, that implies a scale that has both, which would be not a standard mode, but a combination of harmonic and melodic.

Another thought: the key is G minor with a major third for the tonic chord – but that's a contradiction. Typically, minor has minor third.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and Bm(b5)/G is actually supposed to be Bb(b5)/G or something else. But assuming the notation is correct.

Wait, let's see. If we consider the notes for each chord with actual notes:

- Gm: G, Bb, D

- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (Eb major triad in 1st inversion – G bass)

- Bb/F: F, Bb, D (Bb major triad in 2nd inversion)

- Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F (G7)

- F6: F, A, C, D

So the notes in the entire progression include A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. So if we have both B natural and Bb, that's interesting. So this scale includes both B natural and Bb. Which suggests the scale might be using both raised and lowered thirds. That can happen in blues scales or other styles.

The G minor blues scale is G, Bb, C, Db, D, F – but this includes Db. We don't have Db here.

Another possibility: G harmonic minor ascending: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F# – but we don't have F#.

G natural minor: but missing B natural.

But the presence of B natural and Bb suggests the mode could be G Phrygian dominant? G Phrygian dominant: G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F. Yes. But let's see:

G Phrygian dominant: G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F.

So scale degrees:

1. G

b2. Ab

3. B

4. C

5. D

b6. Eb

b7. F

So this is also known as the fifth mode of F harmonic minor.

Now, chords in G Phrygian dominant:

i: Gm(7b9) or something. But typically, Phrygian dominant has a minor chord with altered degrees.

But let's see if the chords fit.

Gm chord: yes, G, Bb, D. But in Phrygian dominant, the third is B natural. Wait no! In G Phrygian dominant, the third is B natural. So G to B is major third, which would make it a G major chord. But the progression has Gm, which has Bb. So this doesn't fit because the scale's third is B natural, so Gm wouldn't be diatonic. G Phrygian dominant has G as root, so tonic chord would be G major? No. Let's see the scale notes:

G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F.

So triads:

G: G, B, D – G major.

Ab: Ab, B, Eb → Ab dim or minor? Ab, B (major third), Eb (dim fifth). So Ab dim.

B: B, D, F – Bdim.

C: C, Eb, G – Cm.

D: D, F, A – Dm with missing A? D, F, Ab? Wait, the scale doesn't have A natural. So D scale note of G Phrygian dominant: D, so D, F (minor third), Ab (dim fifth). So Ddim.

Eb: Eb, G, Bb? No. Eb, G (major third?), wait Eb, G in the scale: Eb to G is major third. G is in scale. So Eb major. Wait:

Eb: Eb, G, Bb. But Bb isn't in the scale. G Phrygian dominant has B, not Bb. So the scale notes don't include Bb or Ab. Wait:

G Phrygian dominant: G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F.

So scale has Ab (not G#), B, not Bb. So Eb is the major sixth.

So for example, G major chord would be G, B, D.

But in our progression, the chord Gm has Bb – which isn't present in this scale. So conflicting again.

Hmm.

Perhaps the best approach is to ignore the B natural for a moment and see if it fits G Aeolian. G Aeolian naturally has all those chords except for the B natural. The presence of B natural could be a chromatic passing tone or part of a borrowed chord.

Alternatively, maybe the key is G minor, and the chord Bm(b5)/G is actually a typo for something else. Like maybe it's supposed to be Bb(b5)/G or Bdim/G, but that would still be the same.

Wait, another idea: Bm(b5) could be misread. Sometimes "Bm(b5)" might mean Bm with flat fifth – B, D, F. Yes. So correct.

But in the key of E minor, for example. Let's check E minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Chords in E minor including Gm. Yes, Gm would be the ii chord. But the progression starts with Gm and ends with Gm – possible. Let's see. In E minor:

i: Em

ii: F#°

III: G

iv: Am

v: Bm

VI: C

VII: D

But our chords include Eb major? Eb isn't in E minor (which has E, F#, G, A, B, C, D). No Eb. So that doesn't fit.

Not likely.

Back to G minor. If all of this is in G minor, then the G7 chord with B natural is probably a chromatic passing chord or part of a secondary dominant. But G7 to Gm doesn't resolve traditionally. Usually, G7 would go to C major.

But maybe the progression is cyclic and the G7 is functioning as the V7 to C, but in the song's context, perhaps it's leading back to Gm or something else.

Alternatively, this could be in G minor with a Picardy third, but that's when the final chord is major. But here it ends with Gm.

Another angle: looking at the bass line. The bass notes are mostly G, with some F and G again. But the Eb/G chord – bass G is the same as Gm bass.

The Bb/F chord has bass F. So if we consider the bass line as G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G,... etc. It's not clear, but mostly G.

So tonic is G.

Let's consider modal interchange. If the key is G minor, then it's Aeolian mode. But using chords from other modes.

For example, the Bb major chord (III) is diatonic.

Eb major chord (VI) diatonic.

F major chord (VII) diatonic.

The G7 chord would be borrowed from the Mixolydian mode? But G Mixolydian is G major with F natural. But we have Gm chord as well. Not quite.

Alternatively, maybe the G7 chord is actually a IV chord for C major. Suppose the key is C major, but starts on Gm. In C major, Gm is the vi chord. But then the F6 would be F major with added sixth – in C major, F is IV, so F6 chord would be F major sixth. Then Eb major is III chord? In C major, Eb isn't diatonic (C major has Eb? No, C major is C, D, Eb? No, C major has E natural. So Eb would be bIII. Not diatonic. But the progression starts with Gm in C major as vi chord, but then Eb/G would be Eb major in C major – not diatonic. So not likely.

Another thought: if the key is D minor. D minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C. Let's see. Chords: Dm, E°, F, Gm, Am, Bb, C. So Gm is iv chord. But the progression starts with Gm, might not feel like tonic. But possible. Let's check chords:

Gm (iv)

Eb major: Eb would be bVI in D minor.

Bb major (III).

F6: F major (I chord). So F major sixth. If the key is D minor, F major is III (major chord), but usually III chord is F major or F minor? In D natural minor: F is the third degree, so F major chord. But the scale of D minor has F natural. Yes. D natural minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C. So yes, F is major third above D? No: D to F is minor third. Yes. So F major chord in D minor would include F, A, C. Which is diatonic. So F6 would be F, A, C, D. But in D minor scale, the scale has D, so D is present.

But the progression starts with Gm as first chord, which would be iv in D minor. And ends in Gm. Possible but unusual.

But let's check if chords fit. In D minor:

Eb major is bVI.

Bb major is V? No. Bb is bVII in D minor.

F major is III.

But Eb major chord: not sure.

But in the original progression with Gm Gm Eb/G etc., it might not make sense as D minor.

This is getting too complicated. Let's return to G minor.

If we consider the key of G minor, which has the standard minor key chords, and the presence of B natural in G7 is a chromatic passing tone or part of a secondary dominant. But how?

Alternatively, maybe this progression is in G natural minor, but the Bm(b5)/G chord is actually a G7 chord, which is used as a passing chord and not part of the modal key.

But the question is about determining key and mode. If the key is G minor, the mode would be Aeolian (natural minor).

Another check: list all the notes used and see if they fit a single scale. The notes present are A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G.

This scale has both B natural and Bb, so it's not a standard seven-note scale. Unless it's a mode that includes chromatic passing notes.

But typically, for key determination, we look for the tonic and the scale degrees that define the mode.

Given that the progression starts and ends with Gm, and G is the most frequent bass note, and the chords Eb and F and Bb are all diatonic to G minor, I think the intended key is G minor with Aeolian mode.

The G7 chord (with B natural) might be a borrowed chord from another mode or a chromatic chord, but the overall tonality points to G minor. In many contexts, especially in popular music, a minor key progression can have occasional major chords or alterations for interest, even if the core mode is natural minor.

So even though there is a B natural in G7, the rest of the notes and chord usage suggest G minor. The G7 chord could be functioning as a V/iii or something else, but the tonic is likely G.

Alternatively, perhaps the Bm(b5)/G is not a G7 but perhaps a G minor 7th with Bb. Wait, Bm(b5)/G: if the slash is misinterpreted. For example, maybe Bm(b5) over G meaning G is the root and Bm(b5) is the chord, but that doesn't make sense. No, slash chords are chord/bass.

Wait, Bm(b5)/G is written as "Bm(b5)/G", which would be B minor flat fifth chord with G in the bass. So yes, chord is Bdim, root B, but bass G. So the chord notes include G, B, D, F.

But if we ignore the B natural for a second and consider the main chord tones, Gm has Bb. The presence of both Bb and B might indicate that the tonality is in G minor, and the B natural is part of a melodic line but not strictly part of the chord. But the chord Bm(b5)/G contains B natural, so it's part of the chord.

Another thought: Maybe the mode is G phrygian, which has Eb, so scale G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. But then there's no B natural, but we have B natural in G7. So not matching.

Wait, if G phrygian: G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. No B natural. So not matching.

G dorian has G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. So has A and Bb. No B natural.

G Aeolian has G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Still Bb.

So the only way to have both Bb and B natural is if it's either chromatic passing or part of a different structure. Like in jazz, minor 7th chords might have passing tones. But for key determination, the most prominent tonal center is G, and the chords fit G minor scale except for one note. So likely the key is G minor with Aeolian mode.

Perhaps the Bm(b5)/G chord is actually a different interpretation. Let's think outside the box. Maybe Bm(b5)/G is not B diminished over G, but G is the root and Bm(b5) is the chord, but that would mean G with Bm(b5) chord, which doesn't make sense. Slash chords are always [chord]/[bass note].

Alternatively, maybe the "Bm(b5)/G" is a typo and should be "Bbm/b5/G" or something else.

But assuming the notation is correct, perhaps it's in the key of G natural minor, with an alteration for the B. Or maybe the mode is different. Let's see if G phrygian has any chance. No, missing the Bb or B.

Another idea: Could the Bm(b5)/G be functioning as a IV chord in some way? Not sure.

Wait, let's look at the chords in a G minor context:

- Gm is i

- Eb is VI

- Bb is III

- F is VII

The only chord that seems out of place is Bm(b5)/G which is G7. But in some contexts, G7 can be used in minor key for a bluesy feel. Like "blues minor" where tonic is dominant 7th.

But typically, blues in minor uses i7 chord, which is Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F). If it were G7, that's G dominant 7th which implies a major tonality. But if the song is in G minor but using G7 for some reason, it might be a blues progression.

However, the chord progression includes both F natural and Eb, which fits minor scale.

Given all this, I think the most likely interpretation is that the key is G minor (Aeolian mode), and the presence of B natural in the G7 chord is a chromatic passing tone or borrowed from another mode. However, the main key center is G minor.

But to check more carefully: if this progression is in G minor, the diatonic chords are i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

Which are:

Gm, A°, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F.

In the progression provided:

Gm is i

Eb is VI (Eb major)

Bb is III (Bb major)

F is VII (F major)

The chord Bm(b5)/G as G7 doesn't fit because G7 is not diatonic. But maybe in context, it's a secondary dominant. For example, G7 leading to C, but then where is the C chord? The progression doesn't have C, but it does have F chords. Maybe G7 is the V of C, and C would be I, but the progression doesn't have C. This complicates things.

Another idea: if the key is C minor. Let's check. C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Then chords would be:

i: Cm

ii°: D°

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII: Bb

But the progression has Gm (v), Eb (III), F6 would be F major? In C minor, F minor is iv, but F major is not diatonic.

So not likely.

Back to G minor. Perhaps the song is in G minor but uses a D major or D7 chord for the V, but here it has G7. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the progression is using harmonic minor. Let's check G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#.

But our chords have F natural, not F#. So conflict. However, perhaps F6 chord is F major, which would mean F natural. So if harmonic minor has F#, but the progression has F natural, maybe the song is using natural minor for most parts and harmonic minor for some.

But in the absence of F#, it's more likely natural minor.

Another angle: look for the leading tone. In G minor harmonic minor, the dominant is D major, which has F# as the leading tone. But here there's no D major chord. Bb/F is Bb major, etc.

I think after considering all this, the simplest and most logical explanation is that the key is G minor, mode Aeolian. The G7 chord might be a temporary chromatic alteration or perhaps the Bm(b5)/G is being misread. Perhaps the slash chord is indicating something else. Wait, Bm(b5)/G could actually be a G minor chord with added Bb? No.

Wait, maybe the Bm(b5)/G is actually a B diminished over G bass, but in context of the song, perhaps it's functioning as part of G minor without raising the third. But the chord itself has B natural, which conflicts with G minor's third.

However, in some interpretations, if all the other chords fit G minor and the tonic is Gm, then we still consider G minor as the key, and the B natural is just a non-chord tone or borrowed.

Given that music theory questions like this are generally expecting a standard key and mode, and the majority of chord qualities fit G minor, I think the intended answer is G minor (Aeolian mode).

So key: G minor, mode: Aeolian.

Alternatively, to confirm, let's see if there's a major key that fits. If the key were G major, but the chords include Gm, so no.

Yes, G minor makes sense.

Another check: the F6 chord. In G minor, F major chord as VII is common in minor keys. F6 would be F major with added sixth (D), which is fine.

So I think after all this, the key is G minor in Aeolian mode.


The chord progression **Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm** is best interpreted as being in **G minor (Aeolian mode)**, with a few chromatic elements that do not disrupt the overall tonal center.

---

### **Key Analysis**
- **Tonic Note**: The progression begins and ends on **Gm**, and **G** is the dominant bass note throughout (e.g., "Eb/G" and "Bm(b5)/G" have **G in the bass**). This strongly suggests **G** is the tonic.
- **Diatonic Chords in G Minor (Aeolian)**:
  - **i**: Gm (G–B♭–D)
  - **III**: Bb (B♭–D–F)
  - **VI**: Eb (E♭–G–B♭)
  - **VII**: F (F–A–C)
  - These chords align perfectly with the diatonic structure of **G Aeolian** (natural minor scale: **G–A–B♭–C–D–E♭–F**).
- **Chord "Bm(b5)/G"**:
  - This is interpreted as a **B diminished triad (B–D–F)** with **G in the bass**, forming **G7 (G–B–D–F)**.
  - While **B natural** is not part of the natural minor scale (which has **B♭**), this is a common chromatic embellishment in minor-key progressions:
    - **G7** could function as a **secondary dominant** (e.g., V of **C**) or a blues-influenced G minor dominant chord.
    - In practice, minor-key progressions often blend natural minor (Aeolian) with chromatic alterations for harmonic interest.
- **F6 Chord**:  
  - **F–A–C–D** fits naturally in G minor (F is the VII chord, and the added **D** is the 5th degree of the scale). This is a standard extension in minor-key music.

---

### **Why Not Other Possibilities?**
- **G Harmonic Minor**: Requires **F#**, but the progression uses **F natural** (e.g., in **F6**), so this does not fit.
- **G Major or Other Modes**: Confirmed by the presence of **Gm** as the tonic chord, which rules out major keys.
- **D Minor or Other Keys**: Other candidates (e.g., D minor) fail because **Eb** and **Bb** do not align diatonically with them.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **G minor**  
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**  
- **Notes**: The scale is **G–A–B♭–C–D–E♭–F**.  
- **Chromatic Note**: The **B natural** in **G7 (from Bm(b5)/G)** is a temporary chromatic alteration, common in minor-key idioms (e.g., for bluesy or modal interchange flavor), but does not change the fundamental key.

This progression is characteristic of a **G minor/Aeolian** tonality with subtle chromatic inflections, typical in jazz, pop, or film score contexts where harmonic color is added to a stable minor key. 

**Final Answer**:  
**Key:** G minor  
**Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor)

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**  
Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm

---

### Step 1: List the chords (ignoring bass notes for now, but note them where relevant)

We can simplify by looking at the **root motion** and **chord qualities**:

1. Gm (G minor)  
2. Gm  
3. Eb/G → **Eb major** with G in bass → this is **first inversion of Eb major**  
4. Eb/G  
5. Gm  
6. Gm  
7. Bm(b5)/G → **B diminished** with G in bass → B° = B-D-F, so B°/G = G-B-D-F → this is a **G7 (dominant 7th) chord**!  
   - Wait — let’s verify:  
     - Bm(b5) = B-D-F (B diminished triad)  
     - With G in the bass → G-B-D-F = **G7 chord** (G dominant 7th)  
     - So Bm(b5)/G = **G7**
8. Gm  
9. Gm  
10. Eb/G → Eb major / G  
11. Eb/G  
12. Gm  
13. Gm  
14. F6 → F major with 6th → F-A-C-D  
15. Gm

---

### Step 2: What’s the tonal center?

The progression starts and ends on **Gm**, and Gm appears **8 times** out of 15 chords. Extremely strong indicator that **G minor** is the tonal center.

But let’s look at the key signature implied by the chords.

### Step 3: Analyze chord function in **G minor**

G natural minor scale: G A Bb C D Eb F

Chords built on that scale:

- i: Gm  
- ii°: Am°  
- III: Bb  
- iv: Cm  
- v: Dm  
- VI: Eb  
- VII: F

So in G minor, the expected diatonic chords are:

- Gm, Am°, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F

Now compare to your progression:

- Gm → ✅ i  
- Eb → ✅ VI  
- F6 → ✅ VII (F major with added 6th = F6 = F-A-C-D — still functions as VII in G minor)  
- Bm(b5)/G → **G7** — this is **NOT** diatonic to G natural minor!

G7 = G-B-D-F  
But in G natural minor, the 7th degree is F natural, and the 3rd is Bb, **not B natural**.

→ So B natural appears here. That means we have a **chromatic alteration**.

G7 = G-B-D-F  
→ B natural = **raised 3rd** compared to G minor’s Bb.

So G7 is **not** diatonic to G natural minor. It’s an example of **harmonic minor** alteration.

In **G harmonic minor**, the scale is:  
**G A Bb C D Eb F#** ← wait, hold on.

Wait — G harmonic minor: **G A Bb C D Eb F#** — the 7th is raised to F# to create a leading tone to G.

BUT in our chord we have **G7 = G-B-D-F**

→ That’s **B natural** and **F natural**

But in G harmonic minor:

- 3rd = Bb  
- 7th = F#  

So G7 (G-B-D-F) has **B natural** (major 3rd) and **F natural** (minor 7th) — **this is not G harmonic minor**.

This is actually **G dominant 7th**, which is **NOT** native to G minor at all. So where does it come from?

---

### Step 4: Look at G7 as a secondary dominant

G7 is the **dominant of C**.

G7 → C would be V7/I in C major or C minor.

But we don’t have a C chord here.

Instead, after G7, we return to Gm.

So G7 → Gm. That’s a **dominant → tonic** relationship, but the **tonic** is minor.

That’s the classic **minor plagal cadence** or more specifically, **G7 → Gm** is a **minor mode mixture** or **borrowed dominant**.

Wait — but G7 to Gm is **not** a standard functional progression in traditional harmony.

G7 → Gm is a **non-diatonic, chromatic resolution**.

Another possibility: G7 is a **tritone substitution**? That would imply we’re going to C# or Db, not Gm.

No — not that.

Wait — let’s reconsider: **Bm(b5)/G = G7**, and it's followed by Gm.

That’s **G7 → Gm** — a **deceptive resolution**: dominant chord resolves to tonic minor? But G7 is built on **B natural**, while Gm has **Bb** — the leading tone is clashing.

This suggests the **G7 chord is not leading to C**, but is instead **borrowed from G harmonic or melodic minor?**

But again — **G harmonic minor** has **F#**, not F natural.

So G7 (G-B-D-F) has F natural — that’s not harmonic minor.

What if we consider **G melodic minor ascending**?

G melodic minor ascending: G A B C D E F#  
→ Still no F natural, and 3rd is B natural, 7th is F#.

So **G7 (G-B-D-F)** has **B natural** and **F natural** — that’s **outside** both natural, harmonic, and melodic minor.

Hmm.

Alternative idea: Maybe the key is **Bb major**?

Let’s test that.

### Step 5: Try key of **Bb major**

Bb major scale: Bb C D Eb F G A

Chords:

- i: Bbm  
- ii: Cm  
- III: D°  
- iv: Eb  
- v: Fm  
- VI: Gm  
- VII: A°  

Wait — Gm is **VI chord in Bb major**

Now look at your chords:

- Gm → VI ✅  
- Eb → IV ✅  
- Eb/G → same chord  
- Bm(b5)/G = G7 → what’s G7 in Bb major? G is the **7th scale degree** in Bb major — so G° chord is the VII° — but we have G7, which is a **major minor 7th** — not diatonic.

G7 in Bb major? G is leading tone, so VII is G°, not G7.

G7 implies F natural and B natural.

In Bb major: F is natural (✓), but B is **B natural**? No — Bb major has **Bb**, not B natural.

So again — **B natural is not in Bb major**.

So neither Bb major nor G minor fully accommodate B natural and F natural together.

Wait — what key has **F natural** and **B natural**?

That’s **C major** or **C minor**.

C major: C D E F G A B  
→ F natural, B natural ✅

But our tonic is Gm.

Let’s try **G minor with chromaticism**.

G minor — most likely **harmonic minor**, which raises 7th to F#.

But we have **F natural** — which is the natural 7th (from natural minor).

And we have **B natural** — which is the raised 3rd, as in the **dominant chord** (G7), which is **borrowed from G major**.

Wait — yes!

This is a **G minor** progression that temporarily borrows from **G major**.

Specifically:

- The G7 chord is **borrowed from G major** — major III and major VII are not in minor modes.

Wait, in **G major**: G A B C D E F# → chord built on G: G major (G-B-D), and we have G7 (G-B-D-F), but F natural is not in G major — G major has F#.

So G7 has **F natural** — so now we have **B natural AND F natural** — that’s **G7 with a flat 7** — yes, that’s **G dominant 7, but the flat 7 is diatonic to G natural minor**.

This chord — **G7** — has:

- Root: G  
- Major 3rd: B (from G major)  
- Minor 7th: F (from G natural minor)

This is a **mixed-mode chord**: combining elements from **G major** (major 3rd) and **G natural minor** (minor 7th).

This is **not standard** in traditional harmony, but very common in **jazz** and **pop/rock** as a **“minor blues”** or **“mixed minor”** sound, or as a **“G blues dominant”** chord.

In **blues and soul**, it’s normal to have dominant 7th chords on the tonic minor (e.g., E7 in E minor blues).

So this is **G minor with tonic dominant 7th chord** — very common in **minor blues progressions**.

So the progression is:

**Gm → Gm → Eb/G → Eb/G → Gm → Gm → G7 → Gm → Gm → Eb/G → Eb/G → Gm → Gm → F6 → Gm**

We can now re-interpret:

### Step 6: Interpret chord functions **in G minor**, using chromaticism

- Gm = i (tonic)  
- Eb = VI (diatonic in natural minor)  
- G7 = **tonic dominant** — borrowed for color, common in minor blues  
- F6 = VII6 (in natural minor: F major = VII, adding 6th = F6 — very common in R&B/pop in minor keys)

### Step 7: Mode?

If the key is G minor, and it’s using mostly natural minor (A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F), with **one chromatic note**: **B natural** (from G7), then we are primarily in **G natural minor** (Aeolian mode).

But the **B natural** is a **borrowed note** — temporary alteration.

**Mode**: G Aeolian (natural minor)

**Key**: G minor

The G7 chord does **not** change the key — it’s a **chromatic passing or color chord**.

### Step 8: Compare to relative major?

Relative major of G minor is **Bb major**.

But again — **B natural** doesn’t belong in Bb major.

So not Bb major.

### Final conclusion:

> ✅ **Key: G minor**  
> ✅ **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  
>  
> The G7 chord (from Bm(b5)/G) is a **chromatic chromatic passing chord**, functioning as a **tonic dominant** in minor blues style — common in pop, R&B, and jazz.  
>  
> The F6 chord is the **VII6** chord, diatonic in G natural minor and very common in minor-key progressions.

### Additional Insight:

This progression is reminiscent of songs like:

- “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill Withers (G minor with G7)
- “I Can’t Help Myself” (Four Tops) — uses F6 → Gm
- Classic minor pop/rock progressions

It’s **G minor Aeolian with modal mixture** (borrowing G7 for dramatic tension).

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: G minor**  
> **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  
>  
> The progression uses chromatic embellishment with a G7 chord (borrowed from blues/pop minor conventions) and an F6 chord, both common in minor-key popular music, but the tonal center remains firmly on G minor in Aeolian mode.

To determine the **key and mode** of the given chord progression:

> **Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm**

### Step 1: List all chords (simplify and identify root notes and qualities)

| Chord             | Root | Quality / Notes                        |
|------------------|------|----------------------------------------|
| Gm               | G    | G–B♭–D                                 |
| Eb/G             | G    | G–Eb (i.e., Eb major with G in bass → G–B♭–Eb) |
| Bb/F             | F    | F–Bb–D (Bb major with F in bass → F–Bb–D) |
| Bm(b5)/G         | G    | G–B–D–F? Wait—Bm(b5) = B–D–F; over G → G–B–D–F → G7? |
| F6               | F    | F–A–C–D                                |

Hold on—**Bm(b5)** is a half-diminished chord: **B–D–F–A** (if it’s Bm7♭5), but written as **Bm(b5)/G**, that would be **G–B–D–F**.

But **G–B–D–F** is a **G7 chord** (G dominant 7: G–B–D–F). So **Bm(b5)/G = G7** enharmonically.

However, if it’s just **Bm(b5)** triad (no 7th), then it’s **B–D–F**, and over G → **G–B–D–F** again → same as G7.

So this chord strongly suggests **G7**, which is a **dominant chord**.

But wait—if the key were **G minor**, then **G7** is the **V7 of C minor**, not native to G minor.

Let’s test possible keys.

---

### Step 2: Look for common diatonic chords

The main chords used:

- **Gm** – appears constantly → likely tonic
- **Eb/G** – first inversion of **Eb major**
- **Bb/F** – first inversion of **Bb major**
- **F6** – F major with added 6th (D), so **F major**
- **Bm(b5)/G** → interpreted as **G7**

So the **chord roots** (ignoring bass inversions):  
**Gm, Eb, Bb, F, G7**

These are all chords from the **key of Bb major** or **G minor** (relative minor of Bb).

**Bb major scale**: Bb C D Eb F G A  
**G natural minor**: G A Bb C D Eb F

Chords in **G natural minor**:
- i: Gm  
- ii°: Adim  
- III: Bb  
- iv: Cm  
- v: Dm  
- VI: Eb  
- VII: F

So:
- Gm = i ✔️  
- Eb = VI ✔️  
- Bb = III ✔️  
- F = VII ✔️  
- F6 = just F with added 6th (D) – still F major ✔️

But what about **G7** (from Bm(b5)/G)?  
In natural minor, the **v chord is Dm**, and **V (D major) or G7 is not diatonic**.

However, in **harmonic minor**, we raise the 7th degree (F → F#), which gives us:
- **D major (V)**, used to lead to Gm
- But **G7** is **not** the dominant of G minor — it would be **D7**.

So **G7** is unusual in G minor.

Wait — maybe **Bm(b5)/G isn’t G7**?

Let’s double-check:  
**Bm(b5)** = B–D–F  
Over G → notes: G, B, D, F

That’s **G7**: G (root), B (3rd), D (5th), F (♭7) → yes, it’s G7.

But **G7 in the key of G minor** is a **modal mixture or borrowed chord**? Not really — it’s the **tonic with a major 3rd and flat 7**, which is **G Mixolydian** or **G7 as a blues/dominant tonic**.

But dominant 7 on tonic is common in **Dorian mode**? No, Dorian has minor 7, but major 6.

Wait — **G Dorian** = G A Bb C D E F  
Chords: Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, Eb, F

Still no G7.

But **F6** = F–A–C–D → includes **A natural**, which is **not in G natural minor** (which has A♭? No — G natural minor has A natural! Wait!)

Hold on: **G natural minor = G A Bb C D Eb F** → yes, **A is natural**, not flat. Only B, E, A are the altered notes from major? No:

G major: G A B C D E F#  
G natural minor: G A B♭ C D E♭ F

So **A is natural** in G minor — correct.

So **F6** = F–A–C–D → all notes in G natural minor:  
- F ✔️  
- A ✔️  
- C ✔️  
- D ✔️

Yes! So **F6 is diatonic to G natural minor** (it's the VII chord with added 13th).

Then what about **G7** (Bm(b5)/G)? The **B natural** in G7 is **not in G natural minor** (which has B♭).

Ah! **B natural** is foreign to G minor.

So **G7 contains B♮**, which is **chromatic** in G minor.

But maybe that chord is **not G7** — maybe it’s a misinterpretation.

Alternative: **Bm(b5)** is **B–D–F**, and the slash **/G** just means **G in bass**, but maybe the chord functions as **ii° of A**, or something else.

But in context: progression is mostly **Gm → Eb → Gm → Bb → [Bm(b5)/G] → Gm**

The **Bm(b5)/G** resolves to **Gm**, so it’s acting like a **dominant or embellishment**.

But **G7 → Gm** is a **modal mixture** or **blues move**, but it’s not functional dominant resolution (since G7 to Gm is **not a V–i**; it’s **I7–i**, which is common in **rock, jazz, or blues**, implying **G Mixolydian** or **G Dorian with altered 3rd**).

But wait — perhaps the **Bm(b5)/G** is better analyzed as a **passing chord** or **voice-leading chord**.

Let’s look at voice leading between **Bb/F** and **Gm**:

- Bb/F = F–Bb–D  
- Bm(b5)/G = G–B–D–F  
- Gm = G–Bb–D

So moving from Bb/F → Bm(b5)/G → Gm:

- F (bass) → G → G  
- Bb → B → Bb (chromatic movement!)  
- D → D → D  
- (F stays)

So **B natural** is a **chromatic passing tone** between Bb and Bb (i.e., Bb → B → Bb), a common embellishment in minor keys (called a **Neapolitan-type** or **chromatic mediant** move, but more likely just a **secondary dominant or applied chord**).

But **B natural** suggests **harmonic/melodic minor of E minor?** Not likely.

Alternatively, maybe the piece is in **Eb major**?

**Eb major chords**:  
Eb (I), Fm (ii), Gm (iii), Ab (IV), Bb (V), Cm (vi), Ddim (vii°)

So:
- Gm = iii  
- Eb = I  
- Bb = V  
- F6 = ii with added 6? But F in Eb is **ii**, which is **Fm**, not F major.

But we have **F major**, not F minor — so **not Eb major**.

In **Eb major**, F should be Fm, but it’s F major → so **not diatonic**.

But in **C minor** (relative minor of Eb):  
Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb

Still, **F is Fm**, not F major.

But in **C harmonic minor**, G is **G major** (V), but F is still Fm.

So **F major** points away from Eb/C minor.

Back to **G minor**.

In **G minor**, the **VII chord is F major**, which is used often as a **modal chord** (from natural minor), and **F6** is just F with added 6.

**Eb (VI)** and **Bb (III)** are also common in minor keys.

So the core chords: Gm (i), Eb (VI), Bb (III), F (VII) — all from **G natural minor**.

The **Bm(b5)/G** introduces a **B natural**, which is **non-diatonic**, but used as a **chromatic passing chord** (common in minor keys for expressive effect).

Thus, the **tonal center is G**, the **quality is minor**, and the **mode is natural minor (Aeolian)**, with occasional chromaticism.

But let’s consider **G Dorian**: G A Bb C D E F

Contains:
- Gm (i)  
- Bb (III)  
- Eb? Eb = E♭, but Dorian has **E natural**, so **Eb is not in G Dorian**

So **Eb major (with Eb note)** is **not in G Dorian** → eliminates Dorian.

**G Phrygian**: G Ab Bb C D Eb F → has Eb, Bb, but **F major?** F is in Phrygian, yes, but **Bb is not a typical chord** — but more importantly, the **A is flat**, but we have **A natural** in F6 and elsewhere, so **not Phrygian**.

Thus, only **G natural minor (Aeolian)** contains:
- G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F → matches all diatonic chords: Gm, Bb, Eb, F

Therefore, the **key is G minor**, **mode is Aeolian (natural minor)**, with brief chromatic alteration (B♮ in the Bm(b5)/G chord).

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **Key**: G minor  
- **Mode**: Natural minor (Aeolian)  

The progression is centered around **G minor**, using diatonic chords from the **G natural minor scale** (i, III, VI, VII), with a brief chromatic passing chord (Bm(b5)/G, which introduces B♮ as a decorative tone).

### Reasoning

**Determining Chord Keys and Modes**

I'm currently focused on the chord tones and roots within this progression. I've listed the chords and am now cross-referencing to determine the underlying harmonic structure. The goal is to uncover the key and mode, which will then guide my harmonic analysis of the chord choices. It's a bit of a puzzle, but I'm getting there.


**Mapping Harmonic Functions**

I've clarified the role of each chord within the assumed G minor context. I've classified Gm as the tonic, Eb as the bVI, and F (including F6) as the bVII. I'm now exploring the implications of the Bm(b5) chord. Its diminished quality hints at a potential modulation or a more complex harmonic function.


**Unraveling Modal Implications**

Considering the Bm(b5) /G, I'm now leaning towards a G natural minor/Aeolian framework, as the bass note is G, and its lack of resolution to C or D major, or a clear dominant, seems to preclude a dominant function for Bdim. The F natural further supports this. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic elements.


**Re-evaluating Chord Functions**

I'm now revisiting the diminished chord, initially considering it a potential modulation point or leading tone chord. However, the presence of F natural and the overall harmonic flow steer me towards understanding it as a passing chord, adding chromatic color without significantly altering the G minor context. The analysis of chord roots has been pivotal.


**Synthesizing Harmonic Insights**

I've finalized my analysis, confirming the key as G minor and the mode as Aeolian (natural minor). The chord progression's structure (i - bVI - III - bVII) strongly supports this. The passing function of the diminished chord and the absence of a dominant chord further corroborate my mode determination.




The analysis of the given chord progression reveals the harmonic center, the prevailing scale degrees, and the overall modality.

## 1. Determine the Key Center (Tonic)

The progression begins and ends on **Gm (G minor)**, and Gm is the most frequently repeated chord. This overwhelmingly establishes **G** as the tonal center and that the key is in a **minor** modality.

## 2. Analyze Chord Relationships

We relate the chords back to the G minor root (G - Bb - D).

| Chord | Function in G Minor | Notes | Characteristic Interval |
| :---: | :---: | :-----: | :---: |
| **Gm** | **i** (Tonic) | G-Bb-D | |
| **Eb** | **bVI** (Submediant Major) | Eb-G-Bb | Uses the minor sixth (Eb) |
| **Bb** | **III** (Relative Major) | Bb-D-F | |
| **F** / **F6** | **bVII** (Subtonic Major) | F-A-C-D | Uses the minor seventh (F) |
| **Bm(b5)** | Passing/Chromatic | B-D-F | The root is G. This acts as a chromatic approach or a function of leading-tone diminished, but is rooted on G (G-B-D-F), often a passing tension $G7(b9)$ or simply a temporary diminished $\text{vii}^{\circ}$ before returning to $\text{i}$. |

## 3. Determine the Mode

The critical factor for determining mode in a minor key is the quality of the sixth and seventh scale degrees.

1.  **Sixth Degree:** The use of **Eb** (the chord $\text{bVI}$) establishes the minor sixth degree.
2.  **Seventh Degree:** The use of **F major** ($\text{bVII}$) establishes the minor seventh degree (F natural).

Since the progression uses the minor sixth ($\text{Eb}$) and the minor seventh ($\text{F}$ natural) instead of the raised seventh ($\text{F\#}$) required for the Harmonic or Melodic minor, the scale is the **Natural Minor Scale**.

***

## Conclusion

*   **Key:** **G minor**
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian** (Natural Minor)

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

The provided chord progression is:

**Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm**

To determine the key and mode, we first look for the most frequently occurring and structurally important chords, particularly the tonic (I) chord.

1.  **Dominant Chord:** The `F6` chord (F-A-C-D) or simply `F` chord serves as the dominant chord, strongly pulling towards G. The `F` major chord is the $\text{VII}$ chord in the $\text{G}$ natural minor scale. Since we don't have a $\text{D}$ major (V) chord, this structure suggests a mode or scale that uses a minor dominant.

2.  **Tonic Chord:** The `Gm` chord starts and ends the progression and is the most frequently occurring chord, establishing **G** as the tonal center. This immediately suggests a minor key system (G minor).

3.  **Progression Analysis:**
    *   $\text{Gm}$ (i)
    *   $\text{Eb/G}$ (IV or iv/major IV depending on mode used) - $\text{Eb}$ major is the $\text{bVI}$ chord in $\text{G}$ minor.
    *   $\text{Bb/F}$ ($\text{Bb}$ Major) - $\text{Bb}$ major is the $\text{bIII}$ chord in $\text{G}$ natural minor.
    *   $\text{Bm(b5)/G}$ (This chord is unusual in a simple minor key. $\text{Bmb5}$ is B-D-F. When inverted with $\text{G}$ in the bass, it functions structurally similar to a $\text{G}$ minor chord with added tension, or perhaps more locally, as a passing chord.)
    *   $\text{F6}$ ($\text{F}$ major) - $\text{F}$ major is the $\text{bVII}$ chord in $\text{G}$ minor.

4.  **Diatonic Chords in G Minor Modes:**

    *   **G Natural Minor (Aeolian):** $\text{Gm}$ (i), $\text{Adim}$ (ii°), $\text{Bb}$ (bIII), $\text{Cm}$ (iv), $\text{Dm}$ (v), $\text{Eb}$ (bVI), $\text{F}$ (bVII).
    *   **G Harmonic Minor:** $\text{Gm}$ (i), $\text{Adim}$ (ii°), $\text{Bbaug}$ (bIII+), $\text{Cm}$ (iv), $\text{D}$ (V), $\text{Eb}$ (bVI), $\text{F#dim}$ (vii°).
    *   **G Melodic Minor:** $\text{Gm}$ (i), $\text{Am}$ (ii), $\text{Bbaug}$ (bIII+), $\text{C}$ (IV), $\text{D}$ (V), $\text{Edim}$ (vi°), $\text{F#dim}$ (vii°).

**Conclusion:**

The progression exclusively uses the chords $\text{Gm}$ (i), $\text{Bb}$ (bIII), $\text{Eb}$ (bVI), and $\text{F}$ (bVII). All these chords are the diatonic chords of the **G Natural Minor Scale** (G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F).

The use of the $\text{F}$ major chord ($\text{bVII}$) instead of the $\text{D}$ major chord (V) is the defining characteristic that separates the Natural Minor (Aeolian Mode) from Harmonic or Melodic Minor, where the Dominant is often raised.

Therefore, the key and mode are:

**Key and Mode:** **G Aeolian Mode (or G Natural Minor)**

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's analyze the chord sequence step by step to determine the **key and mode**:

---

### **Chords (Given)**

We are given:

**Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm**

Let's simplify the inversions and ambiguous chords:

1. **Gm** – G minor triad: G–Bb–D
2. **Eb/G** – Eb major triad with G in bass: Eb–G–Bb (no 5th), but G bass → suggests Eb major with G bass
3. **Bb/F** – Bb major triad with F in bass
4. **Bm(b5)/G** – B minor diminished triad (B–D–F), with G in bass → basically **B°/G** (half-diminished is Bm7b5, but this is **Bmb5**, so likely **B diminished triad** inverted)
5. **F6** – F major with added 6th: F–A–C–D

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Tonic / Key Center**

The chord **Gm** appears **very frequently** — at the beginning, end, and multiple times. It acts as a home base.

So, suggests **G** as the tonal center.

Are we in **G major** or **G minor**?

There are **no G major chords** — all tonic-like chords are **Gm**.

Also, the **Eb major** chord appears multiple times. In the key of **G minor**, **Eb major** is the **VI chord** — very common.

In **G major**, Eb would be **♭VI**, which is a modal or borrowed chord, less likely as a core diatonic chord.

So, **G minor** is strongly suggested.

---

### **Step 2: Check Notes / Diatonic Fit in G Minor**

Natural G minor scale:  
**G – A – Bb – C – D – Eb – F – G**

Let’s see what notes are in the chords:

- **Gm**: G–Bb–D → all in G natural minor ✅
- **Eb/G**: Eb–G–Bb → Eb is VI, G is root → ✅ diatonic
- **Bb/F**: Bb–D–F → Bb is VII, F is 4th → all in G minor ✅
- **Bm(b5)/G**: B–D–F → B diminished triad (B°). In G minor, B natural is the 3rd degree, and D is 5th, F is 7th → **B–D–F** is **vii°**, which is **B°** — the **leading tone diminished triad** — this implies **harmonic minor** usage (raised 7th → F#? Wait — no!)

Wait: In **G natural minor**, 7th is **F**, not F#.

But **B°** is B–D–F — that’s built on the 3rd degree of G minor (B), with minor 3rd (D) and minor 6th from B? Let's check intervals:

From B:  
- B to D = minor 3rd  
- D to F = minor 3rd → so **B–D–F** is a **diminished triad**

In G major, **vii°** is F#–A–C → F#°  
In G **minor**, if we use **natural minor**, 7th is F → so **vii°** would be F–A–C → **F°**, built on ♭VII

But **B°** (B–D–F) is built on scale degree **3** — and in **natural minor**, 3rd degree is **Bb**, not B natural.

Ah! Here's the key point:

> If we have **B natural**, not **Bb**, that means the **3rd scale degree is major** — which is characteristic of **G harmonic minor**, because **raising the 7th (F → F#)** makes the **3rd above G (B)** become **B natural**?

Wait — no: **G to B natural** is a **major 3rd**, regardless of minor mode — it's just that in minor, the 3rd is **flatted** compared to major.

Actually:

- G **major**: G–A–B–C–D–E–F# → B is natural
- G **natural minor**: G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F → Bb

So **B natural** is **NOT** in G natural minor.

But the chord is **Bm(b5)** → B–D–F → this uses **B natural**, **D**, **F**

So **B natural** appears — that’s **scale degree 3**, but **raised** compared to G minor.

But B natural is **part of G major**, not G minor.

However — this chord is **B°** (B–D–F), which is a **diminished triad on the 3rd degree** — and in the key of **G**, that would be **iii°**, which is **rare** in major, but **in minor**, we don’t expect B natural.

Unless — is this implying **G harmonic minor**?

Let’s recall:

> **G harmonic minor**: G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–**F#**

Raised 7th → **F#**

But the chord is **B–D–F** → **F natural**, not F#

So **F is natural**, not F#

Therefore:  
- B natural → not in G natural minor (which has Bb)  
- But F natural → contradicts harmonic minor (which has F#)

So we have **both B natural** and **F natural** — that’s a **tritone** — but they’re **not** in the same scale.

Wait — that seems **modal mixture** or **chromaticism**, but maybe we're misreading the chord.

Let’s double-check: **Bm(b5)/G**

- “Bm(b5)” usually means **B minor triad with flat 5** → B–D–F → that’s **B diminished triad**, same as **B°**
- It’s a **diminished triad**, not half-diminished (which would be Bm7b5: B–D–F–A)

So it's just **B°**, and bass is **G**

So notes: **G (bass), B, D, F**

So full sonority: **G–B–D–F** → that’s **G7** without the 5th? Or **G7 in third inversion**?

Wait:  
**G–B–D–F** = **G7** — **dominant 7th chord in C major/minor**

But here, bass is **G**, and chords are: **B°/G** → meaning **B diminished triad over G bass**

So: **G in bass**, plus **B–D–F** → so total: **G–B–D–F**

That’s **G7** — **G dominant 7th**

Even though labeled as **Bm(b5)/G**, it's functioning as **G7**

Because:  
- G (root)  
- B (major 3rd)  
- D (5th)  
- F (minor 7th)

→ **G7**

So despite the slash chord name, **this is G7 in root position** — G in bass, and upper notes B–D–F — perfect.

So **Bm(b5)/G** = **G7**

✅ So we can **reinterpret** this chord as **G7**

Similarly:

- **Eb/G** — Eb triad with G bass → notes: G–Eb–Bb → that's **Eb major in first inversion** (Eb/G = 2nd inversion: 5th in bass) — yes, G is the 3rd of Eb, so it's **first inversion**? Wait:

Eb major: Eb (root), G (3rd), Bb (5th)

So **G in bass** → **first inversion** → **Eb/G = Eb6** in figured bass, but still just **Eb major, 1st inv**

✅ Diatonic in G minor?  
Eb is **VI** in G minor → yes, common.

**Bb/F** → Bb major, F in bass → **2nd inversion** → **Bb6/4** — still **Bb major**, which is **VII** in G minor (natural minor) → yes, common.

**F6** → F–A–C–D → that's **F major with added 6th**, or **F6**

In G minor:  
F = ♭VII, A = 2nd, C = 4th, D = 5th → all diatonic except:  
A is **natural**, which is in G minor (both natural and harmonic) — yes, A is 2nd degree → **natural**

So F6: F–A–C–D → all notes in **G natural minor** ✅

---

### **Final Chord Functions in G Minor**

Let’s write the progression with **functional analysis**:

| Chord | Likely Function | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Gm | i | tonic |
| Gm | i | |
| Eb/G | VI (1st inv) | submediant |
| Eb/G | VI | |
| Gm | i | return to tonic |
| Gm | i | |
| Bb/F | VII (2nd inv) | in minor, VII is major (from natural minor) — acts as dominant preparation |
| Bm(b5)/G → **G7** | V7 | **dominant** → strong pull to tonic |
| Gm | i | resolution! |
| Gm | i | |
| Eb/G | VI | |
| Eb/G | VI | |
| Gm | i | |
| Gm | i | |
| F6 | ♭VII | neighbor or plagal? Or pre-dominant? |
| Gm | i | ends on tonic |

Wait — **F6 → Gm** — that’s **♭VII → i** — very common in minor keys — **plagal** or **modal** movement — no issue.

And the **G7 → Gm** is **V → i** — **perfect cadence**

Even though **G7** has **B natural** (major 3rd) and **F natural** (minor 7th), that’s **standard dominant chord in minor** — because:

> In **minor keys**, the **V chord** is **major** (even though diatonic 7th is minor), due to **harmonic minor** raising of 7th → **F → F#** for **V or V7**

But here — the **G7** has **F natural**, not F#?

Wait — **G7** = G–B–D–F → **F natural**

But **V7 in G minor** should be **D7**: D–F#–A–C — **F#**, not F

But this chord is **G7** — **not D7**

So **G7** is **NOT V7 of G minor** — it’s **♭VII7**? Or **I7**?

**G7** in the key of **G minor** is **I7** — **tonic with minor 7th**

That’s **not a dominant** — it’s a **tonic chord with added bluesy 7th**, or it could be **borrowed**, but **where does it resolve?**

It resolves **to Gm** — **I7 → i** — **no change in root**, just **softening** — very common in **blues, rock, jazz** — **tonic dominant 7th**

So **G7 → Gm** is **not a cadence** — it’s just **embellishment of tonic**

So **no modulation** — just **chromatic inflection** on tonic

But **B natural** comes from **G7**, and **F natural** is already present — so **no F#** required — it’s just **mixing in a bluesy I7**

Still, **B natural** is **not in G natural minor**, but it's **brief** — **chromatic** — acceptable as **tonic coloring**

So **no strong move to major** — **tonic remains minor**

### **Conclusion: Key and Mode**

- **Tonic**: **G**
- **Quality**: predominantly **minor** — **Gm** is home, start, end, and most frequent
- **Scale**: primarily **G natural minor** (uses Eb, Bb, F)
- **Chromatic tone**: **B natural** appears in **G7** (I7) — but **no F#**, so **harmonic minor** is **not fully invoked** — just **tonic embellishment**
- **No major tonic** — **no G major chords**
- **VI (Eb)** and **VII (Bb, F)** are major — typical of **natural minor**

✅ Therefore, this is in:

> **G minor** — specifically **natural minor** with **chromatic inflection** (B natural in I7), but **mode is minor**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: G minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  
*(with brief chromatic use of B natural in a tonic dominant 7th chord — i.e., I7)*

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze the progression:

```
Gm  Gm  Eb/G  Eb/G  Gm  Gm  Bb/F  Bm(b5)/G  
Gm  Gm  Eb/G  Eb/G  Gm  Gm  F6   Gm
```

### Step 1. Identify the pitch collection

The chords used are:
- G minor (G–Bb–D)
- Eb/G (Eb–G–Bb)
- Bb/F (Bb–D–F)
- Bm(b5)/G (B–D–F)
- F6 (F–A–C–D)

### Step 2. Possible keys

The repeated tonic-like use of **Gm** strongly suggests **G as the tonal center**.

Let’s evaluate possible modes/scales containing the used chords.

| Chord | Fit in G natural minor (G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F)? | Fit in G harmonic minor (G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F#)? | Fit in G Dorian (G–A–Bb–C–D–E–F)? |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Gm | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Eb | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bb | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| F | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bm(b5) (B–D–F) | ✗ (B not in scale) | ✗ (B not in scale) | ✗ (B not in scale) |
| F6 (F–A–C–D) | A and C fine in all modes | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

The **Bm(b5)** chord introduces **B natural**, which is not part of G natural or harmonic minor, but it could serve as a **chromatic passing chord** between Bb and Gm (since it shares G and D with Gm).

### Step 3. Functional interpretation

- **Gm** acts as tonic (i).
- **Eb/G** (same notes as Eb major) can serve as a **VI** chord in G minor.
- **Bb/F** (Bb major first inversion) functions as **III**.
- **F6** (essentially F major with an added 6 = D) could act as **VII** in G minor or a subdominant color chord leading to tonic.
- **Bm(b5)/G** is likely a coloristic, chromatic bass-support chord based on shared tones, not diatonic.

### Step 4. Tonal center and mode

- The consistent **Gm** tonic and presence of **Eb**, **Bb**, and **F** (without F#) all align with **G natural minor** (same as **G Aeolian**).
- The rare appearance of **B natural** seems chromatic, not modal.

✅ **Key: G minor**  
✅ **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**

Chromatic color: the **Bm(b5)** chord is a borrowed or passing chord outside the mode.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

Hmm, this is a chord progression analysis request. The user provided a sequence of chords and wants to know the key and mode. 

First, I need to identify the most likely tonal center by looking at recurring chords and resolutions. Gm appears frequently and feels like the home chord. The progression starts and ends on Gm, which strongly suggests it's the tonic. 

Next, I should check the scale degrees to confirm the mode. The presence of Eb and Bb points to G natural minor (Aeolian) rather than Dorian since there's no F#. The Bm(b5) is just a passing chord that doesn't affect the overall key. 

The F6 chord creates a nice modal interchange moment but doesn't change the fundamental key. I'll explain this while keeping the analysis clear and educational, showing how each chord functions in the progression.

Of course. Let's break this chord progression down.

### Summary

*   **Key:** **G Minor**
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian (Natural Minor)**

---

### Detailed Analysis

Here is the progression written more clearly:

1.  Gm
2.  Gm
3.  Eb/G
4.  Eb/G
5.  Gm
6.  Gm
7.  Bb/F
8.  Bm(b5)/G
9.  Gm
10. Gm
11. Eb/G
12. Eb/G
13. Gm
14. Gm
15. F6
16. Gm

#### Step 1: Finding the Tonal Center (The "Home" Chord)

The chord **Gm** is overwhelmingly the most frequent chord. It starts the progression, ends the progression, and appears repeatedly throughout. This is the strongest possible indicator that **Gm is the tonic**, the central "home" chord of the piece.

#### Step 2: Determining the Mode (Major or Minor?)

Since the tonic is Gm, we are in a **G Minor** key. Now we need to figure out which type of minor scale is being used. The most common are:
*   **Natural Minor (Aeolian):** G A Bb C D Eb F G
*   **Harmonic Minor:** G A Bb C D Eb F# G
*   **Dorian:** G A Bb C D E F G

Let's look at the other chords in the progression:

*   **Eb Major (Eb/G):** The notes in an Eb chord are **Eb, G, Bb**. The Eb is the key clue here. In the key of G Natural Minor, the VI chord is Eb Major. In G Harmonic Minor, the VI chord would be an augmented chord (Eb+ or Ebaug), which this is not. The presence of a plain, consonant Eb Major chord strongly points to **G Natural Minor**.
*   **Bb Major (Bb/F):** The notes are **Bb, D, F**. In G Natural Minor, the V chord is Bb Major. (In a traditional minor key, the V chord is often made major, like D Major, to create a stronger pull back to the tonic, but that is not the case here).
*   **B Diminished (Bm(b5)/G):** This is a B diminished chord over a G bass. The notes are **B, D, F, (G)**. A B diminished triad (B, D, F) is the **vii° chord** in the key of C Major. However, in this context, it's functioning as a passing chord. The G in the bass makes it feel like a slight variation or tension on the Gm chord itself. It doesn't contradict the G minor key; it just adds color.
*   **F6:** The notes are **F, A, C, D**. This is a very interesting chord. The F is the **bVII** chord in the key of G Minor. The 6 (D) adds a sweet, open sound. The presence of a major chord on the flattened 7th scale degree (F Major) is extremely common in rock, pop, and folk music that uses the Aeolian mode. This is another very strong indicator that we are in **G Aeolian/Natural Minor** and not the classical Harmonic Minor scale.

#### Conclusion

The entire progression is built from chords that exist diatonically (naturally) within the **G Natural Minor scale (G Aeolian mode)**:

*   **i chord:** Gm
*   **VI chord:** Eb
*   **v chord:** Bb (It's major, not minor, which is a feature of Aeolian)
*   **bVII chord:** F

The Bm(b5)/G is the only non-diatonic chord, and as a passing chord with the tonic G in the bass, it doesn't challenge the established key.

Therefore, the key is unequivocally **G Minor**, and the specific flavor of minor being used is the **Aeolian mode**.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step-by-step.

---

**1. Write out the chords clearly**

The progression is:

Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – Bb/F – Bm(b5)/G – Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – F6 – Gm

---

**2. Identify the bass line**

- Gm = G bass  
- Eb/G = G bass  
- Bb/F = F bass  
- Bm(b5)/G = G bass  
- F6 = F bass

So bass line is mostly G, with some F.

---

**3. Look at the chord functions in a possible key**

**Option 1: Key of Gm (G natural minor / G Aeolian)**

- Gm = i  
- Eb/G = Eb major (VI chord) in first inversion — in G minor, Eb is bVI  
- Bb/F = Bb major (IV chord) in first inversion — in G minor, Bb is bIII  
- Bm(b5)/G = B–D–F over G bass — B–D–F is B diminished triad (Bdim), which is the ii° chord in A harmonic minor, but here it’s in G minor? Let’s check: in G natural minor: A–C–Eb is ii°, but B–D–F is not in G natural minor. B–D–F is actually the vii° of C minor. But here it’s B–D–F with G in bass — so it’s G–B–D–F = Gm(maj7) if B is included? Wait, Bm(b5) means B–D–F, that’s B diminished triad. Over G bass: notes G–B–D–F — that’s Gm(maj7) indeed. So maybe the chord symbol “Bm(b5)/G” is misleading — it’s really Gm(maj7), which implies G harmonic minor.

- F6 = F–A–C–D — in G minor, F is bVII, F6 adds D which is the 5th of Gm.

---

**4. Check for G minor vs G Dorian**

G natural minor: Gm, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F  
G Dorian: Gm, Bb, C, Dm, Eb, F, Am(b5) — difference is C major instead of Cm.

Here we see Bb and Eb, both from natural minor and Dorian.  
But Bm(b5)/G (G–B–D–F) has B natural, not Bb. That’s the leading tone in G harmonic minor. So it’s not pure Aeolian or Dorian — it’s G minor with a major V chord implied? Actually, no V chord (D major) appears, but the B natural appears in Gm(maj7) chord.

So the mode is **G minor (Aeolian) with occasional harmonic minor inflection** (B natural), not Dorian (which would have C major, not here).

---

**5. F6 in G minor**

F6 = F A C D — D is the 5th of G minor, so it’s a bVII6 chord, common in minor key pop.

---

**6. Conclusion**

Key: **G minor**  
Mode: **Mostly Aeolian (natural minor)** but with a harmonic minor color via the Gm(maj7) chord (Bm(b5)/G).

---

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{G \ \text{minor}}
\]  
Mode: G Aeolian with harmonic minor inflection.

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**
    *   **Input:** A sequence of chords: `Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm`
    *   **Task:** Determine the key and mode.

2.  **Initial Analysis & Simplification:**
    *   The chords are repeated. Let's list the unique chords to make it easier to see the harmonic palette.
        *   `Gm`
        *   `Eb/G`
        *   `Bb/F`
        *   `Bm(b5)/G`
        *   `F6`
    *   The slash chords are important. Let's break them down:
        *   `Eb/G`: This is an Eb major triad (Eb - G - Bb) with a G in the bass. The G is the root of our main chord, `Gm`. So, this is essentially an `Gm7` with the 7th (F) replaced by the 9th (A) and the 3rd (Bb) in the bass? No, wait. Let's look at the notes: Eb - G - Bb over a G bass. The notes are G, Bb, Eb. This is a G minor 7th flat 5 (Gm7b5) *without* the 5th (D). It's also a G Phrygian chord (b2, b3, b6, b7 from the perspective of G major). But let's stick to the simplest interpretation: it's an Eb major chord over G. How does that function? It's the `bVI` chord of G minor. The bass note G makes it a first inversion `bVI` chord. This strongly points to G minor.
        *   `Bb/F`: This is a Bb major triad (Bb - D - F) with an F in the bass. F is the fifth of the Bb triad, so this is Bb major in second inversion. In the key of G minor, Bb major is the `III` chord (the relative major). So, we have a `III` chord.
        *   `Bm(b5)/G`: This is a B diminished triad (B - D - F) with a G in the bass. The notes are G, B, D, F. This is `Gm7b5` in full. In the key of G minor, this is the `iiø7` chord. This is a very strong indicator of the key.
        *   `F6`: This is an F major triad (F - A - C) with an added 6th (D). In G minor, F is the `VII` chord. The `VII` chord in minor is a major chord built on the leading tone *down* a half step (the subtonic). This is very common in rock, pop, and jazz-influenced music.

3.  **Synthesize and Build a Key Center Hypothesis:**

    *   **Primary Hypothesis: G Minor.**
    *   Let's check the chords against the G natural minor scale (G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F).
        *   `Gm`: `i` chord. Perfect fit.
        *   `Eb/G`: `Eb` is the `bVI` chord. Putting it in the bass (first inversion) creates a nice chromatic bass line or just a richer sonority. Strong fit.
        *   `Bb/F`: `Bb` is the `III` chord. Second inversion. Fit.
        *   `Bm(b5)/G`: This is `Gm7b5`. The notes (G-Bb-Db-F) are not all in G natural minor. The `Db` is not in the key. Let's re-examine this chord. `Bm(b5)` is B - D - F. Over a G bass, the notes are G, B, D, F. Ah, I misidentified this earlier. G, B, D, F is a `G7` chord. Wait, no. G7 is G-B-D-F. Yes, it is. So `Bm(b5)/G` is a `G7` chord. `G7` is the dominant 7th chord (`V7`) in the key of C minor, but it's a *secondary dominant* in G minor, leading to C minor (`iv`). Or, it could be a tritone substitution for `Db7` leading to Cm. But let's look at the context. It *doesn't* resolve to Cm. It resolves back to `Gm`. This is a common "backdoor" or "flat-five" resolution. A `G7` resolving to `Gm` is a bit unusual as a primary dominant, but it's a very common sound in jazz and blues, functioning as a `V7/VII` (leading to the F chord, the `VII`) or just a chromatic embellishment of the `i` chord. Let's hold this thought. It's a chromatic chord.
        *   `F6`: `F` is the `VII` chord (subtonic) in G natural minor. `F6` is a common voicing. Strong fit.

4.  **Re-evaluating the `Bm(b5)/G` chord:**
    *   Let's go back to the notes: G, B, D, F. This is a `G7` chord.
    *   In the key of G minor, the diatonic dominant is `D7` (using the harmonic minor: G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F#). We don't have any D or D7 chords.
    *   The progression is heavily centered on `Gm` and uses chords from G natural minor (`Gm`, `Eb`, `Bb`, `F`).
    *   The presence of `F` (the natural 7th) and `Eb` (the minor 6th) strongly points away from G harmonic or melodic minor and towards G natural minor.
    *   The `G7` chord is the chromatic outlier. It introduces an F-natural (which is already in the key) and a B-natural. The B-natural is the leading tone to C. But it doesn't resolve to C. It resolves to Gm. This is a classic "blues" or "rock" inflection. The major third (B) clashes with the minor third (Bb) of the `Gm` chord it resolves to. This is a hallmark of the **Dorian mode**.

5.  **Testing the Dorian Mode Hypothesis:**

    *   Let's test the chords against G Dorian (G - A - Bb - C - D - E - F).
    *   The characteristic note of Dorian is the major 6th (E).
    *   Let's look at our chords again: `Gm`, `Eb/G`, `Bb/F`, `Bm(b5)/G` (G7), `F6`.
    *   Do any of these chords contain the note E?
        *   `Gm`: G, Bb, D. No E.
        *   `Eb/G`: Eb, G, Bb. No E.
        *   `Bb/F`: Bb, D, F. No E.
        *   `G7` (from Bm(b5)/G): G, B, D, F. No E.
        *   `F6`: F, A, C, D. No E.
    *   Hmm. The Dorian characteristic note (E) is absent from all the chords. This makes a pure Dorian interpretation less likely.

6.  **Refining the Natural Minor Hypothesis:**

    *   Let's go back to G Natural Minor. The chords are `i` (`Gm`), `bVI` (`Eb/G`), `III` (`Bb/F`), a chromatic `G7`, and `VII` (`F6`).
    *   This is a very common set of chords in minor key progressions, especially in styles influenced by rock, pop, and film music.
    *   The `i - bVII` cadence (`Gm` to `F`) is extremely common and is a defining feature of the "minor key rock" sound. It's derived from the natural minor scale.
    *   The `i - bVI` (`Gm` to `Eb`) is also a very common and powerful minor key progression.
    *   The chromatic `G7` chord (with its B natural) is a very common "flavor" added to these progressions. It provides a strong dominant pull, even if it resolves deceptively back to the tonic. This is often called a "secondary dominant to the subtonic" (`V7/ VII`), because `G7` is the dominant of `C7`, which is the tritone substitute of `F#7`, which is the dominant of `Bm`... this is getting too complicated. Let's simplify. It's a dominant-sounding chord that adds color and tension before resolving back to the minor tonic. The clash between the major 3rd (B) of the G7 and the minor 3rd (Bb) of the Gm is the key sound.

7.  **Final Conclusion Formulation:**

    *   The **key** is unequivocally **G minor**. The harmonic center is Gm, and the vast majority of the chords are diatonic to the G natural minor scale.
    *   The **mode** is the more nuanced part.
        *   It's not purely G Dorian because the characteristic major 6th (E) is nowhere to be found.
        *   It's not purely G natural minor because of the chromatic `G7` chord (`Bm(b5)/G`). The `G7` introduces a major third (B natural) that is not in the natural minor scale.
        *   It's certainly not G harmonic or G melodic minor, as we have the natural 6th (Eb) and natural 7th (F) present, and the raised 7th (F#) is absent.
    *   Therefore, the best description is **G Natural Minor with chromaticism**.
    *   What kind of chromaticism? It's the use of a secondary dominant or a "blues-inflected" dominant chord (`G7`) that resolves deceptively to the tonic (`Gm`).
    *   So, the most accurate and helpful answer is to state the key is G Minor, and then explain *why* it's not a simple "mode." It's a minor key tonality that primarily uses chords from the natural minor scale but incorporates a very common chromatic chord (`G7`) for color and tension. This sound is heavily associated with genres like rock, pop, and film scores.

8.  **Structure the final answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **Key: G Minor**.
    *   Provide the "Why" by analyzing the chords.
    *   List the diatonic chords from G Natural Minor and show how they fit: `i` (Gm), `III` (Bb), `bVI` (Eb), `VII` (F). Note the inversions (`/G`, `/F`) and the extension (`6`).
    *   Address the "outlier" chord: `Bm(b5)/G`, explaining that it's a `G7` chord.
    *   Discuss the mode. Explain why it's primarily **G Natural Minor**.
    *   Explain why it's *not* Dorian (no E).
    *   Explain why it's *not* harmonic/melodic minor (has F and Eb, no F#).
    *   Conclude with the most precise description: **G Natural Minor with chromaticism**, specifically the use of a chromatic `G7` chord. Mention the stylistic implications (rock/pop/film sound).
    *   Provide a simple summary for clarity.


Excellent chord progression! Let's break it down.

### The Answer

**Key:** G Minor
**Mode:** Primarily **G Natural Minor** with strong chromaticism.

---

### Analysis

Here is a step-by-step look at why this is the case.

#### 1. The Home Chord

The progression starts and ends on **Gm**, and it's the most frequently occurring chord. This immediately establishes G minor as the tonic and home base.

#### 2. The Diatonic Chords

Let's see which chords fit perfectly into the **G natural minor scale** (G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F).

*   **Gm:** This is the **i** chord (the tonic). Perfect fit.
*   **Eb/G:** This is an Eb major chord with G in the bass. In G minor, Eb is the **bVI** chord. This is a very common and powerful chord in minor keys.
*   **Bb/F:** This is a Bb major chord with F in the bass. In G minor, Bb is the **III** chord (the relative major).
*   **F6:** This is an F major 6th chord. In G minor, F is the **VII** chord (the subtonic). The `i - bVII` (Gm to F) movement is a hallmark of rock, pop, and film music and is derived directly from the natural minor scale.

So, the bulk of your progression (`Gm`, `Eb`, `Bb`, `F`) is built from the foundation of the G natural minor scale.

#### 3. The Chromatic Chord

Now for the interesting one: **Bm(b5)/G**.

Let's look at the notes involved:
*   **Bm(b5)** is B - D - F.
*   With a **G** in the bass, the full set of notes is **G - B - D - F**.

That collection of notes spells a **G7** chord.

The G7 chord is the one chromatic element in this progression. The note B (the major third) is not in the G natural minor scale. This chord is used as a "color" chord. It creates a strong dominant tension that resolves deceptively (but effectively) back to the Gm tonic. This type of chord borrowing is extremely common and gives the progression a sophisticated, slightly "bluesy" or jazz-inflected feel.

#### 4. Why Not Other Modes?

*   **G Dorian?** The characteristic note of Dorian is the major 6th (E). None of the chords in your progression contain an E. Therefore, it's not Dorian.
*   **G Harmonic Minor?** This would require a raised 7th degree (F#), which would lead to a D major or D7 chord. Your progression uses F natural and has no D chords.
*   **G Melodic Minor?** This would require both a raised 6th (E) and a raised 7th (F#), neither of which are present in the harmony.

### Conclusion

Your progression is firmly rooted in **G minor**. It primarily uses the rich palette of chords from the **G natural minor scale**, giving it a modern, open sound. The single chromatic **G7** chord (voiced as Bm(b5)/G) is a common and effective way to add tension and color before returning to the tonic.
