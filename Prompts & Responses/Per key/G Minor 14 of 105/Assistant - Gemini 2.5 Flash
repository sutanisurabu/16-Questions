The provided chord progression is:

**Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm**

To determine the key and mode, we first look for the most frequently occurring and structurally important chords, particularly the tonic (I) chord.

1.  **Dominant Chord:** The `F6` chord (F-A-C-D) or simply `F` chord serves as the dominant chord, strongly pulling towards G. The `F` major chord is the $\text{VII}$ chord in the $\text{G}$ natural minor scale. Since we don't have a $\text{D}$ major (V) chord, this structure suggests a mode or scale that uses a minor dominant.

2.  **Tonic Chord:** The `Gm` chord starts and ends the progression and is the most frequently occurring chord, establishing **G** as the tonal center. This immediately suggests a minor key system (G minor).

3.  **Progression Analysis:**
    *   $\text{Gm}$ (i)
    *   $\text{Eb/G}$ (IV or iv/major IV depending on mode used) - $\text{Eb}$ major is the $\text{bVI}$ chord in $\text{G}$ minor.
    *   $\text{Bb/F}$ ($\text{Bb}$ Major) - $\text{Bb}$ major is the $\text{bIII}$ chord in $\text{G}$ natural minor.
    *   $\text{Bm(b5)/G}$ (This chord is unusual in a simple minor key. $\text{Bmb5}$ is B-D-F. When inverted with $\text{G}$ in the bass, it functions structurally similar to a $\text{G}$ minor chord with added tension, or perhaps more locally, as a passing chord.)
    *   $\text{F6}$ ($\text{F}$ major) - $\text{F}$ major is the $\text{bVII}$ chord in $\text{G}$ minor.

4.  **Diatonic Chords in G Minor Modes:**

    *   **G Natural Minor (Aeolian):** $\text{Gm}$ (i), $\text{Adim}$ (ii°), $\text{Bb}$ (bIII), $\text{Cm}$ (iv), $\text{Dm}$ (v), $\text{Eb}$ (bVI), $\text{F}$ (bVII).
    *   **G Harmonic Minor:** $\text{Gm}$ (i), $\text{Adim}$ (ii°), $\text{Bbaug}$ (bIII+), $\text{Cm}$ (iv), $\text{D}$ (V), $\text{Eb}$ (bVI), $\text{F#dim}$ (vii°).
    *   **G Melodic Minor:** $\text{Gm}$ (i), $\text{Am}$ (ii), $\text{Bbaug}$ (bIII+), $\text{C}$ (IV), $\text{D}$ (V), $\text{Edim}$ (vi°), $\text{F#dim}$ (vii°).

**Conclusion:**

The progression exclusively uses the chords $\text{Gm}$ (i), $\text{Bb}$ (bIII), $\text{Eb}$ (bVI), and $\text{F}$ (bVII). All these chords are the diatonic chords of the **G Natural Minor Scale** (G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F).

The use of the $\text{F}$ major chord ($\text{bVII}$) instead of the $\text{D}$ major chord (V) is the defining characteristic that separates the Natural Minor (Aeolian Mode) from Harmonic or Melodic Minor, where the Dominant is often raised.

Therefore, the key and mode are:

**Key and Mode:** **G Aeolian Mode (or G Natural Minor)**
