### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to analyze the chord progression: "Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm." The slashes indicate inversions, so Eb/G means an Eb major chord over G, and Bb/F means Bb major over F. Bm(b5)/G suggests a half-diminished chord over G, which translates to B-D-F over G bass. With all these G minor chords, it confirms the tonic is G minor, and Eb/G seems to be in second inversion.**Clarifying chord functions**

Actually, Eb/G means G in the bass. The chord consists of the notes Eb-G-Bb, where G is the root. In relation to G, this gives a minor third (Bb) and a flat sixth (Eb). It's not the same as Gm7, since Gm is G-Bb-D and Eb/G lacks the D. This chord could serve as the VI in G natural minor or possibly be interpreted as IV in Bb major over the third. Bb/F is a first inversion with F in the bass, indicating a second inversion context, which may link to an interesting Gm6 idea.**Exploring chord functions in G minor**

In G natural minor, the VII chord is F major (F-A-C), but Bb/F doesn’t fit as its IV. I should consider whether we're looking at G Dorian versus Aeolian. The presence of E natural could differ from Eb, especially since I noticed it in the Eb/G chord. The F6 chord (F-A-C-D) is interesting too—it contains A natural. The key difference between Aeolian and Dorian is the sixth: Aeolian has Eb while Dorian has E natural. So, we lean toward Aeolian since we've got a strong Eb.**Determining the key and mode**

So, Bb/F includes D natural as the third of Bb, which is the fifth of G. But I’m not seeing any E natural chords, so it looks like we're in G Aeolian, or natural minor. There’s a chance it could align with Bb major's key signature, where Gm is the vi chord. The Eb/G chord is in first inversion, indicating it’s functioning as the IV chord. Tonic seems to be repeated Gm, solidifying G minor as the tonal center. So, we're sticking with G minor (Aeolian), not harmonic minor since there’s no leading tone.**Analyzing chord relationships**

The Bm(b5) chord uses B natural, which is curious since B natural is the major third of G. In G minor, the third should be Bb, so B natural suggests we might be leaning towards G harmonic or melodic minor. B natural relates to a G7 chord but lacks the fifth; combined with bass G, it reconstructs to form a G7 without an explicit fifth. This points to G minor overall, suggesting modal mixture or a raised third. The Bdim/G also introduces a tonal center still rooted in G minor, indicating an Aeolian quality with some borrowed dominant chords.**Summarizing key and mode**

The key is G minor, and the mode is Aeolian, with occasional Mixolydian inflections. In music theory terms, it refers to G natural minor, confirming its signature with two flats. The relevant chords include Gm (tonic), Eb/G (VI6, first inversion), and Bb/F (III6, second inversion). The Bdim/G function creates a tonic dominant feel, indicating I7, and contributes to G minor's overall color. Thus, I'd summarize: G minor (natural minor/Aeolian) with a mix of Mixolydian elements. 

- Tonic: G  
- Key: G minor  
- Mode: Aeolian  
- Evidence: Gm prevalence; Eb (b6); F natural (b7); cadences via bVII to i; occasional G7.

G minor, Aeolian (natural minor).

Why:
- Strong tonic on Gm and final cadence F6 → Gm (bVII → i), typical of Aeolian.
- Presence of Eb (b6) and F natural (b7); no E natural or F# (so not Dorian or harmonic/melodic minor).
- The Bm(b5)/G moment spells G–B–D–F (G7), a brief Mixolydian/borrowed color over the tonic, but the tonal center remains G minor (Aeolian).
