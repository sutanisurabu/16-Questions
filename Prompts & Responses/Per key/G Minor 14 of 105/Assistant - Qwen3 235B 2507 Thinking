### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me this chord progression: Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm. They want me to figure out the key and mode. Let me start by understanding what each chord is.

First, I'll break down the chords. Gm is G minor, Eb/G is E-flat major with G as the bass note, so that's a first inversion. Bb/F is B-flat major with F in the bass, another first inversion. Bm(b5)/G is B half-diminished with G in the bass—it's a Bø7 chord. F6 is F major with an added sixth, so A is in there.

Now, looking at the progression, it starts and ends on Gm. That makes me think G is the tonic. The chords repeat a bit: Gm appears a lot, Eb/G shows up, then Bb/F, Bø7/G, and F6. I should spell out all the notes to see the key signature.

G minor has two common forms: natural, harmonic, or melodic. Natural minor has a flat sixth and seventh, harmonic has a raised seventh, melodic has both raised. But chord progressions often mix these. Let me list all the notes from the chords.

Gm: G, Bb, D
Eb/G: G, Eb, G, Bb—so the notes are G, Eb, Bb
Bb/F: F, Bb, D—notes F, Bb, D
Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F? Wait, Bm(b5) is B, D, F, and A for half-diminished seventh? Bm(b5) usually implies B half-diminished, so B, D, F, A. With G bass, so notes G, B, D, F, A? Wait, no—the slash means G is the bass, but the chord is Bm(b5), so the notes of the chord are B, D, F, A, but played over G. So overall notes: G, B, D, F, A.

F6: F, A, C, D

Now, collecting all unique notes: G, Bb, D from Gm; Eb from Eb/G; F from Bb/F; A from Bø7/G and F6; C from F6. So the notes are G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. That's seven notes: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F.

What key has these notes? G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Exactly. So the key is G minor. But let me confirm if there are any accidentals or if it's a mode.

In natural minor, the chords are built on the notes. Let's map the progression to the G natural minor scale degrees.

Gm is i
Eb/G—Eb major is the VI chord in G minor. Eb major: Eb, G, Bb. Yes, so VI in first inversion.

Bb/F—Bb major is IV in G minor. Bb, D, F. So IV in first inversion.

Bm(b5)/G—which is B half-diminished. In G minor, the second degree is A, so chord on B would be... wait, in natural minor, the scale is G A Bb C D Eb F. So the ii chord is A diminished (A, C, Eb). But here we have Bm(b5), which is on B. B is not in the scale? Wait, Bb is in the scale, but B natural is not. Hmm, this is confusing.

Hold on, Bm(b5)/G. The chord is spelled as B, D, F, A? But in G natural minor, the notes don't have B natural; they have Bb. So B natural is a raised leading tone? But in natural minor, the seventh is minor, so F is the seventh, not F#. So B natural would be chromatic.

Wait, maybe it's G harmonic minor? G harmonic minor has G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#. But the progression has F6, which is F, A, C, D—so F natural, not F#. So it can't be harmonic minor.

F6 chord: F, A, C, D. So F natural is present, which is the minor seventh in G natural minor. G natural minor has F natural, G harmonic minor has F#.

So the presence of F natural (in Bb/F, F6) and absence of F# suggests natural minor. But then what about Bm(b5)/G? Bm(b5) implies B, D, F—so B natural, D, F. But in G natural minor, the second scale degree is A, so chord on B isn't diatonic. Unless... wait, maybe it's a borrowed chord or something.

Let me think again. The chord is labeled as Bm(b5)/G. So the root is B, with minor third (D), diminished fifth (F), and probably seventh (A), making it B half-diminished. So notes: B, D, F, A. But in G natural minor, the notes are G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So A is present (6th degree), Bb is present (7th? Wait no: degrees in G natural minor: 1=G, 2=A, 3=Bb, 4=C, 5=D, 6=Eb, 7=F.

So scale: G (1), A (2), Bb (3), C (4), D (5), Eb (6), F (7).

So chord on the second degree: A diminished (ii°): A, C, Eb.

Chord on the seventh degree: F major (VII): F, A, C.

But here we have a chord rooted on B. B natural, not Bb. B natural is not in the G natural minor scale—it would be the major third if it were, but it's a chromatic note.

So B natural is a raised third? In minor keys, sometimes the third is raised for certain chords, but here the chord is Bm(b5), which has B natural as root.

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant or substitution. Let's see the progression: ...Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm...

So after Bb/F (which is IV), it goes to Bm(b5)/G, then to Gm. Bm(b5)/G to Gm—that looks like a iiø7 to i progression, but in minor keys. Wait, in minor, the ii chord is diminished (whole-half scale), so ii° is A°: A, C, Eb. But here it's Bm(b5), which is B, D, F, A—so that's the iiø7 chord but a half-step higher? No.

Wait, Bm(b5)/G: the bass is G, so maybe it's functioning as a dominant? Bm(b5) is E7 without the G#? Not sure.

Another approach: look at the entire progression pattern. The sequence is:

Gm (x2) | Eb/G (x2) | Gm (x2) | Bb/F | Bm(b5)/G | Gm (x2) | Eb/G (x2) | Gm (x2) | F6 | Gm

Notice the Eb/G appears twice in a row, and Gm multiples. The move from Bb/F to Bm(b5)/G to Gm is interesting.

Bb/F is Fsus4? Bb major in first inversion is F in bass, so F, Bb, D. Which is like a suspended chord if resolving, but not sure.

Bm(b5)/G: notes G, B, D, F (assuming no seventh, but likely has A). If we consider it as a iiø7 in A minor, but we're in G minor.

Wait, G minor key: the relative major is Bb major. Chords in Bb: I=Bb, ii=Cm, iii=Dm, IV=Eb, V=F, vi=Gm, vii°=A°.

But our tonic is Gm, so vi in Bb major.

The progression has Gm (vi), Eb (IV in Bb, but VI in G minor), Bb (I in Bb, but IV in G minor), F (V in Bb, but VII in G minor), and then Bm(b5) which is not diatonic.

Bm(b5) in the context of G minor: the notes B, D, F, A—as I said. If we think of this as a secondary chord, maybe it's a iiø7/V or something. But V of G minor would be D major or D7 (harmonic minor), but here it's G minor natural.

Another idea: the Bm(b5)/G might be functioning as a German augmented sixth chord. In G minor, the German +6 would be Ab, C, Eb, F#, which resolves to D or D7. But here it's B, D, F, A—doesn't look like that.

Wait, spelling: Bm(b5) is B, D, F. With the bass G, and likely the A (since it's half-diminished), so notes G, A, B, D, F. Sorting: A, B, D, F, G.

A to B is whole step, B to D is minor third? Not sure. Maybe it's a G13sus4 or something? G, C, D, F, A—but here it's Bm(b5)/G, so root is B.

Perhaps mislabeled? Bm(b5)/G—sometimes slash chords can be misinterpreted. Maybe it's G7b9? G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab. But here it's Bm(b5), which is B, D, F, and with /G bass... unless the Bm(b5) is a typo.

Wait, another angle: the progression seems to have a lot of Gm, Eb, Bb, F. Eb is bVI, Bb is IV, F is bVII in G minor. That's common in blues or rock progressions, like the "minor blues" progression: i - bVI - iv - v or something.

But here we have Eb/G (bVI first inversion), Bb/F (IV first inversion), then Bm(b5)/G.

Wait, Bb/F is the same as Fsus4? F, Bb, D. Fsus4 would be F, Bb, C—no, Bb, D, F is F major? Wait, F major is F, A, C. Bb major is Bb, D, F. So Bb/F is Bb major in first inversion: F, Bb, D. So it's a Bb chord with F in bass.

Similarly, Eb/G is Eb major with G in bass: G, Eb, Bb.

Now, the chord Bm(b5)/G: if it's B half-diminished with G bass, notes G, B, D, F, A.

In the key of G minor, the diatonic seventh chords are:

i: Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)
ii°: Adim7 (A, C, Eb, G)
III: BbMaj7 (Bb, D, F, A)
iv: Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)
v: Dm7 (D, F, A, C) — in natural minor, not Dm7b5 like harmonic
VI: EbMaj7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)
VII: F7 (F, A, C, Eb)

So standard chords in G natural minor.

Now, Bm(b5) is not diatonic. But Bm(b5) as a half-diminished seventh would be B, D, F, A. Which is actually the ii chord in A minor or the vii° in C major. Not fitting.

Wait, what if the Bm(b5) is a mislabeling for Am7b5? That would make sense. Am7b5 is A, C, Eb, G—which is ii°7 in G minor. And if it's written as Bm(b5)/G, maybe it's a typo. Because Bm(b5) with G bass doesn't fit, but Am7b5 with G bass is G, A, C, Eb—which is Am7b5 in third inversion (G as bass, so 7 in bass).

That would make more sense! Because in chord symbols, sometimes the bass note is written separately. So if it's Am7b5/G, it would be A half-diminished with G in the bass, which is standard as the iiø7 chord in minor keys resolving to i.

Given that the progression goes to Gm after Bm(b5)/G, and Am7b5/G to Gm is a common cadence (iiø7 - i), it's very likely that "Bm(b5)/G" is a typo or mislabeling for Am7b5/G.

Assuming that correction:

Original progression: ... Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm ...

Becomes: Bb/F Am7b5/G Gm

Now, Bb/F is IV (Bb major) in first inversion, Am7b5/G is iiø7 in third inversion, resolving to i (Gm). Perfectly standard.

The other chords: Eb/G is VI (Eb major) in first inversion, which is common in minor (e.g., "Andalusian cadence": i - bVII - VI - V, but here it's i - VI - i often).

F6 chord: F6 is F, A, C, D. In G minor, F is the bVII degree. F6 would be bVII6, which adds the sixth (D), making it a common extension.

So with the correction, the chords are all diatonic to G natural minor:

- Gm: i
- Eb/G: VI in first inversion
- Bb/F: IV in first inversion
- Am7b5/G: iiø7 in third inversion (assuming typo)
- F6: bVII6

Now confirming the notes:

G natural minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

- i: Gm7 = G, Bb, D, F
- VI: EbMaj7 = Eb, G, Bb, D → Eb/G uses G, Eb, Bb
- IV: BbMaj7 = Bb, D, F, A → Bb/F uses F, Bb, D
- iiø7: Am7b5 = A, C, Eb, G → Am7b5/G uses G, A, C, Eb
- bVII: F6 = F, A, C, D (F major triad with 6th added)

All these chords use only notes from G natural minor. The F6 chord has D natural, which is in the scale (degree 5), so no issue.

The progression makes sense: it starts with i - VI - i, then moves to IV - iiø7 - i, and later revisits VI and ends on i with bVII6 - i, which is a common minor key ending (like in "House of the Rising Sun").

Without the assumed typo, Bm(b5) would require B natural, which isn't in G natural minor. Since F natural is present (F6), it can't be harmonic minor (which has F#), so the only logical conclusion is a labeling error for Am7b5/G.

Therefore, the key is G minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian).

User might have misread or mistyped "Am(b5)" as "Bm(b5)". Given music often has such errors, especially with slash chords.

Based on the chord progression you provided (**Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm**), I've analyzed the harmony, chord functions, and scale compatibility. **The key is G minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian)**. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Tonic (Home Chord)**
- The progression **starts and ends on Gm** (G minor), with Gm appearing **8 times**—more than any other chord (e.g., Eb/G appears 4 times, and Bb/F/F6 appear once each).
- Cadences like **Bb/F → Bm(b5)/G → Gm** (a common minor-key resolution) and **F6 → Gm** (a classic minor cadence) strongly imply **Gm is the tonic chord**.
- **Conclusion**: G is the tonal center. The key is in **G minor**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Mode (Natural, Harmonic, or Melodic Minor?)**
To find the mode, we need to see which G minor scale fits **all chords without chromatic alteration**. Let's test each:

| Mode          | Scale Degrees (G-based)      | Critical Test Point (F vs. F♯) | Compatible? |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **Natural Minor (Aeolian)** | G A B♭ C D E♭ F              | F natural                      | ✅ Yes       |
| Harmonic Minor | G A B♭ C D E♭ F**♯**         | F**♯** (but F6 chord has F natural) | ❌ No        |
| Melodic Minor  | G A B♭ C D E♮ F♯ (ascending) | F**♯** (mismatch with F6)      | ❌ No        |

**Why natural minor?**
- **F natural** is used in:
  - **Bb/F** (B♭ major with F in bass: F-B♭-D),
  - **F6** (F-A-C-D, a major triad with added 6th),
  - The **implied root of Gm** (G-B♭-D, which has no F♯).
- Natural minor is the **only minor mode with F natural** (harmonic/melodic minor use F♯).
- **No accidentals** (like F♯ or B♮) appear elsewhere, ruling out harmonic/melodic minor.

---

### **Step 3: Decode Chord Functions in G Natural Minor**
In **G natural minor (Aeolian)**, the scale degrees are:  
`G (1) - A (2) - B♭ (3) - C (4) - D (5) - E♭ (6) - F (7)`.  

All chords fit diatonically (no notes outside the scale):
- **Gm** (i): Tonic chord. Notes: G-B♭-D.
- **Eb/G** (♭VI): Submediant chord in 1st inversion (G-E♭-B♭). Common in minor keys (e.g., "minor blues" progressions).
- **Bb/F** (IV): Subdominant chord in 1st inversion (F-B♭-D). A strong dominant function toward iiø7 → i.
- **Bm(b5)/G**: **This is likely a typo/mislabeling for Am7b5/G (iiø7)**.
  - Actual notation: `Bm(b5)/G` implies a B-root half-diminished chord (B-D-F-A) over G bass. **But B natural is not in G natural minor** (it has B♭).
  - **Correction**: `Am7b5/G` (A-C-E♭-G in 3rd inversion: G-A-C-E♭) **makes perfect sense**:
    - This is diatonic **iiø7** (half-diminished ii chord), a standard pre-tonic chord resolving to **i** (Gm).
    - Given the context (`Bb/F → [ ] → Gm`), `Am7b5/G` is the expected chord (common in minor cadences).
    - *Likely cause*: Miscounting from B♭ (e.g., labeling "Am" as "Bm" due to scale proximity).
- **F6** (♭VII6): Subtonic chord with added 6th (F-A-C-D). Common in folk/rock minor progressions (e.g., classic ending: ♭VII → i).

---

### **Step 4: Why This Progression Confirms G Natural Minor**
- **Harmonic Flow**:
  - `Gm → Eb/G → Gm`: i → ♭VI → i (emphasizes minor tonality; ♭VI is major only in natural minor).
  - `Bb/F → Am7b5/G → Gm`: IV → iiø7 → i (standard minor-key cadence).
  - Ends with `F6 → Gm`: ♭VII → i (iconic natural minor cadence, e.g., "House of the Rising Sun").
- **No Chromaticism**: All notes (G-A-B♭-C-D-E♭-F) are from **G natural minor**. No F♯ (harmonic minor) or E♮ (melodic minor) appears.
- **Mode Signature**: Natural minor is defined by:
  - Flat 3rd (B♭), flat 6th (E♭), **and flat 7th (F)**—all present.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
- **Key**: G minor  
- **Mode**: **Natural minor (Aeolian)**  
- **Why not harmonic/melodic?** F natural (in Bb/F and F6) contradicts harmonic/melodic minor's raised 7th (F♯).  
- **Critical Fix**: `Bm(b5)/G` is almost certainly a typo for **Am7b5/G** (the diatonic iiø7 chord). Without this correction, the progression would imply non-diatonic harmony (B natural), but **context confirms G natural minor**.

This is a textbook natural minor progression—common in rock, blues, and classical minor-key pieces (e.g., Pachelbel's "Musette in Gm"). If you encountered this in a song, it would sound introspective and unresolved (characteristic of Aeolian). 🎹
