Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**  
Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm

---

### Step 1: List the chords (ignoring bass notes for now, but note them where relevant)

We can simplify by looking at the **root motion** and **chord qualities**:

1. Gm (G minor)  
2. Gm  
3. Eb/G → **Eb major** with G in bass → this is **first inversion of Eb major**  
4. Eb/G  
5. Gm  
6. Gm  
7. Bm(b5)/G → **B diminished** with G in bass → B° = B-D-F, so B°/G = G-B-D-F → this is a **G7 (dominant 7th) chord**!  
   - Wait — let’s verify:  
     - Bm(b5) = B-D-F (B diminished triad)  
     - With G in the bass → G-B-D-F = **G7 chord** (G dominant 7th)  
     - So Bm(b5)/G = **G7**
8. Gm  
9. Gm  
10. Eb/G → Eb major / G  
11. Eb/G  
12. Gm  
13. Gm  
14. F6 → F major with 6th → F-A-C-D  
15. Gm

### Step 2: What’s the tonal center?

The progression starts and ends on **Gm**, and Gm appears **8 times** out of 15 chords. Extremely strong indicator that **G minor** is the tonal center.

But let’s look at the key signature implied by the chords.

### Step 3: Analyze chord function in **G minor**

G natural minor scale: G A Bb C D Eb F

Chords built on that scale:

- i: Gm  
- ii°: Am°  
- III: Bb  
- iv: Cm  
- v: Dm  
- VI: Eb  
- VII: F

So in G minor, the expected diatonic chords are:

- Gm, Am°, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F

Now compare to your progression:

- Gm → ✅ i  
- Eb → ✅ VI  
- F6 → ✅ VII (F major with added 6th = F6 = F-A-C-D — still functions as VII in G minor)  
- Bm(b5)/G → **G7** — this is **NOT** diatonic to G natural minor!

G7 = G-B-D-F  
But in G natural minor, the 7th degree is F natural, and the 3rd is Bb, **not B natural**.

→ So B natural appears here. That means we have a **chromatic alteration**.

G7 = G-B-D-F  
→ B natural = **raised 3rd** compared to G minor’s Bb.

So G7 is **not** diatonic to G natural minor. It’s an example of **harmonic minor** alteration.

In **G harmonic minor**, the scale is:  
**G A Bb C D Eb F#** ← wait, hold on.

Wait — G harmonic minor: **G A Bb C D Eb F#** — the 7th is raised to F# to create a leading tone to G.

BUT in our chord we have **G7 = G-B-D-F**

→ That’s **B natural** and **F natural**

But in G harmonic minor:

- 3rd = Bb  
- 7th = F#  

So G7 (G-B-D-F) has **B natural** (major 3rd) and **F natural** (minor 7th) — **this is not G harmonic minor**.

This is actually **G dominant 7th**, which is **NOT** native to G minor at all. So where does it come from?

---

### Step 4: Look at G7 as a secondary dominant

G7 is the **dominant of C**.

G7 → C would be V7/I in C major or C minor.

But we don’t have a C chord here.

Instead, after G7, we return to Gm.

So G7 → Gm. That’s a **dominant → tonic** relationship, but the **tonic** is minor.

That’s the classic **minor plagal cadence** or more specifically, **G7 → Gm** is a **minor mode mixture** or **borrowed dominant**.

Wait — but G7 to Gm is **not** a standard functional progression in traditional harmony.

G7 → Gm is a **non-diatonic, chromatic resolution**.

Another possibility: G7 is a **tritone substitution**? That would imply we’re going to C# or Db, not Gm.

No — not that.

Wait — let’s reconsider: **Bm(b5)/G = G7**, and it's followed by Gm.

That’s **G7 → Gm** — a **deceptive resolution**: dominant chord resolves to tonic minor? But G7 is built on **B natural**, while Gm has **Bb** — the leading tone is clashing.

This suggests the **G7 chord is not leading to C**, but is instead **borrowed from G harmonic or melodic minor?**

But again — **G harmonic minor** has **F#**, not F natural.

So G7 (G-B-D-F) has F natural — that’s not harmonic minor.

What if we consider **G melodic minor ascending**?

G melodic minor ascending: G A B C D E F#  
→ Still no F natural, and 3rd is B natural, 7th is F#.

So **G7 (G-B-D-F)** has **B natural** and **F natural** — that’s **outside** both natural, harmonic, and melodic minor.

Hmm.

Alternative idea: Maybe the key is **Bb major**?

Let’s test that.

### Step 5: Try key of **Bb major**

Bb major scale: Bb C D Eb F G A

Chords:

- i: Bbm  
- ii: Cm  
- III: D°  
- iv: Eb  
- v: Fm  
- VI: Gm  
- VII: A°  

Wait — Gm is **VI chord in Bb major**

Now look at your chords:

- Gm → VI ✅  
- Eb → IV ✅  
- Eb/G → same chord  
- Bm(b5)/G = G7 → what’s G7 in Bb major? G is the **7th scale degree** in Bb major — so G° chord is the VII° — but we have G7, which is a **major minor 7th** — not diatonic.

G7 in Bb major? G is leading tone, so VII is G°, not G7.

G7 implies F natural and B natural.

In Bb major: F is natural (✓), but B is **B natural**? No — Bb major has **Bb**, not B natural.

So again — **B natural is not in Bb major**.

So neither Bb major nor G minor fully accommodate B natural and F natural together.

Wait — what key has **F natural** and **B natural**?

That’s **C major** or **C minor**.

C major: C D E F G A B  
→ F natural, B natural ✅

But our tonic is Gm.

Let’s try **G minor with chromaticism**.

G minor — most likely **harmonic minor**, which raises 7th to F#.

But we have **F natural** — which is the natural 7th (from natural minor).

And we have **B natural** — which is the raised 3rd, as in the **dominant chord** (G7), which is **borrowed from G major**.

Wait — yes!

This is a **G minor** progression that temporarily borrows from **G major**.

Specifically:

- The G7 chord is **borrowed from G major** — major III and major VII are not in minor modes.

Wait, in **G major**: G A B C D E F# → chord built on G: G major (G-B-D), and we have G7 (G-B-D-F), but F natural is not in G major — G major has F#.

So G7 has **F natural** — so now we have **B natural AND F natural** — that’s **G7 with a flat 7** — yes, that’s **G dominant 7, but the flat 7 is diatonic to G natural minor**.

This chord — **G7** — has:

- Root: G  
- Major 3rd: B (from G major)  
- Minor 7th: F (from G natural minor)

This is a **mixed-mode chord**: combining elements from **G major** (major 3rd) and **G natural minor** (minor 7th).

This is **not standard** in traditional harmony, but very common in **jazz** and **pop/rock** as a **“minor blues”** or **“mixed minor”** sound, or as a **“G blues dominant”** chord.

In **blues and soul**, it’s normal to have dominant 7th chords on the tonic minor (e.g., E7 in E minor blues).

So this is **G minor with tonic dominant 7th chord** — very common in **minor blues progressions**.

So the progression is:

**Gm → Gm → Eb/G → Eb/G → Gm → Gm → G7 → Gm → Gm → Eb/G → Eb/G → Gm → Gm → F6 → Gm**

We can now re-interpret:

### Step 6: Interpret chord functions **in G minor**, using chromaticism

- Gm = i (tonic)  
- Eb = VI (diatonic in natural minor)  
- G7 = **tonic dominant** — borrowed for color, common in minor blues  
- F6 = VII6 (in natural minor: F major = VII, adding 6th = F6 — very common in R&B/pop in minor keys)

### Step 7: Mode?

If the key is G minor, and it’s using mostly natural minor (A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F), with **one chromatic note**: **B natural** (from G7), then we are primarily in **G natural minor** (Aeolian mode).

But the **B natural** is a **borrowed note** — temporary alteration.

**Mode**: G Aeolian (natural minor)

**Key**: G minor

The G7 chord does **not** change the key — it’s a **chromatic passing or color chord**.

### Step 8: Compare to relative major?

Relative major of G minor is **Bb major**.

But again — **B natural** doesn’t belong in Bb major.

So not Bb major.

### Final conclusion:

> ✅ **Key: G minor**  
> ✅ **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  
>  
> The G7 chord (from Bm(b5)/G) is a **chromatic chromatic passing chord**, functioning as a **tonic dominant** in minor blues style — common in pop, R&B, and jazz.  
>  
> The F6 chord is the **VII6** chord, diatonic in G natural minor and very common in minor-key progressions.

---

### Additional Insight:

This progression is reminiscent of songs like:

- “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill Withers (G minor with G7)
- “I Can’t Help Myself” (Four Tops) — uses F6 → Gm
- Classic minor pop/rock progressions

It’s **G minor Aeolian with modal mixture** (borrowing G7 for dramatic tension).

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: G minor**  
> **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  
>  
> The progression uses chromatic embellishment with a G7 chord (borrowed from blues/pop minor conventions) and an F6 chord, both common in minor-key popular music, but the tonal center remains firmly on G minor in Aeolian mode.
