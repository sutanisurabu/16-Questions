G minor (Aeolian mode)

This progression strongly centers on Gm as the tonic (i), with Eb (VI) providing a common subdominant function in minor keys. Bb (III) and F6 (VII) are diatonic to G Aeolian, supporting the minor tonality without a raised leading tone (e.g., no E natural or dominant V chord). The Bm(b5)/G chord introduces chromaticism (B natural is non-diatonic) but functions as a passing or tension chord without altering the overall key center.
