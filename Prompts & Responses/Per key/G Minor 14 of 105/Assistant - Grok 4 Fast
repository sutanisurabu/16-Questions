**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

The given chord progression is firmly tonal and centers on G minor as the key (with Gm functioning as the clear tonic, both at the start and resolution points). 

The primary mode is **Aeolian** (natural minor), as the majority of the harmony derives from the G Aeolian scale (G A Bb C D Eb F). This fits the repetitive Gm–Eb/G–Gm structure (i–bVI–i) and the Bb/F (III/bVII bass) and F6 (bVII add 4) chords, which are staples of rock/pop minor-key writing.

The Bm(b5)/G chord introduces a brief **harmonic minor** inflection: its notes (G bass + B D F) form a G7 (V7/i), implying the raised leading tone (B natural) from G harmonic minor (G A Bb C D Eb F#) for dominant pull toward the tonic. This is a common mix in minor keys but doesn't shift the overall mode. 

No other key or mode (e.g., Dorian, Phrygian, or Eb major) accounts for the full progression as cleanly, though the bVI (Eb) nod to borrowed major flavors is typical in minor-key contexts. If this is from a specific song, more context could refine the analysis further.
