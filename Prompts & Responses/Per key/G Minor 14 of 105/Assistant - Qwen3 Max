To determine the **key and mode** of the given chord progression:

> **Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm**

### Step 1: List all chords (simplify and identify root notes and qualities)

| Chord             | Root | Quality / Notes                        |
|------------------|------|----------------------------------------|
| Gm               | G    | G–B♭–D                                 |
| Eb/G             | G    | G–Eb (i.e., Eb major with G in bass → G–B♭–Eb) |
| Bb/F             | F    | F–Bb–D (Bb major with F in bass → F–Bb–D) |
| Bm(b5)/G         | G    | G–B–D–F? Wait—Bm(b5) = B–D–F; over G → G–B–D–F → G7? |
| F6               | F    | F–A–C–D                                |

Hold on—**Bm(b5)** is a half-diminished chord: **B–D–F–A** (if it’s Bm7♭5), but written as **Bm(b5)/G**, that would be **G–B–D–F**.

But **G–B–D–F** is a **G7 chord** (G dominant 7: G–B–D–F). So **Bm(b5)/G = G7** enharmonically.

However, if it’s just **Bm(b5)** triad (no 7th), then it’s **B–D–F**, and over G → **G–B–D–F** again → same as G7.

So this chord strongly suggests **G7**, which is a **dominant chord**.

But wait—if the key were **G minor**, then **G7** is the **V7 of C minor**, not native to G minor.

Let’s test possible keys.

### Step 2: Look for common diatonic chords

The main chords used:

- **Gm** – appears constantly → likely tonic
- **Eb/G** – first inversion of **Eb major**
- **Bb/F** – first inversion of **Bb major**
- **F6** – F major with added 6th (D), so **F major**
- **Bm(b5)/G** → interpreted as **G7**

So the **chord roots** (ignoring bass inversions):  
**Gm, Eb, Bb, F, G7**

These are all chords from the **key of Bb major** or **G minor** (relative minor of Bb).

**Bb major scale**: Bb C D Eb F G A  
**G natural minor**: G A Bb C D Eb F

Chords in **G natural minor**:
- i: Gm  
- ii°: Adim  
- III: Bb  
- iv: Cm  
- v: Dm  
- VI: Eb  
- VII: F

So:
- Gm = i ✔️  
- Eb = VI ✔️  
- Bb = III ✔️  
- F = VII ✔️  
- F6 = just F with added 6th (D) – still F major ✔️

But what about **G7** (from Bm(b5)/G)?  
In natural minor, the **v chord is Dm**, and **V (D major) or G7 is not diatonic**.

However, in **harmonic minor**, we raise the 7th degree (F → F#), which gives us:
- **D major (V)**, used to lead to Gm
- But **G7** is **not** the dominant of G minor — it would be **D7**.

So **G7** is unusual in G minor.

Wait — maybe **Bm(b5)/G isn’t G7**?

Let’s double-check:  
**Bm(b5)** = B–D–F  
Over G → notes: G, B, D, F

That’s **G7**: G (root), B (3rd), D (5th), F (♭7) → yes, it’s G7.

But **G7 in the key of G minor** is a **modal mixture or borrowed chord**? Not really — it’s the **tonic with a major 3rd and flat 7**, which is **G Mixolydian** or **G7 as a blues/dominant tonic**.

But dominant 7 on tonic is common in **Dorian mode**? No, Dorian has minor 7, but major 6.

Wait — **G Dorian** = G A Bb C D E F  
Chords: Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, Eb, F

Still no G7.

But **F6** = F–A–C–D → includes **A natural**, which is **not in G natural minor** (which has A♭? No — G natural minor has A natural! Wait!)

Hold on: **G natural minor = G A Bb C D Eb F** → yes, **A is natural**, not flat. Only B, E, A are the altered notes from major? No:

G major: G A B C D E F#  
G natural minor: G A B♭ C D E♭ F

So **A is natural** in G minor — correct.

So **F6** = F–A–C–D → all notes in G natural minor:  
- F ✔️  
- A ✔️  
- C ✔️  
- D ✔️

Yes! So **F6 is diatonic to G natural minor** (it's the VII chord with added 13th).

Then what about **G7** (Bm(b5)/G)? The **B natural** in G7 is **not in G natural minor** (which has B♭).

Ah! **B natural** is foreign to G minor.

So **G7 contains B♮**, which is **chromatic** in G minor.

But maybe that chord is **not G7** — maybe it’s a misinterpretation.

Alternative: **Bm(b5)** is **B–D–F**, and the slash **/G** just means **G in bass**, but maybe the chord functions as **ii° of A**, or something else.

But in context: progression is mostly **Gm → Eb → Gm → Bb → [Bm(b5)/G] → Gm**

The **Bm(b5)/G** resolves to **Gm**, so it’s acting like a **dominant or embellishment**.

But **G7 → Gm** is a **modal mixture** or **blues move**, but it’s not functional dominant resolution (since G7 to Gm is **not a V–i**; it’s **I7–i**, which is common in **rock, jazz, or blues**, implying **G Mixolydian** or **G Dorian with altered 3rd**).

But wait — perhaps the **Bm(b5)/G** is better analyzed as a **passing chord** or **voice-leading chord**.

Let’s look at voice leading between **Bb/F** and **Gm**:

- Bb/F = F–Bb–D  
- Bm(b5)/G = G–B–D–F  
- Gm = G–Bb–D

So moving from Bb/F → Bm(b5)/G → Gm:

- F (bass) → G → G  
- Bb → B → Bb (chromatic movement!)  
- D → D → D  
- (F stays)

So **B natural** is a **chromatic passing tone** between Bb and Bb (i.e., Bb → B → Bb), a common embellishment in minor keys (called a **Neapolitan-type** or **chromatic mediant** move, but more likely just a **secondary dominant or applied chord**).

But **B natural** suggests **harmonic/melodic minor of E minor?** Not likely.

Alternatively, maybe the piece is in **Eb major**?

**Eb major chords**:  
Eb (I), Fm (ii), Gm (iii), Ab (IV), Bb (V), Cm (vi), Ddim (vii°)

So:
- Gm = iii  
- Eb = I  
- Bb = V  
- F6 = ii with added 6? But F in Eb is **ii**, which is **Fm**, not F major.

But we have **F major**, not F minor — so **not Eb major**.

In **Eb major**, F should be Fm, but it’s F major → so **not diatonic**.

But in **C minor** (relative minor of Eb):  
Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb

Still, **F is Fm**, not F major.

But in **C harmonic minor**, G is **G major** (V), but F is still Fm.

So **F major** points away from Eb/C minor.

Back to **G minor**.

In **G minor**, the **VII chord is F major**, which is used often as a **modal chord** (from natural minor), and **F6** is just F with added 6.

**Eb (VI)** and **Bb (III)** are also common in minor keys.

So the core chords: Gm (i), Eb (VI), Bb (III), F (VII) — all from **G natural minor**.

The **Bm(b5)/G** introduces a **B natural**, which is **non-diatonic**, but used as a **chromatic passing chord** (common in minor keys for expressive effect).

Thus, the **tonal center is G**, the **quality is minor**, and the **mode is natural minor (Aeolian)**, with occasional chromaticism.

But let’s consider **G Dorian**: G A Bb C D E F

Contains:
- Gm (i)  
- Bb (III)  
- Eb? Eb = E♭, but Dorian has **E natural**, so **Eb is not in G Dorian**

So **Eb major (with Eb note)** is **not in G Dorian** → eliminates Dorian.

**G Phrygian**: G Ab Bb C D Eb F → has Eb, Bb, but **F major?** F is in Phrygian, yes, but **Bb is not a typical chord** — but more importantly, the **A is flat**, but we have **A natural** in F6 and elsewhere, so **not Phrygian**.

Thus, only **G natural minor (Aeolian)** contains:
- G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F → matches all diatonic chords: Gm, Bb, Eb, F

Therefore, the **key is G minor**, **mode is Aeolian (natural minor)**, with brief chromatic alteration (B♮ in the Bm(b5)/G chord).

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **Key**: G minor  
- **Mode**: Natural minor (Aeolian)  

The progression is centered around **G minor**, using diatonic chords from the **G natural minor scale** (i, III, VI, VII), with a brief chromatic passing chord (Bm(b5)/G, which introduces B♮ as a decorative tone).
