Let's analyze the progression:

```
Gm  Gm  Eb/G  Eb/G  Gm  Gm  Bb/F  Bm(b5)/G  
Gm  Gm  Eb/G  Eb/G  Gm  Gm  F6   Gm
```

### Step 1. Identify the pitch collection

The chords used are:
- G minor (G–Bb–D)
- Eb/G (Eb–G–Bb)
- Bb/F (Bb–D–F)
- Bm(b5)/G (B–D–F)
- F6 (F–A–C–D)

### Step 2. Possible keys

The repeated tonic-like use of **Gm** strongly suggests **G as the tonal center**.

Let’s evaluate possible modes/scales containing the used chords.

| Chord | Fit in G natural minor (G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F)? | Fit in G harmonic minor (G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F#)? | Fit in G Dorian (G–A–Bb–C–D–E–F)? |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Gm | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Eb | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bb | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| F | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bm(b5) (B–D–F) | ✗ (B not in scale) | ✗ (B not in scale) | ✗ (B not in scale) |
| F6 (F–A–C–D) | A and C fine in all modes | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

The **Bm(b5)** chord introduces **B natural**, which is not part of G natural or harmonic minor, but it could serve as a **chromatic passing chord** between Bb and Gm (since it shares G and D with Gm).

### Step 3. Functional interpretation

- **Gm** acts as tonic (i).
- **Eb/G** (same notes as Eb major) can serve as a **VI** chord in G minor.
- **Bb/F** (Bb major first inversion) functions as **III**.
- **F6** (essentially F major with an added 6 = D) could act as **VII** in G minor or a subdominant color chord leading to tonic.
- **Bm(b5)/G** is likely a coloristic, chromatic bass-support chord based on shared tones, not diatonic.

### Step 4. Tonal center and mode

- The consistent **Gm** tonic and presence of **Eb**, **Bb**, and **F** (without F#) all align with **G natural minor** (same as **G Aeolian**).
- The rare appearance of **B natural** seems chromatic, not modal.

✅ **Key: G minor**  
✅ **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**

Chromatic color: the **Bm(b5)** chord is a borrowed or passing chord outside the mode.
