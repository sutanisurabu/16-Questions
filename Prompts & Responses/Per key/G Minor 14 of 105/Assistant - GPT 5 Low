### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I’m analyzing a chord progression involving Eb/G as the IV in first inversion and Bb/F as the I in second inversion. Bm(b5) is outside the diatonic framework for Bb major, but Bdim triad serves as a leading tone to C minor. I notice there's a passing chromatic chord with Bnat that plays as a secondary dominant. The progression seems to suggest it's in Bb major, but with a strong return to Gm, maybe it's centered in G minor. Interesting!**Interpreting chord functions**

I’m looking at the non-diatonic G7 as an applied dominant to iv in G minor, where the iv chord is Cm. So, G7 acts as V/iv. But then it seems to resolve back to Gm instead of C minor, which is interesting because that deviation adds color. Let’s map everything: Gm as i, Eb/G as VI in first inversion, Bb/F as III in second inversion, and then explore Bm(b5)/G leading to G7, fitting nicely in G Dorian. It’s quite a journey!**Clarifying chord roles**

In G natural minor, A is indeed the second degree, and F6 uses A, which fits nicely. F6 might be functioning as Fadd6 or as Dm7/F. Since the notes F, A, C, and D are all diatonic to G natural minor, I see that F6 can be identified as Dm7/F, which is the v7 in first inversion. It’s interesting that while F6 relates to the minor sound, the earlier G7 complicates things with the B natural, which strays from pure Aeolian.**Exploring chord functions**

I’m considering how G7 functions as an applied dominant to iv and adds a chromatic color. If we think about G Dorian, the scale includes G, A, Bb, C, D, E, and F. However, E♭ doesn't belong in Dorian since it features E natural instead. Our progression has E♭, which suggests it’s actually Aeolian. So, I conclude it’s in G minor (Aeolian), with G7 acting as an applied dominant and some inversions like F6 functioning as Dm7/F. It's a layered approach!**Determining key and mode**

I’m examining how F6 maps to Dm7/F, confirming it’s the first inversion of Dm7. This suggests a v7 in first inversion. Alternatively, the entire progression could be in Bb major with G7 acting as V/ii, and F6 as V6. However, based on the frequent appearance of Gm, I'd argue the tonal center remains G, placing it in G minor (Aeolian). There are no leading tones, so harmonic minor isn’t applicable. The best conclusion I can draw is: 

- Tonic: G  
- Mode: natural minor (Aeolian)  
- Function notes include Eb/G = bVI6, Bb/F = bIII64, Bm(b5)/G = G7 (V/iv), and F6 = Dm7/F = v7/6. Overall, G minor is the clear center!

Key: G minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Why:
- Gm is the repeated and final chord (tonic center).
- Eb and Bb chords (bVI and bIII) confirm the natural minor collection (G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F).
- F6 (F–A–C–D) is diatonic to G natural minor and can be heard as Dm7/F (v7 in first inversion), reinforcing Aeolian rather than harmonic minor (no F# appears).
- Bm(b5)/G spells G–B–D–F = G7, functioning as a secondary dominant V/iv (targeting Cm), a brief chromatic color.

Note: You could also hear this as Bb major with heavy emphasis on vi (Gm), but the cadence to and repetition of Gm favors G minor (Aeolian).
