### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to determine the key and mode of the chord progression: "Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm". The chords include Gm, Eb/G, Bb/F, Bm(b5)/G, and F6. 

It seems likely that this progression is in G natural minor (Aeolian) or perhaps G Dorian. I’ll analyze the notes and relationships: Gm consists of the notes G, Bb, and D, while the Eb/G chord is an E-flat major triad with G in the bass, indicating first inversion.**Determining chord inversions and key**

I’ve established that with G in the bass, the Eb/G chord is indeed in first inversion, meaning we have chord tones of Eb, G, and Bb. This means Eb major is the VI chord in the G minor key. 

In G Aeolian, Eb is flat 6, confirming its presence, while in G Dorian, Eb wouldn’t be present since it uses E natural. Bb/F is a Bb major triad with F in the bass, which confirms it as the VII chord in G minor. So, Bb is the third in G Aeolian.**Analyzing chord functions**

In G Aeolian, the scale degrees are G(1), A(2), Bb(3), C(4), D(5), Eb(6), and F(7). This indicates that the Bb chord is the III major chord, not flat VII, which would be an F major chord. When the Bb chord is over an F bass, it might serve a different function. 

The chord tones of Bm(b5)/G could suggest B half-diminished (B, D, F), which might be more ambiguous. It might function similarly to a G7b9sus4 due to that G bass.**Parsing the chord relationships**

Let’s break this down: When I combine G in the bass with the notes B, D, and F, it creates a G7 chord, which works as a dominant seventh. This includes a B natural, but G minor Aeolian has Bb instead. So, since B, D, and F form a B diminished triad, over G, it indeed gives us a G7 chord. This suggests a Mixolydian moment, where the G7 acts as a secondary dominant—possibly leading toward a C minor tonal center. But since we are in G minor, it might be functioning as a borrowed chord.**Determining key and mode**

If the tune is in G minor Aeolian, introducing B natural creates a conflict with the minor quality because it serves as the major third of G. While the progression mainly uses Gm, the Bm(b5)/G could be viewed as a B half-diminished triad, which can also function as a G7 chord. 

The presence of Bb and Eb suggests the key of G natural minor (Aeolian mode). The Bm(b5)/G introduces B natural as a brief chromatic element, leading to a secondary dominant feel. After examining, I can conclude that the key is G minor and the mode is Aeolian.**Finalizing key and mode**

To keep it concise, I think the user might expect a statement about "G minor (Aeolian)" with the flattened 6th and 7th degrees (Eb and F natural). 

So, I can craft the final answer: "Key: G minor, Mode: Aeolian (natural minor). The chords are i (Gm), VI (Eb), III (Bb), VII (F), with a brief chromatic G7 (Bm(b5)/G)." Let's keep this short and straightforward for clarity!

Key: G minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Evidence: Gm as tonic, with diatonic Eb (VI), Bb (III), and F/F6 (VII). The Bm(b5)/G functions as a chromatic G7 sonority over a G pedal, a brief color outside Aeolian.
