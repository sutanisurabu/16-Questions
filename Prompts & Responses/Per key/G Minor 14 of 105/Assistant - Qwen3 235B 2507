Let's analyze the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – Bb/F – B°5/G (Bm(b5)/G) – Gm – Gm – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gm – Gm – F6 – Gm

We can simplify and annotate the progression:

1. Gm
2. Gm
3. Eb/G
4. Eb/G
5. Gm
6. Gm
7. Bb/F
8. B°5/G (this means B diminished with G in the bass — B, D, F over G)
9. Gm
10. Gm
11. Eb/G
12. Eb/G
13. Gm
14. Gm
15. F6
16. Gm

### Step 1: Identify the Chords in Context

Let’s write out the notes in each chord to detect a consistent key.

- **Gm** = G, Bb, D
- **Eb/G** = Eb, G, Bb → This is an **Eb major chord** with G in the bass. So essentially **I in G minor**
- **Bb/F** = Bb, D, F → **Bb major** with F in the bass (6th)
- **B°5/G** = B, D, F over G → This is **B diminished**, which is **vii° of C minor** or **ii° of A minor**, but in context of G, this is **vii°7 of C**, but let's examine carefully.
  - Chord: B–D–F → B diminished (B°)
  - With G in the bass → G, B, D, F — this is **G7** without the 7th? Wait:
    - G, B, D, F = **G7**, the **dominant 7th chord** in C
    - But here it's spelled B, D, F, G → same notes → **G7**!
    - So **B°5/G** = G7 as a **second inversion**? Not quite — G7 would normally be G–B–D–F. This is **B–D–F–G**, which is **G7 in third inversion (G7/F#?)** — wait, no: G7 in 3rd inversion is G7 with F as bass → **G7/F**, not /G.

Wait: B°(G) — B–D–F + G in bass = G, B, D, F → **G7**, yes.

But B° is B–D–F — that's correct. So **Bdim over G** = G–B–D–F = **G7**, the **dominant 7th of C**.

So this chord is functionally **G7**, even though it's labeled as Bdim/G — this is a common way to voice G7 as a B diminished chord over G.

So: **B°5/G = G7**

Then the next chord:
- **F6** = F, A, C, D (F major with 6th)

Now the progression ends on Gm, so Gm feels like the tonic.

Let’s reframe with functional analysis.

---

### Step 2: Look for Tonic

The chord Gm appears at the beginning, middle, and end — it’s repeated and emphasized. It’s very likely the **tonic chord**.

So likely key: **G minor**

Let’s analyze each chord in **G minor**:

- **Gm** = i
- **Eb/G** = **VI** chord of G minor, with G in bass → VI in first inversion → very common in minor keys
- **Bb/F** = **III** chord (Bb) of G minor, with F in bass → 3rd inversion? Bb major: Bb, D, F → so F is 5th → **Bb/F = III in 2nd inversion**
- **B°5/G** = G, B, D, F → G7 → which is **V7 of C**, but C is the **IV** in G minor.

Wait — G7 is not native to G minor. In **G natural minor**, the diatonic chords are:

- i: Gm
- ii°: Am°
- III: Bb
- iv: Cm
- v: Dm
- VI: Eb
- VII: F

So **G7 (G–B–D–F)** contains a **B natural**, which is not in G natural minor (which has Bb). The **B natural** comes from the **harmonic minor** scale.

In **G harmonic minor**, we raise the 7th → F# instead of F. But here, we have **F natural** in Eb, Bb, F6.

Wait — contradiction.

- **F natural** appears in:
  - Eb/G = G, Eb, G, Bb → has Eb and Bb → F is not in chord
  - Bb/F = F, Bb, D → F natural
  - B°/G = G, B, D, F → F **natural**
  - F6 = F, A, C, D → A and F natural

So F natural is used consistently — **not F#**.

But B°/G requires a **B natural**, not Bb.

So if we have B natural and F natural, we're not in G natural minor (has Bb and F), nor in G harmonic minor (has F# and B), nor melodic minor (ascending: B and F#).

So how do we get **B natural** and **F natural**?

That implies **chromaticism** or a **secondary dominant**.

Let’s reconsider:

**B°5/G** = G, B, D, F → G7

G7 is **V7 of C**

So this is a **secondary dominant** leading to C.

But what chord follows it? Gm — not C.

Wait:

Sequence:
...Bb/F → B°5/G → Gm

So Bb → G7 → Gm

That’s **III → V7/V → i**? Not quite.

Let’s look:

We have F6 before the final Gm.

So:

Gm – Gm – F6 – Gm

F6 = F, A, C, D

That’s **F–A–C–D** = F6, which is **IV6 in C major**, or **bVII6 in G minor**?

In G minor:
- F is **bVII**
- F6 is a **chromatic chord** (since A is not in G natural minor: G minor has Ab, not A)

Ah! **A natural** — that’s not in G natural minor (Ab), not in harmonic minor (Ab), not in melodic minor (A natural ascending).

G melodic minor ascending: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#

So A natural is present **only in melodic minor ascending**.

But we have **A natural** (in F6), **B natural** (in B°), F natural (in Bb, F6), Eb (in Eb/G), D (in many chords), etc.

So possible notes used:
- G, A, Bb, B, C, D, Eb, (E?), F

Wait — E? Not evident.

But we have:
- G: yes
- A: in F6 → A natural
- Bb: in Gm, Eb
- B: in G7 (from B°)
- C: in F6
- D: in Gm, F6
- Eb: in Eb chord
- F: in Bb, G7, F6

So we have both Bb and B, Ab? No A or Ab — only A in F6 is **A natural**.

So **A natural**, not Ab → so **not in standard G natural minor**, which has Ab.

This suggests the use of **non-diatonic** or **chromatic** harmonies.

Alternatively, could the key be **C major**?

Let’s test that.

Key of C major: C, D, E, F, G, A, B

Chords in C major:
- C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, B°

Now let’s see:

- Gm → not in key (G is major in C major)
- Eb/G → Eb is not in C major
- Bb/F → Bb not in key
- F6 → F major with 6th (D) — F is IV, F6 is common in pop

But Gm is not diatonic to C major → would be ii, but it should be **G major** in C.

So no.

How about **G Dorian** mode?

G Dorian: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F → so notes: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F

But we have **B natural**, not Bb — B natural is used in B° chord.

So can’t be Dorian.

Wait — unless we allow chromatic passing chords.

Perhaps the key is **G minor**, and we have **chromatic chords** for color and voice leading.

Let’s see the overall movement:

- Gm – Eb/G – Gm – Bb/F – G7 (B°/G) – Gm – Eb/G – Gm – F6 – Gm

This feels like a loop.

Now, **F6** = F, A, C, D

That’s the **bVII6 chord** in G minor, but with a **C and A**, the A is chromatic.

F6 in G minor is a common borrowed chord? Not typically.

Alternatively, **F6** is the **IV6 in C major**, so maybe temporary modulation to C?

But ends on Gm.

Another idea: **F6** could be a **German augmented sixth** chord? No — German 6th is Ab–C–Eb–F# — not the case.

Wait — perhaps **F6 = Dm7** in first inversion?

Dm7 = D, F, A, C → same notes as F6 (F, A, C, D) → **F6 = Dm7 in 3rd inversion (Dm7/C?) no — Dm7 with F in bass = Dm7/F**

F6 and Dm7 are **enharmonic** — same notes → **they are the same chord**.

F6 = F–A–C–D  
Dm7 = D–F–A–C — same pitches.

So **F6 ≡ Dm7**.

Now, Dm7 is the **v7 chord** in G minor.

In G minor:
- v = Dm
- v7 = Dm7 → D–F–A–C

Yes! So Dm7 is diatonic to **G natural minor**.

And if we spell F6 as Dm7/F (D–F–A–C with F in bass), it’s **Dm7 in second inversion**.

So what was labeled **F6** is actually **Dm7/F** — a common way to write it as F6.

So the chord is **Dm7**, the **v7** of G minor.

Perfect! Now the chord progression makes sense.

So rewrite with correct interpretation:

- Gm → i
- Eb/G → VI (first inversion) → very common in minor
- Bb/F → III (second inversion) → common
- B°/G = G7 → this is **V7 of C**, not diatonic
- Dm7/F (F6) → v7 → diatonic

But G7 (B°/G) is not leading to C — it goes to Gm

Wait — unless it’s a **deceptive cadence** or something else.

Sequence: ... Bb/F → G7 → Gm

G7 → Gm is not functional. G7 wants to go to C.

But it goes to Gm.

Alternatively, is G7 acting as a **vii° of Gm**?

Wait — **F#°** would be the leading tone chord of Gm.

But this is **B°(G)** = B–D–F–G → which is **G7**.

Another idea: **G7** is being used as a **chromatic passing chord** between Bb and Gm.

Voice leading:
- Bb/F: F, Bb, D
- G7: G, B, D, F
- Then Gm: G, Bb, D

Notice:
- Bb (in Bb/F) → B (in G7) → Bb (in Gm) → ascending chromatic
- F stays
- D stays
- G enters

So it's a **chromatic mediant** or passing function — **B natural** is a chromatic passing tone.

Similarly, later we have F6 (Dm7) before final Gm.

So let’s list progression with roman numerals in **G minor**:

1. Gm (i)  
2. Gm (i)  
3. Eb/G (VI, 1st inv)  
4. Eb/G (VI, 1st inv)  
5. Gm (i)  
6. Gm (i)  
7. Bb/F (III, 2nd inv)  
8. G7/B (V7/IV) or chromatic — B°/G = G7, but not resolving to C)  
9. Gm (i)  
10. Gm (i)  
11. Eb/G (VI)  
12. Eb/G (VI)  
13. Gm (i)  
14. Gm (i)  
15. F6 = Dm7/F = v7, 2nd inv  
16. Gm (i)

Now, chord 8: G7 — could be interpreted as **vii°7 of C**, but since it doesn’t resolve to C, maybe it's just a color chord or passing.

But in context, it’s used for **voice leading effect** — chromatic ascent from Bb to B to Bb.

Similarly, the **A natural** in Dm7 is part of the **natural minor** scale (G natural minor has A, since it's G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F–G).

Wait! Yes! **G natural minor = G Aeolian**: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

So A natural **is** in G natural minor.

So Dm7 (F6) is fully diatonic: v7

Eb is also in the scale.

Only **B natural** in G7 is **extraneous** — it's a chromatic passing note.

So the **only chromatic chord is G7 (B°/G)**, used for melodic interest.

Therefore, the **tonic is Gm**, and the key is **G minor**, specifically **G natural minor (Aeolian mode)**, with one chromatic chord (G7) used as a passing device.

But is G minor the key, or is it a mode?

G natural minor = G Aeolian

So the **mode** is **Aeolian**.

But let’s confirm if the harmony is consistent with natural minor.

Yes — i, VI, III, v7 are all in natural minor.

G7 is a borrowed or chromatic chord for color.

Final chord is Gm — strong tonic.

So conclusion:

---

### ✅ Key: **G minor**
### ✅ Mode: **Aeolian**

With one chromatic passing chord (G7, notated as B°/G), and F6 = Dm7 (v7), fully diatonic.

**Answer:**
**Key: G minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian**
