### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by analyzing this step by step.

First, I need to list out all the chords and see what notes they contain. The chords are: Gm, Eb/G, Bb/F, Bm(b5)/G, F6. Let me write down each chord's notes.

Starting with Gm: G, Bb, D. That's straightforward.

Eb/G: This is an E-flat minor chord with G in the bass. So the notes are Eb, Gb, Bb, but since it's Eb/G, the bass note is G. So the chord is technically G, Eb, Gb, Bb? Wait, no. Eb minor chord is Eb, Gb, Bb. When written as Eb/G, it means the root is Eb, but the bass note is G. So the notes are G, Eb, Gb, Bb. But G and Gb? That doesn't sound right. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the notation. Sometimes in slash chords, the first part is the chord, and the second is the bass note. So Eb/G would be an Eb minor chord with G in the bass. So the chord notes are Eb, Gb, Bb, and the bass is G. But G is not in the Eb minor chord. Eb minor has Eb, Gb, Bb. G is the major third of Eb? Wait no. Eb minor: root Eb, minor third is Gb (since Eb to Gb is a minor third), perfect fifth Bb. So the chord is Eb, Gb, Bb. But if it's Eb/G, that's implying the bass note is G, so the chord would be G, Eb, Gb, Bb? But G and Gb? That seems odd because G and Gb are enharmonic? No, Gb is F#? Wait, no. Gb is the same as F#. But in terms of spelling, Eb minor chord is Eb, Gb, Bb. So if you put G in the bass, the notes are G, Bb, Eb, Gb? But Gb and G are adjacent, which might be dissonant. Maybe it's a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the slash chord notation here is for a different chord. Wait, sometimes people might write Eb/G to mean a G bass with Eb chord, but that's just the same as Eb minor with G bass. Alternatively, maybe it's a misnotation. Let me check the notes again.

Wait, for Eb/G: the chord is Eb minor, but the bass note is G. So the notes are G (bass), Eb, Gb, Bb? But G and Gb are a minor second apart, which is very dissonant. That seems odd. Maybe it's supposed to be E natural? Wait, but the user wrote "Eb/G". Let's spell it out. E flat, so Eb. G in bass. So the chord is Eb minor triad (Eb, Gb, Bb) but with G bass. So the notes are G, Eb, Gb, Bb. But G and Gb? That's G and G flat, which is a very close interval. But maybe the slash chord here is indicating a different chord. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps in some contexts it's written as Eb/G meaning the chord is Eb, but the bass is G. However, technically, Eb minor chord doesn't contain G. So when voiced with G in the bass, it's an inversion. Let me check the intervals. If Eb minor chord is Eb (root), Gb (minor third), Bb (perfect fifth). So if the bass is G, then the chord would be G in the bass, then Eb, Gb, Bb. But G is a major second above Gb? Wait, Gb is F#. So G is a minor second above Gb? Wait, Gb is F#; so G is a half step above F#. So yes, G and Gb (F#) is a minor second interval. That's a very dissonant interval. But maybe in practice, people might just voice it as Eb minor in first inversion where Gb is in the bass? Wait, no. First inversion of Eb minor would have Gb in the bass. But Eb minor: root Eb, first inversion would have Gb as bass, then Bb, Eb. So Eb minor first inversion is Gb/Eb? No, no. The chord's inversion depends on the bass note. For Eb minor triad: root position is Eb, Gb, Bb. First inversion is Gb in bass, then Bb, Eb. Second inversion is Bb in bass, then Eb, Gb. If the bass is G, which is not part of the triad, so it would be a different chord. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the user made a typo. Let me check other chords.

Wait, maybe the slash chord is for a different chord. Let's take Bm(b5)/G. B minor flat fifth. So B minor chord is B, D, F#. But b5 means the fifth is flattened, so B, D, F. So B diminished chord? Because minor flat fifth is diminished. But Bdim is B, D, F. Then Bm(b5)/G would be a diminished chord with G in bass. So notes G, B, D, F. Which is a G7 chord? Because G7 is G, B, D, F. So Bm(b5)/G is actually a G7 chord. Because B diminished triad is B, D, F, and with G in bass, it becomes G, B, D, F which is G7. So that's important. So maybe the slash chords here are indicating inversions or different chords.

Let's redo all chords with their note names.

Gm: G, Bb, D.

Eb/G: If it's Eb minor with G bass. But Eb minor is Eb, Gb, Bb. So notes G, Eb, Gb, Bb. But G and Gb: so G and F# (since Gb is F#). So G, F#, Eb, Bb. Wait, but G and F# is a minor second. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe Eb/G is actually a G minor chord with Eb in bass? No, the slash is usually chord over bass note. So chord: Eb minor, bass: G. But perhaps the chord isn't actually Eb minor. Maybe someone misnotated. Let's see. Alternatively, Eb/G could be a Eb major chord with G bass. But Eb major would be Eb, G, Bb. So if Eb major chord with G bass: the chord notes are G (bass), Eb, G, Bb. But then G is in the root, Eb, and Bb. So that would be G minor chord? Wait, G minor is G, Bb, D. So Eb major chord in root position is Eb, G, Bb. If you have G in the bass, then it's an Eb major slash chord. So notes G, Eb, G, Bb. Which is essentially G, Eb, Bb. But the G is doubled. So that's an Eb major triad with G in the bass. But that would be the same as G minor? Wait, no. Because Eb major chord: E, G, Bb? No, Eb is E flat. Eb major: Eb, G, Bb. Yes. Because Eb to G is a major third (Eb to Bb is perfect fifth, Eb to G is major third? Wait, Eb to G: E to G is major third, so Eb to G is also major third. Yes. So Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So if it's Eb/G, that means bass is G, so the notes are G (bass), Eb, G, Bb. So G, Eb, Bb. Which is a G minor chord without the D? Because G minor is G, Bb, D. So Eb/G here is actually missing the D. But G minor is G, Bb, D. If you have G, Eb, Bb, that's not G minor. Because G minor has D, but here it's Eb instead of D. Wait, Eb and D are different. So Eb here would be a minor sixth above G? G to Eb is minor sixth. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe looking at the chords in context. Let's list all the chords again with their notes.

1. Gm: G, Bb, D

2. Gm: same

3. Eb/G: Let's assume it's Eb major chord with G bass. So notes G, Eb, Bb. But Eb to G is major third, so yes. So triad Eb, G, Bb. In root position. If bass is G, then it's G, Eb, Bb. So the notes here are G, Eb, Bb. Which are the notes of a G minor 7th chord? Wait, G minor 7th is G, Bb, D, F. But here we don't have F or D. We have G, Eb, Bb. So that's a G minor chord missing the fifth (D), but adding Eb which is a minor sixth above G. Alternatively, it's an Eb major triad in first inversion? No, first inversion of Eb major is G, Bb, Eb. So that's exactly it. So Eb major in first inversion: G in bass, then Bb, Eb. Wait, but Eb major chord is Eb (root), G (major third), Bb (perfect fifth). So first inversion: G as bass, then Bb, Eb. So yes, the chord would have notes G, Bb, Eb. So actually Eb major triad in first inversion. So maybe Eb/G here refers to an Eb major chord with G bass. But in standard notation, yes, Eb/G would mean Eb chord with G in the bass. So Eb major chord (Eb, G, Bb) with G in bass. So notes G, Bb, Eb. So the actual notes are G, Bb, Eb. Which is a G minor 6th chord? No, G minor 6th would be G, Bb, D, E. But here it's G, Bb, Eb. So G, Bb, Eb. Eb is the minor sixth of G. So G minor 6th chord is G, Bb, D, E. No, minor sixth chord usually has a sixth instead of a fifth. Wait, G minor sixth: G, Bb, D, E. Yes. But here, we have Eb, which is the same as D#? Wait no, Eb is E-flat. So from G: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb. So Eb is a minor sixth above G. So G, Bb, Eb would be G minor with a flat sixth? But a minor sixth chord typically has the sixth (E natural in G minor). Wait, in G natural minor scale, the sixth is E. So Eb would be a flat sixth. So if it's a G minor chord with Eb, that's G minor with a ♭6. But usually, a minor sixth chord has a natural sixth. Hmm. Alternatively, Eb/G could be considered as a Bb minor chord? Let's see. If notes G, Eb, Bb. Then root could be Bb. Bb, G, Eb – Bb minor chord is Bb, Db, F. Not matching. Or Eb major chord. Yes, as Eb major with G bass, it's just an inversion.

So maybe better to think of all these chords in the context of a key. Let's list all the chords and their notes.

Gm: G, Bb, D

Eb/G: Assuming Eb major triad with G bass: notes G (bass), E-flat, Bb. Wait, no, Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So with G bass, the notes are G (bass), Eb, Bb. Yes. So that's G, Eb, Bb.

But Eb and Bb: Bb is the fifth of Eb, and Eb is the root. So this is just an inversion.

Next chord: Gm again: G, Bb, D

Then Gm again.

Bb/F: So Bb chord with F in bass. Bb major chord is Bb, D, F. So with F in bass, it's Bb, D, F. So it's F, Bb, D. Which is essentially an F major chord? Because F major is F, A, C. Wait no. Bb/F: Bb major triad with F bass. So notes F (bass), Bb, D. So F, Bb, D. F and Bb are perfect fourth, F to D is minor sixth? Wait, F major chord is F, A, C. So F, Bb, D is actually a different chord. Bb/D would be Bb chord with D bass, but Bb/F is Bb chord with F bass. The chord Bb/F contains F, Bb, D. What chord is that? If we look at root: F, Bb, D. The notes F, Bb, D. That's equivalent to a D minor chord? D minor is D, F, A. Not quite. Or it's a Bb7 chord without the third? No. Wait, F, Bb, D – F is root, Bb is perfect fourth, D is major sixth. So F6? But F6 would be F, A, C, D. No. Alternatively, this is a Bb sus4 chord over F? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Bb chord with F in bass, but the triad is Bb, D, F. So notes F, Bb, D. The intervals: F to Bb is perfect fourth, Bb to D is major third, D to F is minor third. Wait, perhaps better to think of the chord as an F minor chord? F minor would be F, Ab, C. Not matching. Alternatively, it's a D half-diminished chord? D, F, Ab. No, because D to F is minor third, F to Bb? No, in F, Bb, D: D to F is minor third. Wait, F to D is major sixth, but the chord is F, Bb, D. Let's see: F major chord is F, A, C. Here we have F, Bb, D. Maybe it's a Bb chord with F as the fifth? No. Alternatively, the chord is F7sus4? Not sure. Maybe better to check the context. Maybe this chord is part of a common chord progression.

Next: Bm(b5)/G. B minor flat fifth. As I thought earlier, B minor is B, D, F#; with flat fifth, it's B, D, F. So diminished triad Bdim: B, D, F. Then slash G, so chord is Bdim with G bass. So notes G, B, D, F. Which is a G7 chord. Because G7 is root G, B, D, F. Perfect.

Then Gm: G, Bb, D again.

Then Eb/G again: same as before.

Then Gm: G, Bb, D.

Then F6. F6 chord: typically F, A, C, D. So F major triad with added sixth (D). So the notes are F, A, C, D.

So summarizing all the chords in the progression:

- Gm: G, Bb, D

- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (from Eb major chord in first inversion)

- Bb/F: F, Bb, D (from Bb major chord with F bass)

- Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F (which is G7)

- F6: F, A, C, D

Wait, but F6 has A and C, but F6 usually includes A and C. So the chord is F major with sixth (D), so F, A, C, D.

Now, let's see what scale these chords belong to. Let's list all the notes present in the entire chord progression.

Looking at the chord notes:

From Gm: G, Bb, D

From Eb/G (Eb major in first inversion): G, Eb, Bb

From Bb/F: F, Bb, D

From Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F

From F6: F, A, C, D

So all the notes across the progression: G, Bb, D, Eb, F, B, A, C.

So notes present: A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. So all eight notes except maybe... Let's list them:

A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. So missing E natural? Wait, the notes here include A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. So that's all chromatic except maybe... Well, there's A, B, Bb (so A and Bb), C, D, Eb, F, G. So the chord progression uses both B and Bb, which is a lot of chromatic notes. But let's see if there's a particular key this fits into.

Alternatively, perhaps it's in a minor key. Let's see. If we look at common minor keys. Let's check G minor.

G natural minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the notes in the progression. Let's see: G natural minor has notes G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Yes! Let's check the chords:

- Gm: G, Bb, D – yes, that fits G natural minor.

- Eb/G: Eb major chord in first inversion (G, Eb, Bb). Eb is a note in the scale, yes. Eb major chord in natural minor? Wait, in G natural minor scale, the diatonic chords are:

i: Gm

ii°: A° (but usually written as A half-diminished in minor scales)

III: Bb Maj

iv: Cm

v: Dm

VI: Eb Maj

VII: F Maj

Wait, yes. So in G natural minor, the chords:

i = Gm, ii° = A°, III = Bb, iv = Cm, v = Dm, VI = Eb, VII = F.

So Eb major and F major are both present. So Eb/G would be Eb major chord with G bass. Which fits as VI chord. Similarly, F6 would be VII chord with added sixth. And F6: F, A, C, D. In the natural minor scale of G minor, the seventh chord is F major (F, A, C), and adding D would be the sixth note (D is the 6th degree of the scale, which in G minor is D). Wait, in G minor scale, the notes are G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So D is the fifth degree. Wait, no. Let's list the scale degrees:

1. G

2. A

b3. Bb

4. C

5. D

b6. Eb

b7. F

So yes, D is the 5th. So F major chord is the VII chord, which is F, A, C. Then adding a sixth... but in the scale, the sixth is Eb. So F6 chord would typically have F, A, C, D? But D is the fifth degree. So F6 would be F major with added sixth (which would be D). But in the key of G minor, F major is VII, and its sixth would be D, which is present. So yes.

But wait, the chord Bm(b5)/G is G7 chord. Let's check if G7 is in G natural minor. The natural minor scale has a minor 7th scale degree. The VII chord in G natural minor is F major. The V chord is D minor. G7 is a dominant seventh chord, which is not diatonic to natural minor scale. G7 has F natural, but in G minor, the seventh degree is F natural. Wait, G minor (natural) has F natural (b7). So G7 chord is G, Bb, D, F. Which is exactly the notes for the G minor 7th chord? Yes, Gm7 would be G, Bb, D, F. But here's the thing: in the chord progression, Bm(b5)/G is G7 because Bdim triad (B, D, F) with G bass becomes G, B, D, F. But wait, B in Bdim chord – in G natural minor scale, what is B? In G natural minor scale, the 3rd is Bb. So B natural is not in the natural minor scale. G natural minor has Bb, so B natural is outside. Wait, so B natural would be a chromatic note.

Wait, this is a conflict. If G natural minor scale has Bb, then B natural would be a chromatic alteration. So when the chord includes B natural (as in the G7 chord: G, B, D, F), but in G natural minor scale, there's no B natural; the third is Bb.

So G7 chord (with B natural) would be a dominant seventh, which typically belongs to the harmonic or melodic minor.

So let's think. If there's a B natural, then maybe it's in the harmonic minor scale.

G harmonic minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#, G.

Wait, F# instead of F natural. But in our chord progression, the chord F6 has F natural, not F#. Also, G7 chord has F natural as the minor seventh. Because G7 chord is G, B, D, F – F natural. So if the scale has F natural, but the harmonic minor has F#. So if the chord progression has F natural and B natural (in G7), then perhaps it's not strictly harmonic minor.

But wait, in the G7 chord we have B natural, which is the major third of G7, so for a dominant seventh chord, B is necessary. So if the key is G minor, having a dominant seventh chord on G would suggest a harmonic minor or melodic minor scale. Because in natural minor, the V chord is minor (D minor), but to get a dominant V chord, you'd use harmonic minor, which raises the seventh note, making the VII chord become a major chord. Wait, in harmonic minor: the raised seventh.

G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#.

So in harmonic minor, the V chord would be D major (D, F#, A), and the leading tone is F#. So if there is a G7 chord in this progression, G7 would be part of a cadence. Wait, G7 would be the minor seventh chord, which in natural minor is fine, but in harmonic minor, G minor seventh would still be G, Bb, D, F, but wait, harmonic minor has F# not F. So if we have F natural, then it's not harmonic minor; F natural means it could be natural or melodic.

Wait, but G7 has a minor seventh (F natural), so that's actually Gm7. Wait, no. G7 is the dominant seventh, which requires a minor seventh (F natural) above root G. G to F is minor seventh. So yes, G7 chord is G-B-D-F. So in the key of G minor, if you have a G7 chord, that's not typical because usually in the key of G minor, the i chord is G minor 7, not a dominant 7. Dominant 7 chords are usually on the V chord. But here, the G7 is actually the i chord, but dominant seventh? That doesn't make sense. If the tonic is G minor, the tonic chord is G minor, possibly Gm7 (which has F natural). Wait, Gm7 is G-Bb-D-F. But here, the chord Bm(b5)/G is G7, but with B natural. So B natural instead of Bb. Which means G7 would be G-B-D-F, which is a dominant seventh chord. But for a G chord to be dominant seventh, it would typically be used as a V chord in dominant to tonic resolution. But if it's on G, that would be the tonic being a dominant chord, which is less common but possible. Alternatively, maybe the tonic chord is minor, but the progression is using a major seventh or something. This is confusing.

Let's recap the chords:

- Gm (G, Bb, D)

- Eb/G (G, Eb, Bb) — which is Eb major triad in first inversion.

- Bb/F: F, Bb, D — Bb major triad with F bass. Bb major is III chord in G minor.

- Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F (G7)

- F6: F, A, C, D — F major chord with added sixth. In G minor, F major is the VII chord.

Wait, but if we have a G7 chord here (with B natural), that B natural isn't in the G natural minor scale. So that suggests maybe we're not in natural minor. Let's see what other scale could include B natural and F natural and so on.

Alternatively, maybe we're in E minor? Wait, but the chords start with Gm. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different key. Let's see.

Another approach: list all the notes used in the chords:

From all chords:

- Gm: G, Bb, D

- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb

- Bb/F: F, Bb, D

- Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F

- F6: F, A, C, D

So all notes present: A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G.

So the notes are: A, Bb, B, C, D, Eb, F, G. Missing E natural and... Wait, E natural isn't present here. So we have A, Bb, B, C, D, Eb, F, G. So all notes except E natural. So it's like G minor with some chromaticism? But B natural and A natural. But G minor typically has A natural, yes. But B natural isn't in G minor; G minor has Bb.

Wait, natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So A is present, Bb, but B natural is not. So to have B natural, the scale would need to have raised the third. So maybe it's G melodic minor ascending? G melodic minor ascending: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. But here we have Eb, not E. So that doesn't match. Or descending is natural minor.

Alternatively, maybe it's in the key of E minor? E minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Chords include Em, F#dim, Gmaj, Am, Bm, Cmaj, Dmaj. But our chords include Gm, which isn't in E minor. So probably no.

Wait, F6 chord: F major with added sixth. So F, A, C, D. Also in the progression we have Eb. If we consider the key of F major: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. But then G minor chord? G minor isn't in F major. F major has G major. Not matching. F minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. But then we have B natural, which isn't in F minor.

Another idea: let's see the bass notes. The progression starts with Gm (bass G), then Gm, then Eb/G (bass G), then Eb/G, then Gm, Gm, then Bb/F (bass F), then Bm(b5)/G (bass G), Gm, Gm, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gm, Gm, F6 (bass F?), then Gm.

The bass notes: G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G. So mostly G bass with some F bass. So perhaps the tonic is G, given that the bass is frequently G, and the song starts and ends with Gm.

Let's consider G minor as the possible key. Now, the presence of Eb major chord (which is VI chord in G minor), F major (VII), Bb major (III), which all exist in G natural minor. But the Bm(b5)/G chord is G7 – G7 has B natural, which isn't in G natural minor. So that's the issue. In G natural minor, the G minor triad is G, Bb, D. If it's G7, it would be G, Bb, D, F – which is Gm7. But the chord Bm(b5)/G has B natural instead of Bb. So B natural in the chord.

So G7 has B natural. So how does that fit? In G minor, having a major third on the G chord is a bit of a thing. For example, in a minor key, sometimes the V chord is dominant to resolve to the tonic. But here, if the G chord is a dominant seventh, that would be strange because the tonic is minor. Wait, perhaps the G chord is not the tonic. Wait, but it's Gm at the beginning and end.

Wait, let's look at the chord progression again. After the F6 Gm, so F6 to Gm. In the key of G minor, F major (VII) to G minor (i) would be a common cadence, using the VII-i resolution. But in G minor, F major chord is diatonic. If F6 is F major with added sixth (D), which is still part of the mode.

But the G7 chord: Bm(b5)/G is written as Bm(b5)/G, which we determined is G7. So G7 chord. Now, if the key is G minor, then using a G7 chord would be unusual. But perhaps it's a modulation, or the music is using the blues scale or something. Alternatively, maybe it's in G Dorian mode.

Wait, the Dorian mode: G Dorian would be G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Let's see. G Dorian has a major sixth (E natural) and minor seventh (F). So scale notes: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Now, in this case, the chords:

- i: Gm7? In Dorian mode, the tonic chord is minor seventh.

Looking at the chords present. Now, in G Dorian, what chords would be present.

But our chords: F6 is F, A, C, D. F major chord in G Dorian? G Dorian has F as the minor seventh. So F major chord would be F, A, C. A and C are present in G Dorian: F is the seventh, A is the second degree, C is the fourth degree. So yes, F major chord exists in G Dorian as VII chord? Wait no. Let's see the diatonic chords for G Dorian:

1 Gm7

2 A°7 or Am7b5

3 Bb Major 7

4 Cmaj7

5 Dm7

6 Emaj7

7 F7

So chord in G Dorian:

i: Gm7

iim7b5: Am°

IIIMaj7: Bb Maj7

IV7: Cm7? Wait, no. Let's see. The scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. So for chords:

G root: G Bb D F (Gm7)

A root: A C E G → Am7

Bb root: Bb D F A → Bbmaj7? Bb D F A is Bbmaj7? Bb to D is major third, D to F is minor third, F to A is major third. Wait, Bb, D, F, A: yes, that's Bb major seventh chord. Yes.

C root: C E G Bb → Cm7? C E G Bb. C to E is major third, E to G minor third, G to Bb minor third. So C minor seventh chord. But in the Dorian mode, the IV chord is typically minor 7th.

D root: D F A C → Dm7

E root: E G B D → E7? E G B D: G is minor third, B is major third, D is fifth. So E minor 7th flat fifth? Wait, E, G, B, D – that's Em7. No. Wait in Dorian mode, the VI chord is minor seventh? Let's see. E as root: E, G, B, D – all notes present in the scale. Yes, E minor seventh chord.

F root: F A C E – Fmaj7.

Wait, so in G Dorian, the chords would be:

i: Gm7

ii: Am7

III: BbMaj7

iv: Cm7

v: Dm7

VI: Em7

VII: Fmaj7

Now, looking at the chord progression:

Gm (Gm7)

Eb/G – this could be Bb chord? Wait, Eb major chord... in G Dorian, the Eb chord would be the flat VI. Hmm, but Eb isn't in G Dorian. G Dorian's notes are G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Eb isn't there. So if the progression has Eb, that's outside the Dorian mode.

So maybe G natural minor is still the best bet. Let's consider that.

In G natural minor (Aeolian mode): scale notes G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F.

So the diatonic chords:

i: Gm

ii°: A° (A, C, Eb)

III: Bb

iv: Cm

v: Dm

VI: Eb

VII: F

So the chords present in the progression should fit into this key.

Now, looking at the chords given:

Gm (i)

Eb/G: which is Eb major (VI chord) with G bass. In the key of G minor, VI chord is Eb major. Yes.

Bb/F: Bb major chord (III) with F bass. Bb major is diatonic.

But wait, Bb/F as chord: Bb major triad with F in bass → F, Bb, D. Which F? In G minor, the VII chord is F major. F major chord is F, A, C. But here in Bb/F: F, Bb, D. So that's missing A and C. So Bb major triad is Bb, D, F. So yes, F bass notes would be F, Bb, D. Which is the same as Bb major triad with F bass. So that's the Bb chord in second inversion. Yes, which is present in the key. Bb chord is III. So Bb/F is still part of Bb major triad, just inverted.

Next chord: Bm(b5)/G. As discussed, is G7 chord: G, B, D, F. Now, in G natural minor scale, there's no B natural. So this B natural is a chromatic note. Similarly, in Bm(b5)/G, it's a Bdim chord with G bass. But Bdim chord has B, D, F. The B natural is not in the natural minor scale. So this suggests that maybe the key is G minor but using a raised leading tone for the V chord.

Wait, if we consider a G harmonic minor scale, the notes would be G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#.

But in our progression, we have F natural, not F#. So F natural is present (in F6 chord: F, A, C, D). But harmonic minor would have F#.

So if there's a B natural in the Bm(b5)/G chord (i.e., in G7), which is part of a dominant chord, perhaps G minor in this section is using harmonic minor. But then the F would need to be raised to F# for harmonic minor. But in the progression, the F6 has F natural. So conflict.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the chord Bm(b5)/G. Let's check again. Bm(b5)/G: B minor flat fifth. Minor flat fifth would technically be a diminished chord, so Bdim. Bdim is B, D, F. So yes. With G in bass: G, B, D, F. So yes G7 chord. Now, for Bdim to be part of the scale in G minor, but B is not in natural minor. However, if the key is G minor, and the B natural appears, this would be the raised seventh note for the harmonic minor scale? Wait no. In G minor:

Natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

Harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#

Melodic minor ascending: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#

So B natural would be part of melodic minor (ascending) or harmonic minor has F# but not B natural. G harmonic minor has Bb natural. So B natural would be from melodic minor.

But melodic minor ascending has B natural, but in ascending form only. But B natural would also be present when using the V chord (D major) to create a leading tone.

But if the key is G minor, and we have a B natural in the G7 chord, that might mean that we're using the harmonic minor or melodic minor. However, the chord F6 contains natural F, which matches natural minor but not harmonic minor.

This is a bit confusing. Let's see all the non-chord tones. Another angle: perhaps this progression is in G minor, and the B natural is a chromatic passing tone or something. But in chord G7, it's the third of the G7 chord. So if the progression is using G minor but with a dominant seventh on G, this would be unusual because in minor keys, the tonic chord is minor seventh (Gm7), not dominant 7th. However, sometimes in blues and other styles, you can have a dominant seventh on tonic.

Alternatively, maybe the key is G Aeolian (natural minor), but the Bm(b5)/G chord is actually something else. Let's reconsider. Maybe Bm(b5)/G is interpreted as B diminished over G, so the G is bass, and the rest. But Bdim chord with G bass is G, B, D, F as before. Yes.

Wait, another thought: if the key is E Phrygian? No, that seems less likely.

Wait, let's look at the F6 chord. F6 has F, A, C, D. A is in G minor. In G natural minor, the A is the supertonic. So F6 chord: F major with added sixth. If the key were F major, then F6 would be tonic chord. But the rest of the chords don't fit F major. Gm in F major? F major doesn't have G minor.

Another approach: check if the key can be determined by the last chord. It ends with Gm, so likely G minor is the tonic.

Let's see the progression again:

Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm

So the chords are mostly Gm, Eb major chords, Bb major chords, then G7 chord, F6.

So let's list the chords without slash notation, by the chord quality:

- Gm

- Eb (major)

- Bb (major)

- G7

- F6

But maybe the slash chords just indicate inversions:

Eb/G could be considered as Eb triad over G → Eb major triad with G bass.

Similarly, Bb/F is Bb triad over F.

But in terms of roots: Eb major chord root Eb, Bb major root Bb, etc.

So chord roots: Gm (G), Eb (Eb), Bb (Bb), G7 (G), F (F).

So roots are G, Eb, Bb, G, F.

If we think of Eb as the sixth scale degree in G minor, Bb as third, F as seventh, G as tonic.

Yes, this fits G natural minor. Now, the issue is with B natural in G7. Let's see. G7 chord has B natural. In G natural minor, the third of the tonic chord is Bb. So having B natural would require altering that. Maybe the progression is using a mix of natural minor with some harmonic minor elements.

However, another possibility: maybe G minor, but using the B natural for a temporary modulation. Or perhaps the key is G minor but the chord Bm(b5)/G is actually not G7? Wait, let's parse Bm(b5)/G again. Bm(b5) is B minor flat fifth, so diminished chord on B. So Bdim. Then slash G means G bass. So yes, G bass with B, D, F from the dim chord. But in G minor, D is present, F is present, but B natural isn't. So unless this B is a passing tone.

Wait, but in the context of the chord progression, maybe the G7 is the V of C major? But then the key would be C major, but the progression also has G minor as the tonic. Hmm.

Alternative idea: if the key is C minor. Let's check. C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. In that case, Gm chord is ii chord, Eb is IV chord. Bb would be VI. But then F6 chord? F major chord in C minor would be IV. But F6 would be F major with sixth. But the progression starts and ends with Gm. If C minor, Gm would be ii, but it starts and ends with ii, which is possible but less common. Also, Bm(b5)/G: G7 chord. In C minor, G7 would be V chord. Which is diatonic if using harmonic minor. C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So V chord is G7 (G, B, D, F). But in that case, the tonic is C, but the progression starts and ends with Gm. So that would be ii chord to ii, not making sense. Unless modulating.

This seems more confusing.

Wait, let's count the bass notes again. The bass is mostly G, with some F. The first two chords are Gm, then Eb/G (bass G), etc. So bass is mostly G. So tonic seems to be G.

So back to G minor. Let's think why the G7 chord is there. Maybe it's a borrowed chord, like from G harmonic minor? But in G harmonic minor, F# is present, not F. But in the chord progression, we have F natural in F6. So F natural. So if harmonic minor has F#, but we're using F natural, maybe it's natural minor with a temporary alteration.

Or perhaps the G7 is not a G major chord but G minor? Wait, Bm(b5)/G – if Bm(b5) is B diminished, then the chord would be G, B, D, F. So B is natural. If the chord were G minor seventh, it would be G, Bb, D, F. But here the melody has B natural. So perhaps in the melody, it's a B natural, but the chord Gm7 would have Bb.

This is confusing. Maybe the notation is different. Let's see: sometimes "Bm(b5)" could be confusing. Bm with a flat fifth would be B, D, F. Yes. So Bm(b5) is Bdim.

So given all this, perhaps the key is G natural minor (Aeolian mode), and the B natural in the G7 chord is an outside note, or perhaps the progression uses a mix of modes.

But another idea: in G Aeolian mode, if you play a G major chord, but we have Gm. However, the chord G7 has B natural, which would be the major third. So this might be a case where the progression is modal but using the dominant 7th chord on the tonic.

Wait, but G dominant seventh would typically resolve to C major. If the progression is in G dominant mode or something else. Alternatively, if the key is Bb major? Let's check.

Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A.

Chords: Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F, Gm, Am. So Bb major has G minor as vi chord. If the progression starts with Gm and ends with Gm, then it could be in Bb major. Let's check all chords.

Gm (vi)

Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb – but Eb major chord would be IV in Bb major.

Bb/F: Bb major with F bass. Bb is I chord.

Bm(b5)/G: G7 chord. In Bb major, what's the G7 chord? G is vi chord, but G7 isn't diatonic. Bb major scale has G natural, A natural, Bb, etc. G7 chord has B natural, which is not in Bb major scale. Bb scale has Bb, so no B natural.

So that doesn't fit.

How about G minor? Yes.

Another angle: look at the F6 chord. F6 has A natural. In G minor natural minor, A natural is present. The F major chord (with added sixth D) fits since F is the VII in G minor.

Now, the problem is the G7 chord. Maybe in this context, G7 is intended as Gm7 but with a typo? Like maybe Bm(b5)/G is actually Bb something, but it's written as Bm(b5)/G.

Alternatively, maybe Bm(b5)/G is actually a B diminished over G, but in this context, it's functioning as V7 of C. If we consider that the progression might be modulating, but it starts and ends with Gm, so G minor would still be the home key.

Wait, but let's see the progression's structure. If we look at the F6 going to Gm – F major to G minor. That's a common cadence in minor keys (VII - i). For example, in G minor, F major to G minor is a common progression.

If we have Bb/F which we can think of as Bb major chord (III) with F in the bass. So Bb in the key of G minor.

And Eb/G would be Eb major (VI) with G bass. Yes.

Now, the Bm(b5)/G chord: if this is actually a G7 chord, then perhaps it's part of a secondary dominant. Like if the progression resolves to C somewhere, but in the progression given, after Bm(b5)/G comes Gm. So G7 to Gm. That would be a dominant seventh resolving to tonic minor, which isn't common – typically dominant seventh resolves to tonic major. Resolving to minor would be unusual.

But there are exceptions. In minor keys, sometimes the dominant chord is major (harmonic minor), but that would be D7 resolving to Gm. But here, the chord is G7, which is tonic chord dominant. If the tonic is minor, using dominant seventh on tonic is not standard.

Another possibility: Perhaps the Bm(b5)/G is not actually a dominant chord but something else. Let's check the notes of Bm(b5)/G again. Bm(b5) is Bdim: B, D, F. Slash G means G bass. So G, B, D, F. So this is a G7 chord, but spelled with B natural, D, F. Now in G minor, if we have a B natural, that suggests maybe they're in G Dorian mode? Wait no.

Wait, G Dorian mode is G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Wait, that has Bb, not B natural. So even in Dorian, it's Bb.

Unless... G Mixolydian? No, that would be G, A, B, C, D, E, F. But then the third is major B, but the tonality would be more major. But the chords include Gm – G Mixolydian major has G major chord. Not matching.

Wait, G Mixolydian: G, A, B, C, D, E, F. So G major chord with F natural (b7). But we have Gm chord as well – no, G Mixolydian has G major. So unless it's G minor Mixolydian? Not a thing.

Wait, let's think of another mode. If there is a G minor and G7 (with B natural), that suggests that the scale contains both Bb and B natural. Which would be the G melodic minor descending? But melodic minor ascending is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#; descending is G, F, Eb, D, C, Bb, A, G.

If we have both B natural and Bb, that implies a scale that has both, which would be not a standard mode, but a combination of harmonic and melodic.

Another thought: the key is G minor with a major third for the tonic chord – but that's a contradiction. Typically, minor has minor third.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and Bm(b5)/G is actually supposed to be Bb(b5)/G or something else. But assuming the notation is correct.

Wait, let's see. If we consider the notes for each chord with actual notes:

- Gm: G, Bb, D

- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (Eb major triad in 1st inversion – G bass)

- Bb/F: F, Bb, D (Bb major triad in 2nd inversion)

- Bm(b5)/G: G, B, D, F (G7)

- F6: F, A, C, D

So the notes in the entire progression include A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. So if we have both B natural and Bb, that's interesting. So this scale includes both B natural and Bb. Which suggests the scale might be using both raised and lowered thirds. That can happen in blues scales or other styles.

The G minor blues scale is G, Bb, C, Db, D, F – but this includes Db. We don't have Db here.

Another possibility: G harmonic minor ascending: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F# – but we don't have F#.

G natural minor: but missing B natural.

But the presence of B natural and Bb suggests the mode could be G Phrygian dominant? G Phrygian dominant: G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F. Yes. But let's see:

G Phrygian dominant: G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F.

So scale degrees:

1. G

b2. Ab

3. B

4. C

5. D

b6. Eb

b7. F

So this is also known as the fifth mode of F harmonic minor.

Now, chords in G Phrygian dominant:

i: Gm(7b9) or something. But typically, Phrygian dominant has a minor chord with altered degrees.

But let's see if the chords fit.

Gm chord: yes, G, Bb, D. But in Phrygian dominant, the third is B natural. Wait no! In G Phrygian dominant, the third is B natural. So G to B is major third, which would make it a G major chord. But the progression has Gm, which has Bb. So this doesn't fit because the scale's third is B natural, so Gm wouldn't be diatonic. G Phrygian dominant has G as root, so tonic chord would be G major? No. Let's see the scale notes:

G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F.

So triads:

G: G, B, D – G major.

Ab: Ab, B, Eb → Ab dim or minor? Ab, B (major third), Eb (dim fifth). So Ab dim.

B: B, D, F – Bdim.

C: C, Eb, G – Cm.

D: D, F, A – Dm with missing A? D, F, Ab? Wait, the scale doesn't have A natural. So D scale note of G Phrygian dominant: D, so D, F (minor third), Ab (dim fifth). So Ddim.

Eb: Eb, G, Bb? No. Eb, G (major third?), wait Eb, G in the scale: Eb to G is major third. G is in scale. So Eb major. Wait:

Eb: Eb, G, Bb. But Bb isn't in the scale. G Phrygian dominant has B, not Bb. So the scale notes don't include Bb or Ab. Wait:

G Phrygian dominant: G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F.

So scale has Ab (not G#), B, not Bb. So Eb is the major sixth.

So for example, G major chord would be G, B, D.

But in our progression, the chord Gm has Bb – which isn't present in this scale. So conflicting again.

Hmm.

Perhaps the best approach is to ignore the B natural for a moment and see if it fits G Aeolian. G Aeolian naturally has all those chords except for the B natural. The presence of B natural could be a chromatic passing tone or part of a borrowed chord.

Alternatively, maybe the key is G minor, and the chord Bm(b5)/G is actually a typo for something else. Like maybe it's supposed to be Bb(b5)/G or Bdim/G, but that would still be the same.

Wait, another idea: Bm(b5) could be misread. Sometimes "Bm(b5)" might mean Bm with flat fifth – B, D, F. Yes. So correct.

But in the key of E minor, for example. Let's check E minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Chords in E minor including Gm. Yes, Gm would be the ii chord. But the progression starts with Gm and ends with Gm – possible. Let's see. In E minor:

i: Em

ii: F#°

III: G

iv: Am

v: Bm

VI: C

VII: D

But our chords include Eb major? Eb isn't in E minor (which has E, F#, G, A, B, C, D). No Eb. So that doesn't fit.

Not likely.

Back to G minor. If all of this is in G minor, then the G7 chord with B natural is probably a chromatic passing chord or part of a secondary dominant. But G7 to Gm doesn't resolve traditionally. Usually, G7 would go to C major.

But maybe the progression is cyclic and the G7 is functioning as the V7 to C, but in the song's context, perhaps it's leading back to Gm or something else.

Alternatively, this could be in G minor with a Picardy third, but that's when the final chord is major. But here it ends with Gm.

Another angle: looking at the bass line. The bass notes are mostly G, with some F and G again. But the Eb/G chord – bass G is the same as Gm bass.

The Bb/F chord has bass F. So if we consider the bass line as G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G,... etc. It's not clear, but mostly G.

So tonic is G.

Let's consider modal interchange. If the key is G minor, then it's Aeolian mode. But using chords from other modes.

For example, the Bb major chord (III) is diatonic.

Eb major chord (VI) diatonic.

F major chord (VII) diatonic.

The G7 chord would be borrowed from the Mixolydian mode? But G Mixolydian is G major with F natural. But we have Gm chord as well. Not quite.

Alternatively, maybe the G7 chord is actually a IV chord for C major. Suppose the key is C major, but starts on Gm. In C major, Gm is the vi chord. But then the F6 would be F major with added sixth – in C major, F is IV, so F6 chord would be F major sixth. Then Eb major is III chord? In C major, Eb isn't diatonic (C major has Eb? No, C major is C, D, Eb? No, C major has E natural. So Eb would be bIII. Not diatonic. But the progression starts with Gm in C major as vi chord, but then Eb/G would be Eb major in C major – not diatonic. So not likely.

Another thought: if the key is D minor. D minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C. Let's see. Chords: Dm, E°, F, Gm, Am, Bb, C. So Gm is iv chord. But the progression starts with Gm, might not feel like tonic. But possible. Let's check chords:

Gm (iv)

Eb major: Eb would be bVI in D minor.

Bb major (III).

F6: F major (I chord). So F major sixth. If the key is D minor, F major is III (major chord), but usually III chord is F major or F minor? In D natural minor: F is the third degree, so F major chord. But the scale of D minor has F natural. Yes. D natural minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C. So yes, F is major third above D? No: D to F is minor third. Yes. So F major chord in D minor would include F, A, C. Which is diatonic. So F6 would be F, A, C, D. But in D minor scale, the scale has D, so D is present.

But the progression starts with Gm as first chord, which would be iv in D minor. And ends in Gm. Possible but unusual.

But let's check if chords fit. In D minor:

Eb major is bVI.

Bb major is V? No. Bb is bVII in D minor.

F major is III.

But Eb major chord: not sure.

But in the original progression with Gm Gm Eb/G etc., it might not make sense as D minor.

This is getting too complicated. Let's return to G minor.

If we consider the key of G minor, which has the standard minor key chords, and the presence of B natural in G7 is a chromatic passing tone or part of a secondary dominant. But how?

Alternatively, maybe this progression is in G natural minor, but the Bm(b5)/G chord is actually a G7 chord, which is used as a passing chord and not part of the modal key.

But the question is about determining key and mode. If the key is G minor, the mode would be Aeolian (natural minor).

Another check: list all the notes used and see if they fit a single scale. The notes present are A, B, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G.

This scale has both B natural and Bb, so it's not a standard seven-note scale. Unless it's a mode that includes chromatic passing notes.

But typically, for key determination, we look for the tonic and the scale degrees that define the mode.

Given that the progression starts and ends with Gm, and G is the most frequent bass note, and the chords Eb and F and Bb are all diatonic to G minor, I think the intended key is G minor with Aeolian mode.

The G7 chord (with B natural) might be a borrowed chord from another mode or a chromatic chord, but the overall tonality points to G minor. In many contexts, especially in popular music, a minor key progression can have occasional major chords or alterations for interest, even if the core mode is natural minor.

So even though there is a B natural in G7, the rest of the notes and chord usage suggest G minor. The G7 chord could be functioning as a V/iii or something else, but the tonic is likely G.

Alternatively, perhaps the Bm(b5)/G is not a G7 but perhaps a G minor 7th with Bb. Wait, Bm(b5)/G: if the slash is misinterpreted. For example, maybe Bm(b5) over G meaning G is the root and Bm(b5) is the chord, but that doesn't make sense. No, slash chords are chord/bass.

Wait, Bm(b5)/G is written as "Bm(b5)/G", which would be B minor flat fifth chord with G in the bass. So yes, chord is Bdim, root B, but bass G. So the chord notes include G, B, D, F.

But if we ignore the B natural for a second and consider the main chord tones, Gm has Bb. The presence of both Bb and B might indicate that the tonality is in G minor, and the B natural is part of a melodic line but not strictly part of the chord. But the chord Bm(b5)/G contains B natural, so it's part of the chord.

Another thought: Maybe the mode is G phrygian, which has Eb, so scale G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. But then there's no B natural, but we have B natural in G7. So not matching.

Wait, if G phrygian: G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. No B natural. So not matching.

G dorian has G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. So has A and Bb. No B natural.

G Aeolian has G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Still Bb.

So the only way to have both Bb and B natural is if it's either chromatic passing or part of a different structure. Like in jazz, minor 7th chords might have passing tones. But for key determination, the most prominent tonal center is G, and the chords fit G minor scale except for one note. So likely the key is G minor with Aeolian mode.

Perhaps the Bm(b5)/G chord is actually a different interpretation. Let's think outside the box. Maybe Bm(b5)/G is not B diminished over G, but G is the root and Bm(b5) is the chord, but that would mean G with Bm(b5) chord, which doesn't make sense. Slash chords are always [chord]/[bass note].

Alternatively, maybe the "Bm(b5)/G" is a typo and should be "Bbm/b5/G" or something else.

But assuming the notation is correct, perhaps it's in the key of G natural minor, with an alteration for the B. Or maybe the mode is different. Let's see if G phrygian has any chance. No, missing the Bb or B.

Another idea: Could the Bm(b5)/G be functioning as a IV chord in some way? Not sure.

Wait, let's look at the chords in a G minor context:

- Gm is i

- Eb is VI

- Bb is III

- F is VII

The only chord that seems out of place is Bm(b5)/G which is G7. But in some contexts, G7 can be used in minor key for a bluesy feel. Like "blues minor" where tonic is dominant 7th.

But typically, blues in minor uses i7 chord, which is Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F). If it were G7, that's G dominant 7th which implies a major tonality. But if the song is in G minor but using G7 for some reason, it might be a blues progression.

However, the chord progression includes both F natural and Eb, which fits minor scale.

Given all this, I think the most likely interpretation is that the key is G minor (Aeolian mode), and the presence of B natural in the G7 chord is a chromatic passing tone or borrowed from another mode. However, the main key center is G minor.

But to check more carefully: if this progression is in G minor, the diatonic chords are i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

Which are:

Gm, A°, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F.

In the progression provided:

Gm is i

Eb is VI (Eb major)

Bb is III (Bb major)

F is VII (F major)

The chord Bm(b5)/G as G7 doesn't fit because G7 is not diatonic. But maybe in context, it's a secondary dominant. For example, G7 leading to C, but then where is the C chord? The progression doesn't have C, but it does have F chords. Maybe G7 is the V of C, and C would be I, but the progression doesn't have C. This complicates things.

Another idea: if the key is C minor. Let's check. C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Then chords would be:

i: Cm

ii°: D°

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII: Bb

But the progression has Gm (v), Eb (III), F6 would be F major? In C minor, F minor is iv, but F major is not diatonic.

So not likely.

Back to G minor. Perhaps the song is in G minor but uses a D major or D7 chord for the V, but here it has G7. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the progression is using harmonic minor. Let's check G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#.

But our chords have F natural, not F#. So conflict. However, perhaps F6 chord is F major, which would mean F natural. So if harmonic minor has F#, but the progression has F natural, maybe the song is using natural minor for most parts and harmonic minor for some.

But in the absence of F#, it's more likely natural minor.

Another angle: look for the leading tone. In G minor harmonic minor, the dominant is D major, which has F# as the leading tone. But here there's no D major chord. Bb/F is Bb major, etc.

I think after considering all this, the simplest and most logical explanation is that the key is G minor, mode Aeolian. The G7 chord might be a temporary chromatic alteration or perhaps the Bm(b5)/G is being misread. Perhaps the slash chord is indicating something else. Wait, Bm(b5)/G could actually be a G minor chord with added Bb? No.

Wait, maybe the Bm(b5)/G is actually a B diminished over G bass, but in context of the song, perhaps it's functioning as part of G minor without raising the third. But the chord itself has B natural, which conflicts with G minor's third.

However, in some interpretations, if all the other chords fit G minor and the tonic is Gm, then we still consider G minor as the key, and the B natural is just a non-chord tone or borrowed.

Given that music theory questions like this are generally expecting a standard key and mode, and the majority of chord qualities fit G minor, I think the intended answer is G minor (Aeolian mode).

So key: G minor, mode: Aeolian.

Alternatively, to confirm, let's see if there's a major key that fits. If the key were G major, but the chords include Gm, so no.

Yes, G minor makes sense.

Another check: the F6 chord. In G minor, F major chord as VII is common in minor keys. F6 would be F major with added sixth (D), which is fine.

So I think after all this, the key is G minor in Aeolian mode.


The chord progression **Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm** is best interpreted as being in **G minor (Aeolian mode)**, with a few chromatic elements that do not disrupt the overall tonal center.

---

### **Key Analysis**
- **Tonic Note**: The progression begins and ends on **Gm**, and **G** is the dominant bass note throughout (e.g., "Eb/G" and "Bm(b5)/G" have **G in the bass**). This strongly suggests **G** is the tonic.
- **Diatonic Chords in G Minor (Aeolian)**:
  - **i**: Gm (G–B♭–D)
  - **III**: Bb (B♭–D–F)
  - **VI**: Eb (E♭–G–B♭)
  - **VII**: F (F–A–C)
  - These chords align perfectly with the diatonic structure of **G Aeolian** (natural minor scale: **G–A–B♭–C–D–E♭–F**).
- **Chord "Bm(b5)/G"**:
  - This is interpreted as a **B diminished triad (B–D–F)** with **G in the bass**, forming **G7 (G–B–D–F)**.
  - While **B natural** is not part of the natural minor scale (which has **B♭**), this is a common chromatic embellishment in minor-key progressions:
    - **G7** could function as a **secondary dominant** (e.g., V of **C**) or a blues-influenced G minor dominant chord.
    - In practice, minor-key progressions often blend natural minor (Aeolian) with chromatic alterations for harmonic interest.
- **F6 Chord**:  
  - **F–A–C–D** fits naturally in G minor (F is the VII chord, and the added **D** is the 5th degree of the scale). This is a standard extension in minor-key music.

---

### **Why Not Other Possibilities?**
- **G Harmonic Minor**: Requires **F#**, but the progression uses **F natural** (e.g., in **F6**), so this does not fit.
- **G Major or Other Modes**: Confirmed by the presence of **Gm** as the tonic chord, which rules out major keys.
- **D Minor or Other Keys**: Other candidates (e.g., D minor) fail because **Eb** and **Bb** do not align diatonically with them.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **G minor**  
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**  
- **Notes**: The scale is **G–A–B♭–C–D–E♭–F**.  
- **Chromatic Note**: The **B natural** in **G7 (from Bm(b5)/G)** is a temporary chromatic alteration, common in minor-key idioms (e.g., for bluesy or modal interchange flavor), but does not change the fundamental key.

This progression is characteristic of a **G minor/Aeolian** tonality with subtle chromatic inflections, typical in jazz, pop, or film score contexts where harmonic color is added to a stable minor key. 

**Final Answer**:  
**Key:** G minor  
**Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor)
