Let's analyze the chord sequence step by step to determine the **key and mode**:

---

### **Chords (Given)**

We are given:

**Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm Bb/F Bm(b5)/G Gm Gm Eb/G Eb/G Gm Gm F6 Gm**

Let's simplify the inversions and ambiguous chords:

1. **Gm** – G minor triad: G–Bb–D
2. **Eb/G** – Eb major triad with G in bass: Eb–G–Bb (no 5th), but G bass → suggests Eb major with G bass
3. **Bb/F** – Bb major triad with F in bass
4. **Bm(b5)/G** – B minor diminished triad (B–D–F), with G in bass → basically **B°/G** (half-diminished is Bm7b5, but this is **Bmb5**, so likely **B diminished triad** inverted)
5. **F6** – F major with added 6th: F–A–C–D

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Tonic / Key Center**

The chord **Gm** appears **very frequently** — at the beginning, end, and multiple times. It acts as a home base.

So, suggests **G** as the tonal center.

Are we in **G major** or **G minor**?

There are **no G major chords** — all tonic-like chords are **Gm**.

Also, the **Eb major** chord appears multiple times. In the key of **G minor**, **Eb major** is the **VI chord** — very common.

In **G major**, Eb would be **♭VI**, which is a modal or borrowed chord, less likely as a core diatonic chord.

So, **G minor** is strongly suggested.

---

### **Step 2: Check Notes / Diatonic Fit in G Minor**

Natural G minor scale:  
**G – A – Bb – C – D – Eb – F – G**

Let’s see what notes are in the chords:

- **Gm**: G–Bb–D → all in G natural minor ✅
- **Eb/G**: Eb–G–Bb → Eb is VI, G is root → ✅ diatonic
- **Bb/F**: Bb–D–F → Bb is VII, F is 4th → all in G minor ✅
- **Bm(b5)/G**: B–D–F → B diminished triad (B°). In G minor, B natural is the 3rd degree, and D is 5th, F is 7th → **B–D–F** is **vii°**, which is **B°** — the **leading tone diminished triad** — this implies **harmonic minor** usage (raised 7th → F#? Wait — no!)

Wait: In **G natural minor**, 7th is **F**, not F#.

But **B°** is B–D–F — that’s built on the 3rd degree of G minor (B), with minor 3rd (D) and minor 6th from B? Let's check intervals:

From B:  
- B to D = minor 3rd  
- D to F = minor 3rd → so **B–D–F** is a **diminished triad**

In G major, **vii°** is F#–A–C → F#°  
In G **minor**, if we use **natural minor**, 7th is F → so **vii°** would be F–A–C → **F°**, built on ♭VII

But **B°** (B–D–F) is built on scale degree **3** — and in **natural minor**, 3rd degree is **Bb**, not B natural.

Ah! Here's the key point:

> If we have **B natural**, not **Bb**, that means the **3rd scale degree is major** — which is characteristic of **G harmonic minor**, because **raising the 7th (F → F#)** makes the **3rd above G (B)** become **B natural**?

Wait — no: **G to B natural** is a **major 3rd**, regardless of minor mode — it's just that in minor, the 3rd is **flatted** compared to major.

Actually:

- G **major**: G–A–B–C–D–E–F# → B is natural
- G **natural minor**: G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F → Bb

So **B natural** is **NOT** in G natural minor.

But the chord is **Bm(b5)** → B–D–F → this uses **B natural**, **D**, **F**

So **B natural** appears — that’s **scale degree 3**, but **raised** compared to G minor.

But B natural is **part of G major**, not G minor.

However — this chord is **B°** (B–D–F), which is a **diminished triad on the 3rd degree** — and in the key of **G**, that would be **iii°**, which is **rare** in major, but **in minor**, we don’t expect B natural.

Unless — is this implying **G harmonic minor**?

Let’s recall:

> **G harmonic minor**: G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–**F#**

Raised 7th → **F#**

But the chord is **B–D–F** → **F natural**, not F#

So **F is natural**, not F#

Therefore:  
- B natural → not in G natural minor (which has Bb)  
- But F natural → contradicts harmonic minor (which has F#)

So we have **both B natural** and **F natural** — that’s a **tritone** — but they’re **not** in the same scale.

Wait — that seems **modal mixture** or **chromaticism**, but maybe we're misreading the chord.

Let’s double-check: **Bm(b5)/G**

- “Bm(b5)” usually means **B minor triad with flat 5** → B–D–F → that’s **B diminished triad**, same as **B°**
- It’s a **diminished triad**, not half-diminished (which would be Bm7b5: B–D–F–A)

So it's just **B°**, and bass is **G**

So notes: **G (bass), B, D, F**

So full sonority: **G–B–D–F** → that’s **G7** without the 5th? Or **G7 in third inversion**?

Wait:  
**G–B–D–F** = **G7** — **dominant 7th chord in C major/minor**

But here, bass is **G**, and chords are: **B°/G** → meaning **B diminished triad over G bass**

So: **G in bass**, plus **B–D–F** → so total: **G–B–D–F**

That’s **G7** — **G dominant 7th**

Even though labeled as **Bm(b5)/G**, it's functioning as **G7**

Because:  
- G (root)  
- B (major 3rd)  
- D (5th)  
- F (minor 7th)

→ **G7**

So despite the slash chord name, **this is G7 in root position** — G in bass, and upper notes B–D–F — perfect.

So **Bm(b5)/G** = **G7**

✅ So we can **reinterpret** this chord as **G7**

Similarly:

- **Eb/G** — Eb triad with G bass → notes: G–Eb–Bb → that's **Eb major in first inversion** (Eb/G = 2nd inversion: 5th in bass) — yes, G is the 3rd of Eb, so it's **first inversion**? Wait:

Eb major: Eb (root), G (3rd), Bb (5th)

So **G in bass** → **first inversion** → **Eb/G = Eb6** in figured bass, but still just **Eb major, 1st inv**

✅ Diatonic in G minor?  
Eb is **VI** in G minor → yes, common.

**Bb/F** → Bb major, F in bass → **2nd inversion** → **Bb6/4** — still **Bb major**, which is **VII** in G minor (natural minor) → yes, common.

**F6** → F–A–C–D → that's **F major with added 6th**, or **F6**

In G minor:  
F = ♭VII, A = 2nd, C = 4th, D = 5th → all diatonic except:  
A is **natural**, which is in G minor (both natural and harmonic) — yes, A is 2nd degree → **natural**

So F6: F–A–C–D → all notes in **G natural minor** ✅

### **Final Chord Functions in G Minor**

Let’s write the progression with **functional analysis**:

| Chord | Likely Function | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Gm | i | tonic |
| Gm | i | |
| Eb/G | VI (1st inv) | submediant |
| Eb/G | VI | |
| Gm | i | return to tonic |
| Gm | i | |
| Bb/F | VII (2nd inv) | in minor, VII is major (from natural minor) — acts as dominant preparation |
| Bm(b5)/G → **G7** | V7 | **dominant** → strong pull to tonic |
| Gm | i | resolution! |
| Gm | i | |
| Eb/G | VI | |
| Eb/G | VI | |
| Gm | i | |
| Gm | i | |
| F6 | ♭VII | neighbor or plagal? Or pre-dominant? |
| Gm | i | ends on tonic |

Wait — **F6 → Gm** — that’s **♭VII → i** — very common in minor keys — **plagal** or **modal** movement — no issue.

And the **G7 → Gm** is **V → i** — **perfect cadence**

Even though **G7** has **B natural** (major 3rd) and **F natural** (minor 7th), that’s **standard dominant chord in minor** — because:

> In **minor keys**, the **V chord** is **major** (even though diatonic 7th is minor), due to **harmonic minor** raising of 7th → **F → F#** for **V or V7**

But here — the **G7** has **F natural**, not F#?

Wait — **G7** = G–B–D–F → **F natural**

But **V7 in G minor** should be **D7**: D–F#–A–C — **F#**, not F

But this chord is **G7** — **not D7**

So **G7** is **NOT V7 of G minor** — it’s **♭VII7**? Or **I7**?

**G7** in the key of **G minor** is **I7** — **tonic with minor 7th**

That’s **not a dominant** — it’s a **tonic chord with added bluesy 7th**, or it could be **borrowed**, but **where does it resolve?**

It resolves **to Gm** — **I7 → i** — **no change in root**, just **softening** — very common in **blues, rock, jazz** — **tonic dominant 7th**

So **G7 → Gm** is **not a cadence** — it’s just **embellishment of tonic**

So **no modulation** — just **chromatic inflection** on tonic

But **B natural** comes from **G7**, and **F natural** is already present — so **no F#** required — it’s just **mixing in a bluesy I7**

Still, **B natural** is **not in G natural minor**, but it's **brief** — **chromatic** — acceptable as **tonic coloring**

So **no strong move to major** — **tonic remains minor**

---

### **Conclusion: Key and Mode**

- **Tonic**: **G**
- **Quality**: predominantly **minor** — **Gm** is home, start, end, and most frequent
- **Scale**: primarily **G natural minor** (uses Eb, Bb, F)
- **Chromatic tone**: **B natural** appears in **G7** (I7) — but **no F#**, so **harmonic minor** is **not fully invoked** — just **tonic embellishment**
- **No major tonic** — **no G major chords**
- **VI (Eb)** and **VII (Bb, F)** are major — typical of **natural minor**

✅ Therefore, this is in:

> **G minor** — specifically **natural minor** with **chromatic inflection** (B natural in I7), but **mode is minor**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: G minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  
*(with brief chromatic use of B natural in a tonic dominant 7th chord — i.e., I7)*
