**Determining Chord Keys and Modes**

I'm currently focused on the chord tones and roots within this progression. I've listed the chords and am now cross-referencing to determine the underlying harmonic structure. The goal is to uncover the key and mode, which will then guide my harmonic analysis of the chord choices. It's a bit of a puzzle, but I'm getting there.


**Mapping Harmonic Functions**

I've clarified the role of each chord within the assumed G minor context. I've classified Gm as the tonic, Eb as the bVI, and F (including F6) as the bVII. I'm now exploring the implications of the Bm(b5) chord. Its diminished quality hints at a potential modulation or a more complex harmonic function.


**Unraveling Modal Implications**

Considering the Bm(b5) /G, I'm now leaning towards a G natural minor/Aeolian framework, as the bass note is G, and its lack of resolution to C or D major, or a clear dominant, seems to preclude a dominant function for Bdim. The F natural further supports this. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic elements.


**Re-evaluating Chord Functions**

I'm now revisiting the diminished chord, initially considering it a potential modulation point or leading tone chord. However, the presence of F natural and the overall harmonic flow steer me towards understanding it as a passing chord, adding chromatic color without significantly altering the G minor context. The analysis of chord roots has been pivotal.


**Synthesizing Harmonic Insights**

I've finalized my analysis, confirming the key as G minor and the mode as Aeolian (natural minor). The chord progression's structure (i - bVI - III - bVII) strongly supports this. The passing function of the diminished chord and the absence of a dominant chord further corroborate my mode determination.




The analysis of the given chord progression reveals the harmonic center, the prevailing scale degrees, and the overall modality.

## 1. Determine the Key Center (Tonic)

The progression begins and ends on **Gm (G minor)**, and Gm is the most frequently repeated chord. This overwhelmingly establishes **G** as the tonal center and that the key is in a **minor** modality.

## 2. Analyze Chord Relationships

We relate the chords back to the G minor root (G - Bb - D).

| Chord | Function in G Minor | Notes | Characteristic Interval |
| :---: | :---: | :-----: | :---: |
| **Gm** | **i** (Tonic) | G-Bb-D | |
| **Eb** | **bVI** (Submediant Major) | Eb-G-Bb | Uses the minor sixth (Eb) |
| **Bb** | **III** (Relative Major) | Bb-D-F | |
| **F** / **F6** | **bVII** (Subtonic Major) | F-A-C-D | Uses the minor seventh (F) |
| **Bm(b5)** | Passing/Chromatic | B-D-F | The root is G. This acts as a chromatic approach or a function of leading-tone diminished, but is rooted on G (G-B-D-F), often a passing tension $G7(b9)$ or simply a temporary diminished $\text{vii}^{\circ}$ before returning to $\text{i}$. |

## 3. Determine the Mode

The critical factor for determining mode in a minor key is the quality of the sixth and seventh scale degrees.

1.  **Sixth Degree:** The use of **Eb** (the chord $\text{bVI}$) establishes the minor sixth degree.
2.  **Seventh Degree:** The use of **F major** ($\text{bVII}$) establishes the minor seventh degree (F natural).

Since the progression uses the minor sixth ($\text{Eb}$) and the minor seventh ($\text{F}$ natural) instead of the raised seventh ($\text{F\#}$) required for the Harmonic or Melodic minor, the scale is the **Natural Minor Scale**.

## Conclusion

*   **Key:** **G minor**
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian** (Natural Minor)
