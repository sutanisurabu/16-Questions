### Reasoning

Hmm, this is a chord progression analysis request. The user provided a sequence of chords and wants to know the key and mode. 

First, I need to identify the most likely tonal center by looking at recurring chords and resolutions. Gm appears frequently and feels like the home chord. The progression starts and ends on Gm, which strongly suggests it's the tonic. 

Next, I should check the scale degrees to confirm the mode. The presence of Eb and Bb points to G natural minor (Aeolian) rather than Dorian since there's no F#. The Bm(b5) is just a passing chord that doesn't affect the overall key. 

The F6 chord creates a nice modal interchange moment but doesn't change the fundamental key. I'll explain this while keeping the analysis clear and educational, showing how each chord functions in the progression.

Of course. Let's break this chord progression down.

### Summary

*   **Key:** **G Minor**
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian (Natural Minor)**

### Detailed Analysis

Here is the progression written more clearly:

1.  Gm
2.  Gm
3.  Eb/G
4.  Eb/G
5.  Gm
6.  Gm
7.  Bb/F
8.  Bm(b5)/G
9.  Gm
10. Gm
11. Eb/G
12. Eb/G
13. Gm
14. Gm
15. F6
16. Gm

#### Step 1: Finding the Tonal Center (The "Home" Chord)

The chord **Gm** is overwhelmingly the most frequent chord. It starts the progression, ends the progression, and appears repeatedly throughout. This is the strongest possible indicator that **Gm is the tonic**, the central "home" chord of the piece.

#### Step 2: Determining the Mode (Major or Minor?)

Since the tonic is Gm, we are in a **G Minor** key. Now we need to figure out which type of minor scale is being used. The most common are:
*   **Natural Minor (Aeolian):** G A Bb C D Eb F G
*   **Harmonic Minor:** G A Bb C D Eb F# G
*   **Dorian:** G A Bb C D E F G

Let's look at the other chords in the progression:

*   **Eb Major (Eb/G):** The notes in an Eb chord are **Eb, G, Bb**. The Eb is the key clue here. In the key of G Natural Minor, the VI chord is Eb Major. In G Harmonic Minor, the VI chord would be an augmented chord (Eb+ or Ebaug), which this is not. The presence of a plain, consonant Eb Major chord strongly points to **G Natural Minor**.
*   **Bb Major (Bb/F):** The notes are **Bb, D, F**. In G Natural Minor, the V chord is Bb Major. (In a traditional minor key, the V chord is often made major, like D Major, to create a stronger pull back to the tonic, but that is not the case here).
*   **B Diminished (Bm(b5)/G):** This is a B diminished chord over a G bass. The notes are **B, D, F, (G)**. A B diminished triad (B, D, F) is the **viiÂ° chord** in the key of C Major. However, in this context, it's functioning as a passing chord. The G in the bass makes it feel like a slight variation or tension on the Gm chord itself. It doesn't contradict the G minor key; it just adds color.
*   **F6:** The notes are **F, A, C, D**. This is a very interesting chord. The F is the **bVII** chord in the key of G Minor. The 6 (D) adds a sweet, open sound. The presence of a major chord on the flattened 7th scale degree (F Major) is extremely common in rock, pop, and folk music that uses the Aeolian mode. This is another very strong indicator that we are in **G Aeolian/Natural Minor** and not the classical Harmonic Minor scale.

#### Conclusion

The entire progression is built from chords that exist diatonically (naturally) within the **G Natural Minor scale (G Aeolian mode)**:

*   **i chord:** Gm
*   **VI chord:** Eb
*   **v chord:** Bb (It's major, not minor, which is a feature of Aeolian)
*   **bVII chord:** F

The Bm(b5)/G is the only non-diatonic chord, and as a passing chord with the tonic G in the bass, it doesn't challenge the established key.

Therefore, the key is unequivocally **G Minor**, and the specific flavor of minor being used is the **Aeolian mode**.
