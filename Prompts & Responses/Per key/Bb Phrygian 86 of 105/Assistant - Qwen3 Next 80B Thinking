**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chords: Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at the chord symbols. Some of them have slashes, like Gb/Bb, which means Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. Similarly, Db/Ab is Db major with Ab in the bass, and B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass. Then there's Abm6, which is A-flat minor sixth. The rest are Bbm (B-flat minor) and others. So I need to list out all the chords without the slashes to understand the actual chord qualities.

Let me rewrite the chords in root position to make it clearer. So:

- Bbm: that's B-flat minor, so notes Bb, Db, F.
- Gb/Bb: this is a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. So the root is Gb, but the bass note is Bb. The actual chord is Gb major (Gb, Bb, Db), but since Bb is in the bass, it's a first inversion of Gb major? Wait, no. A Gb major chord in first inversion would have Bb as the lowest note. But Gb major has notes Gb, Bb, Db. So if Bb is the bass, it's Gb/Bb, which is first inversion of Gb major. But sometimes slash chords like this are used for pedal points or to indicate the bass note explicitly.

Similarly, Db/Ab: Db major chord with Ab in the bass. Db major notes are Db, F, Ab. So Ab is the fifth of the chord. So Db/Ab is Db major in second inversion? Because the fifth is in the bass. Wait, no. Db major: Db (root), F (third), Ab (fifth). So if the bass is Ab, that's fifth in the bass, so second inversion.

B/Bb: B major chord with Bb in the bass. Wait, that's a bit confusing. B major chord is B, D#, F#. But here the bass is Bb. So the chord would be B major with Bb not part of the chord? That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's supposed to be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's B over Bb, but that doesn't make much sense. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a B major chord with a Bb bass, which would be a polychord or something. But that seems unusual. Maybe it's a typo and should be Bb major? But no, it says B/Bb.

Alternatively, perhaps B/Bb is meant to be B major chord with Bb as the bass note, which would imply that the chord is B major, but with a Bb in the bass. So the notes would be Bb, B, D#, F#. But that includes both Bb and B, which is a dissonance. That seems odd. Maybe it's a B7 chord with Bb in the bass? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake. Maybe B/Bb is supposed to be Bbm? But the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, maybe it's a B major chord with Bb as the bass note, but that's a bit strange. Let me note that as possible.

Then Abm6: A-flat minor sixth. So A-flat minor chord with a sixth added. A-flat minor is Ab, Cb, Eb; sixth would be F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. But usually, minor sixth chords have the sixth above the root. So Ab minor sixth would be Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

But wait, Cb is B natural? No, in standard notation, Cb is B natural. But sometimes it's written as B, but technically, in key of Ab minor, the minor scale has Ab, Bbb (which is A), but wait, no. Let's clarify. The natural minor scale of Ab minor is Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. Wait, but usually we would write the minor scale with enharmonic equivalents for readability. But Cb is equivalent to B natural. Hmm. But Abm6 would typically be written as Ab, Cb (which is B), Eb, F. But F is the sixth above Ab. So the chord would be Ab, B, Eb, F. But that might be considered as Ab minor with an added sixth, which is also equivalent to F minor with Ab in the bass. But maybe.

But perhaps Abm6 is just Ab minor with a sixth, so Ab, Cb, Eb, F. But since Cb is B natural, that chord is Ab, B, Eb, F. Which are notes A-flat, B, E-flat, F.

Hmm, okay. Let me list all chords:

1. Bbm: Bb, Db, F

2. Bbm: same

3. Gb/Bb: bass is Bb, so chords notes Gb, Bb, Db (root position is Gb, Bb, Db; so Gb/Bb is Bb in bass, so Gb major first inversion)

Similarly, Gb/Bb: Gb major with Bb bass.

4. Gb/Bb same

5. Bbm

6. Bbm

7. Db/Ab: Db major with Ab in bass. Db, F, Ab. Ab is fifth of Db chord, so second inversion.

8. B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. So the chord has notes B, D#, F# and bass Bb. So Bb, B, D#, F#. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo? Maybe it's meant to be Bb? Or Bb major? But the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, perhaps B/Bb is a B major chord over Bb bass, which could be considered as a Bmaj7#5 or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a B7 chord, but B7 has B, D#, F#, A. But with Bb in the bass, that would be a dissonant chord. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for Bb/Bb, but the user wrote B/Bb. Maybe they meant Bb major chord with Bb in bass? But that's just root position Bb major. That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a slash chord where the top note is B and bass Bb, but that would be a B over Bb, which is a bit unclear. Maybe the user meant something else. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe B/Bb is a B dominant seventh with Bb bass? No, B7 has B, D#, F#, A. If bass is Bb, then the notes are Bb, B, D#, F#, A. That's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's a B major chord with an added major seventh? Wait, B major chord with Bb in bass... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the slash chord is B/Bb meaning the bass is Bb and the chord is B major? So B major triad over Bb bass. So the chord would be Bb (bass), then B, D#, F#. But that's very dissonant because of the B and Bb in close proximity. Maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be Bb/Bb? But the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, maybe it's a Bdim chord? No, but B/Bb would be different. This is a bit confusing. Let's note that as a possible typo or something odd.

Moving on. Then Bbm again, etc., then Abm6. So Abm6 is Ab minor sixth.

Let me list all chords:

- Bbm (x4 times)

- Gb/Bb (x2)

- Db/Ab (once)

- B/Bb (once)

- Abm6 (once)

So in total:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, B/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6, Bbm

Hmm. Now, perhaps looking at the chord qualities. Let's convert all slash chords to their basic chord qualities. But perhaps it's better to look at the bass notes and the chord qualities.

So let's break down each chord:

1. Bbm: root Bb, minor

2. Bbm

3. Gb/Bb: bass Bb, chord Gb major (so Gb-Bb-Db)

4. Gb/Bb same

5. Bbm

6. Bbm

7. Db/Ab: bass Ab, chord Db major (Db-F-Ab)

8. B/Bb: bass Bb, chord B major (B-D#-F#) ?

Wait, if it's B/Bb, then the chords notes are bass Bb, and then chord B major. So notes: Bb (bass), B, D#, F#. That's a lot of semitones. But maybe that's intentional? Alternatively, perhaps this is a typo for Bb/Bb, which would be normal, but the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, Bb major over Bb bass? No, Bb/Bb would just be Bb major. But the user wrote B/Bb. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the slash chord is written as top note over bass? No, usually slash chords are chord / bass note. So B/Bb would mean a B chord (triad or whatever) with Bb as bass. So yes, the chord is B major, bass note Bb.

But that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a miswriting of Bb/Bb? Which would just be Bb. But the user wrote B/Bb. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's Bb7 or something else. Let's see. Let's tentatively take it as B major chord over Bb bass. Though that's a bit odd.

Alternatively, maybe B/Bb is supposed to be Bb/Bb, but the user mistyped the B as a Bb. Or maybe it's supposed to be something like B7/Bb? That could be, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misspelling of Bb/Bb. But regardless, let's proceed.

Moving on, so the other chords: Abm6, which is A-flat minor sixth. So Ab chord with minor third and added sixth. So notes Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which in practical terms is Ab, B, Eb, F.

Now, perhaps looking at the bass notes to see a pattern. Let's list the bass notes for each chord:

1. Bbm: bass Bb

2. Bbm: Bb

3. Gb/Bb: bass Bb (since the slash is Bb)

Wait, slash chords indicate the bass note, so yes: Gb/Bb means Gb chord with Bass Bb.

So bass note is Bb for chord 3.

Similarly:

Chord 4: same, bass Bb

Chord 5-6: Bbm, bass Bb

Chord7: Db/Ab: bass Ab

Chord8: B/Bb: bass Bb

Chord9-10: Bbm: bass Bb

Chord11-12: Gb/Bb: bass Bb

Chord13-14: Bbm: bass Bb

Chord15: Abm6: bass could be Ab (if root position), but the chord is Abm6, which in root position has bass Ab, but if it's written without slash, then yes.

Chord16: Bbm: Bb

So let's list all bass notes:

Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab (assuming Abm6 is root position), Bb

Wait, Abm6 typically would have Ab as bass note if it's in root position. So chord 15 bass is Ab.

So bass notes sequence:

Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb

So the bass notes are mostly Bb, with some Ab in there.

Now, looking at the chords themselves. The chord symbol is like Bbm, so the chord quality is minor. Gb/Bb is a Gb major chord (since Gb is the root, Bb as bass). So Gb major.

Db/Ab is Db major chord.

Abm6 is minor sixth chord.

If we ignore the bass notes for a moment and look at the chord roots:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb (major), Gb (major), Bbm etc. So the chord roots: Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, Db, B, Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb.

So chord roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, Ab.

This is a bit confusing. Now, let's see what scale these notes might fit into. Let's list all chord notes.

First, Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

Db major: Db, F, Ab

B major: B, D#, F#

Abm6: Ab, B (since Cb is B), Eb, F

Wait, Abm6 = Ab minor with sixth. So minor triad is Ab, Cb, Eb. Sixth would be F (since 6th above Ab is F). So chord notes: Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Cb is B natural. So Ab, B, Eb, F.

But in Ab minor key, the diatonic notes would be Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But with the minor sixth, it's the natural minor, so yes, adding F.

But B major chord has notes B, D#, F#. So that's a lot of sharps, which might not fit into a flat key.

Alternatively, maybe the B/Bb is a typo. Let's consider that possibilities. If it's supposed to be Bb/Bb, then the chord is Bb major. That would make more sense. Maybe a typo. Because otherwise, B major chord in a key with flats seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the chord is Bb7? But Bb7 would be Bb, D, F, Ab. But written as B/Bb? No.

Another thought: sometimes slash chords can be used for pedal point. For example, the bass note stays Bb a lot. The bass is mostly Bb, which might indicate that Bb is the tonic or a pedal tone.

So if Bb is the bass throughout, with chords changing above. Let's see.

Bbm chord is Bb minor. So if Bb is the tonic, then Bbm would be the i chord. But then other chords: Gb major. In Bb minor, what's Gb major? Let's look at the harmonic and melodic minor scales.

In Bb natural minor: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb (or Gbb, but better written as A natural? Wait no.

Wait Bb natural minor scale: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb. Hmm, Abb is A, but actually the correct spelling would be: Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb (A♭). Wait, no. Natural minor of Bb: the key signature has two flats (Bb, Eb). Wait, yes: Bb minor key signature is actually two flats? Wait no. Wait, Bb minor is the relative minor of Db major. Db major has four flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. So relative minor is Bb minor (since Db major's 6th scale degree is Bb). Wait, yes: the key of Bb minor has a key signature of four flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. Wait, but natural minor scale would be Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb? Wait, no. Let's get this right.

Natural minor scale for Bb minor starts on Bb, the notes would be: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb (but usually spelled as A natural? No, in standard notation, it's Ab. Wait, Eb? Wait: Bb minor scale.

The natural minor scale is the same as the Aeolian mode of the major scale. So Bb natural minor is the same as Db major scale starting on Bb.

Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So the Aeolian mode on Bb would be Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb? Wait, no: from Db major, the 6th degree is Bb. So Bb natural minor is the Aeolian mode of Db major. So notes in Bb natural minor: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb (which is A natural, but that's confusing). Wait, in standard terms, the Bb natural minor scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. Wait, but that's not right because C would be C natural, but in Db major scale (key of Db), the notes are Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So yes, the Bb natural minor scale would have these notes.

Wait, yes: the Bb natural minor scale is based on the Db major scale (which has four flats), so the notes would be Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. Wait, no: Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So the notes of Db major.

If you take Bb as the root to form the natural minor, it's the 6th degree of Db major. So the Bb natural minor scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A? Wait, no: let's list all degrees.

From Db major scale:

1. Db

2. Eb

3. F

4. Gb

5. Ab

6. Bb

7. C

8. Db

So the natural minor chord scale on Bb (as the 6th degree) would have the same notes:

Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb.

Wait, but in this notation, the scale would be Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

Wait, but C is natural? Yes. And A natural. So key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), but in actual practice, the Bb natural minor scale uses these notes. So Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

So diatonic chords in Bb natural minor:

i - Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

ii° - C diminished (C, Eb, Gb)

III - Eb major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

iv - F minor (F, Ab, C)

v - Gb minor (Gb, Bb, Db), but wait, actually in minor scale the 5th chord is usually diminished in natural minor, but wait:

Wait let's check diatonic chords in Bb minor:

Using the natural minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

So chords:

i: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

ii°: C diminished (C, Eb, Gb)

III: Eb major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

iv: F minor (F, Ab, C) – but Ab is not in the scale; wait the scale has A natural and Gb, but Ab would be a flat A? Wait, in Bb natural minor scale, the notes are Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. So no Ab or Bb. Wait, C is natural, Db is flat D, Eb is E flat, F is natural, Gb, A natural.

So the chords:

i: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

ii°: C, Eb, Gb = C diminished

III: Eb major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

iv: F minor? F, Ab, C – but Ab is not in the scale. Wait, the scale has A natural, so F minor chord would need Ab, but Ab is not present. Wait, F minor chord: F, Ab, C – but Ab isn't in Bb natural minor scale. The scale has A natural, not Ab. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps better to construct diatonic chords properly. The natural minor scale is 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7.

So for Bb natural minor:

1: Bb

2: C

b3: Db

4: Eb

5: F

b6: Gb

b7: Ab

Wait, no! Wait, minor scale has b3, b6, b7.

So Bb minor:

root: Bb

b3: Db

b7: Ab

b6: Gb

So natural minor scale for Bb: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Yes! I think I made a mistake earlier. The natural minor scale of Bb has Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So A flat, not A natural. Because the 7th degree in minor is a b7. So for Bb minor, the diatonic 7th is Ab. Yes.

So key signature would be 5 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, Db major has four flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. The relative minor of Db major is Bb minor. So the key signature for Bb minor is the same as Db major, which is four flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. So yes, in the natural minor scale of Bb, the scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Yes. So the 7th is Ab. So that makes sense. So all chords would use these notes.

So diatonic chords in Bb natural minor:

i: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

ii°: C diminished (C, Eb, Gb)

III: Eb major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

iv: F minor (F, Ab, C)

v°: Gb diminished (Gb, Bb, Db)? Wait, fifth chord: starting on F scale degree: 5th note is F, so F to Gb? Wait:

Scale steps:

1: Bb

2: C

3: Db

4: Eb

5: F

6: Gb

7: Ab

So chord on 5th degree (F): F, Ab, C. But that's F minor, which is iv. Wait, the v chord is the fifth degree, which is F, but wait:

Wait, the chords built on each degree:

i: Bb minor

ii°: Cdim

III: Eb major

iv: F minor

v: Gb minor (since the fifth note Gb is the root? No, the fifth degree of the scale is F. Wait, no. Let's list all chords:

Degree 1: Bb - minor chord (Bb, Db, F)

Degree 2: C - diminished (C, Eb, Gb)

Degree 3: Eb - major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

Degree 4: Eb? Wait, no. Scale degree 4 is Eb. So chord is Eb, Gb, Bb? Wait, no. Wait, the chord built on 4th degree of Bb minor scale (which is Eb):

Eb, Gb, Bb, Dbb? No, triads only. So Eb, Gb, Bb? Yes: Eb major chord.

Wait, Eb minor? No. Eb as root, third is Gb, fifth is Bb. Yes, Eb major.

Degree 5: F. The chord built on F: F, Ab, C. So F minor.

Degree 6: Gb. Chord is Gb, Bb, Db. Which is Gb major.

Degree 7: Ab. Chord is Ab, Cb, Eb. But Cb is B, so Ab diminished chord? Ab, Cb, Eb. Cb is B natural, which would make it Ab, B, Eb. So diminished? Let's see: Ab to Cb is minor third (Cb is B), and Cb to Eb is minor third, so yes, Ab diminished. But in natural minor, the vii chord is diminished.

Wait, natural minor scale diatonic chords:

i: minor

ii°: diminished

III: major

iv: minor

v: minor (but in harmonic minor, it's major)

vi: major

vii°: diminished

So for Bb minor:

i: Bb minor

ii°: C diminished

III: Eb major

iv: F minor

v: Gb minor? Wait, scale degree 5 is F, chord F minor.

Scale degree 6 is Gb, chord Gb major.

Scale degree 7 is Ab, chord Ab diminished.

Wait, yes.

So diatonic chords:

i: Bb minor

ii°: Cdim

III: Eb Major (but Eb could also be considered as a major chord in minor key)

iv: F minor

v: Gb minor (no, scale degree 5 chord is F minor. Scale degree 5 note is F, chord built on F is F minor.

vi: Gb major

vii°: Ab diminished.

But typically, in minor keys, the v chord is often raised to a major 5th chord for stronger cadence. So harmonic minor would have the raised 7th. So Bb harmonic minor would have Ab raised to A natural. So the v chord is Gb major.

But let's get back. So in Bb minor key, chords present would be Bbm, Eb, Fm, Gbm (if natural or harmonic), etc.

Now looking at the chord sequence given:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb (which is Gb major chords), Db/Ab (Db major chord), B/Bb (unknown), Abm6, etc.

In the context of Bb minor, Gb major could be the vi chord (since vi in Bb minor is Gb major). Because as per above, vi is Gb major.

Db major: Db is the III chord? Wait no. In Bb minor, the III chord is Eb major. Wait, no:

Wait chord on III: yes, Eb major. So Db major would be... where does Db fit in?

Wait Bb minor scale notes: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So Db is the third degree. So chord on Db would be Db diminished? Wait, the diatonic chord built on second degree (C) is diminished, third degree Db chord: Db, F, Ab. Which is Db major? Db (root), F is minor third above Db? No: Db to F is major third, because Db to Eb is major, Eb to F is minor, so Db to F is major third. Wait, Db, F, Ab is Db major chord. Yes. Because Db to F is major third, F to Ab is minor third, so Db major.

Wait, so chord on third scale degree (Db) is Db major. Yes. So in Bb minor key, the III chord is Db major.

Wait, but earlier we said III is Eb major. No, confusion here. Wait, if the scale degrees:

1. Bb

2. C

3. Db

4. Eb

5. F

6. Gb

7. Ab

So chord built on 3rd degree (Db): Db, F, Ab. Db major.

Yes. So iii chord is Db major.

Similarly, IV chord is Eb minor? No, chord on 4th degree: Eb, Gb, Bb. Which is Eb minor? Because Eb to Gb is minor third, Gb to Bb is major third. So minor chord. Wait, Eb, Gb, Bb is Eb minor. But the standard notation for chords in minor key: usually chords are named as minor or major.

But in general terms, for Bb natural minor:

i: Bb minor

ii°: C diminished

iii: Db major

iv: Eb minor

v: F minor

vi: Gb major

vii°: Ab diminished.

Wait, that seems right.

Wait, chord on F (5th degree): F, Ab, C. Which is F minor.

Chord on Gb (6th degree): Gb, Bb, Db. Which is Gb major.

Yes. So vi chord is Gb major.

So in Bb minor, vi chord is Gb major. So Gb major is diatonic.

Similarly, Db major is iii chord.

Db major chord is indeed the iii chord of Bb minor.

Now, looking at Db/Ab: Db major chord with Ab in bass. Db major notes are Db, F, Ab. So Ab is the fifth. So Db/Ab is Db major in second inversion.

Similarly, Abm6: A-flat minor sixth. In Bb minor, Ab is the vii° chord in natural minor, but with addition of sixth. Ab minor chord would be Ab, Cb, Eb. But Cb is B natural, so Ab, B, Eb. But in Bb minor, the natural minor scale has Ab as the vii° chord.

But Abm6 would be A-flat minor with added sixth. So Ab minor has Ab, Cb, Eb; sixth would be F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

But in Bb minor key, the natural minor scale uses Ab and Eb. Let's see: Abm6 chord notes are Ab, B, Eb, F.

Db major: Db, F, Ab (from Db major triad)

Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

So all these chords seem to fit into Bb minor. Let's check:

- Bbm (i)

- Gb major (vi)

- Db major (iii)

- Ab minor (vii°)

But wait, in the chord sequence we have an Abm6, which is Ab minor with added sixth. Which would fit into the same key.

Now what about the B/Bb chord? If it's B major chord with Bb bass, which would be B, D#, F# with bass Bb. That's problematic because B major has an F#, which is not in Bb minor; Bb minor has Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So F# would be a sharp, which is not in the key. But B in the scale is Cb, which is equivalent to B. Wait: scale of Bb minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Wait, no! Wait again:

Wait, the natural minor scale for Bb minor is:

Bb (1), C (2), Db (b3), Eb (4), F (5), Gb (b6), Ab (b7).

So the notes are Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So all flats. So B is not in the scale; the second scale degree is C natural. Wait, yes: C natural. So there is a C natural here. But B natural is not in the scale.

Wait, Cb is the same as B natural. But in Bb minor scale, the b3 is Db. So the notes don't include B natural; instead, they have C natural and Db.

Wait, yes, Bb m scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So all natural except for the flats. So C is natural. So no B natural. So a B major chord (B, D#, F#) would be completely outside the Bb minor key. So if there's a B/Bb chord (B major over Bb bass), which introduces notes B, D#, F#, Bb – which have a B natural, D# (which is Eb? No, D# is different from Eb, but they are enharmonic equivalent, but not the same note in terms of diatonic scale). Wait, but in Bb minor key, the scale has Eb natural, which is not same as D#. But regardless, B natural is not in scale, so B major chord would be non-diatonic.

But maybe B/Bb is a typo. Let's consider that. If it's supposed to be Bb/Bb, but then chord is Bb major. But Bb major in Bb minor would be a major i chord, but minor key normally uses minor i. Alternatively, if it's Bbm7 or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's Bb major with bass Bb. But still. Alternatively, perhaps B/Bb should be Bbm/Bb? No. Or maybe B7/Bb? B7 would have B, D#, F#, A. Bass Bb would create a weird chord.

Alternatively, the chord might be a Bb11 or something. But perhaps most likely a typo for Bbm/Bb? Which is just Bbm. But the user wrote B/Bb.

Another possibility: maybe the user wrote B/Bb when they meant Bb/Bb, which is just root position Bb. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, could it be Bb over Bb, but written as B/Bb by mistake? Like 'B' instead of 'Bb'. If so, then it's a typo. Because "B" is a different note from Bb. So likely the chord was meant to be Bb, and the slash was written as /Bb by mistake, making it Bb/Bb which just means Bb chord. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be Bbm/Bb, but again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a B augmented over Bb, but that's less likely.

But given the rest of the chords fit into Bb minor, maybe B/Bb is a typo and should be something else. For example, in the key of Bb minor, another chord that fits is Abm7 or Ab diminished. Or Ab major? Let's see.

Wait, let's consider the chord sequence again. If we ignore the slash for a moment and look at chord roots and qualities.

The chords listed are: Bbm, Bbm, Gb (major), Gb (major), Bbm, Bbm, Db (major), B (major), Bbm, etc., then Abm6.

If B major is present, it's quite a stretch for Bb minor. But if B/Bb is actually a Bb major chord (if the slash was mistakenly written), then Bb major would be the tonic chord. But Bb major would make the key of Bb major, not minor. Let's check.

In Bb major key: key signature two flats.

Chords: I Bb, II Cm, III Dm, IV Eb, V F, VI Gm, VII Am.

But in this sequence, we have Gb major chord. Gb would not be in Bb major. Bb major scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. So Gb would be a note outside.

But if the key is Gb major? Let's see. Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. Wait, Cb is B natural.

But chord roots present: Bbm (Bb minor), Gb major, Db major, B major? Not fitting.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Db major? Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords in Db major: I Db, II Ebm, III Fm, IV Gb, V Ab, VI Bbm, VII Cdim.

Ah! Let's check. If the sequence is in Db major.

Bbm is the vi chord.

Gb major is IV.

Db major is I.

Ab major would be V.

But in the sequence: we have Bbm, Bbm, Gb (IV), Gb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab (Db major), B/Bb (problematic), Abm6 (but in Db major, Ab is the V chord, so Ab major. But Abm6 would be minor?).

Wait, but Abm6 would be Ab minor with sixth. In Db major, the chords include Ab major (V), but Ab minor would be outside.

Wait, but let's check all chords in Db major:

Chords:

I: Db

II: Ebm

III: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

VI: Bbm

VII: Cdim

So if the chord sequence is: Bbm (vi), Gb (IV), Db (I), etc. So Bbm is vi of Db major. Gb is IV. Db is I. Then what about Db/Ab: Db major with Ab bass (which is fifth in Db major chord), which makes sense as second inversion. Ab would be the fifth.

B/Bb: B major? B is not in Db major; Db major's notes include Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So no B or Bb? Wait, Bb is in Db major scale (Bb is the seventh note). So Bb exists, but B natural doesn't. So if the chord is B/Bb, meaning B major chord over Bb bass, which includes B and D# and F#. None of those are in Db major scale. So again problem.

Another approach: looking at the bass notes. The majority are Bb or Ab.

Bb and Ab are a half-step apart. In Bb minor, the vi chord is Gb, which fits. But the Abm6 could be vii° chord, but with added sixth.

Wait, if the key is Bb minor, Ab is the vii degree. So Ab diminished. If it's Abm6, that might be a chord with minor sixth, which is a bit unusual. But maybe.

But Bm6 would be a minor chord with sixth. In Bb minor, Abm6 would be vii° with added sixth. Alternatively, in some keys, it might be used.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the key is Gb major. Let's see. Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Cb is B natural.

Chords in Gb major:

I: Gb

II: Abm

III: Bbm

IV: Cbm

V: Db

VI: Ebm

VII: Fdim

So Bbm would be III chord.

Gb major as tonic. Then in this context:

Bbm is III

Gb would be I

Db is V

Abm would be II

But in our chord sequence: Bbm, Gb/Bb (which would be Gb major chord, which would fit as I), Db/Ab (Db major, which would be V in Gb major), and Abm6 (Ab minor with sixth, which is II chord in Gb major). So let's see.

Check:

- Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F.

- Chord Bbm: Bb minor is III chord.

- Gb major (I)

- Db major (V)

- Abm is II chord.

So the Abm6 could be Ab minor chord with added sixth. In Ab minor, the sixth would be F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which in Gb major scale, Cb is B, but the scale would have the notes Cb or B? Depending on spelling.

Wait, in Gb major scale, the notes are Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. Cb is technically the B note.

So Abm chord: Ab, Cb, Eb (which would be Ab, B, Eb). Which is valid.

Adding sixth: sixth above Ab is F, which is in Gb major scale. So Abm6 would be Ab, B, Eb, F. Which fits.

Similarly, Db/Ab: Db major chord (Db, F, Ab), which is V chord. And Db/Ab would be the second inversion.

So this seems plausible.

But what about the B/Bb chord? B major over Bb bass. In Gb major, is B part of the scale? No. Because Gb major scale has Cb (B natural), but B major would be B, D#, F#. D# is not in Gb major scale, which has Cb (B), Db, etc. So D# would be Enharmonic to Eb, which is in the scale. But B natural is part of the scale (as Cb). So B natural does exist in Gb major scale as Cb.

But B major chord would be B, D#, F#. But in Gb major, D# would be Eb, but D# is not the same as Eb. However, in practice, it's common to use flats instead of sharps, but if the chord uses D#, which is enharmonic to Eb, but Eb is in the scale. Wait, D# and Eb are different spellings but same pitch? No, wait: D# and Eb are enharmonic equivalents. So in music theory context, they are the same pitch but different spelling. However, chord spelling matters for diatonic considerations.

But if the key is Gb major, the scale has F natural, but does it have D#? No. The scale of Gb major is Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. So notes are all flats or naturals with flats except for the last note F. So Eb is not D#.

But D# is not present. So B major chord (B, D#, F#) would have D# and F#. F# is not in Gb major scale (which has F natural). So no. Thus, B major chord would have F# which is outside the Gb major scale. F in Gb major is natural. So F# would be a sharp, outside the key.

So that's a problem. So B/Bb chord still seems out of place.

Another idea: maybe the B/Bb is actually Bb/Bb, and the user mistyped the 'B' as uppercase instead of 'Bb'. So the chord is Bb major, but written as B/Bb by mistake. If that's the case, then in key of Gb major, Bb would be the III chord. Wait, no: in Gb major, the chords:

I: Gb

II: Abm

III: Bbm

IV: Cbm (but Cb is B, so Cbm would be Cb minor – which is B minor)

V: Db

VI: Ebm

VII: Fdim

So if Bb/Bb is a chord (Bb major), but Bb is not part of the Gb major diatonic chords. The III chord is Bbm (minor), so major Bb would be the bIII chord in Gb major, which is not diatonic. So not sure.

Alternatively, if the key were Bb minor, as earlier:

Bb minor scale has all the chords we mentioned. Let's check Abm6 again. In Bb minor, the vii chord is Ab diminished, so Abm6 would be a different chord, but still possible.

But still, the B/Bb chord is a problem.

Another approach: look at the tonic chord. If we assume that Bbm appears frequently and is the tonic, then maybe Bb minor.

But let's see the chord progression. Common progressions in Bb minor might be i - iv - bVI - bIII etc. But let's see:

Bbm (i), Gb (vi), Db (iii), etc.

In Bb minor, vi is Gb major, iii is Db major. So Bbm (i), Gb (vi), Db (iii), then B/Bb is problematic.

Wait, Db major chord (iii), then Abm6 (vii° or maybe something else). In Bb minor, the vii° is Ab diminished, so Abm6 could be a variation.

Alternatively, if the key is Db major, vi chord Bbm, IV Gb, I Db.

But again B/Bb is problematic.

Wait, another idea. Maybe the slash chords have the bass note indicating a pedal tone. Let's see.

If the bass note is mostly Bb or Ab, maybe it's a pedal point on Bb/Ab.

Bb and Ab are a minor second apart, which is common in some progressions.

But focusing on chord tones:

Let's list all chord tones without bass notes considering.

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db

Db/Ab: Db, F, Ab

B/Bb: B, D#, F# and Bb bass

Abm6: Ab, B, Eb, F

So common tones: F appears in several chords. Bb, Db, Ab.

But B, D#, F# in B/Bb chord would be very foreign.

Unless B/Bb is a typo for Bb/Bb. If so, then Bb major.

But in Bb major, the chords would be I Bb, II Cm, III Dm, IV Eb, V F, VI Gm, VII Am.

But our chords include Gb major (which in Bb major isn't present), Db major (also not diatonic). Db is not in Bb major scale. Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab. So no Db. So Db major would be outside.

Hmm.

Another possible key: is there a key where both Ab and B are present? Like B major? But B major has B, D#, F#, etc. No Ab. So unlikely.

Wait, maybe the key is F minor. Let's see.

F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Chords: i Fm, ii° Gdim, III Ab major, iv Bbm, V Cm, VI Db major, VII Eb dim.

No, but we have Db major chord (VI in F minor), Ab major is III, Bbm is iv. Let's see.

If the chord sequence fits F minor:

- Bbm: iv chord

- Gb/Bb: Gb is not directly in F minor scale. Wait F minor scale notes: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

So no Gb. Gb is enharmonic to F#, which isn't in the scale. So probably not.

Another idea: maybe it's F Dorian or something. But not sure.

Wait, let's consider the Abm6 chord. If Abm6 is Ab minor sixth = Ab, Cb, Eb, F (B, Eb, Ab, F). This chord could also be interpreted as F minor with added sixth? But F minor is F, Ab, C. So Fm6 would be F, Ab, C, D. No, Abm6 as F minor with Ab? Not sure.

Alternatively, Abm6 is same as F minor 7th? No. Fm7 is F, Ab, C, Eb.

But anyway, maybe not helpful.

Let's try to see if there's a common key that includes Bb, Gb, Db, Ab, and maybe B (but that's problematic).

Wait, perhaps the key is Bb minor, but the B/Bb is actually a Bb7 or something. Like Bb7 chord with Bb bass, but written wrong.

Or perhaps "B/Bb" is supposed to be Bb7/Bb? Not sure.

Alternatively, could the "B/Bb" be a miswrite of "Bbm7/Bb" or something else.

Alternatively, let's look at the overall pattern. The chords repeat Bbm several times, and have Gb major, Db major, and then Abm6.

So a possible common progression in Bb minor:

i - vi - iii - iv - etc.

Bbm (i), Gb (vi), Db (iii), then Abm6 could be vii°6 or something.

But Abm6 in Bb minor: Ab minor chord with sixth. But vii° is diminished, so usually Abdim, but Abm6 is more of a chromatic chord.

But maybe it's considered as part of the key.

However, the B/Bb chord is still problematic.

Wait, another idea: in some contexts, especially blues or jazz, a major chord a whole step below the tonic is common. So if tonic is Bb, then the chord B major could be a chord from outside, but it's a common thing in blues. However, B major with Bb bass would be B over Bb, which could be a B chord with a chromatic bass line.

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, let's consider the bass notes. Let's list all bass notes:

As before:

Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb

So mostly Bb, with Ab appearing at some points. So the bass is playing mostly Bb with some Ab, maybe a pedal.

If the bass is staying on Bb and Ab, but the chords above move. If the tonic is Bb minor, then the bass pedal on Bb makes sense. The Ab could be the lowered 7th of Bb minor.

But the Abm6 chord has Ab as root. So if the bass note Ab is played for the Abm6 chord, then Ab is the bass note.

Now, considering the chord symbols given, let's assume that when it says Abm6, the root is Ab.

So chord tones:

- Bbm: root Bb, minor

- Gb/Bb: root Gb, major

- Db/Ab: root Db, major

- B/Bb: root B, major

- Abm6: root Ab, minor sixth

So chord roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, Ab.

These roots are spaced: Bb (which is same as A#), Ab is G#, B is B. So intervals between them: from Bb to Ab is minor second? Not sure. It's a bit random.

But in terms of key, looking at the root notes: Bb, Ab, Gb, Db, B.

That seems like a pattern descending by whole step: Bb to Ab (b9?), no: Bb, Ab is descending minor second.

Not sure. Alternatively, Bb, Ab, Gb, Db... all descending whole steps? Bb to Ab is a minor second, Ab to Gb is minor second. No, all flats decreasing: Bb, then Ab, Gb, Db – that's each flat one tone down?

Wait Bb to Ab is a step down (Bb to Ab is minor second, but a whole step down would be A to Ab, no). Actually, descending by half steps: Bb, Ab, Gb, Db, Cb (B), which is not quite.

Another approach: look at all notes used in the chords. Ignore the bass, look at chord tones.

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

Db major: Db, F, Ab

B major: B, D#, F#

Abm6: Ab, B, Eb, F

So all notes used:

Bb, Db, F, Gb, Ab, B, D#, Eb.

Wait, that's a lot of different notes. Let's list them:

Bb, Db, F, Gb, Ab, B, D#, Eb.

D# is the same as Eb; B and Cb are same. But in terms of pitch classes:

B, Cb (B), D#, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

So if D# = Eb, then Eb is present. So notes:

B, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb (D#), F, Gb, Ab.

Wait, but B and Bb are separate. Cb is B. So effectively, the pitches are:

B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So seven pitches. That's all the notes in a major scale? No, seven notes. That sounds like diatonic. Let's see if they fit.

But B major scale is B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. Not matching.

Alternatively, Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Yes! Wait Db major scale is Db (1), Eb (2), F (3), Gb (4), Ab (5), Bb (6), C (7).

But in our chord notes, we have B and Eb, F, Db, Gb, Ab, Bb.

But Db major scale has C as seventh, not B natural. But C and B are different, unless Cb. So Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Our note list has B natural, which isn't in Db major. Unless B natural is the Cb.

No, it's messy. However, B natural and Cb is same pitch. But Db major doesn't have B, it has C.

So if we replace C with B (as Cb), it's different.

Another possibility: Cb major? But Cb major is enharmonic to B major, which is highly theoretical and unusual.

Alternatively, is there a key where all these notes fit? Let's see.

The notes present: B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Let's list them alphabetically: B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. That seems to be a set of notes. But B and Bb are a half step apart, which would mean it's chromatic.

Alternatively, if we ignore the B and Bb, it sounds like Db major scale except missing C. But Db major has C. Or maybe F minor.

F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

But we also have Gb and B in there. Gb is not in F minor. F minor includes G natural.

Not matching.

Wait another idea: could this be Phrygian mode?

In Phrygian, the second note is lowered.

But perhaps Bb Phrygian: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Wait, Bb Phrygian mode would be Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Which is exactly the natural minor of Bb, which is the same as Aeolian. Wait, yes: natural minor is the Aeolian mode, which is flat 3rd, 6th, 7th. So it's the same as natural minor.

So Bb Aeolian / natural minor: Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

But in this scale, we have B (as Cb), so B and natural B is same as Cb.

Wait, in Bb natural minor, the scale is Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So the notes: Bb, B (Cb), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So all seven notes. So in this scale, the note that's often written as Cb is B natural.

So Cb = B natural.

And Db is same as C#.

So the scale notes are Bb, B, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Exactly matching what we have: B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Yes! Because Cb is B natural. So all those notes are diatonic to Bb natural minor.

So if we consider this key: Bb minor (Aeolian), then all the chord notes fit.

But then what about B/Bb chord. B major chord is B, D#, F#. But in Bb minor scale:

Our scale has: B natural (as Cb), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

So D# would be Eb. So in scale, Eb is present.

So B major chord: B, D#, F#. But D# is enharmonic to Eb, which is in scale. And F# would not be in scale; scale has F natural.

Ah, right. F# is not in Bb natural minor scale. So F# would be outside. So if the B major chord contains F#, which is not in the scale, it's a chromatic chord.

But perhaps the B in the chord is a natural B, which is in the scale as Cb. But the issue is the F#.

So B major chord would require F#, which isn't in the scale. But if the F is used instead of F#, which would make it a B minor chord. But the user wrote B/Bb.

Alternatively, if the chord is not B major but Bb major. Then it fits. Or perhaps the chord is B diminished or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe B/Bb is a typo for Bbm/Bb, which is just Bbm. Because 'B' and 'Bb' might have been confused. If the user had a Bbm chord written as B/Bb due to typo.

If that's the case, then all chords fit Bb minor:

- Bbm

- Gb/Bb (Gb major chord, sixth degree in Bb minor)

- Db/Ab (Db major chord, iii degree)

- B/Bb → Bbm (i)

- Abm6 (Ab minor chord with sixth; vii° becomes Abm?)

Wait, in Bb minor natural: vii° is Ab diminished (Ab, Cb, Eb). But Abm6 would be Ab minor with added sixth (F). So Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which would be diatonic in Bb natural minor scale? Let's check.

Scale notes: Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So Ab minor chord (Ab, Cb, Eb), and the sixth would be F. F is in scale. So yes, Abm6 can be considered diatonic as Ab minor chord plus F added. But usually, the minor sixth chord might be a variant of minor seventh chord (Abm7 would have Gb), but Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which is valid.

Similarly, Db major chord (iii) in Bb minor.

So if we assume that the "B/Bb" chord is actually "Bbm/Bb" due to typo, then everything fits into Bb natural minor.

Alternatively, maybe the "B/Bb" is supposed to be "Ab/Bb" or something else. But assuming typo on 'B' for 'Bb'.

Another possibility: the slash chord "B/Bb" might mean a chord with B as the top note over Bb bass, but in the context of the key, but it's unclear.

But given the repetition of Bbm and the other chords fitting into Bb minor with the exception of B/Bb, it's highly likely that's a typo.

Another angle: Abm6 chord. If it's Ab minor sixth, which is same as Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) but no. Wait Abm6: Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Whereas Fm7 is F, Ab, C, Eb. So actually, Abm6 shares notes with Fm7, but different voicings. But in Bb minor context, it still fits.

So, all chords except possibly the B/Bb fit into Bb minor (natural minor). Therefore, likely the key is Bb minor, and the B/Bb is a typo.

But what's another way to look at it. If the chord "B/Bb" is actually "Bb/Bb", which is just root position Bb minor. But written as /Bb meaning bass is Bb. But Bbm chord with bass Bb is standard.

But regardless, the key is probably Bb minor.

But let's check again.

If we consider the key of Eb minor, but that seems less likely.

Another check: common chord progressions.

In Bb minor, a common progression might be i - iv - v - iv or something. But in this sequence: i, i, vi, vi, i, i, iii, iv? But the Db/Ab is Db major which is iii. Then B/Bb (problem), then later Abm6. In Bb minor, Abm6 could be related to the vii chord.

Alternatively, another mode. Let's see, if it's Dorian mode.

Bb Dorian would be Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. But we don't have G natural; we have Gb. So no.

Phrygian: Bb Phrygian is Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Which is same as Aeolian, which is Bb minor. Yes. Because Phrygian has b2, but in Bb Phrygian: root Bb, b2 Cb (B), b3 Db, 4 Eb, 5 F, b6 Gb, b7 Ab. Yes! So Bb Phrygian is actually the same as Bb natural minor (Aeolian), because Aeolian is natural minor, and Phrygian has b2. Wait no! Wait, no. Hold on.

Wait, the modes:

Ionian: same as major.

Dorian: minor with natural 6.

Phrygian: minor with b2.

Lydian: major with #4.

Mixolydian: major with b7.

Aeolian: natural minor.

Locrian: diminished.

So Bb Aeolian (natural minor) is: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Bb Phrygian would be Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab – same as Aeolian? No, wait no.

Wait, the Phrygian mode starts on the third degree of the major scale. Wait, better to build Phrygian by taking the scale and lowering the 2nd degree.

For example, Bb Phrygian would be: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Wait, but the Phrygian mode has b2, b3, etc. Wait, no.

Let's take a major scale and create the modes:

If we take Db major scale (four flats):

Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

The modes:

1. Db Ionian (major)

2. Eb Dorian

3. F Phrygian (because starting on third degree of Db major)

F Phrygian: F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Which is F, b2 Gb, b3 Ab, etc.

But if we take Bb Phrygian, it would be the Phrygian mode of Eb major.

But regardless, the point is that Bb natural minor is Aeolian mode of Db major.

So the scale notes are the same as Db major's notes starting on Bb.

But for the purpose of key signature, it's Bb minor (Bb Aeolian).

Now, back to the chords. Assuming all chords fit Bb minor except for the B/Bb chord.

But if we assume that "B/Bb" is a typo for "Bbm/Bb", then all chords fit. Or perhaps it's "Bb/Bb" which is same.

Alternatively, perhaps "B/Bb" is actually "Bb7", but written weirdly.

But given the context, I think it's most likely Bb minor key.

Another check: the presence of Bm6. Abm6 chord as vii minor sixth. But in Bb minor, vii chord is diminished, but adding sixth could be a substitute.

Alternatively, if the mode is different. Wait, but all diatonic chords fit.

Wait, Db major chord (iii) in Bb minor.

Gb major is vi.

So a progression like Bbm -> Gb -> Db -> ... etc.

Yes, that's plausible.

So the key is Bb minor (Aeolian mode). But Aeolian is just the natural minor scale, so the mode is minor.

But the question asks for key and mode. So key is Bb minor, mode would be Aeolian (natural minor).

Alternatively, if the progression uses chords common for harmonic minor, but with a raised seventh, but I don't see evidence of that here.

Wait, in harmonic minor of Bb, we'd have Ab raised to A natural. Then v chord would be Ab major. But we don't have Ab major chord here; Abm6 suggests minor.

So probably natural minor.

Regarding the B/Bb chord: if it's supposed to be something else, but if we take it as Bm over Bb bass or something else.

But given all other chords fit Bb minor, that seems the answer.

Another test: look at the bass notes sequence: Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, etc.

So the bass is moving down from Bb to Ab. In Bb minor, Ab is the minor seventh tone. So descending minor second from tonic to b7. Common in some progressions.

And then chords changing above.

So yes, Bb minor key, Aeolian mode (natural minor).

Now, what about the B/Bb chord? If that's a typo for Ab/Bb or something else. Or perhaps it's a Bb minor chord with bass Bb, which is standard. If the chord was written as B/Bb instead of Bbm/Bb due to missing 'm', then it makes sense.

Alternatively, "B/Bb" could be Bb major, but no, Bb major would be written as Bb. B/Bb is strange.

So conclusion: key is Bb minor, mode Aeolian (or simply minor).

But to confirm, let's see if there are other hints.

The chord Abm6: Ab minor sixth. In Bb minor, this chord's notes (Ab, Cb, Eb, F) all belong to the scale. Cb is B, which is part of the scale. F is also in scale.

So yes.

Gb major chord: Gb, Bb, Db. All in scale.

Db major: Db, F, Ab. Yes.

Bbm: yes.

So all chords fit except possibly the B/Bb. Assuming typo.

Therefore, I think the key is B flat minor (Bb minor) in natural minor mode (Aeolian).


The chord sequence provided is:  
**Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm**

---

### ✅ Step 1: Analyze the Chord Structure
Let’s examine the **chord roots** and **qualifications** (ignoring bass notes for now):

- **Bbm** (B♭ minor): B♭, D♭, F  
- **Gb/Bb** (Gb major in first inversion): G♭, B♭, D♭  
- **Db/Ab** (Db major in second inversion): D♭, F, A♭  
- **B/Bb** (problematic—B major over B♭ bass: B, D♯, F♯ with B♭ bass)  
- **Abm6** (A♭ minor sixth): A♭, C♭ (B), E♭, F  

All of these chords (with the exception of **B/Bb**) clearly fit within the **B♭ natural minor (Aeolian) scale**, whose notes are:  
**B♭, C♭ (B), D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭**

---

### ✅ Step 2: Confirm Scale Fit (excluding B/Bb)
- **Bbm**: Tonic (i)  
- **Gb major**: vi chord (G♭, B♭, D♭)  
- **Db major**: iii chord (D♭, F, A♭)  
- **Abm6**: vii° with added 6th (A♭, B, E♭, F) — all within the scale  

All these chords are **diatonic** to **B♭ natural minor (Aeolian)**.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Address the Problematic **B/Bb**
The **B/Bb** chord is the only exception. A **B major chord (B, D♯, F♯)** with **B♭ as bass** introduces **D♯ and F♯**, which **do not belong** to the B♭ minor scale. This is highly irregular.

However, this is almost certainly a **typo**. Here's why:
- In most sheet music or chord notation, **B/Bb** is not standard.
- Common confusion: **Bm** (B minor) might have been mistyped as **B/Bb** due to missing **"m"** or incorrect slash formatting.
- If **B/Bb** were actually **Bbm/Bb**, it would be a standard **B♭ minor chord with B♭ in the bass**, which fits perfectly within the key.

This is a **very common notation error** in handwritten or typed chord charts.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Determine Key and Mode
Given:
- All chords (excluding **B/Bb**) are **diatonic to B♭ minor**
- The tonal center (B♭) is consistently used as the root or bass note
- The progression follows a typical **Aeolian (natural minor)** pattern
- The only non-diatonic element is likely a **typo**

➡️ **Key**: **B♭ minor**  
➡️ **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**

---

### 📌 Final Answer:
**Key: B♭ minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  

> *Note: The chord "B/Bb" is almost certainly a typo and likely should be "Bbm" or "Bbm/Bb". Otherwise, it introduces non-diatonic notes that break the key context.*
