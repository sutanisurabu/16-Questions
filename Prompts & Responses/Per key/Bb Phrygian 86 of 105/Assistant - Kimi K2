Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Db/Ab – B/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Abm6 – Bbm**

---

### Step 1: Identify the roots and their relationships
All chords are rooted in flats (Bb, Gb, Db, Ab), so we’re likely in a **flat key**.

Let’s list the root notes in order:

- Bb  
- Gb  
- Db  
- B (natural!)  
- Ab  

This is unusual because **B natural** appears in a progression otherwise full of flats.

---

### Step 2: Look at the tonic
The chord **Bbm** appears **6 times**, more than any other. It begins and ends the progression. This strongly suggests **Bb minor** is the **tonic**.

---

### Step 3: Check the mode
Since the tonic is **Bbm**, and the progression centers around **Bb**, we are in **Bb minor**.

But we must check for **modal inflections**.

### Step 4: Analyze the chords in Bb minor

| Chord     | Function in Bb minor |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Bbm       | i (tonic)            |
| Gb/Bb     | ♭VI in 1st inversion |
| Db/Ab     | ♭III in 1st inversion |
| B/Bb      | **V/V** (secondary dominant of V) |
| Abm6      | ♭II with added 6th   |

---

### Final Answer:

**Key: Bb minor**  
**Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)** with **secondary dominant** (B/Bb = V/V) and **chromatic voice-leading** (Abm6 is a passing color).

No modal interchange or major tonic is implied — it's **straight Bb minor**, with some **chromatic spice**.
