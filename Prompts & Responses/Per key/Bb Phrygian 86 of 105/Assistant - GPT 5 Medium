### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to identify the key and mode for the chord progression: "Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb..." I'm thinking it’s probably in B-flat minor. Bbm serves as the tonic, while Gb/Bb appears frequently, indicating a sixth-degree major chord. I’m calculating the natural scale of Bb minor, which includes Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, and Ab. Gb is a lowered sixth, and with Bb as the bass, it suggests a IV chord in Bbm. Let's make sure I have that right!**Classifying diatonic chords**

Oh, in a minor context, I've got the diatonic chords: i (Bbm), ii° (C°), III (Db), iv (Ebm), v (Fm), VI (Gb), and VII (Ab). Gb major acts as the VI chord, and Gb/Bb becomes a VI6 in first inversion with Bb as the bass. Then there's Db/Ab, which is the III chord in second inversion. It can have a functional role leading to Gb or Bbm. I'm looking to keep this clear as I analyze the progression!**Checking chord relationships**

I’m wondering if B/Bb is part of a IV—6/4 progression. The sequence shows Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, and B/Bb. B/Bb seems odd, implying a B major chord over a Bb bass. That leads me to think it might be notated as Cb/Bb, especially since B natural isn’t diatonic in this context. I’m considering that it could suggest a Neapolitan chord, Cb major, acting as bII in the key of Bb minor, which is fascinating!**Exploring Neapolitan usage**

I’m looking at the common usage of the Neapolitan chord, which is typically in first inversion, meaning Db in the bass. But here we have B/Bb, which is essentially a Neapolitan chord over a Bb bass. This could suggest it’s functioning as a passing chord in Bb minor, despite not being a diatonic chord there. The other chords—Bbm, Gb/Bb, and Db/Ab—fit diatonically. Then there's the Abm6 at the end, which mixes in borrowed notes, giving it a unique flavor in this progression!**Investigating chord functions**

Okay, we're deep in minor territory. The VII is often Ab major, but I’m considering modal mixture with Ab minor. That brings up the Neapolitan chord, Cb major, which sets up some complex relationships with the other chords like B/Bb and Abm6. I'm connecting the dots with chord functions, and this Abm6 might be borrowed to lead us back to Bbm, creating motion that feels familiar in pop progressions. I’m really leaning towards Bb minor as the tonal center, especially with frequent returns to Bbm. Let's keep refining this!**Determining key and mode**

I’m analyzing the chord progression and thinking that B/Bb might be a chromatic passing chord often used in guitar tabs. The steps suggest a chromatic bass line moving from Ab to Bb, leading back to Bbm. This would imply a jazzy flavor, especially with the Abm6 functioning elegantly as a bVII. Considering all this, I've concluded that the key is Bb minor in the Aeolian mode, without any raised leading tone. 

So, the key is Bb minor, and the mode is Aeolian (natural minor).

Key: B-flat minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Notes:
- Gb/Bb = VI6, Db/Ab = III6/4; progression centers and cadences on Bbm.
- Abm6 is a borrowed/altered bVII sonority leading back to i.
- B/Bb is a chromatic color (enharmonic to Cb/Bb, Neapolitan-like) rather than a diatonic function.
