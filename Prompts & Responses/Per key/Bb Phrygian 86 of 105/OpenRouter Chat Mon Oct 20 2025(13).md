### Reasoning

**Checking Ab minor chord**

I’m trying to figure out the pitches for an Ab minor chord (Ab, Cb, Eb) and considering if I should add a 6th, which would be Fb. In the Ab natural minor scale, the 6th scale degree is indeed Fb. Typically, an "m6" chord means a minor triad with an added major 6th; in this case, it's F.

I see that while F natural fits in the Abm6, it appears B natural isn't found in the Ab minor context, making it a bit tricky with the notation "B/Bb." That seems a bit non-diatonic!**Considering enharmonic spelling**

I’m exploring enharmonic spelling, particularly in flat keys where B natural is represented as Cb. So, a B major chord (B, D#, F#) could correspond to a Cb major chord (Cb, Eb, Gb) enharmonically.

Then, thinking about the chord B/Bb, it could be a Cb/Bb triad, leading to a Bb half-diminished seventh chord. But my notes (Bb, Cb, Eb, Gb) don’t correspond to standard diminished chord notes. There’s no Db, so it seems like I might have Bbm7b5. But when comparing, Bb7b9b13 might not fit either.**Analyzing B/Bb chord use**

If the chord symbol is indeed B/Bb, many pop charts treat that as a chromatic approach, often in Bb minor, where it serves as a passing chord. Looking closely at the pattern: Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, then it feels like a gospel walk.

However, Gb over Bb gives notes Gb, Bb, Db, which doesn't match the Bbm7 chords. I realize that Gb/Bb functions as IV over 6 in the key of Db major, adding another layer to this musical interpretation.**Exploring chord progressions in Db major**

In the context of Db major, I realize Bbm is not the iii minor, as F minor holds that spot instead. Instead, Bbm is the vi minor. So in Db major, the scale offers: I (Db), ii (Ebm), iii (Fm), IV (Gb), V (Ab), vi (Bbm), and vii° (C dim). 

I see a possible progression emerging: vi vi IV/6. This suggests Gb/Bb serves as IV with a 6th in the bass, and this aligns nicely throughout the progression back to Abm6. It's interesting to see where each chord fits!**Analyzing key and mode**

When people ask about the "key and mode," they might inquire if Bb minor is Aeolian or harmonic minor. Since there's no F major chord present, it indicates that it's not harmonic minor. 

The inclusion of Cb in Abm6 suggests the tone is borrowed from Phrygian, while the absence of A natural confirms that it's not harmonic. So it appears to be Bb minor in the Aeolian mode with a flat 2 borrow. The final answer is Bb minor (Aeolian).

Bb minor (Aeolian).

Notes:
- Bbm is the clear tonic.
- Gb/Bb = VI in first inversion; Db/Ab = III in second inversion.
- B/Bb is enharmonic to Cb/Bb (bII over 1), a Neapolitan color.
- No raised leading tone or V major, so it’s not harmonic/melodic minor; ending Abm6 is a borrowed color resolving to i.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to identify the key and mode for the chord progression: "Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb..." I'm thinking it’s probably in B-flat minor. Bbm serves as the tonic, while Gb/Bb appears frequently, indicating a sixth-degree major chord. I’m calculating the natural scale of Bb minor, which includes Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, and Ab. Gb is a lowered sixth, and with Bb as the bass, it suggests a IV chord in Bbm. Let's make sure I have that right!**Classifying diatonic chords**

Oh, in a minor context, I've got the diatonic chords: i (Bbm), ii° (C°), III (Db), iv (Ebm), v (Fm), VI (Gb), and VII (Ab). Gb major acts as the VI chord, and Gb/Bb becomes a VI6 in first inversion with Bb as the bass. Then there's Db/Ab, which is the III chord in second inversion. It can have a functional role leading to Gb or Bbm. I'm looking to keep this clear as I analyze the progression!**Checking chord relationships**

I’m wondering if B/Bb is part of a IV—6/4 progression. The sequence shows Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, and B/Bb. B/Bb seems odd, implying a B major chord over a Bb bass. That leads me to think it might be notated as Cb/Bb, especially since B natural isn’t diatonic in this context. I’m considering that it could suggest a Neapolitan chord, Cb major, acting as bII in the key of Bb minor, which is fascinating!**Exploring Neapolitan usage**

I’m looking at the common usage of the Neapolitan chord, which is typically in first inversion, meaning Db in the bass. But here we have B/Bb, which is essentially a Neapolitan chord over a Bb bass. This could suggest it’s functioning as a passing chord in Bb minor, despite not being a diatonic chord there. The other chords—Bbm, Gb/Bb, and Db/Ab—fit diatonically. Then there's the Abm6 at the end, which mixes in borrowed notes, giving it a unique flavor in this progression!**Investigating chord functions**

Okay, we're deep in minor territory. The VII is often Ab major, but I’m considering modal mixture with Ab minor. That brings up the Neapolitan chord, Cb major, which sets up some complex relationships with the other chords like B/Bb and Abm6. I'm connecting the dots with chord functions, and this Abm6 might be borrowed to lead us back to Bbm, creating motion that feels familiar in pop progressions. I’m really leaning towards Bb minor as the tonal center, especially with frequent returns to Bbm. Let's keep refining this!**Determining key and mode**

I’m analyzing the chord progression and thinking that B/Bb might be a chromatic passing chord often used in guitar tabs. The steps suggest a chromatic bass line moving from Ab to Bb, leading back to Bbm. This would imply a jazzy flavor, especially with the Abm6 functioning elegantly as a bVII. Considering all this, I've concluded that the key is Bb minor in the Aeolian mode, without any raised leading tone. 

So, the key is Bb minor, and the mode is Aeolian (natural minor).

Key: B-flat minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Notes:
- Gb/Bb = VI6, Db/Ab = III6/4; progression centers and cadences on Bbm.
- Abm6 is a borrowed/altered bVII sonority leading back to i.
- B/Bb is a chromatic color (enharmonic to Cb/Bb, Neapolitan-like) rather than a diatonic function.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing key and mode**

I need to determine the key and mode from the given chord progression: "Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm". 

The tonic appears to be Bbm, and there are some interesting slash chords like Gb/Bb and Db/Ab. I'm considering the key of Bb minor. This involves analyzing the harmonic and melodic minor scales. I’ll check the notes and confirm the mode too. Let’s dive deeper into this!**Breaking down chords**

I’m analyzing the chords to understand their structure and position.  

Bbm is the tonic (i) with its notes Bb-Db-F. 

The Gb/Bb chord translates to Gb major over Bb, classifying it as VI6 in Bb minor, since the Bb bass indicates first inversion. 

Then there’s the Db/Ab chord, which is Db major over Ab and serves as the III chord. It's so interesting how inversions affect their labeling! Let's summarize these relationships clearly.**Examining chord inversions**

I’m looking at the chord structure, starting with the Db triad, which consists of the notes Db-F-Ab. With Ab in the bass, it’s a second inversion, III6/4.

Now, for the B/Bb chord, we have a B major chord over Bb, and the notes are B-D#-F#. Since we're in Bb minor, this suggests some borrowed harmony. 

Enharmonically, B could be interpreted as Cb, which makes it an interesting challenge! In Bb minor, Cb would indeed represent a Neapolitan chord in first inversion, giving us a unique flavor!**Exploring Neapolitan chords**

Okay, I’m checking out the Neapolitan chord in a minor key, which is built on bII major (Cb-Eb-Gb). If it were in first inversion, Eb would be the bass note. However, since we have Bb in the bass, it’s not matching up as a chord tone.

This B/Bb could function as a chromatic upper neighbor or appoggiatura. It’s possible the composer is using B major as a leading tone, or maybe it’s a tritone substitution. Plus, I see that Abm6 also appears later, indicating it's worth considering some borrowed chords too!**Analyzing chord relationships**

I'm examining how Ab minor fits within Bb minor. The Neapolitan chord built on bII major (Cb-Eb-Gb) doesn’t quite match since Bb is a fifth and not a chord tone. 

The B/Bb chord could be a chromatic neighbor or serving as a leading tone. I'm also considering whether Ab minor appears as a borrowed chord, along with its relationship to major keys. 

My analysis points toward Bb minor as the key, where Abm6 might serve as a borrowed subdominant minor chord. The progression flows from i to VI6 to i, suggesting an Aeolian mode as well.**Determining key and mode**

I'm thinking about how Ab minor fits into different keys. In Bb major, the iv minor would be Eb minor, while here, it seems we're dealing with bVII minor. The presence of Abm6 might act like a backdoor cadence while exploring other keys, like Db major, where Bbm can function as the vi.

Then, considering Gb major, Bbm serves as iii, suggesting the chord progression revolves around this. I'm finding consistency with the key of Gb major, but the ending chords hint at an open dominant feeling, leaving the resolution unclear. So, I’m determining the key and mode as Gb major or Eb minor.**Determining key and mode**

I'm thinking the tonal center could be Bb minor, especially since Bbm is frequently repeated, starting and ending the progression. The supportive chords include Gb (VI), Db (III), and Abm6 (bVII minor), fitting within Bb minor Aeolian with some modal mixture. If we interpret the B/Bb chord as enharmonically Cb/Bb, it can function as Neapolitan. 

Overall, the key seems to be Bb minor in Aeolian mode, based on the absence of a leading tone and presence of modal colors. So, I’d say the answer is Bb minor, Aeolian!

Key: B-flat minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Evidence: Bbm is the clear tonal center; Gb (VI) and Db (III) are Aeolian pillars. Db/Ab = III6/4, Gb/Bb = VI6. The B/Bb chord reads best as Cb/Bb, i.e., a Neapolitan (bII6/4), and Abm6 functions as a borrowed bVII minor sonority resolving back to i—all consistent with Bb Aeolian.

Bb minor (natural minor/Aeolian mode)

### Explanation
- **Tonal center**: The progression strongly revolves around Bbm as the tonic (i), with repetition at the start, throughout, and end. This establishes Bb minor as the key.
- **Supporting chords** (Roman numeral analysis in Bb minor):
  - Bbm: i
  - Gb/Bb: ♭VII (inversion; common borrowed chord from parallel major)
  - Gb/Bb: ♭VII (repeated)
  - Db/Ab: III (inversion)
  - B/Bb: Chromatic/non-diatonic (possibly a borrowed dominant or passing chord; enharmonically tense with the D♯, but doesn't disrupt the overall center)
  - Abm6: vii (borrowed/secondary minor with added 6th; leads back to tonic)
- **Key signature**: 5 flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb), consistent with natural minor (no consistent use of raised 7th/A harmonic minor elements like F major).
- **Why not other keys?** 
  - Not major (e.g., Gb major or Eb major) due to heavy use of Bbm and lack of dominant pull to a major tonic.
  - Fits better than relatives (e.g., Db major) because Bbm dominates tonally.
- This progression has a moody, repetitive feel typical of pop/R&B in minor keys (e.g., similar to sections in songs like "Wicked Games" by The Weeknd). If this is from a specific song or you have more context (e.g., melody), I can refine the analysis.

### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Determined Key: B♭ minor
- **Reasoning**: 
  - The progression strongly revolves around B♭m as the tonal center—it opens, repeats, and resolves back to B♭m multiple times, giving it a clear role as the tonic (i chord).
  - Most chords derive from or align closely with the B♭ minor scale (natural minor: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭).
    - B♭m = i (B♭ D♭ F)
    - G♭/B♭ = VI with B♭ bass (G♭ B♭ D♭; G♭ = VI in B♭ minor)
    - D♭/A♭ = III with A♭ bass (D♭ F A♭; D♭ = III in B♭ minor)
  - The overall structure feels unresolved and cyclical, typical of minor keys, with a dark, introspective quality.
- Slash chords (e.g., G♭/B♭, D♭/A♭) emphasize bass movement that reinforces the B♭ root or supports the minor tonic (e.g., B♭ bass under G♭ creates a i6/4-like tension resolving back to i).
- The B major chord (B D♯ F♯, or enharmonically B E♭ G♭ / B♭ bass) acts as a chromatic passing chord or secondary dominant (possibly V/iii or borrowed for color), adding tension before returning to B♭m.
- A♭m6 (A♭ B E♭ F) functions as a vii chord (substitute for leading-tone resolution to i), though it borrows the B natural (C♭) from outside the strict scale—common in minor key practice for color without changing the key center.

#### Determined Mode: Aeolian (Natural Minor)
- **Reasoning**:
  - The progression uses the natural minor scale without consistent raising of the 7th degree (A♭ remains natural, as seen in D♭ and A♭-related chords; no prominent A natural for harmonic minor flavor).
  - A♭m6 emphasizes the flattened 7th (A♭ root with minor third B/C♭), aligning with Aeolian's subtonic (VII) rather than harmonic minor's leading tone.
  - No strong V chord (Fm) or raised 7th suggests Dorian (which would include a major VI, but G♭ is minor-key flavored). It's not Phrygian (lacks E♭ emphasis) or Locrian.
  - The repetitive, moody loop evokes Aeolian's characteristic minor sound without modal mixture dominating (e.g., borrowed major chords are minimal).

This progression has a jazz/R&B or pop-ballad vibe (possibly from a song like an Adele or Sam Smith track?), but fits squarely in B♭ minor's Aeolian mode. If this is from a specific piece, more context could refine it further!

### Reasoning

**Examining the Chord Progression**

\n\n

I've started by taking a look at the chord progression. My initial deconstruction focused on identifying the key and common functional relationships between the chords. I'm now looking at the cadential patterns and how the slash chords affect the overall harmonic movement. The goal is to get a handle on the structure and potential for modulation.


**Identifying Possible Borrowing**

\n\n

Now that I've identified B-flat minor as the apparent key, I'm digging into each chord to confirm its function. The `Abm6` chord is particularly interesting. It might be borrowed from another key. I'll need to check the borrowed chord options. I'm also scrutinizing the slash chords, looking at how the bass notes influence the harmonic movement and possible voice leading.


**Dissecting the B/Bb Chord**

\n\n

The analysis of `B/Bb` is proving complex. It's clearly not diatonic to B-flat minor. Initially, I thought about secondary dominants, but that doesn't feel right. My current working hypothesis is that it might involve modal mixture, perhaps borrowed from B-flat major. I'm checking for its function and its role in voice leading toward Bbm.


**Refining Chord Function**

\n\n

I've been re-evaluating the function of each chord within the B-flat minor context. The `Db/Ab` functions as a straightforward subdominant, while the `Gb/Bb` acts as a submediant, offering a smooth voice leading to the tonic. I'm now comparing the `B/Bb` to other possible non-diatonic chords, considering its implications for a stronger resolution to the tonic. I'm taking a hard look at the `Abm6`, comparing it with alternative analyses.


**Considering Harmonic Functionality**

\n\n

My current focus is on the `Abm6`. I now see it's function as a `Fm7b5` chord in first inversion, acting as a chromatic approach to the tonic. I'm checking it against the harmonic minor scale. I am also investigating the impact the `Gb/Bb` chords have on voice leading to and from the tonic, while noting the cadence.


**Deconstructing the Chords**

\n\n

I'm revisiting the `Abm6` to confirm my suspicion that it's acting as a `Fm7b5` chord, offering a chromatically descending line toward the tonic. I'm now comparing the functions and relationships between the remaining chords, including the `Gb/Bb` and `Db/Ab`, considering voice leading. This should clarify the tonal center.


**Concluding Chord Functions**

\n\n

My analysis has led me to finalize the chord functions. The `Abm6` is a sophisticated pre-tonic chord, providing chromatic color. I now see the role the `Gb/Bb` and `Db/Ab` chords have in the progression, particularly in their voice leading, confirming my suspicions. The Neapolitan chord adds a unique character. My analysis is complete.


**Concluding the Analysis**

\n\n

With all the chord functions established, I'm now fully aware of each chord's purpose. The use of chromatic chords, like the `Abm6`, enhances the tonal depth. I see now how the `Gb/Bb` acts as a submediant, leading to the tonic in a pleasing way. The `B/Bb` further exemplifies a rich musical language. My comprehensive analysis is now finished.


**Assessing the Overall Sound**

\n\n

I've begun taking stock of the overall texture of the piece, now that I have completed my analysis of the individual chords. Considering the natural minor scale, and the Neapolitan chord, I'm thinking about the way these harmonic tools add color to the piece. The effect is one of a darker, richer and more layered feel, allowing for a somewhat melancholy sound.




Based on the chord progression provided, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **B-flat minor**
*   **Mode:** **Natural Minor** (with significant chromaticism)

---

### **Detailed Analysis:**

1.  **Tonic Center (The "Home" Chord):** The progression begins and ends on **Bbm**. This chord also appears more frequently than any other, establishing it as the tonic and pointing strongly to **B-flat minor** as the key.

2.  **Diatonic Chords:** Let's analyze the chords based on the B-flat natural minor scale (Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab):
    *   **Bbm** is the **i** (tonic) chord.
    *   **Gb/Bb** is a **Gb Major** chord (the **VI** chord) over the tonic note in the bass. This is a very common and smooth movement in minor keys.
    *   **Db/Ab** is a **Db Major** chord (the **III** chord) over its fifth in the bass. This is also perfectly diatonic to B-flat natural minor.

3.  **Chromatic Chords (The "Color" Chords):** The progression uses two key non-diatonic chords that add significant harmonic color.
    *   **B/Bb**: This is the most telling chromatic chord. **B Major** is the enharmonic equivalent of **Cb Major** (Cb-Eb-Gb). A major chord built on the lowered second scale degree (Cb in this key) is called the **Neapolitan Chord** (bII). Using the Neapolitan is a classic feature of minor-key harmony, creating a dramatic, color-rich sound that strongly leads back to the tonic or dominant. Here, it's placed over the tonic bass note (Bb), which intensifies the tension before it resolves back to Bbm.
    *   **Abm6**: This is a sophisticated subdominant chord. The notes are Ab - Cb(B) - Eb - F. It functions as a colorful approach to the final Bbm chord. It acts as a substitute for the more common `iv` chord (Ebm), creating a "minor plagal cadence" (like iv-i, but with a chromatic twist) that feels both somber and conclusive.

4.  **Why Natural Minor?** The progression consistently uses the notes of the natural minor scale for its primary diatonic chords (Bbm, Gb, Db). Crucially, there is no major V chord (F Major) or a leading-tone diminished chord (A diminished), which would require the raised 7th degree (A natural) found in the harmonic or melodic minor scales. The overall feel is more modal and plagal rather than driven by a strong dominant-to-tonic pull.

**In summary:** The piece is firmly rooted in **B-flat minor**. It uses the **natural minor** scale as its foundation but enriches the harmony with classic chromatic chords like the Neapolitan (B/Bb) and a colorful minor subdominant (Abm6) to create a dark, atmospheric, and harmonically rich progression.

### Reasoning

Okay, let me try to figure out the key and mode for this chord progression. The chords given are: Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, B/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6, Bbm.

First, I need to understand what each chord is. Let's break them down. The notation is a bit confusing with slashes, so I should figure out what the slash chords mean. For example, Gb/Bb. The chord before the slash is the main chord, and after the slash is the bass note. So Gb/Bb would be a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. Wait, but Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So if the bass note is Bb, which is already the third of the Gb major chord, that would make it a first inversion chord. So Gb/Bb is Gb major in first inversion.

Similarly, Db/Ab is Db major with Ab in the bass. Db major is Db, F, Ab. So Ab is the fifth, so Db/Ab is Db major in second inversion.

B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass? Wait, B major is B, D#, F#. But Bb is not part of B major. Wait, that might be a typo. Wait, maybe it's Bb? Let me check again. The original progression has B/Bb. So the chord is B major, and the bass note is Bb. But B major and Bb don't belong together. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be Bb/Bb? But the user wrote B/Bb. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a B diminished chord or something else? Wait, B/Bb could be a misspelling, perhaps it's Bb/Bb which is just Bb major, but written as B/Bb? Wait, maybe the user meant Bb, but wrote B by mistake. Wait, let's see. Let's list out all the chords with their notes.

Starting with Bbm. Bb minor is Bb, Db, Fb (which is E). Wait, no: minor chord is root, minor third, fifth. So Bb minor is Bb, Db, F. Because minor third from Bb is Db (since Bb to C is major second, C to Db is minor second, so Bb to Db is minor third). Then the fifth is F (Bb to F is perfect fifth). So Bbm: Bb, Db, F.

Gb/Bb: Gb major chord (Gb, Bb, Db) with Bb in the bass. So the notes are Bb, Gb, Db. Wait, but the chord is still Gb major, just inverted.

Db/Ab: Db major (Db, F, Ab) with Ab in the bass, so Ab, Db, F.

B/Bb: B major (B, D#, F#) with Bb in the bass. But Bb is not in B major. This seems problematic. Maybe it's a typo and should be Bb/Bb, meaning Bb major with Bb in the bass, which is just Bb major. Or perhaps it's a B diminished chord? B diminished is B, D, F. But with Bb in the bass? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Bb chord with an added note, but written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be Db/Bb? Wait, but the user wrote B/Bb. Let me check the original sequence again: ...Db/Ab, B/Bb... Hmm. Maybe B/Bb is a B major chord over Bb bass, but that creates a dissonance. Alternatively, maybe it's a miswrite for Ab/Bb? Not sure. Let's hold that thought and proceed.

Abm6: Ab minor 6th chord. Ab minor is Ab, Cb (B), Eb. Then add the 6th, which is F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

Now, to find the key, we need to see which key these chords naturally belong to. Let's list all the roots of the chords: Bbm, Gb, Db, B (problematic), Abm6.

Wait, the roots here are Bb, Gb, Db, B (if it's B major), Ab. But B major is a very sharp key, which doesn't fit with the flats we're seeing in other chords. So perhaps B/Bb is a typo. Maybe it's Ab/Bb? Wait, no, the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, could it be a Bb chord? If it's Bb, then Bb/Bb is Bb major. Let me check common keys.

Looking at the chords: Bbm, Gb, Db, Abm6. Let's see the key of Bb minor. Natural minor key of Bb minor has the notes Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So the diatonic chords in Bb natural minor would be:

i: Bbm

ii°: C dim

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

Wait, but in the progression, we have Gb major (which would be the VI chord in Bb minor), Db major (III), Ab minor 6th (which is based on VII, but Abm is the VII chord in Bb natural minor? Wait, in natural minor, the VII is major. Wait, no: let's recast.

In natural minor, the scale degrees are all natural. So Bb natural minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

Chords built on each degree:

i: Bb (minor) - Bb, Db, F

ii°: C diminished - C, Eb, Gb

III: Db major - Db, F, Ab

iv: Eb minor - Eb, Gb, Bb

v: F minor - F, Ab, C

VI: Gb major - Gb, Bb, Db

VII: Ab major - Ab, C, Eb

Wait, but in the progression, after Db/Ab (which is Db major), we have B/Bb. If B/Bb is supposed to be Ab major (VII), then that fits. But the user wrote B/Bb. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be Ab/Bb? Wait, but Ab/Bb would be Ab major with Bb in the bass, which is a second inversion Ab chord. However, in the list it's written as B/Bb, which is confusing.

Wait, let's look at the chord B/Bb again. If the chord is B major (B, D#, F#) over Bb bass, that would create a very dissonant sound, maybe a Bb7 chord with a #9? But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake and should be Ab/Bb. Because Ab major chord with Bb in the bass would be Ab major second inversion (Ab, C, Eb with Bb as bass? Wait, no, Bb isn't in Ab major. Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. So Bb isn't part of it. Hmm.

Wait another thought: maybe the "B" here is actually "Bb". In some notations, especially in European systems, B is Bb and H is B natural. But the user is using Bb here already, so probably not. Wait, the chord is written as B/Bb. If it's Bb/Bb, that's just Bb major. But the user wrote B/Bb. Maybe it's a typo for Bb/Bb. Let's assume that for a moment. So Db/Ab followed by Bb/Bb. Then the progression would make more sense in Bb minor.

Wait, let's check:

Bbm, Gb, Db, Bb. In Bb natural minor, the chords would be i, VI, III, i (since VII is Ab major, but here it's Bb). Wait, but Bb would be the i chord. Hmm.

Wait, the sequence is: ... Db/Ab, B/Bb, Bbm...

If B/Bb is Bb major (assuming typo), then the chords are Db major, Bb major, Bbm. But Bb major is not in Bb natural minor; in natural minor, Bb is minor. So Bb major would be the VII chord in Cb major, but that's a very theoretical key.

Alternatively, maybe it's Bb harmonic minor. Bb harmonic minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb. So raised 7th (A instead of Ab). Then the diatonic chords would have Ab augmented or something? Wait, chord on VII would be Ab augmented? Not sure. Alternatively, the V chord would be F major (since 7th is A natural). Wait, harmonic minor changes the v chord to major and the VII chord to diminished.

Wait, maybe the key is Ab major? Let's see. Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Diatonic chords:

I: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: G dim

But in the progression, we have Bbm, which would be ii in Ab major. But the progression starts with Bbm, which is more likely to be the tonic in a minor key.

Another approach: list all the notes present in the chords.

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db (since it's Gb major in first inversion)

Db/Ab: Db, F, Ab

B/Bb (assuming B is a typo and it's Ab major?): Ab, C, Eb

Wait, but if B/Bb is actually Ab major, then notes are Ab, C, Eb. But B/Bb is confusing. Alternatively, if B/Bb is Bb7, which is Bb, D, F, Ab. But written as B/Bb? Not sure.

Wait, let's look at Abm6. Abm6 is Ab, Cb (B), Eb, F. So notes Ab, B, Eb, F.

Wait, Abm6 contains a B natural, which is a major sixth above Ab (Ab to F is major sixth? Wait, Ab to F is a major sixth interval (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F — that's six notes, yes). Wait, minor sixth would be Fb, but Abm6 is Ab minor with a major sixth added. So Ab minor triad is Ab, Cb, Eb. Then major sixth is F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. So notes: Ab, B (Cb is B), Eb, F.

So in Abm6, we have B natural. That suggests a raised sixth scale degree if we're in a minor key. For example, in Bb harmonic minor, the 7th is raised to A natural, but the 6th remains Gb. Wait, no: Bb harmonic minor has A natural (raised 7th), but the 6th is still Gb. However, Abm6 has B natural, which would be a major sixth above Ab. Wait, in Bb minor, the sixth note is Gb (in natural minor). If the sixth is raised to G natural, that would be Bb melodic minor ascending. Bb melodic minor ascending: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. So raised 6th and 7th. Then the sixth degree is G, so chord built on Ab (which is the VII degree) would be Ab major? Wait, no.

Wait, let's try Bb melodic minor (ascending). Scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

Chords:

i: Bb min

ii: C min

III+: Db augmented

IV: Eb maj

V: F maj

vi°: G dim

vii°: A dim

Wait, but Ab isn't in this scale. Wait, Ab would be the flattened seventh? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but Abm6 has an Ab root, so maybe the key is Ab minor. Let's check Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. So equivalent to G# minor, but usually written as Ab minor.

Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb.

Chords in Ab natural minor:

i: Abm

ii°: Bb dim

III: Cb (B) major

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (E) major

VII: Gb major

But in this progression, we have Bbm, which would be the ii° chord in Ab minor, but it's a minor chord, not diminished. Wait, no, in natural minor, the ii chord is diminished. So Bbm would not be diatonic to Ab minor. Unless it's a different mode.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Gb major. Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Diatonic chords:

I: Gb

ii: Abm

iii: Bbm

IV: Cb (B)

V: Db

vi: Ebm

vii°: F dim

So Bbm would be the iii chord in Gb major. But the progression starts with Bbm, so unlikely to be iii chord.

Wait, but the progression has a lot of Bbm, Gb, Db. In Gb major, Gb is I, Bbm is iii, Db is V. So a I-iii-V progression? Not common.

Alternatively, Dorian mode. Let's consider Bb Dorian. Bb Dorian has the notes Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So differs from natural minor by having a major sixth (G natural instead of Gb). So chords in Bb Dorian:

i: Bbm

ii: Cm

III: Db

IV: Eb

v: Fm

VI: Gb

vii°: Ab dim

So in Bb Dorian, the IV chord is Eb major, but in our progression, we have Abm6. Hmm. Wait, but Abm6 contains Ab, B (Cb), Eb, F. Wait, in Bb Dorian, Ab is the flatted seventh, so the VII chord would be Ab major (Ab, C, Eb). But Abm6 is minor with a major sixth, which suggests a different construction.

Wait, looking at the Abm6 chord: Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which is Ab minor triad plus F. In the key of Bb minor (natural), the Ab would be the minor seventh, so the VII chord is Ab major. But Abm6 is a minor chord, so not directly diatonic. Unless it's a borrowed chord.

Alternatively, the presence of both Gb major and Db major suggests that Gb and Db are IV and I in Db major. Let's see: Db major scale, chords would be Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Ab, Bbm, C dim. So Bbm would be vi in Db major. But the progression starts with Bbm, which would be unusual for a vi chord to be tonic.

Wait, but the progression has two Bbm chords followed by two Gb/Bb (which is Gb major), then Bbm again, then Db/Ab (Db major), then B/Bb..., etc. So Bbm - Gb - Bbm - Db - ... So Bbm to Gb is i - III in minor (if Bb minor). Wait, in natural minor, III is major. So Bb minor key: i = Bbm, III = Db major. Wait, but Gb major is VI. Wait, Bb natural minor: VI is Gb major. So progression i - VI - i - III ... That is a common progression in minor keys (e.g., i - VI - III - VII). So maybe Bb natural minor.

Let's list the progression with that in mind:

Bbm (i), Bbm (i), Gb/Bb (VI), Gb/Bb (VI), Bbm (i), Bbm (i), Db/Ab (III), B/Bb (problem), Bbm (i), etc.

Assuming B/Bb is a typo for Ab (VII), then Db (III), Ab (VII), i.

That would make sense for a progression i - VI - i - III - VII - i, which is a common progression in minor keys.

Given that Abm6 is the last but one chord before returning to Bbm. Abm6: if Ab is the VII chord, in natural minor it should be Ab major (VII). But here it's Ab minor 6th. That suggests maybe harmonic minor? Wait, in Bb harmonic minor, the Ab would be raised to A natural, so the VII chord would be Ab augmented or something else? Wait, Bb harmonic minor scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb. So the seventh degree is A, making the Ab note not present. The VII chord would actually be on A, but A is the leading tone.

Wait, in Bb harmonic minor, the diatonic chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: C dim

III+: Db aug

iv: Ebm

V: F major (due to raised 7th A)

VI: Gb maj

vii°: A dim

But Ab doesn't appear here. So Abm6 must be borrowed from another mode.

Alternatively, the Abm6 could be a iv chord in Bb Phrygian? Bb Phrygian: Bb, Cb (A#), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Wait, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the Abm6 has an F natural. In Bb natural minor, the sixth is Gb, but the F is the fifth. However, Abm6 adds F as the sixth. Wait, minor 6th chord is built as minor triad plus major sixth. So Abm6 is Ab-Cb-Eb-F. The F is the major sixth above Ab. In terms of the key, if we are in Bb minor, the Ab note is the minor seventh scale degree. Having an Abm6 chord here might indicate that we're using the subtonic (minor VII) chord, but as minor instead of major. In natural minor, the VII is major, so Ab major. But here it's Ab minor, suggesting maybe Dorian mode? Wait, in Bb Dorian, the VII chord is Ab major as well. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a modal mixture. Or perhaps the key is Ab minor. Let's check Ab minor.

Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Enharmonically: G# minor, but we'll stick with Ab.

Chords in Ab natural minor:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbm dim

III: Cb (B) major

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (E) major

VII: Gb major

But in our progression, Bbm is prominent. If Bbm is ii° in Ab minor, it should be diminished, but it's a minor chord, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless it's Ab Dorian? Ab Dorian: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb. So raised sixth (F natural instead of Fb). Then:

i: Abm

ii: Bbm

III: Cb

IV: Db

v: Ebm

VI: F maj

vii°: Gb dim

But in this case, Bbm would be the ii chord. But the progression starts with Bbm as the tonic, so probably not.

Wait, going back. The repeated use of Bbm as the anchor chord suggests it's the tonic. So key of Bb minor. Now, which flavor of minor? Natural, harmonic, or melodic.

The chords present: Bbm (i), Gb (VI), Db (III), Ab (VII but minor 6th).

In natural minor: VI and VII are major. So Gb major and Ab major.

In harmonic minor: the VII becomes major because of the raised seventh (but in Bb harmonic minor, the seventh is A natural, so the scale has A instead of Ab, thus the Ab note isn't there; the seventh chord would be on A).

Wait, this is confusing. Let's tabulate:

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Chords: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

So III is Db major, VI is Gb major, VII is Ab major.

Our progression has Bbm (i), Gb (VI), Db (III), and then instead of Ab major (VII), we have B/Bb which we're unsure about, then later Abm6.

Wait, if the progression uses Abm6 instead of Ab major, that suggests it's not purely natural minor. Maybe a mode like Dorian, which has a major sixth. Bb Dorian: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab.

In Bb Dorian:

i: Bbm

ii: Cm

III: Db

IV: Eb

v: Fm

VI: Gb

vii°: Ab dim

Wait, but VII chord is Ab diminished? No, in Dorian, the seventh degree chord is diminished? Wait, scale degrees for chords: in Dorian mode, the chords are i, ii, III, IV, v, vi°, VII.

Wait, better to build chords:

Bb Dorian: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chord on Bb: Bb, Db, F → Bbm (i)

C: C, Eb, G → Cm (ii)

Db: Db, F, Ab → Db (III)

Eb: Eb, G, Bb → Eb (IV)

F: F, Ab, C → Fm (v)

G: G, Bb, Db → G dim (vi°)

Ab: Ab, C, Eb → Ab (VII)

Ah, there we go. So in Bb Dorian, the VII chord is Ab major. So if our progression has Abm6 instead of Ab major, that's a deviation. However, Abm6 has Ab, Cb (B), Eb, F. The Cb is B natural, which is not in Bb Dorian (which has C natural). So B natural vs C natural.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's consider the Abm6 chord. Notes: Ab, B (Cb), Eb, F.

This has a B natural (Cb), which is a raised fifth of Ab minor (since Ab minor triad is Ab, Cb, Eb). So raised fifth would be C natural, but here it's B natural, which is actually a minor sixth above Ab. Wait, Abm6 is constructed as minor triad plus major sixth: Ab (root), Cb (minor third), Eb (fifth), F (major sixth). So F is the major sixth. So the notes are Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

In terms of scale degrees, if Ab is the tonic, then F is the sixth degree. So in Ab minor, the sixth degree natural is Fb (E), but if it's raised, it becomes F natural. So Ab harmonic minor has a raised seventh (G), but sixth remains Fb. Ab melodic minor ascending has raised sixth (F) and seventh (G).

Ah! So Ab melodic minor ascending scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab.

Thus, the sixth degree is F natural. So in this scale, an Abm6 chord would fit because the sixth is F (major sixth). So Abm6 is diatonic to Ab melodic minor (ascending).

But how does this relate to the overall key of the progression which centers around Bbm?

If the progression has Abm6 as a chord, and also Bbm, Gb, Db, perhaps the key is Bb Phrygian? Let's check.

Bb Phrygian mode: Bb, Cb (A#), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb. So equivalent to Ab major scale starting on Bb.

Notes: Bb, A#, Cb is enharmonic confusion. Better to think in flats: Bb Phrygian is mode of Ab major: sixth mode.

Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Sixth mode (Aeolian): F minor.

Wait, maybe another approach. Modes share the same notes as their parent major scale.

If we consider all the chords: Bbm, Gb, Db, Abm6.

The roots are Bb, Gb, Db, Ab — all roots are a perfect fourth apart: Bb to Eb would be next, but we have Db. Wait, Bb - Eb - Ab - Db - Gb - Cb (B) - ... It's a cycle of fourths.

Bb -- (F) --> Eb -- (C) --> Ab -- (G) --> Db -- (D) --> Gb -- (A) --> Cb.

But our chords are Bb, Gb, Db, Ab. Which are Bb, then down a fifth to Eb? Not sure.

Wait, chord progression in minor keys often use iv and v chords, but here we have III and VI.

Common minor progression: i - VI - III - VII (e.g., in Am: Am - F - C - G)

Which is exactly similar to what we have here if we consider:

i = Bbm

VI = Gb

III = Db

VII = Ab

So progression i - VI - i - III - VII - i

Indeed, the given progression is:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, [B/Bb], Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6, Bbm

Assuming [B/Bb] is a typo for Ab (VII), then it fits the common i - VI - III - VII progression in Bb natural minor.

But the last chord before returning to Bbm is Abm6 instead of Ab major. Hmm. Abm6 vs Ab major.

In natural minor, it should be Ab major (VII). But here it's Ab minor 6th. However, Abm6 contains the same notes as F minor 7th (F, Ab, Cb, Eb). Maybe it's functioning as a iv chord? Not sure.

Wait, Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. If we think of Bb as the tonic, Ab is the minor seventh scale degree. In natural minor, Ab is the VII major chord. But Abm6 has Cb (B) instead of C natural. Wait, B natural is not in Bb natural minor. Bb natural minor has C natural? Wait, no:

Bb natural minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Wait, hold on! Earlier I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, intervals for natural minor: whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole.

Starting at Bb:

Bb (root)

Bb + whole = C

C + half = Db

Db + whole = Eb

Eb + whole = F

F + half = Gb

Gb + whole = Ab

Ab + whole = Bb

Yes, so Bb natural minor scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So the sixth note is Gb, seventh is Ab.

Therefore, chord built on Ab (VII) is Ab major: Ab, C, Eb.

But Abm6 is Ab, Cb (B), Eb, F. So the third of the Ab chord is Cb instead of C natural. That would be a minor third, hence Ab minor. But in natural minor, Ab should have a major third (C natural), making it Ab major. So Abm6 is Ab minor with an added sixth (F), which suggests it's not diatonic to Bb natural minor.

However, if we are in Bb harmonic minor, the seventh note is raised to A natural. So scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb.

Then, the Ab note isn't in the scale; the seventh is A natural. So Abm6 still doesn't fit.

Bb melodic minor ascending: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

Then, Ab isn't in the scale either. Descending is natural minor.

Alternatively, could the key be Ab harmonic minor? Let's see.

Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G, Ab.

Chords:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbm dim

III+: Cb aug

iv: Dbm

V: Eb (major due to G natural)

VI: Fb (E) dim

VII: G maj (as G-A#/Bb)

But this has Bbm, which is ii°, but in our progression Bbm is a minor chord, not diminished. So Bbm as ii should be diminished in Ab harmonic minor, but it's not. So doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: Maybe it's Dorian mode. Bb Dorian, which has a major sixth.

Bb Dorian: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Note that sixth is G natural, not Gb.

So diatonic chords:

i: Bbm

II: Cm

III: Db

IV: Eb

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

Yes! So the VII chord is Ab major. Now, Abm6 is different; it's Ab minor with F added. But in Bb Dorian, Ab major would be the VII chord (Ab, C, Eb). The Abm6 has Cb instead of C natural, which is not in Bb Dorian. However, if we consider a modal interchange, borrowing the iv chord from the natural minor (which would be Ebm), not sure.

Wait, but the presence of G natural (from Bb Dorian's sixth degree) would mean that the F in Abm6 is diatonic? Wait, Abm6 has F natural as the sixth. In Bb Dorian, F is the fifth scale degree, so F natural is present.

Wait, Abm6 notes: Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

If in Bb Dorian, Ab is the VII, and the chord would be Ab major (Ab, C, Eb). To make it minor, we need to lower the third to Cb, which is not in the Dorian mode. So Abm6 would be a borrowed chord, perhaps from Bb Aeolian (natural minor).

Bb natural minor has Ab major as VII, Bb Dorian has Ab major as VII as well. Wait:

Wait, no: In Bb natural minor, the VII chord is Ab major (Ab, C, Eb). In Bb Dorian, since Dorian has a major sixth (G natural), the seventh degree Ab still forms a major chord because C natural is still the third (scale degree for Ab chord: Ab, Bb, C... wait no).

Wait, scale degrees in Bb Dorian:

Pitch: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab

So for chord on Ab (VII):

Ab is the note, next scale degrees: Ab, Bb, C. Wait, no: chord is Ab, C, Eb.

Because the Ab chord: Ab (root), C (major third), Eb (fifth). But in Dorian mode, does C natural exist?

Yes, in Bb Dorian, the notes include C natural (second degree). So Ab major chord (VII) is diatonic: Ab, C, Eb.

Therefore, Abm6 with a minor third (Cb) is not diatonic. Unless...

Wait, the Abm6 chord has Cb which is B natural. So B natural is not in Bb Dorian (which has Bb, C, D etc.). So B natural would be a raised fifth.

This is perplexing. Maybe the key is Gb major, but the tonic is Bbm? No, Gb major's vi chord is Ebm.

Wait, let's list all the chord roots:

Bbm, Gb, Db, Abm6. The roots are all major keys a minor third apart? Not sure.

Wait, another method: look for the most common chords and see relative majors/minors.

Bbm's relative major is Db major (Bbm i = Db III). Gb's relative minor is Ebm. Not sure.

But the progression centers on Bbm, with Gb and Db as prominent chords. In the key of Bb minor, Gb is VI and Db is III. As mentioned before, i - VI - III is a common minor progression.

If we accept that Abm6 is a variation of the VII chord (normally Ab major), perhaps in the progression it's using a different mode where the VII chord is minor. When is the VII chord minor in a minor key?

In natural minor, VII is major. In harmonic minor, VII is diminished (if the seventh is raised). Wait:

Bb harmonic minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

Chord on Ab: does Ab exist? No, the seventh note is A, so scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. So no Ab, thus chord on Ab wouldn't be diatonic.

Bb melodic minor ascending: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A. Still no Ab.

Bb melodic minor descending is natural minor, so Ab appears.

This is tricky. Maybe the Abm6 is actually functioning as a iv chord in Bb minor? But iv in Bb minor is Ebm.

Wait, Abm6 root is Ab. Transposed to Bb minor, Ab is the minor seventh degree. So chord built on the minor seventh is usually major in natural minor.

But here it's minor sixth chord. However, the "6" in Abm6 refers to the sixth added, not the chord being in first inversion. Abm6 is a four-note chord: minor triad plus major sixth interval from the root.

Given that the progression ends with Abm6 going back to Bbm, it might be using Abm as a subtonic chord. But why the sixth?

Alternatively, maybe the key is Ab minor, and Bbm is a IV chord or something. But progression starts on Bbm.

Wait, consider the following: the chords Bbm, Gb, Db are all related by the circle of fifths. Bbm to Db is minor third up, Db to Gb is minor third up. This is characteristic of the diminished scale, but probably not relevant here.

Wait, common minor key progressions: The progression i - VI - III - VII is very common (e.g., "Don't Stop Believin'"). In Bb minor, that would be Bbm - Gb - Db - Ab.

Our progression matches this except for the Abm6 instead of Ab major, and that interloper B/Bb.

Assuming B/Bb is meant to be Ab (VII), then it fits perfectly: Bbm - Gb - Bbm - Db - Ab - Bbm... etc.

But the user wrote "Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm", so after Db/Ab comes B/Bb. If B/Bb is Ab major, but written incorrectly as B/Bb. Maybe a misprint where "Ab" was written as "B" due to similar shape in handwriting or typo. For example, in some fonts, Ab and B might look similar? Unlikely, but possible.

Given that all other chords fit perfectly into Bb natural minor (i, VI, III, VII), I think it's safe to assume that "B/Bb" is a typo for "Ab" or "Ab/Bb" (which would be Ab major second inversion). Ab/Bb is Ab chord with Bb in bass, but Bb isn't in Ab major. Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. So Bb isn't part of it; thus Ab/Bb would be non-diatonic.

Alternatively, maybe "B/Bb" is supposed to be "Bb", so Bb major. But in Bb natural minor, Bb major is the III+ chord? No, in Bb minor, III is Db major.

Wait, another thought: if "B/Bb" is actually "F/Bb", which would make sense as the V chord in Bb minor. Because V in natural minor is minor, but in harmonic minor it's major. If we use F major as V, that would fit harmonic minor.

Let's see: progression would be ... Db/Ab, F/Bb, Bbm...

F major with Bb bass is second inversion F chord. F major is V in Bb harmonic minor.

Then the progression has Bbm (i), Gb (VI), Db (III), F (V) — but the sequence is i - VI - i - III - V - i, which is plausible.

But where does Abm6 fit in? Before last chord is Abm6.

Wait, user wrote: ...Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm.

So after returning to Bbm a couple times, it goes to Abm6 then Bbm.

If Abm6 is functioning as a VII chord, even if minor, and in the context of Bb minor, with possible melodic minor influence (raised sixth), let's see:

Bb melodic minor ascending has G natural instead of Gb. So scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A.

Chord on Ab: Ab, C, Eb which is Ab major — but wait, Ab isn't in the scale. The seventh note is A, so scale degrees don't include Ab. Hmm.

Wait, descending melodic minor is natural minor, which has Ab. But usually melodic minor ascending and descending differ.

This is getting too bogged down. Given the prominent chords are Bbm, Gb, Db, and the resolution to Abm6 before Bbm, and assuming the "B/Bb" is an error, the most straightforward answer is Bb natural minor.

Even though Abm6 is not strictly diatonic (should be Ab major), sometimes in pop music the VII chord is minor due to mixture or other influences. Alternatively, Abm6 could be analyzed as a borrowed chord from Dorian mode (which has a minor iv chord), but that's stretching.

Wait, another angle: Abm6 can be seen as the iv chord in Bb minor if we consider F minor.

Wait, Bb minor, iv chord is Ebm. Not related.

Hold on: Abm6 contains F natural, which is the fifth of Bb minor. Abm6: Ab, Cb, Eb, F. If we voice this as F - Ab - Cb - Eb, it's F minor 7th (F, Ab, Cb, Eb). So Abm6 is enharmonically equivalent to Fm7. Maybe it's functioning as a v chord? Bb minor's v chord is Fm. Yes!

In Bb natural minor, the v chord is F minor. So an Fm7 chord would fit. But the chord is written as Abm6. Depending on voicing, chords can be respelled. Abm6 (Ab, Cb, Eb, F) is the same as Fm7 (F, Ab, Cb, Eb). Yes! So it's an Fm7 chord in first inversion or something else. But named as Abm6.

This is a crucial insight. So Abm6 is enharmonically equivalent to Fm7. The fifth chord in Bb natural minor is Fm. Therefore, this chord is actually the v chord (Fm), but voiced with Ab as the root, making it Abm6.

How does that fit into the progression?

Original progression after B/Bb is Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb,..., then:

Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, [B/Bb], Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6 (Fm7), Bbm.

Wait, let's map it:

- Up to Db/Ab: This is Db major (III)

- Next chord B/Bb (problem)

- Then two Bbms

- Then Gb/Bb (VI)

- Two Bbms

- Then Abm6 (Fm7 as v), leading to Bbm

Ah! So if the Abm6 is actually the v chord (Fm7), then the progression ends with v - i, which is a perfect cadence. But in natural minor, v is minor, so Fm - Bbm is a minor v-i cadence.

So reinterpreting Abm6 as Fm7 (same notes), the progression makes sense: ... Fm7 (v) → Bbm (i)

That's a standard cadence.

Similarly, the chord before the final Abm6/Fm7: it's Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb,... wait, the order is:

... Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm

So two Bbms, two Gb/Bbs (VI), two Bbms, then Abm6 (v), then Bbm (i).

Wait, but then where does Db/Ab fit in? Earlier we have:

Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm...

Assuming Db/Ab is Db major (III), then:

i, i, VI, VI, i, i, III, ?, i, i, VI, VI, i, i, v, i

If "B/Bb" is a mistake, and the following chords make sense without it, or if it's another chord.

But if Abm6 = Fm7 = v, then the progression uses i - VI - i - III, and later i - VI - i - v - i.

This is plausible. Common progressions in minor keys often use v (minor fifth) for cadences, though in harmonic minor it's major (V).

Given that the final cadence uses Abm6 which functions as v-i, this suggests the mode is natural minor, since v is minor. If it were harmonic minor, we'd expect V major (F major) leading to i.

Therefore, the key is Bb natural minor.

Let's verify all chords:

- Bbm = i

- Gb = VI

- Db = III

- Abm6 = Fm7 = v (enharmonically equivalent)

All of these chords exist in Bb natural minor:

i: Bbm

III: Db

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab (but we're using v instead)

Wait, yes, in natural minor:

i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII

So III (Db), v (Fm), VI (Gb) are all present.

The Db/Ab is Db major (III) with Ab in bass (second inversion), which is fine.

Abm6 as Fm7 is the v chord, which explains its presence.

The B/Bb chord—if we consider it might be F major (V), but written incorrectly. If "B/Bb" is supposed to be "F/Bb", which is F major second inversion (F, Ab, C with Bb bass? No, F major is F, A, C. So F/Bb would be non-diatonic. Wait, no, Bb isn't in F major.

Alternatively, if "B/Bb" is supposed to be "Bb", but Bb major isn't diatonic to Bb minor.

Given the Abm6 makes sense as v, and assuming "B/Bb" might be a typo for F (or Fm), but without more info, the predominant chords fit Bb natural minor.

Therefore, the key is Bb minor, natural minor mode.

The chord progression provided can be analyzed as follows to determine its key and mode:

---

### **Chord Breakdown**
- **Bbm**: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F) — the tonic chord.
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb major in first inversion (Bb, Gb, Db) — VI in Bb natural minor.
- **Db/Ab**: Db major in second inversion (Ab, Db, F) — III in Bb natural minor.
- **Abm6**: Ab minor 6th (Ab, Cb, Eb, F) — enharmonically equivalent to **Fm7** (F, Ab, Cb, Eb), functioning as the **v chord** (Fm) in Bb natural minor.
- **B/Bb**: Likely a **typo** for **F/Bb** (F major with Bb bass) or **Ab**, which would align with the progression. Assuming this is **Fm7** (v) or **Ab major** (VII), but the **Abm6** (v) at the end confirms the use of natural minor.

---

### **Key and Mode Analysis**
1. **Tonic Identification**:  
   The progression centers around **Bbm**, which acts as the **tonic chord (i)**. This strongly suggests the key is **Bb minor**.

2. **Chord Relationships in Bb Natural Minor**:  
   The **Bb natural minor scale** is:  
   **Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab**.  
   Diatonic chords in this scale are:  
   - **i**: Bbm  
   - **ii°**: C diminished  
   - **III**: Db major  
   - **iv**: Ebm  
   - **v**: Fm  
   - **VI**: Gb major  
   - **VII**: Ab major  

   The progression uses:  
   - **Bbm (i)**, **Gb (VI)**, **Db (III)**, and **Fm7 (v)** (enharmonically written as **Abm6**).  
   These chords all align with **Bb natural minor**.

3. **Resolution and Cadence**:  
   The progression ends with **Abm6 → Bbm**, which functions as **v → i** (Fm7 → Bbm). This is a **minor perfect cadence**, characteristic of **natural minor** (where **v** is minor).  
   In **harmonic minor**, the **v chord** would be **major (F major)**, but here **Fm7** (v) is used, confirming the use of **natural minor**.

4. **Resolving Ambiguities**:  
   - **Abm6** is enharmonically equivalent to **Fm7**, the **v chord** in Bb natural minor. This explains its presence in the progression.  
   - The **B/Bb** chord is likely a typo or misnotation. If interpreted as **F/Bb** (F major second inversion) or omitted, the progression remains coherent in **Bb natural minor**.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **Bb minor**  
- **Mode**: **Natural minor**  

This progression follows a common natural minor pattern:  
**i – VI – i – III – v – i**, with **Abm6** functioning as **v (Fm7)** before resolving to the tonic (Bbm). The consistent use of minor v (Fm) and absence of a raised 7th (characteristic of harmonic minor) confirms **natural minor** as the mode.

---

### **Final Answer**
- **Key**: **Bb minor**  
- **Mode**: **Natural minor**

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

> Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Db/Ab – B/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Abm6 – Bbm

### Step 1: Identify the Root Notes and Chords

Let’s write out the chords with their **roots** (ignoring inversions for now):

- Bbm = Bb minor
- Gb/Bb = Gb major with Bb in the bass → chord is **Gb**, bass note is **Bb**
- Db/Ab = Db major with Ab in the bass → chord is **Db**, bass note is **Ab**
- B/Bb = B major with Bb in the bass → chord is **B**, bass note is **Bb** — **This is a chromatic anomaly**
- Abm6 = Ab minor 6th (Ab–Cb–Eb–F)

Wait — **B chord over Bb bass (B/Bb)**? That’s unusual.

B major is **B–D#–F#**. Bb is **A#**, so having B over Bb is enharmonically **B over A#**, which is a very dissonant half-step clash. But **B/Bb** likely indicates a **B major triad over Bb bass** — this is highly chromatic and probably a **misinterpretation or typo**.

But let's look again: Could it be **Bb dim** or **B diminished** over Bb? Or is **"B/Bb"** meant to be **C♭ / Bb**?

Wait — perhaps it's not **B natural**, but **Bb** — could this be a **notation error**?

In jazz or popular music notation, **"B" over "Bb"** is extremely rare. But **C♭** is enharmonic to **B**, so **C♭/Bb** is possible.

But **Db/Ab** just before it, followed by **B/Bb** — that would make more sense as **C♭/Bb**? But that still doesn't resolve smoothly.

Alternatively, could **B/Bb** be a **misprint** for **Bb**? Or maybe **Bdim**?

Wait — let's re-express the chords:

Let’s go back:  
- Bbm – Bbm  
- Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb → Gb major with Bb bass  
- Bbm – Bbm  
- Db/Ab → Db major with Ab bass  
- B/Bb → B major over Bb bass — very strange  
- Bbm – Bbm  
- Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
- Bbm – Bbm  
- Abm6 – Bbm

That **B/Bb** stands out.

But here’s a possibility: In **jazz or gospel** contexts, **B** over **Bb** could be **enharmonically** reinterpreted.

But B = enharmonic to C♭

So B/Bb = C♭/Bb — which is a **Cb major triad over Bb** — still odd.

But **Cb major** is not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps it's **B°** (B diminished) over Bb? That would be: B° = B D F → over Bb → creating a **Bb7(♭9)** sound? That could make sense in a resolution to Bbm.

So maybe **B/Bb** is actually meant to represent a **Bdim chord over Bb bass**, which functions as **Bb7♭9**? That’s a common way to voice **dominant7♭9** chords: use a dim chord a **half-step above the root**.

- B dim over Bb = creates **Bb7♭9** (Bb D F Ab Cb)  
  - B dim = B D F = same as **C♭ D F** = **enharmonic to 7♭9** of Bb7

Yes — this is a **common substitution**.

So: **B/Bb** is likely functioning as **Bb7♭9**, which is the **V7♭9 of Bbm**.

That makes sense harmonically.

So we reinterpret:

- **B/Bb** → **Bdim/Bb** → functions as **Bb7♭9** → **V7♭9 of Bbm**

So it’s a **secondary dominant** leading back to **Bbm**.

Similarly, **Db/Ab** — Db major over Ab bass → root is **Db**, bass Ab (5th of Db) — so it’s just Db major in second inversion. But **Db major** is **bVI** in Bbm.

And **Gb/Bb** = Gb major over Bb → Gb is **bIII** in Bb minor? Let's check.

---

### Step 2: Consider Key of Bb Minor

Let’s assume **tonic = Bb minor**

In Bb natural minor (Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb)

Chords built on degrees:

- i = Bbm
- ii° = Cdim
- III♭ = Db
- iv = Ebm
- v = Fm
- VI♭ = Gb
- VII♭ = Ab

Now look at our chords:

- Bbm = **i** — tonic
- Gb/Bb = Gb major — that’s **VI♭** (Gb) — so **bVI** — common in minor keys (borrowed from Phrygian or natural minor)
- Db/Ab = Db major — that’s **III♭** — **bIII** — also common in minor
- B/Bb = as analyzed, likely **Bb7♭9** → **V7♭9 of i** — very common in minor
- Abm6 — Ab minor 6 (Ab–Bb–Eb–F) — that’s **viiø6**? Wait:

In Bb minor:

- Ab = 7th scale degree
- Ab minor = Ab–Bb–Eb → but Abm6 adds **F**, the 6th
- So Abm6 = Ab Cb Eb F → that’s the **viiø7** chord if you use **Bbb (A)** — but here Cb = B, so **Ab–C♭–Eb–F** = Ab–B–Eb–F → but that has **B natural**, which is **not in Bb minor**.

Wait — **Abm6 = Ab–Cb–Eb–F**

In standard spelling:

- Cb = enharmonic to B, but in Ab minor, the third is **C♭** (instead of C♮)

So Abm6 = **Ab–C♭–Eb–F**

But that’s:

- Ab (root)
- Cb (minor third)
- Eb (fifth)
- F (sixth)

So intervals: 1, b3, 5, 6

That's **i6** in **Ab minor**, but here it's being used as a **chord in Bb minor**

In **Bb minor**, the **7th degree** is Ab, and a chord built on Ab with Cb, Eb, F — is that diatonic?

Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab

So:

- Ab (7th degree)
- Cb? Cb = B, but the **2nd degree is C**, so Cb is **not in scale**
- So **Cb** is **not diatonic** to Bb natural minor
- But **C** is in Bb **harmonic** minor!

Ah — here we go.

---

### Step 3: Consider Bb Harmonic Minor

Bb harmonic minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb A

Scale: 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 7

So:

- 7th degree is **A natural**, not **Ab**

But our chord is **Abm6**, not A dim.

So can't be A-based.

Abm6 uses **Ab**, so root is Ab — flat 7.

But in harmonic minor, we raise the **7th**, so **A natural**, not **Ab**.

So **Abm6** is not in **Bb harmonic minor**.

But maybe **melodic minor**? Bb melodic minor ascending: Bb C Db Eb F G A

Still, **A natural**, not Ab.

So Abm6 has **Ab**, so it's **lowered seventh**, not raised.

So it’s **not** in harmonic minor.

But Abm6 contains **F natural** as the 6th.

In **Bb natural minor**, F is diatonic.

But Abm6 = Ab–Cb–Eb–F

Cb = B, which is not in Bb natural minor (has C, not B)

So **Cb (B)** is **enharmonic to the leading tone**, but it’s spelled **Cb**, not B.

Wait — in **Ab major**, Cb would be the flat third? No.

Wait — perhaps **Abm6** is used as a **borrowed chord**, or perhaps there's a modal mixture.

Another idea: maybe this is in **Bb dorian**?

Bb dorian: Bb C Db Eb F G Ab Bb

So: 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7

Yes — contains **Ab (b7)** and **G (6)**

So Abm6 chord: Ab–Cb–Eb–F

- Cb = B — but dorian has **C natural**, not **Cb**

So still no Cb.

**Cb** is **B**, not **C natural**

There's a problem: **Cb ≠ C natural** — **Cb = B**

So **Abm6 with Cb** contains **B**, not **C**

So the chord has **B**, not **C**

So in terms of pitches: Abm6 = **Ab, B, Eb, F**

That’s: Ab (root), B (major second), Eb (fifth), F (sixth)

That interval is **Ab to B** = **augmented second** — very exotic.

Wait — is **Abm6** spelled correctly?

Standard **Ab minor 6** is: Ab–Cb–Eb–F

- Cb = B (enharmonic), so pitches: **Ab, B, Eb, F**

But **Ab to B** is a **major third**, not a minor third?

Wait — **minor third from Ab** is **Cb**, which is **B** — yes, **Ab to B is a major third**, because Ab to C is major third, Ab to B is **greater than major third**.

Hold on:

- Ab to B:  
  - Ab to A = minor second  
  - A to B = major second  
  - So Ab to B = two half steps = major second — no, **Ab to B is 3 half steps**: Ab–A (1), A–Bb (2), Bb–B (3) → Ab to B is **augmented second** (same as minor third enharmonically, but spelled differently)

In equal temperament, **Cb = B**, so **Ab–Cb = Ab to B**, which sounds like **Ab to B**, which is a **major third** interval (4 semitones):

- Ab to B:  
  - Ab–A = 1, A–Bb = 2, Bb–B = 3? No:
  - Ab → A = 1 semitone (Ab = G#, G# to A = 1)
  - A to B = 2 semitones
  - Total Ab to B = 3 semitones = **minor third**

Ah! **Ab to B is 3 semitones**, same as **Ab to Cb** — so **Cb is correct** spelling for **minor third of Ab minor**

In 12-TET, **Cb and B are the same pitch**, but in notation, for **Ab minor**, the third is **Cb**, not **B**

So **Abm6** = Ab–Cb–Eb–F → same as Ab, B, Eb, F in sound

So pitches: **Ab, B, Eb, F**

Now, which scales contain all of these?

- Ab, Eb, F → common tones
- B = leading tone

So if we're in **Ab minor**, then B = Cb = minor third — fine

But **B natural** is the **raised seventh in Ab harmonic minor**

Ab harmonic minor: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G

Yes! **7th degree is G**, so **V** is **Eb**, **V7** includes **G**, and **i** is **Abm**

But here, we have **Abm6**, which is **Ab–Cb–Eb–F**

F is the **6th** — in Ab minor, F is the **6th scale degree only in natural and melodic**, but **melodic minor ascending** has **F#**, so not F.

In **Ab natural minor**: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb → has **Fb** = E, not F

So no F

In **Ab harmonic minor**: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G → Fb = E, so still **no F natural**

So where do we get **F natural**?

This is confusing.

Wait — perhaps **Abm6** is not Ab minor with 6th, but **6th chord** meaning **minor triad with sixth above root**, which is standard.

But still, same pitches.

But here's another idea: **Abm6** is the **iv6** chord in **Bb Dorian**

Let’s check Bb Dorian: Bb C Db Eb F G Ab

So:

- iv chord = Ebm (Ebm7) — not Abm

Abm would be **vii** chord in Bb Dorian:

- Bb Dorian: i Bbm, ii Cm, iii°, IV Eb, V F, vi G, vii° Ab° — no Abm

So not dorian.

Back to Bb minor.

Wait — what if we reconsider the **B/Bb** chord.

We already think it's **Bb7♭9** function (V7♭9 of Bbm), which is very common in minor.

So that supports **Bbm** as tonic.

Similarly, **Gb major** is **bVI** in Bb minor — common in minor key progressions (e.g., "House of the Rising Sun")

**Db major** is **bIII** — also common in minor (e.g., in "Cry Baby", "All Along the Watchtower")

So bVI (Gb), bIII (Db), i (Bbm) are all common **borrowed chords** in **minor keys**, but actually, in **natural minor**, **bIII** and **bVI** are diatonic:

- Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab
- So **Db = III**, **Gb = VI**, so **Db and Gb are diatonic**, not borrowed.

Wait — in **Bb natural minor**:

- i = Bbm
- III = Db major
- VI = Gb major

Yes! So:

- Bbm = i
- Gb = VI
- Db = III

But in minor keys, **III** and **VI** are **major**, not minor.

Yes — that’s correct.

So Gb/Bb = Gb major in first inversion — **VI**
Db/Ab = Db major in second inversion — **III**

So the progression has:

- i – i – VI – VI – i – i – III – ?
- Then **B/Bb** → which we’ve interpreted as **Bb7♭9** (V7♭9 of i)
- Then back to i

Then: i – i – VI – VI – i – i – **Abm6 – Bbm**

What is **Abm6**?

In Bb natural minor:

- vii° = Ab° (Ab, Cb, Eb)

But **Abm6** = Ab, Cb, Eb, F → adds **F**, the **b6** of Ab scale, but in Bb minor, F is the **5th** degree.

So Abm6 = **Ab–Cb–Eb–F**

In Bb natural minor:
- Ab = 7th degree
- Cb = enharmonic B, but in scale, 2nd degree is **C natural**, not Cb
- Wait — in key signature of Bb minor, B is not lowered — so **Cb is not in the scale**

But in minor keys, the **third of the chord** is **already lowered** — so when spelling **triads**, we use flat accidentals.

In Bb minor, the **C is natural**, but the **third of Ab chord** is **Cb** (because Ab to C is major third, but we need **minor third**, so Cb)

So **Cb** is used to spell **minor third of Ab minor**, even though it's the same pitch as B.

But in the **scale**, the **second note** is **C**, not **Cb**

So when **Cb** appears in a chord, it's just the spelling — it's not altering the key.

So **Abm6** is **vii** chord with added 6th.

What is the function?

Abm6 = **Ab–Cb–Eb–F**

In Bb minor, that’s:

- b7 – b2 – b4 – 5

But as a chord, it’s **vii** with added sixth.

But **vii** in minor is diminished, but here it's **minor**? No, **Abm** is minor, but in Bb minor, the **vii chord** should be **Ab diminished** (Ab–Cb–Ebb), but Ebb = D.

But here we have **Eb**, not **D**

So **Abm** = Ab–Cb–Eb → that’s **Ab minor**, which is **not** the diatonic vii chord.

The diatonic **vii chord** in Bb minor is **Ab diminished**: Ab–Cb–Ebb (Ab–Cb–D)

But here we have **Ab–Cb–Eb**, which is a **minor third (3 semitones)** from Cb to Eb? Cb = B, Eb = E — B to E = 5 semitones = **diminished fourth**, not minor third.

Wait:

- Cb to Eb:  
  - Cb to D = major seventh? Messy.

Ab–Cb–Eb:
- Ab to Cb = minor third (3 semitones)
- Cb to Eb = major third (4 semitones)
- Ab to Eb = perfect fifth (7 semitones)

So it's a **minor triad** — yes.

But in **Bb minor**, the **vii chord** built on Ab should be:

- Ab, B, D → but B and D are not in key — Bb minor has **C**, not **B**, and has **Db**, not **D**

Wait — the **vii degree chord** is built from scale degrees:

- 7 (Ab), 2 (C), 4 (Eb)

So Ab–C–Eb

But **Ab–C–Eb** is **Ab major**, because Ab to C is **major third**

But in minor key, we don't alter chord qualities — the diatonic chord on vii is **Ab major**, not minor.

Wait a minute!

Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab

Chords:

- i: Bbm (Bb-Db-F)
- ii°: C° (C-Eb-Gb)
- III: Db (Db-F-Ab)
- iv: Ebm (Eb-Gb-Bb)
- v: Fm (F-Ab-C)
- VI: Gb (Gb-Bb-Db)
- VII: **Ab (Ab-C-Eb)** → **Ab major**

Oh! So the **VII chord** in Bb natural minor is **Ab major**, not Ab diminished.

I made a mistake earlier.

In natural minor, the **vii chord** is **major**, built on the b7.

So:

- **Ab major** = Ab–C–Eb

But our chord is **Abm6** = Ab–Cb–Eb–F

Which is **Ab minor** — so **not diatonic**

To make it **minor**, we need to **lower the third** — so **C to Cb**

So **Abm6** has **Cb**, which is **not in Bb natural minor**

Therefore, **Abm6** is a **non-diatonic chord**, probably used for color.

But in **Bb harmonic minor**, we have:

- Scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb A

Chords:

- i: Bbm
- II°: Cdim
- bIII+: Ebm (wait, no)

Actually, in harmonic minor, the **III chord** is augmented, but **VI** is diminished, etc.

The **vii chord** is **Ab–**C–E, but A is not in scale — Ab is not a root.

Roots:

- i: Bbm
- ii°: Cdim
- III+: Eb aug? No

Better to build:

Scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A

Chords:

- i: Bbm
- ii°: C–Eb–Gb = Cdim
- III+: Db–F–A = Db aug
- iv: Ebm
- V: F major (because A is leading tone)
- vi°: Gbdim
- VII: Ab–C–Eb = **Ab major**

So again, **vii is Ab major**, not minor.

To get **Ab minor**, we’d need to **lower the third from C to Cb**, which would give **Abm**, but that would require **Cb**, which is not in any Bb minor mode.

So **Abm6** is likely a **chromatic chord** or **misinterpretation**.

Perhaps it's **Ab6** (major 6th) instead of **Abm6**?

But it's labeled **Abm6**

Another idea: perhaps it's **G#m6**, but notated as Ab for consistency.

Unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the key is **Ab minor**, and the progression is modulating.

But the overwhelming number of Bbm chords suggests **Bbm is tonic**.

Perhaps **Abm6** is a **borrowed chord** from another mode.

But let's step back.

Best explanation:

- The chord progression is in **Bb minor**
- **Tonic**: Bbm
- **Gb major** = **VI** (diatonic)
- **Db major** = **III** (diatonic)
- **B/Bb** = Bdim/Bb → **Bb7♭9**, functioning as **V7♭9 of i** (common in minor)
- **Abm6** — less common, but possible as a **chromatic passing chord**

Abm6 to Bbm: Ab to Bb = whole step, so could be a **modal** or **chromatic transition**

But why not **Ab major**? That would be diatonic.

Perhaps **Abm6** is a typo for **Ab6** or **Ab**?

But assuming it's intentional, it might be from **Bb Phrygian** or something.

Bb Phrygian: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab — so **b2**, which is Cb.

Then:

- ii chord = Cb–Eb–Gb = Cb major
- iv = Ebm
- VI = Gbb = F diminished?

Not helpful.

But in Phrygian, the **i** chord has a **b2**, so **C minor** second.

But our progression has no such melody.

Given that most chords fit **Bb natural minor**, and the non-diatonic Abm6 is likely a **color chord** or the spelling is off, I think the intended key is:

### **Bb minor** (specifically **natural minor** or **Aeolian**)

With chromatic passing chords.

And the **B/Bb** functions as **secondary dominant** (V7♭9 of i), strengthening the minor tonic.

### Final Answer:

**Key**: Bb minor  
**Mode**: Natural minor (Aeolian)

> Although Abm6 is not diatonic, it may be used for color or there might be a notation issue. The rest of the progression strongly supports Bb natural minor.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chords: Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at the chord symbols. Some of them have slashes, like Gb/Bb, which means Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. Similarly, Db/Ab is Db major with Ab in the bass, and B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass. Then there's Abm6, which is A-flat minor sixth. The rest are Bbm (B-flat minor) and others. So I need to list out all the chords without the slashes to understand the actual chord qualities.

Let me rewrite the chords in root position to make it clearer. So:

- Bbm: that's B-flat minor, so notes Bb, Db, F.
- Gb/Bb: this is a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. So the root is Gb, but the bass note is Bb. The actual chord is Gb major (Gb, Bb, Db), but since Bb is in the bass, it's a first inversion of Gb major? Wait, no. A Gb major chord in first inversion would have Bb as the lowest note. But Gb major has notes Gb, Bb, Db. So if Bb is the bass, it's Gb/Bb, which is first inversion of Gb major. But sometimes slash chords like this are used for pedal points or to indicate the bass note explicitly.

Similarly, Db/Ab: Db major chord with Ab in the bass. Db major notes are Db, F, Ab. So Ab is the fifth of the chord. So Db/Ab is Db major in second inversion? Because the fifth is in the bass. Wait, no. Db major: Db (root), F (third), Ab (fifth). So if the bass is Ab, that's fifth in the bass, so second inversion.

B/Bb: B major chord with Bb in the bass. Wait, that's a bit confusing. B major chord is B, D#, F#. But here the bass is Bb. So the chord would be B major with Bb not part of the chord? That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's supposed to be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's B over Bb, but that doesn't make much sense. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a B major chord with a Bb bass, which would be a polychord or something. But that seems unusual. Maybe it's a typo and should be Bb major? But no, it says B/Bb.

Alternatively, perhaps B/Bb is meant to be B major chord with Bb as the bass note, which would imply that the chord is B major, but with a Bb in the bass. So the notes would be Bb, B, D#, F#. But that includes both Bb and B, which is a dissonance. That seems odd. Maybe it's a B7 chord with Bb in the bass? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake. Maybe B/Bb is supposed to be Bbm? But the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, maybe it's a B major chord with Bb as the bass note, but that's a bit strange. Let me note that as possible.

Then Abm6: A-flat minor sixth. So A-flat minor chord with a sixth added. A-flat minor is Ab, Cb, Eb; sixth would be F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. But usually, minor sixth chords have the sixth above the root. So Ab minor sixth would be Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

But wait, Cb is B natural? No, in standard notation, Cb is B natural. But sometimes it's written as B, but technically, in key of Ab minor, the minor scale has Ab, Bbb (which is A), but wait, no. Let's clarify. The natural minor scale of Ab minor is Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. Wait, but usually we would write the minor scale with enharmonic equivalents for readability. But Cb is equivalent to B natural. Hmm. But Abm6 would typically be written as Ab, Cb (which is B), Eb, F. But F is the sixth above Ab. So the chord would be Ab, B, Eb, F. But that might be considered as Ab minor with an added sixth, which is also equivalent to F minor with Ab in the bass. But maybe.

But perhaps Abm6 is just Ab minor with a sixth, so Ab, Cb, Eb, F. But since Cb is B natural, that chord is Ab, B, Eb, F. Which are notes A-flat, B, E-flat, F.

Hmm, okay. Let me list all chords:

1. Bbm: Bb, Db, F

2. Bbm: same

3. Gb/Bb: bass is Bb, so chords notes Gb, Bb, Db (root position is Gb, Bb, Db; so Gb/Bb is Bb in bass, so Gb major first inversion)

Similarly, Gb/Bb: Gb major with Bb bass.

4. Gb/Bb same

5. Bbm

6. Bbm

7. Db/Ab: Db major with Ab in bass. Db, F, Ab. Ab is fifth of Db chord, so second inversion.

8. B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. So the chord has notes B, D#, F# and bass Bb. So Bb, B, D#, F#. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo? Maybe it's meant to be Bb? Or Bb major? But the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, perhaps B/Bb is a B major chord over Bb bass, which could be considered as a Bmaj7#5 or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a B7 chord, but B7 has B, D#, F#, A. But with Bb in the bass, that would be a dissonant chord. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for Bb/Bb, but the user wrote B/Bb. Maybe they meant Bb major chord with Bb in bass? But that's just root position Bb major. That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a slash chord where the top note is B and bass Bb, but that would be a B over Bb, which is a bit unclear. Maybe the user meant something else. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe B/Bb is a B dominant seventh with Bb bass? No, B7 has B, D#, F#, A. If bass is Bb, then the notes are Bb, B, D#, F#, A. That's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's a B major chord with an added major seventh? Wait, B major chord with Bb in bass... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the slash chord is B/Bb meaning the bass is Bb and the chord is B major? So B major triad over Bb bass. So the chord would be Bb (bass), then B, D#, F#. But that's very dissonant because of the B and Bb in close proximity. Maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be Bb/Bb? But the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, maybe it's a Bdim chord? No, but B/Bb would be different. This is a bit confusing. Let's note that as a possible typo or something odd.

Moving on. Then Bbm again, etc., then Abm6. So Abm6 is Ab minor sixth.

Let me list all chords:

- Bbm (x4 times)

- Gb/Bb (x2)

- Db/Ab (once)

- B/Bb (once)

- Abm6 (once)

So in total:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, B/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6, Bbm

Hmm. Now, perhaps looking at the chord qualities. Let's convert all slash chords to their basic chord qualities. But perhaps it's better to look at the bass notes and the chord qualities.

So let's break down each chord:

1. Bbm: root Bb, minor

2. Bbm

3. Gb/Bb: bass Bb, chord Gb major (so Gb-Bb-Db)

4. Gb/Bb same

5. Bbm

6. Bbm

7. Db/Ab: bass Ab, chord Db major (Db-F-Ab)

8. B/Bb: bass Bb, chord B major (B-D#-F#) ?

Wait, if it's B/Bb, then the chords notes are bass Bb, and then chord B major. So notes: Bb (bass), B, D#, F#. That's a lot of semitones. But maybe that's intentional? Alternatively, perhaps this is a typo for Bb/Bb, which would be normal, but the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, Bb major over Bb bass? No, Bb/Bb would just be Bb major. But the user wrote B/Bb. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the slash chord is written as top note over bass? No, usually slash chords are chord / bass note. So B/Bb would mean a B chord (triad or whatever) with Bb as bass. So yes, the chord is B major, bass note Bb.

But that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a miswriting of Bb/Bb? Which would just be Bb. But the user wrote B/Bb. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's Bb7 or something else. Let's see. Let's tentatively take it as B major chord over Bb bass. Though that's a bit odd.

Alternatively, maybe B/Bb is supposed to be Bb/Bb, but the user mistyped the B as a Bb. Or maybe it's supposed to be something like B7/Bb? That could be, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misspelling of Bb/Bb. But regardless, let's proceed.

Moving on, so the other chords: Abm6, which is A-flat minor sixth. So Ab chord with minor third and added sixth. So notes Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which in practical terms is Ab, B, Eb, F.

Now, perhaps looking at the bass notes to see a pattern. Let's list the bass notes for each chord:

1. Bbm: bass Bb

2. Bbm: Bb

3. Gb/Bb: bass Bb (since the slash is Bb)

Wait, slash chords indicate the bass note, so yes: Gb/Bb means Gb chord with Bass Bb.

So bass note is Bb for chord 3.

Similarly:

Chord 4: same, bass Bb

Chord 5-6: Bbm, bass Bb

Chord7: Db/Ab: bass Ab

Chord8: B/Bb: bass Bb

Chord9-10: Bbm: bass Bb

Chord11-12: Gb/Bb: bass Bb

Chord13-14: Bbm: bass Bb

Chord15: Abm6: bass could be Ab (if root position), but the chord is Abm6, which in root position has bass Ab, but if it's written without slash, then yes.

Chord16: Bbm: Bb

So let's list all bass notes:

Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab (assuming Abm6 is root position), Bb

Wait, Abm6 typically would have Ab as bass note if it's in root position. So chord 15 bass is Ab.

So bass notes sequence:

Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb

So the bass notes are mostly Bb, with some Ab in there.

Now, looking at the chords themselves. The chord symbol is like Bbm, so the chord quality is minor. Gb/Bb is a Gb major chord (since Gb is the root, Bb as bass). So Gb major.

Db/Ab is Db major chord.

Abm6 is minor sixth chord.

If we ignore the bass notes for a moment and look at the chord roots:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb (major), Gb (major), Bbm etc. So the chord roots: Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, Db, B, Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb.

So chord roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, Ab.

This is a bit confusing. Now, let's see what scale these notes might fit into. Let's list all chord notes.

First, Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

Db major: Db, F, Ab

B major: B, D#, F#

Abm6: Ab, B (since Cb is B), Eb, F

Wait, Abm6 = Ab minor with sixth. So minor triad is Ab, Cb, Eb. Sixth would be F (since 6th above Ab is F). So chord notes: Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Cb is B natural. So Ab, B, Eb, F.

But in Ab minor key, the diatonic notes would be Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But with the minor sixth, it's the natural minor, so yes, adding F.

But B major chord has notes B, D#, F#. So that's a lot of sharps, which might not fit into a flat key.

Alternatively, maybe the B/Bb is a typo. Let's consider that possibilities. If it's supposed to be Bb/Bb, then the chord is Bb major. That would make more sense. Maybe a typo. Because otherwise, B major chord in a key with flats seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the chord is Bb7? But Bb7 would be Bb, D, F, Ab. But written as B/Bb? No.

Another thought: sometimes slash chords can be used for pedal point. For example, the bass note stays Bb a lot. The bass is mostly Bb, which might indicate that Bb is the tonic or a pedal tone.

So if Bb is the bass throughout, with chords changing above. Let's see.

Bbm chord is Bb minor. So if Bb is the tonic, then Bbm would be the i chord. But then other chords: Gb major. In Bb minor, what's Gb major? Let's look at the harmonic and melodic minor scales.

In Bb natural minor: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb (or Gbb, but better written as A natural? Wait no.

Wait Bb natural minor scale: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb. Hmm, Abb is A, but actually the correct spelling would be: Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb (A♭). Wait, no. Natural minor of Bb: the key signature has two flats (Bb, Eb). Wait, yes: Bb minor key signature is actually two flats? Wait no. Wait, Bb minor is the relative minor of Db major. Db major has four flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. So relative minor is Bb minor (since Db major's 6th scale degree is Bb). Wait, yes: the key of Bb minor has a key signature of four flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. Wait, but natural minor scale would be Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb? Wait, no. Let's get this right.

Natural minor scale for Bb minor starts on Bb, the notes would be: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb (but usually spelled as A natural? No, in standard notation, it's Ab. Wait, Eb? Wait: Bb minor scale.

The natural minor scale is the same as the Aeolian mode of the major scale. So Bb natural minor is the same as Db major scale starting on Bb.

Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So the Aeolian mode on Bb would be Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb? Wait, no: from Db major, the 6th degree is Bb. So Bb natural minor is the Aeolian mode of Db major. So notes in Bb natural minor: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Abb (which is A natural, but that's confusing). Wait, in standard terms, the Bb natural minor scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. Wait, but that's not right because C would be C natural, but in Db major scale (key of Db), the notes are Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So yes, the Bb natural minor scale would have these notes.

Wait, yes: the Bb natural minor scale is based on the Db major scale (which has four flats), so the notes would be Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. Wait, no: Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So the notes of Db major.

If you take Bb as the root to form the natural minor, it's the 6th degree of Db major. So the Bb natural minor scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A? Wait, no: let's list all degrees.

From Db major scale:

1. Db

2. Eb

3. F

4. Gb

5. Ab

6. Bb

7. C

8. Db

So the natural minor chord scale on Bb (as the 6th degree) would have the same notes:

Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb.

Wait, but in this notation, the scale would be Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

Wait, but C is natural? Yes. And A natural. So key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), but in actual practice, the Bb natural minor scale uses these notes. So Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

So diatonic chords in Bb natural minor:

i - Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

ii° - C diminished (C, Eb, Gb)

III - Eb major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

iv - F minor (F, Ab, C)

v - Gb minor (Gb, Bb, Db), but wait, actually in minor scale the 5th chord is usually diminished in natural minor, but wait:

Wait let's check diatonic chords in Bb minor:

Using the natural minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

So chords:

i: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

ii°: C diminished (C, Eb, Gb)

III: Eb major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

iv: F minor (F, Ab, C) – but Ab is not in the scale; wait the scale has A natural and Gb, but Ab would be a flat A? Wait, in Bb natural minor scale, the notes are Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. So no Ab or Bb. Wait, C is natural, Db is flat D, Eb is E flat, F is natural, Gb, A natural.

So the chords:

i: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

ii°: C, Eb, Gb = C diminished

III: Eb major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

iv: F minor? F, Ab, C – but Ab is not in the scale. Wait, the scale has A natural, so F minor chord would need Ab, but Ab is not present. Wait, F minor chord: F, Ab, C – but Ab isn't in Bb natural minor scale. The scale has A natural, not Ab. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps better to construct diatonic chords properly. The natural minor scale is 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7.

So for Bb natural minor:

1: Bb

2: C

b3: Db

4: Eb

5: F

b6: Gb

b7: Ab

Wait, no! Wait, minor scale has b3, b6, b7.

So Bb minor:

root: Bb

b3: Db

b7: Ab

b6: Gb

So natural minor scale for Bb: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Yes! I think I made a mistake earlier. The natural minor scale of Bb has Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So A flat, not A natural. Because the 7th degree in minor is a b7. So for Bb minor, the diatonic 7th is Ab. Yes.

So key signature would be 5 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, Db major has four flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. The relative minor of Db major is Bb minor. So the key signature for Bb minor is the same as Db major, which is four flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. So yes, in the natural minor scale of Bb, the scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Yes. So the 7th is Ab. So that makes sense. So all chords would use these notes.

So diatonic chords in Bb natural minor:

i: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

ii°: C diminished (C, Eb, Gb)

III: Eb major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

iv: F minor (F, Ab, C)

v°: Gb diminished (Gb, Bb, Db)? Wait, fifth chord: starting on F scale degree: 5th note is F, so F to Gb? Wait:

Scale steps:

1: Bb

2: C

3: Db

4: Eb

5: F

6: Gb

7: Ab

So chord on 5th degree (F): F, Ab, C. But that's F minor, which is iv. Wait, the v chord is the fifth degree, which is F, but wait:

Wait, the chords built on each degree:

i: Bb minor

ii°: Cdim

III: Eb major

iv: F minor

v: Gb minor (since the fifth note Gb is the root? No, the fifth degree of the scale is F. Wait, no. Let's list all chords:

Degree 1: Bb - minor chord (Bb, Db, F)

Degree 2: C - diminished (C, Eb, Gb)

Degree 3: Eb - major (Eb, Gb, Bb)

Degree 4: Eb? Wait, no. Scale degree 4 is Eb. So chord is Eb, Gb, Bb? Wait, no. Wait, the chord built on 4th degree of Bb minor scale (which is Eb):

Eb, Gb, Bb, Dbb? No, triads only. So Eb, Gb, Bb? Yes: Eb major chord.

Wait, Eb minor? No. Eb as root, third is Gb, fifth is Bb. Yes, Eb major.

Degree 5: F. The chord built on F: F, Ab, C. So F minor.

Degree 6: Gb. Chord is Gb, Bb, Db. Which is Gb major.

Degree 7: Ab. Chord is Ab, Cb, Eb. But Cb is B, so Ab diminished chord? Ab, Cb, Eb. Cb is B natural, which would make it Ab, B, Eb. So diminished? Let's see: Ab to Cb is minor third (Cb is B), and Cb to Eb is minor third, so yes, Ab diminished. But in natural minor, the vii chord is diminished.

Wait, natural minor scale diatonic chords:

i: minor

ii°: diminished

III: major

iv: minor

v: minor (but in harmonic minor, it's major)

vi: major

vii°: diminished

So for Bb minor:

i: Bb minor

ii°: C diminished

III: Eb major

iv: F minor

v: Gb minor? Wait, scale degree 5 is F, chord F minor.

Scale degree 6 is Gb, chord Gb major.

Scale degree 7 is Ab, chord Ab diminished.

Wait, yes.

So diatonic chords:

i: Bb minor

ii°: Cdim

III: Eb Major (but Eb could also be considered as a major chord in minor key)

iv: F minor

v: Gb minor (no, scale degree 5 chord is F minor. Scale degree 5 note is F, chord built on F is F minor.

vi: Gb major

vii°: Ab diminished.

But typically, in minor keys, the v chord is often raised to a major 5th chord for stronger cadence. So harmonic minor would have the raised 7th. So Bb harmonic minor would have Ab raised to A natural. So the v chord is Gb major.

But let's get back. So in Bb minor key, chords present would be Bbm, Eb, Fm, Gbm (if natural or harmonic), etc.

Now looking at the chord sequence given:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb (which is Gb major chords), Db/Ab (Db major chord), B/Bb (unknown), Abm6, etc.

In the context of Bb minor, Gb major could be the vi chord (since vi in Bb minor is Gb major). Because as per above, vi is Gb major.

Db major: Db is the III chord? Wait no. In Bb minor, the III chord is Eb major. Wait, no:

Wait chord on III: yes, Eb major. So Db major would be... where does Db fit in?

Wait Bb minor scale notes: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So Db is the third degree. So chord on Db would be Db diminished? Wait, the diatonic chord built on second degree (C) is diminished, third degree Db chord: Db, F, Ab. Which is Db major? Db (root), F is minor third above Db? No: Db to F is major third, because Db to Eb is major, Eb to F is minor, so Db to F is major third. Wait, Db, F, Ab is Db major chord. Yes. Because Db to F is major third, F to Ab is minor third, so Db major.

Wait, so chord on third scale degree (Db) is Db major. Yes. So in Bb minor key, the III chord is Db major.

Wait, but earlier we said III is Eb major. No, confusion here. Wait, if the scale degrees:

1. Bb

2. C

3. Db

4. Eb

5. F

6. Gb

7. Ab

So chord built on 3rd degree (Db): Db, F, Ab. Db major.

Yes. So iii chord is Db major.

Similarly, IV chord is Eb minor? No, chord on 4th degree: Eb, Gb, Bb. Which is Eb minor? Because Eb to Gb is minor third, Gb to Bb is major third. So minor chord. Wait, Eb, Gb, Bb is Eb minor. But the standard notation for chords in minor key: usually chords are named as minor or major.

But in general terms, for Bb natural minor:

i: Bb minor

ii°: C diminished

iii: Db major

iv: Eb minor

v: F minor

vi: Gb major

vii°: Ab diminished.

Wait, that seems right.

Wait, chord on F (5th degree): F, Ab, C. Which is F minor.

Chord on Gb (6th degree): Gb, Bb, Db. Which is Gb major.

Yes. So vi chord is Gb major.

So in Bb minor, vi chord is Gb major. So Gb major is diatonic.

Similarly, Db major is iii chord.

Db major chord is indeed the iii chord of Bb minor.

Now, looking at Db/Ab: Db major chord with Ab in bass. Db major notes are Db, F, Ab. So Ab is the fifth. So Db/Ab is Db major in second inversion.

Similarly, Abm6: A-flat minor sixth. In Bb minor, Ab is the vii° chord in natural minor, but with addition of sixth. Ab minor chord would be Ab, Cb, Eb. But Cb is B natural, so Ab, B, Eb. But in Bb minor, the natural minor scale has Ab as the vii° chord.

But Abm6 would be A-flat minor with added sixth. So Ab minor has Ab, Cb, Eb; sixth would be F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

But in Bb minor key, the natural minor scale uses Ab and Eb. Let's see: Abm6 chord notes are Ab, B, Eb, F.

Db major: Db, F, Ab (from Db major triad)

Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

So all these chords seem to fit into Bb minor. Let's check:

- Bbm (i)

- Gb major (vi)

- Db major (iii)

- Ab minor (vii°)

But wait, in the chord sequence we have an Abm6, which is Ab minor with added sixth. Which would fit into the same key.

Now what about the B/Bb chord? If it's B major chord with Bb bass, which would be B, D#, F# with bass Bb. That's problematic because B major has an F#, which is not in Bb minor; Bb minor has Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So F# would be a sharp, which is not in the key. But B in the scale is Cb, which is equivalent to B. Wait: scale of Bb minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Wait, no! Wait again:

Wait, the natural minor scale for Bb minor is:

Bb (1), C (2), Db (b3), Eb (4), F (5), Gb (b6), Ab (b7).

So the notes are Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So all flats. So B is not in the scale; the second scale degree is C natural. Wait, yes: C natural. So there is a C natural here. But B natural is not in the scale.

Wait, Cb is the same as B natural. But in Bb minor scale, the b3 is Db. So the notes don't include B natural; instead, they have C natural and Db.

Wait, yes, Bb m scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So all natural except for the flats. So C is natural. So no B natural. So a B major chord (B, D#, F#) would be completely outside the Bb minor key. So if there's a B/Bb chord (B major over Bb bass), which introduces notes B, D#, F#, Bb – which have a B natural, D# (which is Eb? No, D# is different from Eb, but they are enharmonic equivalent, but not the same note in terms of diatonic scale). Wait, but in Bb minor key, the scale has Eb natural, which is not same as D#. But regardless, B natural is not in scale, so B major chord would be non-diatonic.

But maybe B/Bb is a typo. Let's consider that. If it's supposed to be Bb/Bb, but then chord is Bb major. But Bb major in Bb minor would be a major i chord, but minor key normally uses minor i. Alternatively, if it's Bbm7 or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's Bb major with bass Bb. But still. Alternatively, perhaps B/Bb should be Bbm/Bb? No. Or maybe B7/Bb? B7 would have B, D#, F#, A. Bass Bb would create a weird chord.

Alternatively, the chord might be a Bb11 or something. But perhaps most likely a typo for Bbm/Bb? Which is just Bbm. But the user wrote B/Bb.

Another possibility: maybe the user wrote B/Bb when they meant Bb/Bb, which is just root position Bb. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, could it be Bb over Bb, but written as B/Bb by mistake? Like 'B' instead of 'Bb'. If so, then it's a typo. Because "B" is a different note from Bb. So likely the chord was meant to be Bb, and the slash was written as /Bb by mistake, making it Bb/Bb which just means Bb chord. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be Bbm/Bb, but again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a B augmented over Bb, but that's less likely.

But given the rest of the chords fit into Bb minor, maybe B/Bb is a typo and should be something else. For example, in the key of Bb minor, another chord that fits is Abm7 or Ab diminished. Or Ab major? Let's see.

Wait, let's consider the chord sequence again. If we ignore the slash for a moment and look at chord roots and qualities.

The chords listed are: Bbm, Bbm, Gb (major), Gb (major), Bbm, Bbm, Db (major), B (major), Bbm, etc., then Abm6.

If B major is present, it's quite a stretch for Bb minor. But if B/Bb is actually a Bb major chord (if the slash was mistakenly written), then Bb major would be the tonic chord. But Bb major would make the key of Bb major, not minor. Let's check.

In Bb major key: key signature two flats.

Chords: I Bb, II Cm, III Dm, IV Eb, V F, VI Gm, VII Am.

But in this sequence, we have Gb major chord. Gb would not be in Bb major. Bb major scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. So Gb would be a note outside.

But if the key is Gb major? Let's see. Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. Wait, Cb is B natural.

But chord roots present: Bbm (Bb minor), Gb major, Db major, B major? Not fitting.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Db major? Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords in Db major: I Db, II Ebm, III Fm, IV Gb, V Ab, VI Bbm, VII Cdim.

Ah! Let's check. If the sequence is in Db major.

Bbm is the vi chord.

Gb major is IV.

Db major is I.

Ab major would be V.

But in the sequence: we have Bbm, Bbm, Gb (IV), Gb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab (Db major), B/Bb (problematic), Abm6 (but in Db major, Ab is the V chord, so Ab major. But Abm6 would be minor?).

Wait, but Abm6 would be Ab minor with sixth. In Db major, the chords include Ab major (V), but Ab minor would be outside.

Wait, but let's check all chords in Db major:

Chords:

I: Db

II: Ebm

III: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

VI: Bbm

VII: Cdim

So if the chord sequence is: Bbm (vi), Gb (IV), Db (I), etc. So Bbm is vi of Db major. Gb is IV. Db is I. Then what about Db/Ab: Db major with Ab bass (which is fifth in Db major chord), which makes sense as second inversion. Ab would be the fifth.

B/Bb: B major? B is not in Db major; Db major's notes include Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So no B or Bb? Wait, Bb is in Db major scale (Bb is the seventh note). So Bb exists, but B natural doesn't. So if the chord is B/Bb, meaning B major chord over Bb bass, which includes B and D# and F#. None of those are in Db major scale. So again problem.

Another approach: looking at the bass notes. The majority are Bb or Ab.

Bb and Ab are a half-step apart. In Bb minor, the vi chord is Gb, which fits. But the Abm6 could be vii° chord, but with added sixth.

Wait, if the key is Bb minor, Ab is the vii degree. So Ab diminished. If it's Abm6, that might be a chord with minor sixth, which is a bit unusual. But maybe.

But Bm6 would be a minor chord with sixth. In Bb minor, Abm6 would be vii° with added sixth. Alternatively, in some keys, it might be used.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the key is Gb major. Let's see. Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Cb is B natural.

Chords in Gb major:

I: Gb

II: Abm

III: Bbm

IV: Cbm

V: Db

VI: Ebm

VII: Fdim

So Bbm would be III chord.

Gb major as tonic. Then in this context:

Bbm is III

Gb would be I

Db is V

Abm would be II

But in our chord sequence: Bbm, Gb/Bb (which would be Gb major chord, which would fit as I), Db/Ab (Db major, which would be V in Gb major), and Abm6 (Ab minor with sixth, which is II chord in Gb major). So let's see.

Check:

- Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F.

- Chord Bbm: Bb minor is III chord.

- Gb major (I)

- Db major (V)

- Abm is II chord.

So the Abm6 could be Ab minor chord with added sixth. In Ab minor, the sixth would be F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which in Gb major scale, Cb is B, but the scale would have the notes Cb or B? Depending on spelling.

Wait, in Gb major scale, the notes are Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. Cb is technically the B note.

So Abm chord: Ab, Cb, Eb (which would be Ab, B, Eb). Which is valid.

Adding sixth: sixth above Ab is F, which is in Gb major scale. So Abm6 would be Ab, B, Eb, F. Which fits.

Similarly, Db/Ab: Db major chord (Db, F, Ab), which is V chord. And Db/Ab would be the second inversion.

So this seems plausible.

But what about the B/Bb chord? B major over Bb bass. In Gb major, is B part of the scale? No. Because Gb major scale has Cb (B natural), but B major would be B, D#, F#. D# is not in Gb major scale, which has Cb (B), Db, etc. So D# would be Enharmonic to Eb, which is in the scale. But B natural is part of the scale (as Cb). So B natural does exist in Gb major scale as Cb.

But B major chord would be B, D#, F#. But in Gb major, D# would be Eb, but D# is not the same as Eb. However, in practice, it's common to use flats instead of sharps, but if the chord uses D#, which is enharmonic to Eb, but Eb is in the scale. Wait, D# and Eb are different spellings but same pitch? No, wait: D# and Eb are enharmonic equivalents. So in music theory context, they are the same pitch but different spelling. However, chord spelling matters for diatonic considerations.

But if the key is Gb major, the scale has F natural, but does it have D#? No. The scale of Gb major is Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. So notes are all flats or naturals with flats except for the last note F. So Eb is not D#.

But D# is not present. So B major chord (B, D#, F#) would have D# and F#. F# is not in Gb major scale (which has F natural). So no. Thus, B major chord would have F# which is outside the Gb major scale. F in Gb major is natural. So F# would be a sharp, outside the key.

So that's a problem. So B/Bb chord still seems out of place.

Another idea: maybe the B/Bb is actually Bb/Bb, and the user mistyped the 'B' as uppercase instead of 'Bb'. So the chord is Bb major, but written as B/Bb by mistake. If that's the case, then in key of Gb major, Bb would be the III chord. Wait, no: in Gb major, the chords:

I: Gb

II: Abm

III: Bbm

IV: Cbm (but Cb is B, so Cbm would be Cb minor – which is B minor)

V: Db

VI: Ebm

VII: Fdim

So if Bb/Bb is a chord (Bb major), but Bb is not part of the Gb major diatonic chords. The III chord is Bbm (minor), so major Bb would be the bIII chord in Gb major, which is not diatonic. So not sure.

Alternatively, if the key were Bb minor, as earlier:

Bb minor scale has all the chords we mentioned. Let's check Abm6 again. In Bb minor, the vii chord is Ab diminished, so Abm6 would be a different chord, but still possible.

But still, the B/Bb chord is a problem.

Another approach: look at the tonic chord. If we assume that Bbm appears frequently and is the tonic, then maybe Bb minor.

But let's see the chord progression. Common progressions in Bb minor might be i - iv - bVI - bIII etc. But let's see:

Bbm (i), Gb (vi), Db (iii), etc.

In Bb minor, vi is Gb major, iii is Db major. So Bbm (i), Gb (vi), Db (iii), then B/Bb is problematic.

Wait, Db major chord (iii), then Abm6 (vii° or maybe something else). In Bb minor, the vii° is Ab diminished, so Abm6 could be a variation.

Alternatively, if the key is Db major, vi chord Bbm, IV Gb, I Db.

But again B/Bb is problematic.

Wait, another idea. Maybe the slash chords have the bass note indicating a pedal tone. Let's see.

If the bass note is mostly Bb or Ab, maybe it's a pedal point on Bb/Ab.

Bb and Ab are a minor second apart, which is common in some progressions.

But focusing on chord tones:

Let's list all chord tones without bass notes considering.

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db

Db/Ab: Db, F, Ab

B/Bb: B, D#, F# and Bb bass

Abm6: Ab, B, Eb, F

So common tones: F appears in several chords. Bb, Db, Ab.

But B, D#, F# in B/Bb chord would be very foreign.

Unless B/Bb is a typo for Bb/Bb. If so, then Bb major.

But in Bb major, the chords would be I Bb, II Cm, III Dm, IV Eb, V F, VI Gm, VII Am.

But our chords include Gb major (which in Bb major isn't present), Db major (also not diatonic). Db is not in Bb major scale. Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab. So no Db. So Db major would be outside.

Hmm.

Another possible key: is there a key where both Ab and B are present? Like B major? But B major has B, D#, F#, etc. No Ab. So unlikely.

Wait, maybe the key is F minor. Let's see.

F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Chords: i Fm, ii° Gdim, III Ab major, iv Bbm, V Cm, VI Db major, VII Eb dim.

No, but we have Db major chord (VI in F minor), Ab major is III, Bbm is iv. Let's see.

If the chord sequence fits F minor:

- Bbm: iv chord

- Gb/Bb: Gb is not directly in F minor scale. Wait F minor scale notes: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

So no Gb. Gb is enharmonic to F#, which isn't in the scale. So probably not.

Another idea: maybe it's F Dorian or something. But not sure.

Wait, let's consider the Abm6 chord. If Abm6 is Ab minor sixth = Ab, Cb, Eb, F (B, Eb, Ab, F). This chord could also be interpreted as F minor with added sixth? But F minor is F, Ab, C. So Fm6 would be F, Ab, C, D. No, Abm6 as F minor with Ab? Not sure.

Alternatively, Abm6 is same as F minor 7th? No. Fm7 is F, Ab, C, Eb.

But anyway, maybe not helpful.

Let's try to see if there's a common key that includes Bb, Gb, Db, Ab, and maybe B (but that's problematic).

Wait, perhaps the key is Bb minor, but the B/Bb is actually a Bb7 or something. Like Bb7 chord with Bb bass, but written wrong.

Or perhaps "B/Bb" is supposed to be Bb7/Bb? Not sure.

Alternatively, could the "B/Bb" be a miswrite of "Bbm7/Bb" or something else.

Alternatively, let's look at the overall pattern. The chords repeat Bbm several times, and have Gb major, Db major, and then Abm6.

So a possible common progression in Bb minor:

i - vi - iii - iv - etc.

Bbm (i), Gb (vi), Db (iii), then Abm6 could be vii°6 or something.

But Abm6 in Bb minor: Ab minor chord with sixth. But vii° is diminished, so usually Abdim, but Abm6 is more of a chromatic chord.

But maybe it's considered as part of the key.

However, the B/Bb chord is still problematic.

Wait, another idea: in some contexts, especially blues or jazz, a major chord a whole step below the tonic is common. So if tonic is Bb, then the chord B major could be a chord from outside, but it's a common thing in blues. However, B major with Bb bass would be B over Bb, which could be a B chord with a chromatic bass line.

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, let's consider the bass notes. Let's list all bass notes:

As before:

Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb

So mostly Bb, with Ab appearing at some points. So the bass is playing mostly Bb with some Ab, maybe a pedal.

If the bass is staying on Bb and Ab, but the chords above move. If the tonic is Bb minor, then the bass pedal on Bb makes sense. The Ab could be the lowered 7th of Bb minor.

But the Abm6 chord has Ab as root. So if the bass note Ab is played for the Abm6 chord, then Ab is the bass note.

Now, considering the chord symbols given, let's assume that when it says Abm6, the root is Ab.

So chord tones:

- Bbm: root Bb, minor

- Gb/Bb: root Gb, major

- Db/Ab: root Db, major

- B/Bb: root B, major

- Abm6: root Ab, minor sixth

So chord roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, Ab.

These roots are spaced: Bb (which is same as A#), Ab is G#, B is B. So intervals between them: from Bb to Ab is minor second? Not sure. It's a bit random.

But in terms of key, looking at the root notes: Bb, Ab, Gb, Db, B.

That seems like a pattern descending by whole step: Bb to Ab (b9?), no: Bb, Ab is descending minor second.

Not sure. Alternatively, Bb, Ab, Gb, Db... all descending whole steps? Bb to Ab is a minor second, Ab to Gb is minor second. No, all flats decreasing: Bb, then Ab, Gb, Db – that's each flat one tone down?

Wait Bb to Ab is a step down (Bb to Ab is minor second, but a whole step down would be A to Ab, no). Actually, descending by half steps: Bb, Ab, Gb, Db, Cb (B), which is not quite.

Another approach: look at all notes used in the chords. Ignore the bass, look at chord tones.

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

Db major: Db, F, Ab

B major: B, D#, F#

Abm6: Ab, B, Eb, F

So all notes used:

Bb, Db, F, Gb, Ab, B, D#, Eb.

Wait, that's a lot of different notes. Let's list them:

Bb, Db, F, Gb, Ab, B, D#, Eb.

D# is the same as Eb; B and Cb are same. But in terms of pitch classes:

B, Cb (B), D#, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

So if D# = Eb, then Eb is present. So notes:

B, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb (D#), F, Gb, Ab.

Wait, but B and Bb are separate. Cb is B. So effectively, the pitches are:

B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So seven pitches. That's all the notes in a major scale? No, seven notes. That sounds like diatonic. Let's see if they fit.

But B major scale is B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. Not matching.

Alternatively, Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Yes! Wait Db major scale is Db (1), Eb (2), F (3), Gb (4), Ab (5), Bb (6), C (7).

But in our chord notes, we have B and Eb, F, Db, Gb, Ab, Bb.

But Db major scale has C as seventh, not B natural. But C and B are different, unless Cb. So Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Our note list has B natural, which isn't in Db major. Unless B natural is the Cb.

No, it's messy. However, B natural and Cb is same pitch. But Db major doesn't have B, it has C.

So if we replace C with B (as Cb), it's different.

Another possibility: Cb major? But Cb major is enharmonic to B major, which is highly theoretical and unusual.

Alternatively, is there a key where all these notes fit? Let's see.

The notes present: B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Let's list them alphabetically: B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. That seems to be a set of notes. But B and Bb are a half step apart, which would mean it's chromatic.

Alternatively, if we ignore the B and Bb, it sounds like Db major scale except missing C. But Db major has C. Or maybe F minor.

F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

But we also have Gb and B in there. Gb is not in F minor. F minor includes G natural.

Not matching.

Wait another idea: could this be Phrygian mode?

In Phrygian, the second note is lowered.

But perhaps Bb Phrygian: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Wait, Bb Phrygian mode would be Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Which is exactly the natural minor of Bb, which is the same as Aeolian. Wait, yes: natural minor is the Aeolian mode, which is flat 3rd, 6th, 7th. So it's the same as natural minor.

So Bb Aeolian / natural minor: Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

But in this scale, we have B (as Cb), so B and natural B is same as Cb.

Wait, in Bb natural minor, the scale is Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So the notes: Bb, B (Cb), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So all seven notes. So in this scale, the note that's often written as Cb is B natural.

So Cb = B natural.

And Db is same as C#.

So the scale notes are Bb, B, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Exactly matching what we have: B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Yes! Because Cb is B natural. So all those notes are diatonic to Bb natural minor.

So if we consider this key: Bb minor (Aeolian), then all the chord notes fit.

But then what about B/Bb chord. B major chord is B, D#, F#. But in Bb minor scale:

Our scale has: B natural (as Cb), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

So D# would be Eb. So in scale, Eb is present.

So B major chord: B, D#, F#. But D# is enharmonic to Eb, which is in scale. And F# would not be in scale; scale has F natural.

Ah, right. F# is not in Bb natural minor scale. So F# would be outside. So if the B major chord contains F#, which is not in the scale, it's a chromatic chord.

But perhaps the B in the chord is a natural B, which is in the scale as Cb. But the issue is the F#.

So B major chord would require F#, which isn't in the scale. But if the F is used instead of F#, which would make it a B minor chord. But the user wrote B/Bb.

Alternatively, if the chord is not B major but Bb major. Then it fits. Or perhaps the chord is B diminished or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe B/Bb is a typo for Bbm/Bb, which is just Bbm. Because 'B' and 'Bb' might have been confused. If the user had a Bbm chord written as B/Bb due to typo.

If that's the case, then all chords fit Bb minor:

- Bbm

- Gb/Bb (Gb major chord, sixth degree in Bb minor)

- Db/Ab (Db major chord, iii degree)

- B/Bb → Bbm (i)

- Abm6 (Ab minor chord with sixth; vii° becomes Abm?)

Wait, in Bb minor natural: vii° is Ab diminished (Ab, Cb, Eb). But Abm6 would be Ab minor with added sixth (F). So Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which would be diatonic in Bb natural minor scale? Let's check.

Scale notes: Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So Ab minor chord (Ab, Cb, Eb), and the sixth would be F. F is in scale. So yes, Abm6 can be considered diatonic as Ab minor chord plus F added. But usually, the minor sixth chord might be a variant of minor seventh chord (Abm7 would have Gb), but Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which is valid.

Similarly, Db major chord (iii) in Bb minor.

So if we assume that the "B/Bb" chord is actually "Bbm/Bb" due to typo, then everything fits into Bb natural minor.

Alternatively, maybe the "B/Bb" is supposed to be "Ab/Bb" or something else. But assuming typo on 'B' for 'Bb'.

Another possibility: the slash chord "B/Bb" might mean a chord with B as the top note over Bb bass, but in the context of the key, but it's unclear.

But given the repetition of Bbm and the other chords fitting into Bb minor with the exception of B/Bb, it's highly likely that's a typo.

Another angle: Abm6 chord. If it's Ab minor sixth, which is same as Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) but no. Wait Abm6: Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Whereas Fm7 is F, Ab, C, Eb. So actually, Abm6 shares notes with Fm7, but different voicings. But in Bb minor context, it still fits.

So, all chords except possibly the B/Bb fit into Bb minor (natural minor). Therefore, likely the key is Bb minor, and the B/Bb is a typo.

But what's another way to look at it. If the chord "B/Bb" is actually "Bb/Bb", which is just root position Bb minor. But written as /Bb meaning bass is Bb. But Bbm chord with bass Bb is standard.

But regardless, the key is probably Bb minor.

But let's check again.

If we consider the key of Eb minor, but that seems less likely.

Another check: common chord progressions.

In Bb minor, a common progression might be i - iv - v - iv or something. But in this sequence: i, i, vi, vi, i, i, iii, iv? But the Db/Ab is Db major which is iii. Then B/Bb (problem), then later Abm6. In Bb minor, Abm6 could be related to the vii chord.

Alternatively, another mode. Let's see, if it's Dorian mode.

Bb Dorian would be Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. But we don't have G natural; we have Gb. So no.

Phrygian: Bb Phrygian is Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Which is same as Aeolian, which is Bb minor. Yes. Because Phrygian has b2, but in Bb Phrygian: root Bb, b2 Cb (B), b3 Db, 4 Eb, 5 F, b6 Gb, b7 Ab. Yes! So Bb Phrygian is actually the same as Bb natural minor (Aeolian), because Aeolian is natural minor, and Phrygian has b2. Wait no! Wait, no. Hold on.

Wait, the modes:

Ionian: same as major.

Dorian: minor with natural 6.

Phrygian: minor with b2.

Lydian: major with #4.

Mixolydian: major with b7.

Aeolian: natural minor.

Locrian: diminished.

So Bb Aeolian (natural minor) is: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Bb Phrygian would be Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab – same as Aeolian? No, wait no.

Wait, the Phrygian mode starts on the third degree of the major scale. Wait, better to build Phrygian by taking the scale and lowering the 2nd degree.

For example, Bb Phrygian would be: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Wait, but the Phrygian mode has b2, b3, etc. Wait, no.

Let's take a major scale and create the modes:

If we take Db major scale (four flats):

Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

The modes:

1. Db Ionian (major)

2. Eb Dorian

3. F Phrygian (because starting on third degree of Db major)

F Phrygian: F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Which is F, b2 Gb, b3 Ab, etc.

But if we take Bb Phrygian, it would be the Phrygian mode of Eb major.

But regardless, the point is that Bb natural minor is Aeolian mode of Db major.

So the scale notes are the same as Db major's notes starting on Bb.

But for the purpose of key signature, it's Bb minor (Bb Aeolian).

Now, back to the chords. Assuming all chords fit Bb minor except for the B/Bb chord.

But if we assume that "B/Bb" is a typo for "Bbm/Bb", then all chords fit. Or perhaps it's "Bb/Bb" which is same.

Alternatively, perhaps "B/Bb" is actually "Bb7", but written weirdly.

But given the context, I think it's most likely Bb minor key.

Another check: the presence of Bm6. Abm6 chord as vii minor sixth. But in Bb minor, vii chord is diminished, but adding sixth could be a substitute.

Alternatively, if the mode is different. Wait, but all diatonic chords fit.

Wait, Db major chord (iii) in Bb minor.

Gb major is vi.

So a progression like Bbm -> Gb -> Db -> ... etc.

Yes, that's plausible.

So the key is Bb minor (Aeolian mode). But Aeolian is just the natural minor scale, so the mode is minor.

But the question asks for key and mode. So key is Bb minor, mode would be Aeolian (natural minor).

Alternatively, if the progression uses chords common for harmonic minor, but with a raised seventh, but I don't see evidence of that here.

Wait, in harmonic minor of Bb, we'd have Ab raised to A natural. Then v chord would be Ab major. But we don't have Ab major chord here; Abm6 suggests minor.

So probably natural minor.

Regarding the B/Bb chord: if it's supposed to be something else, but if we take it as Bm over Bb bass or something else.

But given all other chords fit Bb minor, that seems the answer.

Another test: look at the bass notes sequence: Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, etc.

So the bass is moving down from Bb to Ab. In Bb minor, Ab is the minor seventh tone. So descending minor second from tonic to b7. Common in some progressions.

And then chords changing above.

So yes, Bb minor key, Aeolian mode (natural minor).

Now, what about the B/Bb chord? If that's a typo for Ab/Bb or something else. Or perhaps it's a Bb minor chord with bass Bb, which is standard. If the chord was written as B/Bb instead of Bbm/Bb due to missing 'm', then it makes sense.

Alternatively, "B/Bb" could be Bb major, but no, Bb major would be written as Bb. B/Bb is strange.

So conclusion: key is Bb minor, mode Aeolian (or simply minor).

But to confirm, let's see if there are other hints.

The chord Abm6: Ab minor sixth. In Bb minor, this chord's notes (Ab, Cb, Eb, F) all belong to the scale. Cb is B, which is part of the scale. F is also in scale.

So yes.

Gb major chord: Gb, Bb, Db. All in scale.

Db major: Db, F, Ab. Yes.

Bbm: yes.

So all chords fit except possibly the B/Bb. Assuming typo.

Therefore, I think the key is B flat minor (Bb minor) in natural minor mode (Aeolian).


The chord sequence provided is:  
**Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm**

---

### ✅ Step 1: Analyze the Chord Structure
Let’s examine the **chord roots** and **qualifications** (ignoring bass notes for now):

- **Bbm** (B♭ minor): B♭, D♭, F  
- **Gb/Bb** (Gb major in first inversion): G♭, B♭, D♭  
- **Db/Ab** (Db major in second inversion): D♭, F, A♭  
- **B/Bb** (problematic—B major over B♭ bass: B, D♯, F♯ with B♭ bass)  
- **Abm6** (A♭ minor sixth): A♭, C♭ (B), E♭, F  

All of these chords (with the exception of **B/Bb**) clearly fit within the **B♭ natural minor (Aeolian) scale**, whose notes are:  
**B♭, C♭ (B), D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭**

---

### ✅ Step 2: Confirm Scale Fit (excluding B/Bb)
- **Bbm**: Tonic (i)  
- **Gb major**: vi chord (G♭, B♭, D♭)  
- **Db major**: iii chord (D♭, F, A♭)  
- **Abm6**: vii° with added 6th (A♭, B, E♭, F) — all within the scale  

All these chords are **diatonic** to **B♭ natural minor (Aeolian)**.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Address the Problematic **B/Bb**
The **B/Bb** chord is the only exception. A **B major chord (B, D♯, F♯)** with **B♭ as bass** introduces **D♯ and F♯**, which **do not belong** to the B♭ minor scale. This is highly irregular.

However, this is almost certainly a **typo**. Here's why:
- In most sheet music or chord notation, **B/Bb** is not standard.
- Common confusion: **Bm** (B minor) might have been mistyped as **B/Bb** due to missing **"m"** or incorrect slash formatting.
- If **B/Bb** were actually **Bbm/Bb**, it would be a standard **B♭ minor chord with B♭ in the bass**, which fits perfectly within the key.

This is a **very common notation error** in handwritten or typed chord charts.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Determine Key and Mode
Given:
- All chords (excluding **B/Bb**) are **diatonic to B♭ minor**
- The tonal center (B♭) is consistently used as the root or bass note
- The progression follows a typical **Aeolian (natural minor)** pattern
- The only non-diatonic element is likely a **typo**

➡️ **Key**: **B♭ minor**  
➡️ **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**

---

### 📌 Final Answer:
**Key: B♭ minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  

> *Note: The chord "B/Bb" is almost certainly a typo and likely should be "Bbm" or "Bbm/Bb". Otherwise, it introduces non-diatonic notes that break the key context.*

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

> Bbm — Bbm — Gb/Bb — Gb/Bb — Bbm — Bbm — Db/Ab — B/Bb — Bbm — Bbm — Gb/Bb — Gb/Bb — Bbm — Bbm — Abm6 — Bbm

---

### Step 1: List unique chords and their roots

- **Bbm** (B♭ minor) — appears many times
- **Gb/Bb** — Gb major chord with Bb in bass (so Gb major in first inversion)
- **Db/Ab** — Db major with Ab in bass (Db major in first inversion)
- **B/Bb** — B major with Bb in bass — this is very unusual!

And finally:

- **Abm6** — A-flat minor 6 chord

---

### Step 2: Analyze tonal center

The progression **starts and ends on Bbm**, and **Bbm appears 8 times**, almost always as the home chord. That strongly suggests **B♭ minor** is the tonal center.

But let’s check if this is Ionian (major) or Aeolian (minor) mode — clearly, it’s **minor**, given the prevalence of Bbm.

So tentative key: **B♭ minor**

---

### Step 3: Check chords for compatibility with B♭ minor

B♭ natural minor scale (Aeolian):  
**B♭ - C - D♭ - E♭ - F - G♭ - A♭**

Chords built on this scale (diatonic):

- i: B♭m
- ii°: C°
- III: D♭
- iv: E♭m
- v: Fm
- VI: G♭
- VII: A♭

Now compare with your chords:

- **Bbm** → i ✅  
- **Gb** → VI ✅ (Gb is major in natural minor)  
- **Db** → III ✅ (D♭ major — common in minor keys, as borrowed or from harmonic context)  
- **Abm6** → This is A♭ minor 6. In B♭ minor, VII chord is A♭ major (not minor). So **Abm6** is **not diatonic**.

Wait — **Abm6** is A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F

In B♭ minor, A♭ should be **A♭-C-E♭** (major triad).  
Here we have **A♭m6**: A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F → so it's A♭ minor with added 6th (F)

But C♭ is **B natural** enharmonically — this is **not** part of the B♭ natural minor scale.

Let’s reconsider.

---

### Step 4: The odd one out — **B/Bb**

This is **B major chord with B♭ in the bass**.

B major = B - D# - F#

B♭ in bass = B/B♭ = first inversion of B major? No — that doesn’t make sense because root is B, B♭ is not in the chord.

This is a **non-diatonic, chromatic chord**. It’s a **B major triad over B♭ bass** — which creates a very dissonant clash: B, D#, F# over B♭ — so intervals include B♭-B (minor 9th), B♭-D# (augmented 4th), B♭-F# (augmented 5th). This is very harsh.

In jazz/pop contexts, this often functions as a **chromatic bass motion** — perhaps leading to Bbm.

So: **B/Bb → Bbm**  
B♭ → B → B♭? That seems odd... unless it's **B/Bb → Cb** (which is Bm), but no — then it goes to **Bbm**.

Wait — B/Bb → Bbm? That’s a **half-step bass descent**: B♭ → B → B♭? That doesn’t make sense.

Actually, looking at the sequence:

> ... Db/Ab — **B/Bb** — Bbm ...

So: Db/Ab → B/Bb → Bbm

Bass notes: Ab → B♭ → B♭? Wait, no:

- Db/Ab → bass is Ab
- B/Bb → bass is B♭
- Bbm → bass is B♭

So: **Ab → B♭ → B♭**

That’s a **minor 3rd upward bass motion**: Ab to B♭ (up 3 semitones)

Then staying on B♭.

This suggests a possible **chromatic passing motion** in the bass: Ab → A → B♭? But here we have Ab → B♭. No A in between.

Alternatively, **B/Bb** may be a **borrowed chord** from another mode or key.

---

### Step 5: Consider **Abm6** — what key?

Abm6 = A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F  
C♭ is B natural, so this chord is:

A♭ - B - E♭ - F

That’s the same as **G#m6**: G# - B - D# - F#

But we're in B♭ land, so we’ll write as A♭m6.

A♭ minor 6 is **not** in B♭ minor. But let’s see if it fits another key.

What if the key is **G minor**?

G natural minor: G A B♭ C D E♭ F

Chords: Gm, A°, B♭, Cm, Dm, E♭, F

No A♭m6 here.

What if it’s **C minor**?

C natural minor: C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭

Now we see: **A♭** is the VI chord in C minor — and **A♭m6** would be a minor VI with added 6th (F). In C minor, VI chord is A♭ major. But here we have **A♭m6** — which suggests **borrowing from parallel major or another mode**? Not standard.

Wait — perhaps B♭ **harmonic minor**?

B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ **A**

Now we have **A natural**! So now:

- Chord VII = A major (A C# E)

But our chord is **Abm6** — A♭ minor — that’s not A.

Still not matching.

Try **B♭ melodic minor ascending**: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G A

Now, chords:

- i: B♭m
- ii: C°
- III+: D♭ (major)
- IV: E♭
- V: F
- VI: G
- VII: A diminished

Still no A♭m6.

What chord is Abm6?

Abm6 = Ab - Cb - Eb - F  
Cb = B

So: Ab - B - Eb - F → **Abm6** = **G#m6** enharmonically

G#m6 = G# B D# F# — nothing to do with B♭.

So maybe it’s a **modal mixture** or **extended non-diatonic chord**.

But the most plausible interpretation is that **Bbm is the tonic**, and the other chords are borrowed or chromatic.

Let’s look at the character.

---

### Step 6: **B/Bb** as a tritone substitution?

B/Bb is a B major chord with B♭ bass — that’s **B major over B♭ bass**.

This **could** be interpreted as a **slash chord implying a tritone substitution** — B major is the tritone substitution for E major — but in B♭ minor? Doesn’t fit.

Alternatively, it’s a **chromatic passing chord**, used to create motion from Db/Ab (which has Ab bass) → B/Bb (B♭ bass) → Bbm (B♭ bass). So bass moves:

**Ab → B♭ → B♭**

That’s a minor 3rd leap up — not smooth.

Wait — maybe a **typo**? Could it be **Bb/Bb** instead of **B/Bb**? That would make more sense: **Bb/Bb = Bb major**, which would be **major tonic** — creating a **modal interchange** from minor to major.

But it says **B/Bb** — so root is B, not Bb.

In pop/rock/jazz, **B/Bb** is sometimes used in **B minor** context to create a chromatic bass line.

But we’re in B♭ minor.

Unless... the key is **A minor**?

Try: **A minor**

Diagonal chords in A minor:

- i: Am
- ii°: B°
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

Our chords: Bbm, Gb, Db, Abm6 — all flat notes. Unlikely for A minor.

---

### Step 7: Consider **Eb major**?

Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D

Chords: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bbm, Cm, D°

Bbm = v? — yes.

Db = IV? Db is **not in Eb major** — Db is flattened IV, which could be borrowed.

Gb? That would be #V — not in key.

Nope.

---

### Step 8: Reconsider the chord **B/Bb**

B/Bb — Bass: B♭  
Chord: B major

This creates the tritone: **B and B♭ — minor 9th**, but also: in context, this might be the **leading tone chord** — **B natural is the leading tone to C**, but we’re going to Bbm.

B natural → B♭ minor? That’s strengthening the minor third.

In **B♭ minor harmonic**, the leading tone is **A natural** — not B.

Wait — **B natural** in B♭ minor is the **#2** (upper auxiliary tone).

This chord could be a **secondary dominant** or **chromatic mediant**.

Try interpreting **B/Bb** as **secondary dominant to Cm**? But next chord is Bbm.

Alternatively, it’s **not functional** — just color.

---

### Step 9: Look at **Abm6**

A♭m6 = A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F

C♭ is B — so: **A♭ - B - E♭ - F**

This is essentially **G#m6** = G# - B - D# - F#

Now, G#m6 is the **i chord** in **G# minor**

G# minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#

But we’re in B♭ world — B♭ and A# are enharmonic.

So perhaps **A♭m6** is meant to be **G#m6**, implying **G# minor key**?

But the entire progression is anchored in B♭m — that would mean **key change** mid-progression? Unlikely.

Alternatively, **A♭m6** = **bVI chord in C minor**? Cm → A♭m6? Not standard.

Wait — **Abm6** could be a **borrowed chord from B♭ Dorian or Phrygian**?

B♭ Dorian: B♭ C D E♭ F G A → VI = F major

Not Ab.

B♭ Phrygian: B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭

Now we have **A♭** — which is VII — but **A♭ major**, not minor.

To get **A♭m**, we’d need C♭ (B), E♭, A♭ — so C♭ is **B**, which is not in Phrygian. Phrygian would have C♭ (D♭? No)

Wait — B♭ Phrygian:  
B♭ (root), C♭ (♭2), D♭ (♭3), E♭ (4), F (5), G♭ (♭6), A♭ (♭7)

Now, the **vii chord** = A♭ major (A♭ - C - E♭)

But Abm6 is A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F

C♭ is not in the scale (C♭ is ♭3, which is D♭). C♭ is actually **B natural** — so **C♭ ≠ D♭**.

So **C♭ is not in B♭ Phrygian** — it’s introducing the **major 6th** (F) and **♭3 but flat even more?**

It’s too chromatic.

---

### Best Interpretation:

Despite the chromatic intrusions (**B/Bb** and **Abm6**), the overwhelming tonal center is **B♭ minor**, with **Bbm** appearing as the tonic chord throughout, especially beginning and end.

The **Gb** chord is the **♭VI** in B♭ minor — common in pop/rock/metal (e.g., "More Than a Woman" by Bee Gees).

The **Db** chord is the **♭III** — also common (e.g., in minor keys, borrowed from parallel major or as a substitute).

The **B/Bb** is a **chromatic bass approach** to the tonic — perhaps mimicking a **lower neighboring tone**: **Ab → B♭ → B♭**, where B/Bb singers a non-harmonic chord — intended for bass motion, not functional harmony.

The **Abm6** is the most puzzling, but it might be miswritten or:

- Could be **A♭ major 6**? (A♭ - C - E♭ - F) — that would be the **♭VI in B♭ minor** — but that’s Gb major in our chords!

Wait a minute — we have **Gb** already as ♭VI — so Abm6 is perhaps a **mistake**? Could it be **Ab** (major)? Then it’s ♭VII — which is common as a dominant substitute.

But the user wrote **Abm6**.

Perhaps it’s a **modal interchange from B♭ Dorian minor**? But still...

### Final Answer:

Despite unusual chromatic chords (**B/Bb**, **Abm6**), the **tonic chord is Bbm**, appearing frequently and framing the progression.

The harmonic language is **minor**, with borrowed chords and chromatic bass lines.

→ **Key: B♭ minor (or B♭ Aeolian)**  
→ **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)** — with chromatic inflections (borrowed chords, chromatic bass)

**B/Bb** may be a passing chord (B major = #2) for ornamentation  
**Abm6** may be a modal or textural choice — perhaps inspired by jazz minor harmony.

So:

> ✅ **Key: B♭ minor**  
> ✅ **Mode: Aeolian** (natural minor) — with chromatic alterations

This is **B♭ minor with chromatic passing and color chords** — common in modern pop, rock, and R&B (e.g., Adele, Sam Smith, late 90s R&B).

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

Let’s analyze the chord progression you provided:

**Chord Sequence:**
Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Db/Ab – B/Bb –  
Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Abm6 – Bbm

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center
The progression keeps returning to **Bbm**, suggesting **B♭ minor** as the tonal center.

---

### Step 2: List all chords involved (simplify inversions)
- **Bbm** → B♭ minor (i in B♭ minor)
- **Gb/Bb** → G♭ major with B♭ in the bass → same as **Gb major** (VI in B♭ minor)
- **Db/Ab** → D♭ major with A♭ in the bass → **Db major** (III in B♭ minor)
- **B/Bb** → B major with B♭ in the bass → this is **enharmonic to C♭ major**, but more likely a **chromatic mediant or altered chord**. B major is **not diatonic** to B♭ minor. However, **B major = V of VI** (V/VI), since G♭ is VI, and the V of G♭ is D♭... wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, **B major = augmented sixth chord?** Let's hold that thought.
- **Abm6** → A♭ minor with added 6th (F). In B♭ minor, A♭ is **VII**, so Abm is **♭VII**, and Abm6 adds a 6th (F). This is a common modal mixture or borrowed chord.

But let's double-check **B/Bb**. B major spelled out: B–D♯–F♯. With B♭ in the bass, that creates a highly dissonant cluster (B and B♭ together). This may be a **tritone substitution** or **chromatic passing chord**.

Alternatively, is it possible that **B/Bb** is a typo or misnotation? Because **B major over B♭ bass** is extremely unusual. Perhaps it’s meant to be **B diminished** or **B°**, or even **B♭7**? But assuming notation is intentional...

Another interpretation: **B/Bb** might actually be **B7♯9 or altered dominant**, but again, that’s speculative.

However, note that **B = C♭**, and **C♭ major = enharmonic to B major**, and **C♭ is the ♭II** in B♭ minor. ♭II is a Neapolitan chord! But Neapolitan in minor is usually **major triad on ♭II**, which in B♭ minor would be **C♭ major** (C♭–E♭–G♭) = **B major** (enharmonically). So **B major = ♭II (Neapolitan)** in B♭ minor!

Yes! So:

- **B major = ♭II (N)** in B♭ minor → used in first inversion often (N6), but here it’s over B♭ (the tonic), which is unusual but possible as a color chord or passing voicing.

So we can reinterpret **B/Bb** as the **Neapolitan chord (♭II)** with a tonic pedal in the bass.

---

### Step 3: Map chords to B♭ natural minor (Aeolian)
B♭ natural minor scale: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭

Diatonic chords:
- i: Bbm
- ♭III: D♭ major → present as **Db/Ab**
- iv: E♭m (not present)
- v: Fm (not present)
- ♭VI: G♭ major → present as **Gb/Bb**
- ♭VII: A♭ major → but we have **Abm6**, which is **A♭ minor**, not major.

Wait: **Abm6** = A♭–C♭–E♭–F  
→ This is **A♭ minor (♭VII minor)**, which is **not diatonic** to B♭ natural minor (where ♭VII is A♭ **major**).

But **A♭ minor** is the **iv chord in E♭ minor**, or it could be a **modal mixture** from B♭ Phrygian or other modes.

Alternatively, **Abm6** may function as a **iiø7** of G♭ (VI), but not quite.

However, **Abm6** contains **C♭ (enharmonic to B)** and **F**, which both appear in the B major chord as well—possible voice-leading connection.

---

### Step 4: Consider mode
The consistent use of:
- i (Bbm)
- ♭VI (Gb)
- ♭III (Db)
- ♭II (B = C♭)

...is characteristic of **minor key (tonic Bbm)** with **modal mixture** and **chromaticism**, common in jazz, film music, or Romantic harmony.

The presence of **♭VI (Gb)** and **♭III (Db)** supports **B♭ natural minor (Aeolian)** as the base.

However, the **Neapolitan (♭II)** and **Abm6 (♭VII minor)** suggest **borrowing from other modes or chromatic mediant usage**, but **not necessarily a shift in mode**.

Also note: no leading tone (A♮) is used—no dominant (F or F7) appears, which suggests **modal minor** (Aeolian) rather than harmonic or melodic minor.

So: **Key = B♭ minor**, **Mode = Aeolian (natural minor)** with chromatic alterations (Neapolitan, modal mixture).

---

### Final Answer:
- **Key:** B♭ minor  
- **Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor), with chromatic chords (Neapolitan ♭II, modal mixture such as Abm6)

The absence of a dominant (V) chord and use of ♭VI, ♭III, and ♭II are hallmarks of modal minor (Aeolian) harmony with chromatic color.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing the Harmony**

I'm currently breaking down the chord progression. The use of slash chords adds some interesting color, especially the $\text{Gb}/\text{Bb}$ and $\text{Db}/\text{Ab}$. Considering the key of B flat minor, I'm trying to see how these chords function within that context, and how their voice leading could influence the overall feeling.


**Exploring Chord Functions**

I've been examining the harmonic functions, and the $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ chord is particularly intriguing. Thinking about it, the major chord over a $\text{Bb}$ bassline doesn't quite fit the typical minor key mold, but its dominant qualities are evident. I suspect it's there to pull us back to the tonic. I'm now looking at potential resolutions.


**Pinpointing the Tonic**

I'm now completely certain that the tonic is B-flat minor. The progression keeps coming back to $\text{Bbm}$, and even the unusual chord choices seem to resolve toward that tonal center. I am now refining my analysis of the $\text{Abm6}$ chord, and its role as a pre-dominant.


**Identifying Cadences**

I'm now focusing on cadence points, and the move from $\text{Abm6}$ to $\text{Bbm}$ is particularly telling. This is a very interesting cadence and the $\text{bVII}$ - $\text{i}$ cadence is unexpected. The finality of the $\text{Bbm}$ at the end of the progression is now completely confirmed, and I will be looking closely at the effect of the slash chords.


**Deconstructing Chromaticism**

I'm now fully immersed in the analysis, and the $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ chord is proving particularly thorny. Considering the preceding $\text{Db}/\text{Ab}$ chord, and the subsequent resolution to $\text{Bbm}$, I'm seeing this as potentially a chromatic passing chord. I will be looking at this in the context of voice leading.


**Deciphering Chromaticism**

I'm now fully analyzing the chromatic movement, particularly the $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ chord and its function. Given the $bIII$ to $I$ context, it's clear this is a color chord, and the use of the slash chords adds a nice flavor to the B-flat minor progression. I'm focusing on how this works rhythmically.


**Considering the Context**

I'm now considering the context of the piece, given the B-flat minor key. The $\text{Gb}/\text{Bb}$ and $\text{Db}/\text{Ab}$ chords are clearly providing color. The presence of the $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ chord is still puzzling, and I'm analyzing it as a chromatic passing chord. The $\text{Abm6}$ provides a strong pull.


**Synthesizing Findings**

I'm now fully confident about my analysis. The $\text{Bb}$ minor key is confirmed, and the use of the natural minor mode is clear. The chromatic passing chord, $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$, adds color to the overall harmonic landscape, with the overall flavor revolving around a minor key cadence.




The provided chord progression strongly establishes **B-flat Minor** as the tonic key center.

Here is the analysis of the chords relative to $\text{Bbm}$:

| Chord | Function in $\text{Bbm}$ | Notes | Scale Degrees in $\text{Bb}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\text{Bbm}$ | **I** (Tonic) | $\text{Bb}$, $\text{Db}$, $\text{F}$ | 1, $b3$, 5 |
| $\text{Gb}/\text{Bb}$ | **bVI** (Submediant) | $\text{Gb}$, $\text{Bb}$, $\text{Db}$ | $b6$, 1, $b3$ |
| $\text{Db}/\text{Ab}$ | **bIII** (Mediant) | $\text{Db}$, $\text{F}$, $\text{Ab}$ | $b3$, 5, $b7$ |
| $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ | Highly chromatic passing chord (bII/pedal) | $\text{B}$, $\text{D}\sharp$, $\text{F}\sharp$ over $\text{Bb}$ | - |
| $\text{Abm6}$ | **bVIIm6** (Subtonic minor 6) | $\text{Ab}$, $\text{B}$($\text{Cb}$), $\text{Eb}$, $\text{F}$ | $b7$, $b2$/$\sharp 1$, 4, 5 |

### Determining the Mode

The mode is determined by the characteristic degrees used in the harmony, namely the 6th and 7th degrees.

1.  **Sixth Degree:** The use of the $\text{Gb}$ Major chord ($\text{bVI}$) establishes the **lowered 6th degree** ($\text{Gb}$).
2.  **Seventh Degree:** The use of $\text{Db}$ ($\text{bIII}$) and the $\text{Abm6}$ chord implies the existence of the **lowered 7th degree** ($\text{Ab}$). The $\text{Abm6}$ uses $\text{Ab}$ as its root. (Note: $\text{Ab}$ major ($\text{bVII}$) is the typical chord built on this degree, but $\text{Abm}$ works similarly by confirming the $b7$).

When a minor key uses both the natural (lowered) sixth ($\text{b6}$) and natural (lowered) seventh ($\text{b7}$) degrees, the mode is the **Natural Minor** (or Aeolian mode).

| Scale Degree | Note in $\text{Bb}$ Minor | Mode Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $\text{Bb}$ | Minor Tonic |
| $b3$ | $\text{Db}$ | Minor Tonic |
| $b6$ | $\text{Gb}$ | Natural Minor / Aeolian |
| $b7$ | $\text{Ab}$ | Natural Minor / Aeolian |

The chromatic chords ($\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ and the specific voicing of $\text{Abm6}$) function as color chords or passing movements, but they do not disrupt the fundamental minor mode established by the I, bIII, and bVI chords.

***

## Conclusion

*   **Key:** **B-flat Minor** ($\text{Bbm}$)
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian** (Natural Minor)

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

Based on the chords provided, here is the analysis to determine the key and mode:

**Chords:** Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, B/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6, Bbm

**1. Identify the Tonic and Chord Tonalities:**

* **Tonic/Home Chord:** The music consistently starts and ends on **Bbm** (B-flat minor). This strongly suggests the key is centred around B-flat minor.
* **Basic Chords Used:**
    * **Bbm** (i - B-flat minor)
    * **Gb** (VI - G-flat major, implied by Gb/Bb)
    * **Db** (v - D-flat major, implied by Db/Ab)
    * **B** (A very unusual chord for the key of B-flat minor)
    * **Abm6** (Ab minor triad with an added F note)

**2. Analyze Chord Functions in B-flat Minor:**

The most likely key is **B-flat minor (Bbm)**. Let's analyze the chords based on the B-flat minor scale:

| Chord | Function in B-flat Minor | Notes in Chord | B-flat Natural Minor Scale Notes (Aeolian) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Bbm** | **i** (Tonic) | Bb, Db, F | Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab |
| **Gb** | **VI** (Submediant) | Gb, Bb, Db | Matches |
| **Db** | **III** (Mediant) | Db, F, Ab | Matches (often used as III in minor) |
| **Abm6** | **vii $\flat$** | Ab, Cb (B), Eb, F | This chord is borrowed. If we consider Abm (vii $\flat$), and add the F. |

**3. Address the Difficult Chord (B major) and Borrowed Chords:**

* **The B Chord:** A B major chord (B, D#, F#) is highly chromatic in the key of B-flat minor (Bb, Db, F, Gb, Ab). This chord suggests a brief moment of modal mixture or a secondary function that is highly altered. Its presence indicates that the mode is not strictly the Aeolian scale.
* **Gb/Bb and Db/Ab:** The inversions (especially Gb/Bb) emphasize the bass line movement while maintaining the strong anchor of the tonic note (Bb).

**4. Determine the Mode:**

Since the piece is centred around B-flat minor, we need to compare the overall harmonic content against the different minor modes:

* **B-flat Natural Minor (Aeolian):** Uses Gb and Ab. **Gb** (VI) and **Db** (III) fit perfectly.
* **B-flat Harmonic Minor:** Uses Gb and **A natural** (leading tone). This mode is often used to create the dominant chord (V - F major). The lack of a major dominant chord (F major or F7) strongly argues against Harmonic minor. The usage of **Db** (III) instead of the expected predominant chord (iv - Eb minor) is also less common in classical harmonic minor.
* **B-flat Melodic Minor (Ascending):** Uses G natural and A natural. Does not fit the **Gb** major (VI) chord.

**Conclusion on Mode:**

The primary use of the **Bbm (i)**, **Gb (VI)**, and **Db (III)** chords, combined with the absence of a raised leading tone or a major dominant (V), points strongly toward the **Aeolian mode (Natural Minor Scale)**.

The unusual **B major** chord is likely a brief chromatic embellishment or modulation that does not define the overall modal character.

---

### Final Determination:

* **Key:** **B-flat Minor** (Bbm)
* **Mode:** **Aeolian** (or Natural Minor)

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Db/Ab – B/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Abm6 – Bbm**

---

### Step 1: Identify the roots and their relationships
All chords are rooted in flats (Bb, Gb, Db, Ab), so we’re likely in a **flat key**.

Let’s list the root notes in order:

- Bb  
- Gb  
- Db  
- B (natural!)  
- Ab  

This is unusual because **B natural** appears in a progression otherwise full of flats.

---

### Step 2: Look at the tonic
The chord **Bbm** appears **6 times**, more than any other. It begins and ends the progression. This strongly suggests **Bb minor** is the **tonic**.

---

### Step 3: Check the mode
Since the tonic is **Bbm**, and the progression centers around **Bb**, we are in **Bb minor**.

But we must check for **modal inflections**.

---

### Step 4: Analyze the chords in Bb minor

| Chord     | Function in Bb minor |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Bbm       | i (tonic)            |
| Gb/Bb     | ♭VI in 1st inversion |
| Db/Ab     | ♭III in 1st inversion |
| B/Bb      | **V/V** (secondary dominant of V) |
| Abm6      | ♭II with added 6th   |

---

### Final Answer:

**Key: Bb minor**  
**Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)** with **secondary dominant** (B/Bb = V/V) and **chromatic voice-leading** (Abm6 is a passing color).

No modal interchange or major tonic is implied — it's **straight Bb minor**, with some **chromatic spice**.

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze the chord progression:  

**Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm**

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their relationships

Let's rewrite them in a simpler form (removing inversions for a moment):

- **Bbm** (Bb–Db–F)  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major over Bb (Gb–Bb–Db) → functions as **Gb** chord  
- **Db/Ab** = Db major over Ab (Db–F–Ab) → functions as **Db** chord  
- **B/Bb** = B major over Bb → a chromatic color tone (Bb as bass leading back to tonic)  
- **Abm6** (Ab–Cb–Eb–F)  

---

### Step 2: Possible key areas

Let's test **Bb minor** as a key center:

| Chord | In Bb minor | Function |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Bbm | i (tonic) |
| Gb (Gb/Bb) | VI |
| Db (Db/Ab) | III |
| B/Bb | Chromatic passing chord (non-diatonic) |
| Abm6 | iv6 or iv with added 6 |

Everything except **B major (B/Bb)** fits well inside **Bb natural minor** (Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab).  
The **B/Bb** chord introduces a momentary chromatic color — it doesn’t imply tonicization elsewhere, so it’s likely a passing or borrowed chord.

---

### Step 3: Determine the mode

Since the progression centers on **Bbm** and uses **Gb (b6)** and **Ab (b7)** chords, it aligns with the **Aeolian (natural minor)** mode, not harmonic or melodic minor (no A natural or E natural appears).

---

✅ **Answer:**

- **Key:** B♭ minor  
- **Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor)

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

Hmm, this is a chord progression analysis request. The user provided a sequence of chords and wants to determine the key and mode. The chords are mostly Bbm and Gb/Bb with some variations, which immediately suggests Bbm as the tonal center. 

I notice the progression alternates between Bbm and Gb/Bb, which is a i-VI relationship in minor keys. The presence of Db/Ab (IV chord) and Abm6 (iv chord in minor) further supports Bb minor. The B/Bb chord is interesting - it's likely a secondary dominant (V/V) pointing to Cb major, which is the relative major's dominant. 

The consistent use of Gb major (VI) instead of G diminished (vi°) confirms this is Bb natural minor, not harmonic or melodic minor. The B natural in B/Bb creates a brief major V effect but doesn't change the overall mode. The progression strongly emphasizes the i-VI movement typical of modern minor key songs.

Of course. Let's break this chord progression down.

### Summary

- **Key:** **Bb Minor**
- **Mode:** **Aeolian Mode (Natural Minor)**

---

### Detailed Analysis

Let's look at the chords and their relationship to the key of Bb minor.

**1. The Tonal Center (i chord)**

The progression is dominated by the **Bbm** chord. It starts and ends on Bbm, and appears frequently throughout, firmly establishing it as the "home" chord (the tonic). In a minor key, the tonic chord is the **i chord**.

**2. The Chord Functions**

Here is the progression with Roman numeral analysis in the key of Bb minor (Bb Natural Minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab).

*   **Bbm** = **i** (Tonic)
*   **Gb/Bb** = **VI** (Major chord built on the 6th scale degree). The slash bass note `/Bb` just puts the root of the key in the bass, reinforcing the tonal center.
*   **Db/Ab** = **IV** (Major chord built on the 4th scale degree). The `/Ab` is a first-inversion voicing, putting the 5th of the chord in the bass.
*   **B/Bb** = This is the most colorful chord. It's a **B major triad over a Bb bass note**. This functions as a **V/V chord** (the dominant of the dominant). It's a secondary dominant that strongly pulls towards the Cb (B) major chord, which is the V chord in the key of Eb minor. Here, it creates tension before resolving deceptively or moving back to the tonic area.
*   **Abm6** = **iv⁶** (Minor chord built on the 4th scale degree, in first inversion). In the natural minor scale, the chord on the 4th degree is minor (Abm). The "6" indicates it's an Abm chord in first inversion (Abm/Cb).

**3. Determining the Mode (Why it's Natural Minor/Aeolian)**

The most telling chord is the **Gb** major (the **VI** chord). In the key of Bb minor, the chords built on the 6th and 7th degrees are critical for distinguishing the mode:

*   **Bb Natural Minor (Aeolian):** Scale = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, **Gb**, Ab
    *   Chord on Gb = **Gb major (VI)**
*   **Bb Harmonic Minor:** Scale = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, **Gb**, A
    *   Chord on Gb = **Gb augmented (VI+)**
*   **Bb Melodic Minor:** Scale = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, **G**, A
    *   Chord on G = **G diminished (vi°)**

The progression consistently uses **Gb major**, which only exists in the **Bb Natural Minor** scale. Therefore, the mode is **Aeolian**.

**4. Overall Feel and Conclusion**

This is a very common and evocative modern progression, often found in pop, film scores, and R&B. The back-and-forth between the **i (Bbm)** and **VI (Gb)** creates a somber yet expansive feel. The **B/Bb** chord acts as a surprising, bright, and tense moment that adds sophistication before the final resolution to the tonic.

**In a nutshell:** The constant return to Bbm as the home base, combined with the use of the Gb major chord from the Bb natural minor scale, definitively places this progression in the **key of Bb Aeolian (Bb Natural Minor)**.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:

**Bbm  Bbm  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbm  Bbm  Db/Ab  B/Bb  Bbm  Bbm  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbm  Bbm  Abm6  Bbm**

- **Bbm** = B♭ D♭ F  
- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ B♭ D♭ (first inversion) — that’s just a G♭ major chord over B♭ in bass.  
- **Db/Ab** = D♭ F A♭ (second inversion) — D♭ major chord.  
- **B/Bb** = B D♯ F♯ over B♭ bass — unusual, but B major triad over B♭ bass creates a B♭7♯5♯9 sound (B♭ alt chord).  
- **Abm6** = A♭ C♭ E♭ F — that’s A♭ minor with an added 6th (F).

---

## **2. Look for tonal center**

The progression starts and ends on **Bbm**, and Bbm appears frequently.  
Likely key: **B♭ minor**.

---

## **3. Check scale/chord relationships in B♭ natural minor**

B♭ natural minor scale:  
B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭

Chords in B♭ natural minor:  
- B♭m (i)  
- Cdim (ii°)  
- D♭ (III)  
- E♭m (iv)  
- Fm (v)  
- G♭ (VI)  
- A♭ (VII)

---

**Gb** = G♭ major = VI chord in B♭ minor.  
**Db** = D♭ major = III chord in B♭ minor.  
**Abm6** = A♭ C♭ E♭ F = A♭ minor with a 6th = ivm6 in B♭ minor? Wait — A♭ minor would be A♭ C♭ E♭, but in B♭ natural minor, A♭ is major (A♭ C E♭). So Abm is **not** diatonic to B♭ natural minor — it’s borrowed.

---

## **4. Check B♭ harmonic minor**

B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♮ B♭

A♭m doesn’t occur in harmonic minor either — A becomes A♮, so A♭ is lowered.

So **Abm** must be borrowed from **B♭ Phrygian** (B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭) — that’s B♭ minor with a ♭2 and ♭6 relative to natural minor? Wait, B♭ Phrygian is from G♭ major scale: G♭ A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F. Yes — in G♭ major, B♭ Phrygian chord built on A♭ is A♭ minor.

But simpler: Abm is the **iv of E♭ minor**? Actually, Abm is the **ii of G♭ major** — but here it’s in B♭m context, so it’s **♭VI minor** — a rare borrowed chord.

---

## **5. The B/Bb chord**

B major triad = B D♯ F♯.  
Over B♭ bass = B♭ B D♯ F♯ → enharmonically B♭ C♭ E♮ G♭? Let’s respell:  
B = B D♯ F♯  
B♭ bass = B♭ + B D♯ F♯ → notes: B♭, B, D♯, F♯.  
That’s B♭, C♭, E♮, G♭.  

In B♭ minor harmonic: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♮.  
We have C♭ (not C), E♮ (not E♭), G♭ (in scale).  
So this is B♭7♯5♯9: B♭ D F♯ A♭ C♭ — yes:  
B♭ (root), D (3rd) — wait, we have E♮ (D♯) not D. So it’s B♭ minor-major? No — 3rd is D♯ = E♭? No, D♯ is E♭? No, D♯ is enharmonic to E♭ only in 12-TET but functionally different. Actually, D♯ is E♭ in equal temperament, so B major triad = B E♭ G♭? That’s wrong — B to D♯ is major third, D♯ to F♯ is minor third. B major = B D♯ F♯. D♯ = E♭. So B major = B E♭ G♭. Yes! So B major triad is B E♭ G♭.  

So B/B♭ = B♭ + B E♭ G♭ = B♭ B E♭ G♭ = B♭ C♭ E♭ G♭.  
That’s just a B♭7sus♭9: B♭ E♭ G♭ C♭.  
But E♭ is the 4th (sus4), G♭ is ♭7, C♭ is ♭9.  
So it’s B♭7sus4(♭9).  
In B♭ minor, E♭ and G♭ are scale tones (iv and VI), C♭ is the ♭2 (C♭ = B).  
So it’s a Phrygian ♭2 sound.

---

## **6. Mode determination**

We have:  
- B♭m (i)  
- G♭ (VI)  
- D♭ (III)  
- Abm (♭VI minor — borrowed)  
- B♭7sus♭9 (borrowed from Phrygian)

The B/B♭ chord suggests **B♭ Phrygian** or **B♭ Phrygian Dominant** influence.  
B♭ Phrygian = B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭.  
In that scale:  
B♭m, G♭, D♭, Abm all fit.  
B/B♭ = B♭ C♭ E♭ G♭ = B♭7sus♭9 fits as v7sus♭9 in B♭ Phrygian.

---

## **7. Conclusion**

The key is **B♭ minor**, but the mode is **B♭ Phrygian** (a minor mode with ♭2, ♭6, ♭7 relative to natural minor — actually Phrygian has ♭2, ♭3, ♭6, ♭7 relative to major).  
B♭ Phrygian is the 3rd mode of G♭ major.  
All chords except possibly the B/B♭ are diatonic to B♭ Phrygian, and B/B♭ is just a Phrygian suspension.

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**
    *   **Input:** A sequence of chords: `Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm`
    *   **Task:** Determine the key and mode.

2.  **Initial Analysis & Simplification:**
    *   The chords are repeated a lot. Let's strip it down to the unique chords present:
        *   `Bbm` (B flat minor)
        *   `Gb/Bb` (G flat major over B flat bass)
        *   `Db/Ab` (D flat major over A flat bass)
        *   `B/Bb` (B major over B flat bass)
        *   `Abm6` (A flat minor 6th)
    *   The most frequent chord, by far, is `Bbm`. It starts the progression, ends the progression, and appears multiple times in between. This is a *huge* clue. `Bbm` is very likely the tonic (the "i" chord).

3.  **Hypothesis 1: Bb Minor (Natural, Harmonic, or Melodic)**
    *   Let's assume the key is Bb minor. What are the diatonic chords?
        *   **Bb Natural Minor:** Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - Gb - Ab
            *   i: `Bbm` (✓)
            *   ii°: `Cdim`
            *   III: `Db` (✓, we have `Db/Ab`)
            *   iv: `Ebm`
            *   v: `Fm`
            *   VI: `Gb` (✓, we have `Gb/Bb`)
            *   VII: `Ab` (✓, we have `Abm6`, which is related)
        *   **Bb Harmonic Minor:** Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - Gb - A
            *   i: `Bbm` (✓)
            *   ii°: `Cdim`
            *   III+: `Dbaug`
            *   iv: `Ebm`
            *   V: `F` (Major, not present)
            *   VI: `Gb` (✓)
            *   vii°: `Adim`
        *   **Bb Melodic Minor:** Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G - A
            *   i: `Bbm` (✓)
            *   ii: `Cm`
            *   III+: `Dbaug`
            *   IV: `Eb` (Major, not present)
            *   V: `F` (Major, not present)
            *   vi°: `Gdim`
            *   vii°: `Adim`

4.  **Evaluating the Chords against the Bb Minor Hypothesis:**
    *   `Bbm`: Perfect fit as the tonic (i).
    *   `Gb/Bb`: This is a `VI` chord (Gb major) with the tonic in the bass. This is a very common "phrygian" or "locrian" type sound, but in this context, it's just a `VI` chord. It strongly reinforces the tonic of Bb. It's diatonic to Bb natural minor.
    *   `Db/Ab`: This is a `III` chord (Db major) with the fifth (Ab) in the bass. Diatonic to Bb natural minor.
    *   `Abm6`: This is the tricky one.
        *   Let's analyze `Abm6`. The notes are Ab - Cb - Eb - F.
        *   In the context of Bb minor, Ab is the `VI` or `vii` degree. Cb is the `ii` degree. Eb is the `iv` degree. F is the `v` degree.
        *   This chord is *not* strictly diatonic to Bb natural minor. The `F` is the problem. Bb natural minor has a Gb, not an F.
        *   However, `Abm6` is a very common substitution. It's often used as a "minor iv" or a "backdoor" type chord. Let's think about its function. It contains the notes of an F7 (F-A-C-Eb) but with an Ab root instead. No, that's not right. Let's re-examine.
        *   `Abm6` (Ab-Cb-Eb-F). Let's compare it to a standard `i` chord in Bb minor (`Bbm` = Bb-Db-F). The `Abm6` shares the `F` (the fifth of Bbm). It also has `Cb` (which is enharmonic to B, the leading tone in Bb *major* but not minor). This is getting complicated.
        *   Let's try a simpler approach. What does `Abm6` *sound* like? It's a classic "film noir" or "jazz minor" chord. It often functions as a `i` chord in a minor key a whole step down (e.g., Gm7 -> Cm7 -> Abm6 -> Gm7). But here, it resolves to `Bbm`.
        *   Let's re-examine its relationship to Bb. `Abm6` is the `i` chord of Ab minor. How does Ab minor relate to Bb minor? It's the `VII` chord in the natural minor scale. `Abm` is the diatonic `VII` chord. The `6` (F) is the one non-diatonic note. This `F` is the major 2nd of Eb, or the perfect 4th of B. It's the `v` of Bb minor.
        *   So, `Abm6` is a `VII` chord with an added `v` degree. This is a common chromaticism. It creates a lot of tension that wants to resolve back to the tonic `Bbm`. It's a "color" chord.
    *   `B/Bb`: This is the *most* interesting and important chord.
        *   The notes are B - D# - F# over a Bb bass.
        *   Let's analyze the intervals from the bass note Bb:
            *   Bb to B is a major 2nd (or augmented unison).
            *   Bb to D# is an augmented 4th.
            *   Bb to F# is an augmented 6th.
        *   This is an **Augmented Sixth Chord**! Specifically, it's a **German Augmented Sixth Chord**.
        *   What does an Augmented Sixth chord do? It's a pre-dominant chord that resolves outwardly to an octave on the dominant. The augmented sixth interval (Bb to F#) resolves to an octave on the dominant note.
        *   What is the dominant of Bb minor? The dominant is `F` (or `F` major in harmonic/melodic minor).
        *   So, the `B/Bb` chord should resolve to `F`. But it doesn't. It resolves back to `Bbm`.
        *   This is a *deceptive resolution* of an augmented sixth chord. Instead of resolving to the dominant (`F`), it resolves back to the tonic (`Bbm`). This is a very dramatic and effective harmonic device, especially in styles like rock, metal, and film scores. It strongly implies the key of Bb minor because the entire function of the chord is built around the relationship to the tonic (Bb) and the expected dominant (F).

5.  **Synthesizing the Analysis:**
    *   **Tonic:** `Bbm` is overwhelmingly the tonic. It's the home base.
    *   **Diatonic Chords:** `Gb/Bb` (VI) and `Db/Ab` (III) are straight from Bb natural minor.
    *   **Chromatic/Altered Chords:**
        *   `B/Bb` is a German Augmented Sixth chord that deceptively resolves to the tonic. This is a powerful indicator of Bb minor.
        *   `Abm6` is a chromatic "color" chord, a `VII` chord with an added note, creating tension that resolves back to `Bbm`.
    *   **Mode:** The use of the natural minor chords (III, VI) and the lack of a strong V chord (like `F` or `F7`) points strongly towards the **Natural Minor** mode (also known as the Aeolian mode). The chromatic chords are *additions* to this framework, not replacements for it. The overall feel is dark and minor, consistent with Aeolian.

6.  **Considering Alternatives (and why they're less likely):**
    *   **Could it be Gb Major?** The chords `Bbm` (ii), `Db/Ab` (IV/6), `Gb/Bb` (I/3) are all diatonic. But `B/Bb` and `Abm6` are very strange and non-functional in Gb major. The `Bbm` feels like a tonic, not a `ii` chord.
    *   **Could it be Db Major?** `Bbm` is vi. `Gb/Bb` is IV/3. `Db/Ab` is I/5. `Abm6` is a weird chromaticism. `B/Bb` is completely out of place. Again, `Bbm` feels like home, not a `vi`.
    *   **Could it be a mode like Bb Locrian?** No, the tonic chord is minor, not diminished. The progression doesn't fit the Locrian sound at all.
    *   **Could it be Bb Dorian?** Bb Dorian is Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G - Ab. The `IV` chord would be `Eb` major, which isn't present. The `v` chord would be `F` minor, which isn't present. The chords we have (`Gb`, `Db`) fit natural minor much better.

7.  **Final Conclusion Formulation:**
    *   Start with the most likely answer: **Key of Bb Natural Minor (Aeolian mode).**
    *   Provide the evidence, step-by-step.
    *   **Primary Evidence:** The overwhelming presence and function of `Bbm` as the tonic chord.
    *   **Secondary Evidence:** The diatonic chords `Gb` (VI) and `Db` (III) fit perfectly within the Bb natural minor scale.
    *   **Advanced Evidence (The "Smoking Gun"):** Explain the function of the non-diatonic chords.
        *   Identify `B/Bb` as a German Augmented Sixth chord. Explain its typical function (resolving to the dominant) and how its deceptive resolution back to the tonic (`Bbm`) powerfully reinforces Bb as the key center.
        *   Describe `Abm6` as a chromatic color chord, a common "minor film noir" type chord that adds tension before resolving to the tonic.
    *   **Mode Justification:** Explain why it's Natural Minor (Aeolian) and not Harmonic or Melodic minor. The core diatonic structure is based on the natural minor scale (III and VI are major). The chromaticism is an added layer, not a fundamental change to the scale's character (like raising the 7th degree for a dominant V chord).
    *   **Add a "Sound/Feel" description:** Mention that this type of progression is common in rock, metal, and film music, creating a dramatic, dark, and epic feel. This adds context and helps the user understand *why* these chords are used together.


This is a fantastic and interesting chord progression! Let's break it down.

### The Short Answer

The key is **Bb Natural Minor** (also known as the **Aeolian mode**).

---

### The Detailed Analysis

Here is the reasoning behind that conclusion, looking at each chord's function.

#### 1. The Tonic Center: Bbm

The chord **Bbm** appears more than any other chord. It starts the progression, ends it, and bookends the main phrases. This makes it the overwhelming candidate for the tonic chord (the "i" chord), establishing Bb minor as our home key.

#### 2. The Diatonic Framework: Natural Minor

Let's look at the chords that fit naturally into the Bb minor scale. The Bb Natural Minor scale consists of the notes: Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - Gb - Ab.

*   **Bbm (i):** The tonic minor chord. (✓)
*   **Gb/Bb:** This is a **Gb major** chord (the VI chord) with a Bb in the bass. The VI chord is diatonic to natural minor. Putting the tonic in the bass is a very common way to reinforce the key center. (✓)
*   **Db/Ab:** This is a **Db major** chord (the III chord) with an Ab in the bass (its 5th). The III chord is also diatonic to natural minor. (✓)

The core structure of the progression (i - VI - i - III - i) is built entirely from the Bb Natural Minor scale. This is our primary evidence.

#### 3. The Chromatic Chords: The "Smoking Gun"

The two remaining chords are non-diatonic, but their function actually *confirms* Bb minor as the key.

*   **B/Bb:** This is the most important and telling chord.
    *   The notes are B - D# - F# over a Bb bass.
    *   The interval between the bass note (Bb) and the top note (F#) is an **Augmented Sixth**.
    *   This is a **German Augmented Sixth Chord**. Its traditional function is to be a very strong pre-dominant chord that resolves to the dominant (F or F major in this key).
    *   However, in this progression, it **deceptively resolves** back to the tonic `Bbm`. This is a very dramatic and modern-sounding harmonic trick. The fact that this chord's entire identity is built around its relationship to the Bb tonic and the F dominant is a powerful confirmation of the key.

*   **Abm6:** This is a classic "color" chord.
    *   The notes are Ab - Cb - Eb - F.
    *   While not strictly diatonic, it functions as a chromatic subdominant or a "minor iv" type sound. It creates a lot of dark, jazzy tension that beautifully resolves back to the tonic `Bbm`. It's a common chord in rock, metal, and film noir-style jazz.

### Conclusion

*   **Key:** **Bb Minor**
*   **Mode:** **Natural Minor (Aeolian)**

The progression is firmly rooted in the **Bb Natural Minor** sound due to the use of the diatonic `i`, `VI`, and `III` chords. The chromatic chords (`B/Bb` and `Abm6`) are sophisticated additions that create tension and drama, but their functions are defined by their relationship to the Bb minor tonic, ultimately reinforcing it rather than contradicting it.

This type of progression is very common in genres like progressive rock, metal, and film scores, where a dark, epic, and dramatic atmosphere is desired.
