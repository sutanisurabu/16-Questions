### Reasoning

**Analyzing key and mode**

I need to determine the key and mode from the given chord progression: "Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm". 

The tonic appears to be Bbm, and there are some interesting slash chords like Gb/Bb and Db/Ab. I'm considering the key of Bb minor. This involves analyzing the harmonic and melodic minor scales. I’ll check the notes and confirm the mode too. Let’s dive deeper into this!**Breaking down chords**

I’m analyzing the chords to understand their structure and position.  

Bbm is the tonic (i) with its notes Bb-Db-F. 

The Gb/Bb chord translates to Gb major over Bb, classifying it as VI6 in Bb minor, since the Bb bass indicates first inversion. 

Then there’s the Db/Ab chord, which is Db major over Ab and serves as the III chord. It's so interesting how inversions affect their labeling! Let's summarize these relationships clearly.**Examining chord inversions**

I’m looking at the chord structure, starting with the Db triad, which consists of the notes Db-F-Ab. With Ab in the bass, it’s a second inversion, III6/4.

Now, for the B/Bb chord, we have a B major chord over Bb, and the notes are B-D#-F#. Since we're in Bb minor, this suggests some borrowed harmony. 

Enharmonically, B could be interpreted as Cb, which makes it an interesting challenge! In Bb minor, Cb would indeed represent a Neapolitan chord in first inversion, giving us a unique flavor!**Exploring Neapolitan chords**

Okay, I’m checking out the Neapolitan chord in a minor key, which is built on bII major (Cb-Eb-Gb). If it were in first inversion, Eb would be the bass note. However, since we have Bb in the bass, it’s not matching up as a chord tone.

This B/Bb could function as a chromatic upper neighbor or appoggiatura. It’s possible the composer is using B major as a leading tone, or maybe it’s a tritone substitution. Plus, I see that Abm6 also appears later, indicating it's worth considering some borrowed chords too!**Analyzing chord relationships**

I'm examining how Ab minor fits within Bb minor. The Neapolitan chord built on bII major (Cb-Eb-Gb) doesn’t quite match since Bb is a fifth and not a chord tone. 

The B/Bb chord could be a chromatic neighbor or serving as a leading tone. I'm also considering whether Ab minor appears as a borrowed chord, along with its relationship to major keys. 

My analysis points toward Bb minor as the key, where Abm6 might serve as a borrowed subdominant minor chord. The progression flows from i to VI6 to i, suggesting an Aeolian mode as well.**Determining key and mode**

I'm thinking about how Ab minor fits into different keys. In Bb major, the iv minor would be Eb minor, while here, it seems we're dealing with bVII minor. The presence of Abm6 might act like a backdoor cadence while exploring other keys, like Db major, where Bbm can function as the vi.

Then, considering Gb major, Bbm serves as iii, suggesting the chord progression revolves around this. I'm finding consistency with the key of Gb major, but the ending chords hint at an open dominant feeling, leaving the resolution unclear. So, I’m determining the key and mode as Gb major or Eb minor.**Determining key and mode**

I'm thinking the tonal center could be Bb minor, especially since Bbm is frequently repeated, starting and ending the progression. The supportive chords include Gb (VI), Db (III), and Abm6 (bVII minor), fitting within Bb minor Aeolian with some modal mixture. If we interpret the B/Bb chord as enharmonically Cb/Bb, it can function as Neapolitan. 

Overall, the key seems to be Bb minor in Aeolian mode, based on the absence of a leading tone and presence of modal colors. So, I’d say the answer is Bb minor, Aeolian!

Key: B-flat minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Evidence: Bbm is the clear tonal center; Gb (VI) and Db (III) are Aeolian pillars. Db/Ab = III6/4, Gb/Bb = VI6. The B/Bb chord reads best as Cb/Bb, i.e., a Neapolitan (bII6/4), and Abm6 functions as a borrowed bVII minor sonority resolving back to i—all consistent with Bb Aeolian.
