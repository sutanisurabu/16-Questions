### Reasoning

Hmm, this is a chord progression analysis request. The user provided a sequence of chords and wants to determine the key and mode. The chords are mostly Bbm and Gb/Bb with some variations, which immediately suggests Bbm as the tonal center. 

I notice the progression alternates between Bbm and Gb/Bb, which is a i-VI relationship in minor keys. The presence of Db/Ab (IV chord) and Abm6 (iv chord in minor) further supports Bb minor. The B/Bb chord is interesting - it's likely a secondary dominant (V/V) pointing to Cb major, which is the relative major's dominant. 

The consistent use of Gb major (VI) instead of G diminished (vi°) confirms this is Bb natural minor, not harmonic or melodic minor. The B natural in B/Bb creates a brief major V effect but doesn't change the overall mode. The progression strongly emphasizes the i-VI movement typical of modern minor key songs.

Of course. Let's break this chord progression down.

### Summary

- **Key:** **Bb Minor**
- **Mode:** **Aeolian Mode (Natural Minor)**

### Detailed Analysis

Let's look at the chords and their relationship to the key of Bb minor.

**1. The Tonal Center (i chord)**

The progression is dominated by the **Bbm** chord. It starts and ends on Bbm, and appears frequently throughout, firmly establishing it as the "home" chord (the tonic). In a minor key, the tonic chord is the **i chord**.

**2. The Chord Functions**

Here is the progression with Roman numeral analysis in the key of Bb minor (Bb Natural Minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab).

*   **Bbm** = **i** (Tonic)
*   **Gb/Bb** = **VI** (Major chord built on the 6th scale degree). The slash bass note `/Bb` just puts the root of the key in the bass, reinforcing the tonal center.
*   **Db/Ab** = **IV** (Major chord built on the 4th scale degree). The `/Ab` is a first-inversion voicing, putting the 5th of the chord in the bass.
*   **B/Bb** = This is the most colorful chord. It's a **B major triad over a Bb bass note**. This functions as a **V/V chord** (the dominant of the dominant). It's a secondary dominant that strongly pulls towards the Cb (B) major chord, which is the V chord in the key of Eb minor. Here, it creates tension before resolving deceptively or moving back to the tonic area.
*   **Abm6** = **iv⁶** (Minor chord built on the 4th scale degree, in first inversion). In the natural minor scale, the chord on the 4th degree is minor (Abm). The "6" indicates it's an Abm chord in first inversion (Abm/Cb).

**3. Determining the Mode (Why it's Natural Minor/Aeolian)**

The most telling chord is the **Gb** major (the **VI** chord). In the key of Bb minor, the chords built on the 6th and 7th degrees are critical for distinguishing the mode:

*   **Bb Natural Minor (Aeolian):** Scale = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, **Gb**, Ab
    *   Chord on Gb = **Gb major (VI)**
*   **Bb Harmonic Minor:** Scale = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, **Gb**, A
    *   Chord on Gb = **Gb augmented (VI+)**
*   **Bb Melodic Minor:** Scale = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, **G**, A
    *   Chord on G = **G diminished (vi°)**

The progression consistently uses **Gb major**, which only exists in the **Bb Natural Minor** scale. Therefore, the mode is **Aeolian**.

**4. Overall Feel and Conclusion**

This is a very common and evocative modern progression, often found in pop, film scores, and R&B. The back-and-forth between the **i (Bbm)** and **VI (Gb)** creates a somber yet expansive feel. The **B/Bb** chord acts as a surprising, bright, and tense moment that adds sophistication before the final resolution to the tonic.

**In a nutshell:** The constant return to Bbm as the home base, combined with the use of the Gb major chord from the Bb natural minor scale, definitively places this progression in the **key of Bb Aeolian (Bb Natural Minor)**.
