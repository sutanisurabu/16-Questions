Let's analyze the chord progression:  

**Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm**

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their relationships

Let's rewrite them in a simpler form (removing inversions for a moment):

- **Bbm** (Bb–Db–F)  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major over Bb (Gb–Bb–Db) → functions as **Gb** chord  
- **Db/Ab** = Db major over Ab (Db–F–Ab) → functions as **Db** chord  
- **B/Bb** = B major over Bb → a chromatic color tone (Bb as bass leading back to tonic)  
- **Abm6** (Ab–Cb–Eb–F)

### Step 2: Possible key areas

Let's test **Bb minor** as a key center:

| Chord | In Bb minor | Function |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Bbm | i (tonic) |
| Gb (Gb/Bb) | VI |
| Db (Db/Ab) | III |
| B/Bb | Chromatic passing chord (non-diatonic) |
| Abm6 | iv6 or iv with added 6 |

Everything except **B major (B/Bb)** fits well inside **Bb natural minor** (Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab).  
The **B/Bb** chord introduces a momentary chromatic color — it doesn’t imply tonicization elsewhere, so it’s likely a passing or borrowed chord.

### Step 3: Determine the mode

Since the progression centers on **Bbm** and uses **Gb (b6)** and **Ab (b7)** chords, it aligns with the **Aeolian (natural minor)** mode, not harmonic or melodic minor (no A natural or E natural appears).

✅ **Answer:**

- **Key:** B♭ minor  
- **Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor)
