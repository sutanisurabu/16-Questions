**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

> Bbm — Bbm — Gb/Bb — Gb/Bb — Bbm — Bbm — Db/Ab — B/Bb — Bbm — Bbm — Gb/Bb — Gb/Bb — Bbm — Bbm — Abm6 — Bbm

---

### Step 1: List unique chords and their roots

- **Bbm** (B♭ minor) — appears many times
- **Gb/Bb** — Gb major chord with Bb in bass (so Gb major in first inversion)
- **Db/Ab** — Db major with Ab in bass (Db major in first inversion)
- **B/Bb** — B major with Bb in bass — this is very unusual!

And finally:

- **Abm6** — A-flat minor 6 chord

---

### Step 2: Analyze tonal center

The progression **starts and ends on Bbm**, and **Bbm appears 8 times**, almost always as the home chord. That strongly suggests **B♭ minor** is the tonal center.

But let’s check if this is Ionian (major) or Aeolian (minor) mode — clearly, it’s **minor**, given the prevalence of Bbm.

So tentative key: **B♭ minor**

---

### Step 3: Check chords for compatibility with B♭ minor

B♭ natural minor scale (Aeolian):  
**B♭ - C - D♭ - E♭ - F - G♭ - A♭**

Chords built on this scale (diatonic):

- i: B♭m
- ii°: C°
- III: D♭
- iv: E♭m
- v: Fm
- VI: G♭
- VII: A♭

Now compare with your chords:

- **Bbm** → i ✅  
- **Gb** → VI ✅ (Gb is major in natural minor)  
- **Db** → III ✅ (D♭ major — common in minor keys, as borrowed or from harmonic context)  
- **Abm6** → This is A♭ minor 6. In B♭ minor, VII chord is A♭ major (not minor). So **Abm6** is **not diatonic**.

Wait — **Abm6** is A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F

In B♭ minor, A♭ should be **A♭-C-E♭** (major triad).  
Here we have **A♭m6**: A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F → so it's A♭ minor with added 6th (F)

But C♭ is **B natural** enharmonically — this is **not** part of the B♭ natural minor scale.

Let’s reconsider.

---

### Step 4: The odd one out — **B/Bb**

This is **B major chord with B♭ in the bass**.

B major = B - D# - F#

B♭ in bass = B/B♭ = first inversion of B major? No — that doesn’t make sense because root is B, B♭ is not in the chord.

This is a **non-diatonic, chromatic chord**. It’s a **B major triad over B♭ bass** — which creates a very dissonant clash: B, D#, F# over B♭ — so intervals include B♭-B (minor 9th), B♭-D# (augmented 4th), B♭-F# (augmented 5th). This is very harsh.

In jazz/pop contexts, this often functions as a **chromatic bass motion** — perhaps leading to Bbm.

So: **B/Bb → Bbm**  
B♭ → B → B♭? That seems odd... unless it's **B/Bb → Cb** (which is Bm), but no — then it goes to **Bbm**.

Wait — B/Bb → Bbm? That’s a **half-step bass descent**: B♭ → B → B♭? That doesn’t make sense.

Actually, looking at the sequence:

> ... Db/Ab — **B/Bb** — Bbm ...

So: Db/Ab → B/Bb → Bbm

Bass notes: Ab → B♭ → B♭? Wait, no:

- Db/Ab → bass is Ab
- B/Bb → bass is B♭
- Bbm → bass is B♭

So: **Ab → B♭ → B♭**

That’s a **minor 3rd upward bass motion**: Ab to B♭ (up 3 semitones)

Then staying on B♭.

This suggests a possible **chromatic passing motion** in the bass: Ab → A → B♭? But here we have Ab → B♭. No A in between.

Alternatively, **B/Bb** may be a **borrowed chord** from another mode or key.

---

### Step 5: Consider **Abm6** — what key?

Abm6 = A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F  
C♭ is B natural, so this chord is:

A♭ - B - E♭ - F

That’s the same as **G#m6**: G# - B - D# - F#

But we're in B♭ land, so we’ll write as A♭m6.

A♭ minor 6 is **not** in B♭ minor. But let’s see if it fits another key.

What if the key is **G minor**?

G natural minor: G A B♭ C D E♭ F

Chords: Gm, A°, B♭, Cm, Dm, E♭, F

No A♭m6 here.

What if it’s **C minor**?

C natural minor: C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭

Now we see: **A♭** is the VI chord in C minor — and **A♭m6** would be a minor VI with added 6th (F). In C minor, VI chord is A♭ major. But here we have **A♭m6** — which suggests **borrowing from parallel major or another mode**? Not standard.

Wait — perhaps B♭ **harmonic minor**?

B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ **A**

Now we have **A natural**! So now:

- Chord VII = A major (A C# E)

But our chord is **Abm6** — A♭ minor — that’s not A.

Still not matching.

Try **B♭ melodic minor ascending**: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G A

Now, chords:

- i: B♭m
- ii: C°
- III+: D♭ (major)
- IV: E♭
- V: F
- VI: G
- VII: A diminished

Still no A♭m6.

What chord is Abm6?

Abm6 = Ab - Cb - Eb - F  
Cb = B

So: Ab - B - Eb - F → **Abm6** = **G#m6** enharmonically

G#m6 = G# B D# F# — nothing to do with B♭.

So maybe it’s a **modal mixture** or **extended non-diatonic chord**.

But the most plausible interpretation is that **Bbm is the tonic**, and the other chords are borrowed or chromatic.

Let’s look at the character.

---

### Step 6: **B/Bb** as a tritone substitution?

B/Bb is a B major chord with B♭ bass — that’s **B major over B♭ bass**.

This **could** be interpreted as a **slash chord implying a tritone substitution** — B major is the tritone substitution for E major — but in B♭ minor? Doesn’t fit.

Alternatively, it’s a **chromatic passing chord**, used to create motion from Db/Ab (which has Ab bass) → B/Bb (B♭ bass) → Bbm (B♭ bass). So bass moves:

**Ab → B♭ → B♭**

That’s a minor 3rd leap up — not smooth.

Wait — maybe a **typo**? Could it be **Bb/Bb** instead of **B/Bb**? That would make more sense: **Bb/Bb = Bb major**, which would be **major tonic** — creating a **modal interchange** from minor to major.

But it says **B/Bb** — so root is B, not Bb.

In pop/rock/jazz, **B/Bb** is sometimes used in **B minor** context to create a chromatic bass line.

But we’re in B♭ minor.

Unless... the key is **A minor**?

Try: **A minor**

Diagonal chords in A minor:

- i: Am
- ii°: B°
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

Our chords: Bbm, Gb, Db, Abm6 — all flat notes. Unlikely for A minor.

---

### Step 7: Consider **Eb major**?

Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D

Chords: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bbm, Cm, D°

Bbm = v? — yes.

Db = IV? Db is **not in Eb major** — Db is flattened IV, which could be borrowed.

Gb? That would be #V — not in key.

Nope.

---

### Step 8: Reconsider the chord **B/Bb**

B/Bb — Bass: B♭  
Chord: B major

This creates the tritone: **B and B♭ — minor 9th**, but also: in context, this might be the **leading tone chord** — **B natural is the leading tone to C**, but we’re going to Bbm.

B natural → B♭ minor? That’s strengthening the minor third.

In **B♭ minor harmonic**, the leading tone is **A natural** — not B.

Wait — **B natural** in B♭ minor is the **#2** (upper auxiliary tone).

This chord could be a **secondary dominant** or **chromatic mediant**.

Try interpreting **B/Bb** as **secondary dominant to Cm**? But next chord is Bbm.

Alternatively, it’s **not functional** — just color.

---

### Step 9: Look at **Abm6**

A♭m6 = A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F

C♭ is B — so: **A♭ - B - E♭ - F**

This is essentially **G#m6** = G# - B - D# - F#

Now, G#m6 is the **i chord** in **G# minor**

G# minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#

But we’re in B♭ world — B♭ and A# are enharmonic.

So perhaps **A♭m6** is meant to be **G#m6**, implying **G# minor key**?

But the entire progression is anchored in B♭m — that would mean **key change** mid-progression? Unlikely.

Alternatively, **A♭m6** = **bVI chord in C minor**? Cm → A♭m6? Not standard.

Wait — **Abm6** could be a **borrowed chord from B♭ Dorian or Phrygian**?

B♭ Dorian: B♭ C D E♭ F G A → VI = F major

Not Ab.

B♭ Phrygian: B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭

Now we have **A♭** — which is VII — but **A♭ major**, not minor.

To get **A♭m**, we’d need C♭ (B), E♭, A♭ — so C♭ is **B**, which is not in Phrygian. Phrygian would have C♭ (D♭? No)

Wait — B♭ Phrygian:  
B♭ (root), C♭ (♭2), D♭ (♭3), E♭ (4), F (5), G♭ (♭6), A♭ (♭7)

Now, the **vii chord** = A♭ major (A♭ - C - E♭)

But Abm6 is A♭ - C♭ - E♭ - F

C♭ is not in the scale (C♭ is ♭3, which is D♭). C♭ is actually **B natural** — so **C♭ ≠ D♭**.

So **C♭ is not in B♭ Phrygian** — it’s introducing the **major 6th** (F) and **♭3 but flat even more?**

It’s too chromatic.

---

### Best Interpretation:

Despite the chromatic intrusions (**B/Bb** and **Abm6**), the overwhelming tonal center is **B♭ minor**, with **Bbm** appearing as the tonic chord throughout, especially beginning and end.

The **Gb** chord is the **♭VI** in B♭ minor — common in pop/rock/metal (e.g., "More Than a Woman" by Bee Gees).

The **Db** chord is the **♭III** — also common (e.g., in minor keys, borrowed from parallel major or as a substitute).

The **B/Bb** is a **chromatic bass approach** to the tonic — perhaps mimicking a **lower neighboring tone**: **Ab → B♭ → B♭**, where B/Bb singers a non-harmonic chord — intended for bass motion, not functional harmony.

The **Abm6** is the most puzzling, but it might be miswritten or:

- Could be **A♭ major 6**? (A♭ - C - E♭ - F) — that would be the **♭VI in B♭ minor** — but that’s Gb major in our chords!

Wait a minute — we have **Gb** already as ♭VI — so Abm6 is perhaps a **mistake**? Could it be **Ab** (major)? Then it’s ♭VII — which is common as a dominant substitute.

But the user wrote **Abm6**.

Perhaps it’s a **modal interchange from B♭ Dorian minor**? But still...

### Final Answer:

Despite unusual chromatic chords (**B/Bb**, **Abm6**), the **tonic chord is Bbm**, appearing frequently and framing the progression.

The harmonic language is **minor**, with borrowed chords and chromatic bass lines.

→ **Key: B♭ minor (or B♭ Aeolian)**  
→ **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)** — with chromatic inflections (borrowed chords, chromatic bass)

**B/Bb** may be a passing chord (B major = #2) for ornamentation  
**Abm6** may be a modal or textural choice — perhaps inspired by jazz minor harmony.

So:

> ✅ **Key: B♭ minor**  
> ✅ **Mode: Aeolian** (natural minor) — with chromatic alterations

This is **B♭ minor with chromatic passing and color chords** — common in modern pop, rock, and R&B (e.g., Adele, Sam Smith, late 90s R&B).
