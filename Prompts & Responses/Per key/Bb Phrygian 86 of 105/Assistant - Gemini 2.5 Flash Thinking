### Reasoning

**Analyzing the Harmony**

I'm currently breaking down the chord progression. The use of slash chords adds some interesting color, especially the $\text{Gb}/\text{Bb}$ and $\text{Db}/\text{Ab}$. Considering the key of B flat minor, I'm trying to see how these chords function within that context, and how their voice leading could influence the overall feeling.


**Exploring Chord Functions**

I've been examining the harmonic functions, and the $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ chord is particularly intriguing. Thinking about it, the major chord over a $\text{Bb}$ bassline doesn't quite fit the typical minor key mold, but its dominant qualities are evident. I suspect it's there to pull us back to the tonic. I'm now looking at potential resolutions.


**Pinpointing the Tonic**

I'm now completely certain that the tonic is B-flat minor. The progression keeps coming back to $\text{Bbm}$, and even the unusual chord choices seem to resolve toward that tonal center. I am now refining my analysis of the $\text{Abm6}$ chord, and its role as a pre-dominant.


**Identifying Cadences**

I'm now focusing on cadence points, and the move from $\text{Abm6}$ to $\text{Bbm}$ is particularly telling. This is a very interesting cadence and the $\text{bVII}$ - $\text{i}$ cadence is unexpected. The finality of the $\text{Bbm}$ at the end of the progression is now completely confirmed, and I will be looking closely at the effect of the slash chords.


**Deconstructing Chromaticism**

I'm now fully immersed in the analysis, and the $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ chord is proving particularly thorny. Considering the preceding $\text{Db}/\text{Ab}$ chord, and the subsequent resolution to $\text{Bbm}$, I'm seeing this as potentially a chromatic passing chord. I will be looking at this in the context of voice leading.


**Deciphering Chromaticism**

I'm now fully analyzing the chromatic movement, particularly the $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ chord and its function. Given the $bIII$ to $I$ context, it's clear this is a color chord, and the use of the slash chords adds a nice flavor to the B-flat minor progression. I'm focusing on how this works rhythmically.


**Considering the Context**

I'm now considering the context of the piece, given the B-flat minor key. The $\text{Gb}/\text{Bb}$ and $\text{Db}/\text{Ab}$ chords are clearly providing color. The presence of the $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ chord is still puzzling, and I'm analyzing it as a chromatic passing chord. The $\text{Abm6}$ provides a strong pull.


**Synthesizing Findings**

I'm now fully confident about my analysis. The $\text{Bb}$ minor key is confirmed, and the use of the natural minor mode is clear. The chromatic passing chord, $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$, adds color to the overall harmonic landscape, with the overall flavor revolving around a minor key cadence.




The provided chord progression strongly establishes **B-flat Minor** as the tonic key center.

Here is the analysis of the chords relative to $\text{Bbm}$:

| Chord | Function in $\text{Bbm}$ | Notes | Scale Degrees in $\text{Bb}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\text{Bbm}$ | **I** (Tonic) | $\text{Bb}$, $\text{Db}$, $\text{F}$ | 1, $b3$, 5 |
| $\text{Gb}/\text{Bb}$ | **bVI** (Submediant) | $\text{Gb}$, $\text{Bb}$, $\text{Db}$ | $b6$, 1, $b3$ |
| $\text{Db}/\text{Ab}$ | **bIII** (Mediant) | $\text{Db}$, $\text{F}$, $\text{Ab}$ | $b3$, 5, $b7$ |
| $\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ | Highly chromatic passing chord (bII/pedal) | $\text{B}$, $\text{D}\sharp$, $\text{F}\sharp$ over $\text{Bb}$ | - |
| $\text{Abm6}$ | **bVIIm6** (Subtonic minor 6) | $\text{Ab}$, $\text{B}$($\text{Cb}$), $\text{Eb}$, $\text{F}$ | $b7$, $b2$/$\sharp 1$, 4, 5 |

### Determining the Mode

The mode is determined by the characteristic degrees used in the harmony, namely the 6th and 7th degrees.

1.  **Sixth Degree:** The use of the $\text{Gb}$ Major chord ($\text{bVI}$) establishes the **lowered 6th degree** ($\text{Gb}$).
2.  **Seventh Degree:** The use of $\text{Db}$ ($\text{bIII}$) and the $\text{Abm6}$ chord implies the existence of the **lowered 7th degree** ($\text{Ab}$). The $\text{Abm6}$ uses $\text{Ab}$ as its root. (Note: $\text{Ab}$ major ($\text{bVII}$) is the typical chord built on this degree, but $\text{Abm}$ works similarly by confirming the $b7$).

When a minor key uses both the natural (lowered) sixth ($\text{b6}$) and natural (lowered) seventh ($\text{b7}$) degrees, the mode is the **Natural Minor** (or Aeolian mode).

| Scale Degree | Note in $\text{Bb}$ Minor | Mode Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $\text{Bb}$ | Minor Tonic |
| $b3$ | $\text{Db}$ | Minor Tonic |
| $b6$ | $\text{Gb}$ | Natural Minor / Aeolian |
| $b7$ | $\text{Ab}$ | Natural Minor / Aeolian |

The chromatic chords ($\text{B}/\text{Bb}$ and the specific voicing of $\text{Abm6}$) function as color chords or passing movements, but they do not disrupt the fundamental minor mode established by the I, bIII, and bVI chords.

## Conclusion

*   **Key:** **B-flat Minor** ($\text{Bbm}$)
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian** (Natural Minor)
