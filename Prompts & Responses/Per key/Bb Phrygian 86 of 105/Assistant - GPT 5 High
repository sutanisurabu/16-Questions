### Reasoning

**Checking Ab minor chord**

I’m trying to figure out the pitches for an Ab minor chord (Ab, Cb, Eb) and considering if I should add a 6th, which would be Fb. In the Ab natural minor scale, the 6th scale degree is indeed Fb. Typically, an "m6" chord means a minor triad with an added major 6th; in this case, it's F.

I see that while F natural fits in the Abm6, it appears B natural isn't found in the Ab minor context, making it a bit tricky with the notation "B/Bb." That seems a bit non-diatonic!**Considering enharmonic spelling**

I’m exploring enharmonic spelling, particularly in flat keys where B natural is represented as Cb. So, a B major chord (B, D#, F#) could correspond to a Cb major chord (Cb, Eb, Gb) enharmonically.

Then, thinking about the chord B/Bb, it could be a Cb/Bb triad, leading to a Bb half-diminished seventh chord. But my notes (Bb, Cb, Eb, Gb) don’t correspond to standard diminished chord notes. There’s no Db, so it seems like I might have Bbm7b5. But when comparing, Bb7b9b13 might not fit either.**Analyzing B/Bb chord use**

If the chord symbol is indeed B/Bb, many pop charts treat that as a chromatic approach, often in Bb minor, where it serves as a passing chord. Looking closely at the pattern: Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, then it feels like a gospel walk.

However, Gb over Bb gives notes Gb, Bb, Db, which doesn't match the Bbm7 chords. I realize that Gb/Bb functions as IV over 6 in the key of Db major, adding another layer to this musical interpretation.**Exploring chord progressions in Db major**

In the context of Db major, I realize Bbm is not the iii minor, as F minor holds that spot instead. Instead, Bbm is the vi minor. So in Db major, the scale offers: I (Db), ii (Ebm), iii (Fm), IV (Gb), V (Ab), vi (Bbm), and vii° (C dim). 

I see a possible progression emerging: vi vi IV/6. This suggests Gb/Bb serves as IV with a 6th in the bass, and this aligns nicely throughout the progression back to Abm6. It's interesting to see where each chord fits!**Analyzing key and mode**

When people ask about the "key and mode," they might inquire if Bb minor is Aeolian or harmonic minor. Since there's no F major chord present, it indicates that it's not harmonic minor. 

The inclusion of Cb in Abm6 suggests the tone is borrowed from Phrygian, while the absence of A natural confirms that it's not harmonic. So it appears to be Bb minor in the Aeolian mode with a flat 2 borrow. The final answer is Bb minor (Aeolian).

Bb minor (Aeolian).

Notes:
- Bbm is the clear tonic.
- Gb/Bb = VI in first inversion; Db/Ab = III in second inversion.
- B/Bb is enharmonic to Cb/Bb (bII over 1), a Neapolitan color.
- No raised leading tone or V major, so it’s not harmonic/melodic minor; ending Abm6 is a borrowed color resolving to i.
