**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507 Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, let me try to figure out the key and mode for this chord progression. The chords given are: Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, B/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6, Bbm.

First, I need to understand what each chord is. Let's break them down. The notation is a bit confusing with slashes, so I should figure out what the slash chords mean. For example, Gb/Bb. The chord before the slash is the main chord, and after the slash is the bass note. So Gb/Bb would be a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. Wait, but Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So if the bass note is Bb, which is already the third of the Gb major chord, that would make it a first inversion chord. So Gb/Bb is Gb major in first inversion.

Similarly, Db/Ab is Db major with Ab in the bass. Db major is Db, F, Ab. So Ab is the fifth, so Db/Ab is Db major in second inversion.

B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass? Wait, B major is B, D#, F#. But Bb is not part of B major. Wait, that might be a typo. Wait, maybe it's Bb? Let me check again. The original progression has B/Bb. So the chord is B major, and the bass note is Bb. But B major and Bb don't belong together. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be Bb/Bb? But the user wrote B/Bb. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a B diminished chord or something else? Wait, B/Bb could be a misspelling, perhaps it's Bb/Bb which is just Bb major, but written as B/Bb? Wait, maybe the user meant Bb, but wrote B by mistake. Wait, let's see. Let's list out all the chords with their notes.

Starting with Bbm. Bb minor is Bb, Db, Fb (which is E). Wait, no: minor chord is root, minor third, fifth. So Bb minor is Bb, Db, F. Because minor third from Bb is Db (since Bb to C is major second, C to Db is minor second, so Bb to Db is minor third). Then the fifth is F (Bb to F is perfect fifth). So Bbm: Bb, Db, F.

Gb/Bb: Gb major chord (Gb, Bb, Db) with Bb in the bass. So the notes are Bb, Gb, Db. Wait, but the chord is still Gb major, just inverted.

Db/Ab: Db major (Db, F, Ab) with Ab in the bass, so Ab, Db, F.

B/Bb: B major (B, D#, F#) with Bb in the bass. But Bb is not in B major. This seems problematic. Maybe it's a typo and should be Bb/Bb, meaning Bb major with Bb in the bass, which is just Bb major. Or perhaps it's a B diminished chord? B diminished is B, D, F. But with Bb in the bass? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Bb chord with an added note, but written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be Db/Bb? Wait, but the user wrote B/Bb. Let me check the original sequence again: ...Db/Ab, B/Bb... Hmm. Maybe B/Bb is a B major chord over Bb bass, but that creates a dissonance. Alternatively, maybe it's a miswrite for Ab/Bb? Not sure. Let's hold that thought and proceed.

Abm6: Ab minor 6th chord. Ab minor is Ab, Cb (B), Eb. Then add the 6th, which is F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

Now, to find the key, we need to see which key these chords naturally belong to. Let's list all the roots of the chords: Bbm, Gb, Db, B (problematic), Abm6.

Wait, the roots here are Bb, Gb, Db, B (if it's B major), Ab. But B major is a very sharp key, which doesn't fit with the flats we're seeing in other chords. So perhaps B/Bb is a typo. Maybe it's Ab/Bb? Wait, no, the user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, could it be a Bb chord? If it's Bb, then Bb/Bb is Bb major. Let me check common keys.

Looking at the chords: Bbm, Gb, Db, Abm6. Let's see the key of Bb minor. Natural minor key of Bb minor has the notes Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So the diatonic chords in Bb natural minor would be:

i: Bbm

ii°: C dim

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

Wait, but in the progression, we have Gb major (which would be the VI chord in Bb minor), Db major (III), Ab minor 6th (which is based on VII, but Abm is the VII chord in Bb natural minor? Wait, in natural minor, the VII is major. Wait, no: let's recast.

In natural minor, the scale degrees are all natural. So Bb natural minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

Chords built on each degree:

i: Bb (minor) - Bb, Db, F

ii°: C diminished - C, Eb, Gb

III: Db major - Db, F, Ab

iv: Eb minor - Eb, Gb, Bb

v: F minor - F, Ab, C

VI: Gb major - Gb, Bb, Db

VII: Ab major - Ab, C, Eb

Wait, but in the progression, after Db/Ab (which is Db major), we have B/Bb. If B/Bb is supposed to be Ab major (VII), then that fits. But the user wrote B/Bb. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be Ab/Bb? Wait, but Ab/Bb would be Ab major with Bb in the bass, which is a second inversion Ab chord. However, in the list it's written as B/Bb, which is confusing.

Wait, let's look at the chord B/Bb again. If the chord is B major (B, D#, F#) over Bb bass, that would create a very dissonant sound, maybe a Bb7 chord with a #9? But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake and should be Ab/Bb. Because Ab major chord with Bb in the bass would be Ab major second inversion (Ab, C, Eb with Bb as bass? Wait, no, Bb isn't in Ab major. Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. So Bb isn't part of it. Hmm.

Wait another thought: maybe the "B" here is actually "Bb". In some notations, especially in European systems, B is Bb and H is B natural. But the user is using Bb here already, so probably not. Wait, the chord is written as B/Bb. If it's Bb/Bb, that's just Bb major. But the user wrote B/Bb. Maybe it's a typo for Bb/Bb. Let's assume that for a moment. So Db/Ab followed by Bb/Bb. Then the progression would make more sense in Bb minor.

Wait, let's check:

Bbm, Gb, Db, Bb. In Bb natural minor, the chords would be i, VI, III, i (since VII is Ab major, but here it's Bb). Wait, but Bb would be the i chord. Hmm.

Wait, the sequence is: ... Db/Ab, B/Bb, Bbm...

If B/Bb is Bb major (assuming typo), then the chords are Db major, Bb major, Bbm. But Bb major is not in Bb natural minor; in natural minor, Bb is minor. So Bb major would be the VII chord in Cb major, but that's a very theoretical key.

Alternatively, maybe it's Bb harmonic minor. Bb harmonic minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb. So raised 7th (A instead of Ab). Then the diatonic chords would have Ab augmented or something? Wait, chord on VII would be Ab augmented? Not sure. Alternatively, the V chord would be F major (since 7th is A natural). Wait, harmonic minor changes the v chord to major and the VII chord to diminished.

Wait, maybe the key is Ab major? Let's see. Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Diatonic chords:

I: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: G dim

But in the progression, we have Bbm, which would be ii in Ab major. But the progression starts with Bbm, which is more likely to be the tonic in a minor key.

Another approach: list all the notes present in the chords.

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db (since it's Gb major in first inversion)

Db/Ab: Db, F, Ab

B/Bb (assuming B is a typo and it's Ab major?): Ab, C, Eb

Wait, but if B/Bb is actually Ab major, then notes are Ab, C, Eb. But B/Bb is confusing. Alternatively, if B/Bb is Bb7, which is Bb, D, F, Ab. But written as B/Bb? Not sure.

Wait, let's look at Abm6. Abm6 is Ab, Cb (B), Eb, F. So notes Ab, B, Eb, F.

Wait, Abm6 contains a B natural, which is a major sixth above Ab (Ab to F is major sixth? Wait, Ab to F is a major sixth interval (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F — that's six notes, yes). Wait, minor sixth would be Fb, but Abm6 is Ab minor with a major sixth added. So Ab minor triad is Ab, Cb, Eb. Then major sixth is F. So Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. So notes: Ab, B (Cb is B), Eb, F.

So in Abm6, we have B natural. That suggests a raised sixth scale degree if we're in a minor key. For example, in Bb harmonic minor, the 7th is raised to A natural, but the 6th remains Gb. Wait, no: Bb harmonic minor has A natural (raised 7th), but the 6th is still Gb. However, Abm6 has B natural, which would be a major sixth above Ab. Wait, in Bb minor, the sixth note is Gb (in natural minor). If the sixth is raised to G natural, that would be Bb melodic minor ascending. Bb melodic minor ascending: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. So raised 6th and 7th. Then the sixth degree is G, so chord built on Ab (which is the VII degree) would be Ab major? Wait, no.

Wait, let's try Bb melodic minor (ascending). Scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

Chords:

i: Bb min

ii: C min

III+: Db augmented

IV: Eb maj

V: F maj

vi°: G dim

vii°: A dim

Wait, but Ab isn't in this scale. Wait, Ab would be the flattened seventh? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but Abm6 has an Ab root, so maybe the key is Ab minor. Let's check Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. So equivalent to G# minor, but usually written as Ab minor.

Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb.

Chords in Ab natural minor:

i: Abm

ii°: Bb dim

III: Cb (B) major

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (E) major

VII: Gb major

But in this progression, we have Bbm, which would be the ii° chord in Ab minor, but it's a minor chord, not diminished. Wait, no, in natural minor, the ii chord is diminished. So Bbm would not be diatonic to Ab minor. Unless it's a different mode.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Gb major. Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Diatonic chords:

I: Gb

ii: Abm

iii: Bbm

IV: Cb (B)

V: Db

vi: Ebm

vii°: F dim

So Bbm would be the iii chord in Gb major. But the progression starts with Bbm, so unlikely to be iii chord.

Wait, but the progression has a lot of Bbm, Gb, Db. In Gb major, Gb is I, Bbm is iii, Db is V. So a I-iii-V progression? Not common.

Alternatively, Dorian mode. Let's consider Bb Dorian. Bb Dorian has the notes Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So differs from natural minor by having a major sixth (G natural instead of Gb). So chords in Bb Dorian:

i: Bbm

ii: Cm

III: Db

IV: Eb

v: Fm

VI: Gb

vii°: Ab dim

So in Bb Dorian, the IV chord is Eb major, but in our progression, we have Abm6. Hmm. Wait, but Abm6 contains Ab, B (Cb), Eb, F. Wait, in Bb Dorian, Ab is the flatted seventh, so the VII chord would be Ab major (Ab, C, Eb). But Abm6 is minor with a major sixth, which suggests a different construction.

Wait, looking at the Abm6 chord: Ab, Cb, Eb, F. Which is Ab minor triad plus F. In the key of Bb minor (natural), the Ab would be the minor seventh, so the VII chord is Ab major. But Abm6 is a minor chord, so not directly diatonic. Unless it's a borrowed chord.

Alternatively, the presence of both Gb major and Db major suggests that Gb and Db are IV and I in Db major. Let's see: Db major scale, chords would be Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Ab, Bbm, C dim. So Bbm would be vi in Db major. But the progression starts with Bbm, which would be unusual for a vi chord to be tonic.

Wait, but the progression has two Bbm chords followed by two Gb/Bb (which is Gb major), then Bbm again, then Db/Ab (Db major), then B/Bb..., etc. So Bbm - Gb - Bbm - Db - ... So Bbm to Gb is i - III in minor (if Bb minor). Wait, in natural minor, III is major. So Bb minor key: i = Bbm, III = Db major. Wait, but Gb major is VI. Wait, Bb natural minor: VI is Gb major. So progression i - VI - i - III ... That is a common progression in minor keys (e.g., i - VI - III - VII). So maybe Bb natural minor.

Let's list the progression with that in mind:

Bbm (i), Bbm (i), Gb/Bb (VI), Gb/Bb (VI), Bbm (i), Bbm (i), Db/Ab (III), B/Bb (problem), Bbm (i), etc.

Assuming B/Bb is a typo for Ab (VII), then Db (III), Ab (VII), i.

That would make sense for a progression i - VI - i - III - VII - i, which is a common progression in minor keys.

Given that Abm6 is the last but one chord before returning to Bbm. Abm6: if Ab is the VII chord, in natural minor it should be Ab major (VII). But here it's Ab minor 6th. That suggests maybe harmonic minor? Wait, in Bb harmonic minor, the Ab would be raised to A natural, so the VII chord would be Ab augmented or something else? Wait, Bb harmonic minor scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb. So the seventh degree is A, making the Ab note not present. The VII chord would actually be on A, but A is the leading tone.

Wait, in Bb harmonic minor, the diatonic chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: C dim

III+: Db aug

iv: Ebm

V: F major (due to raised 7th A)

VI: Gb maj

vii°: A dim

But Ab doesn't appear here. So Abm6 must be borrowed from another mode.

Alternatively, the Abm6 could be a iv chord in Bb Phrygian? Bb Phrygian: Bb, Cb (A#), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Wait, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the Abm6 has an F natural. In Bb natural minor, the sixth is Gb, but the F is the fifth. However, Abm6 adds F as the sixth. Wait, minor 6th chord is built as minor triad plus major sixth. So Abm6 is Ab-Cb-Eb-F. The F is the major sixth above Ab. In terms of the key, if we are in Bb minor, the Ab note is the minor seventh scale degree. Having an Abm6 chord here might indicate that we're using the subtonic (minor VII) chord, but as minor instead of major. In natural minor, the VII is major, so Ab major. But here it's Ab minor, suggesting maybe Dorian mode? Wait, in Bb Dorian, the VII chord is Ab major as well. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a modal mixture. Or perhaps the key is Ab minor. Let's check Ab minor.

Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Enharmonically: G# minor, but we'll stick with Ab.

Chords in Ab natural minor:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbm dim

III: Cb (B) major

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (E) major

VII: Gb major

But in our progression, Bbm is prominent. If Bbm is ii° in Ab minor, it should be diminished, but it's a minor chord, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless it's Ab Dorian? Ab Dorian: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb. So raised sixth (F natural instead of Fb). Then:

i: Abm

ii: Bbm

III: Cb

IV: Db

v: Ebm

VI: F maj

vii°: Gb dim

But in this case, Bbm would be the ii chord. But the progression starts with Bbm as the tonic, so probably not.

Wait, going back. The repeated use of Bbm as the anchor chord suggests it's the tonic. So key of Bb minor. Now, which flavor of minor? Natural, harmonic, or melodic.

The chords present: Bbm (i), Gb (VI), Db (III), Ab (VII but minor 6th).

In natural minor: VI and VII are major. So Gb major and Ab major.

In harmonic minor: the VII becomes major because of the raised seventh (but in Bb harmonic minor, the seventh is A natural, so the scale has A instead of Ab, thus the Ab note isn't there; the seventh chord would be on A).

Wait, this is confusing. Let's tabulate:

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Chords: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

So III is Db major, VI is Gb major, VII is Ab major.

Our progression has Bbm (i), Gb (VI), Db (III), and then instead of Ab major (VII), we have B/Bb which we're unsure about, then later Abm6.

Wait, if the progression uses Abm6 instead of Ab major, that suggests it's not purely natural minor. Maybe a mode like Dorian, which has a major sixth. Bb Dorian: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab.

In Bb Dorian:

i: Bbm

ii: Cm

III: Db

IV: Eb

v: Fm

VI: Gb

vii°: Ab dim

Wait, but VII chord is Ab diminished? No, in Dorian, the seventh degree chord is diminished? Wait, scale degrees for chords: in Dorian mode, the chords are i, ii, III, IV, v, vi°, VII.

Wait, better to build chords:

Bb Dorian: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chord on Bb: Bb, Db, F → Bbm (i)

C: C, Eb, G → Cm (ii)

Db: Db, F, Ab → Db (III)

Eb: Eb, G, Bb → Eb (IV)

F: F, Ab, C → Fm (v)

G: G, Bb, Db → G dim (vi°)

Ab: Ab, C, Eb → Ab (VII)

Ah, there we go. So in Bb Dorian, the VII chord is Ab major. So if our progression has Abm6 instead of Ab major, that's a deviation. However, Abm6 has Ab, Cb (B), Eb, F. The Cb is B natural, which is not in Bb Dorian (which has C natural). So B natural vs C natural.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's consider the Abm6 chord. Notes: Ab, B (Cb), Eb, F.

This has a B natural (Cb), which is a raised fifth of Ab minor (since Ab minor triad is Ab, Cb, Eb). So raised fifth would be C natural, but here it's B natural, which is actually a minor sixth above Ab. Wait, Abm6 is constructed as minor triad plus major sixth: Ab (root), Cb (minor third), Eb (fifth), F (major sixth). So F is the major sixth. So the notes are Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

In terms of scale degrees, if Ab is the tonic, then F is the sixth degree. So in Ab minor, the sixth degree natural is Fb (E), but if it's raised, it becomes F natural. So Ab harmonic minor has a raised seventh (G), but sixth remains Fb. Ab melodic minor ascending has raised sixth (F) and seventh (G).

Ah! So Ab melodic minor ascending scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab.

Thus, the sixth degree is F natural. So in this scale, an Abm6 chord would fit because the sixth is F (major sixth). So Abm6 is diatonic to Ab melodic minor (ascending).

But how does this relate to the overall key of the progression which centers around Bbm?

If the progression has Abm6 as a chord, and also Bbm, Gb, Db, perhaps the key is Bb Phrygian? Let's check.

Bb Phrygian mode: Bb, Cb (A#), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb. So equivalent to Ab major scale starting on Bb.

Notes: Bb, A#, Cb is enharmonic confusion. Better to think in flats: Bb Phrygian is mode of Ab major: sixth mode.

Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Sixth mode (Aeolian): F minor.

Wait, maybe another approach. Modes share the same notes as their parent major scale.

If we consider all the chords: Bbm, Gb, Db, Abm6.

The roots are Bb, Gb, Db, Ab — all roots are a perfect fourth apart: Bb to Eb would be next, but we have Db. Wait, Bb - Eb - Ab - Db - Gb - Cb (B) - ... It's a cycle of fourths.

Bb -- (F) --> Eb -- (C) --> Ab -- (G) --> Db -- (D) --> Gb -- (A) --> Cb.

But our chords are Bb, Gb, Db, Ab. Which are Bb, then down a fifth to Eb? Not sure.

Wait, chord progression in minor keys often use iv and v chords, but here we have III and VI.

Common minor progression: i - VI - III - VII (e.g., in Am: Am - F - C - G)

Which is exactly similar to what we have here if we consider:

i = Bbm

VI = Gb

III = Db

VII = Ab

So progression i - VI - i - III - VII - i

Indeed, the given progression is:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, [B/Bb], Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6, Bbm

Assuming [B/Bb] is a typo for Ab (VII), then it fits the common i - VI - III - VII progression in Bb natural minor.

But the last chord before returning to Bbm is Abm6 instead of Ab major. Hmm. Abm6 vs Ab major.

In natural minor, it should be Ab major (VII). But here it's Ab minor 6th. However, Abm6 contains the same notes as F minor 7th (F, Ab, Cb, Eb). Maybe it's functioning as a iv chord? Not sure.

Wait, Abm6 is Ab, Cb, Eb, F. If we think of Bb as the tonic, Ab is the minor seventh scale degree. In natural minor, Ab is the VII major chord. But Abm6 has Cb (B) instead of C natural. Wait, B natural is not in Bb natural minor. Bb natural minor has C natural? Wait, no:

Bb natural minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Wait, hold on! Earlier I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, intervals for natural minor: whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole.

Starting at Bb:

Bb (root)

Bb + whole = C

C + half = Db

Db + whole = Eb

Eb + whole = F

F + half = Gb

Gb + whole = Ab

Ab + whole = Bb

Yes, so Bb natural minor scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So the sixth note is Gb, seventh is Ab.

Therefore, chord built on Ab (VII) is Ab major: Ab, C, Eb.

But Abm6 is Ab, Cb (B), Eb, F. So the third of the Ab chord is Cb instead of C natural. That would be a minor third, hence Ab minor. But in natural minor, Ab should have a major third (C natural), making it Ab major. So Abm6 is Ab minor with an added sixth (F), which suggests it's not diatonic to Bb natural minor.

However, if we are in Bb harmonic minor, the seventh note is raised to A natural. So scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb.

Then, the Ab note isn't in the scale; the seventh is A natural. So Abm6 still doesn't fit.

Bb melodic minor ascending: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

Then, Ab isn't in the scale either. Descending is natural minor.

Alternatively, could the key be Ab harmonic minor? Let's see.

Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G, Ab.

Chords:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbm dim

III+: Cb aug

iv: Dbm

V: Eb (major due to G natural)

VI: Fb (E) dim

VII: G maj (as G-A#/Bb)

But this has Bbm, which is ii°, but in our progression Bbm is a minor chord, not diminished. So Bbm as ii should be diminished in Ab harmonic minor, but it's not. So doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: Maybe it's Dorian mode. Bb Dorian, which has a major sixth.

Bb Dorian: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Note that sixth is G natural, not Gb.

So diatonic chords:

i: Bbm

II: Cm

III: Db

IV: Eb

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

Yes! So the VII chord is Ab major. Now, Abm6 is different; it's Ab minor with F added. But in Bb Dorian, Ab major would be the VII chord (Ab, C, Eb). The Abm6 has Cb instead of C natural, which is not in Bb Dorian. However, if we consider a modal interchange, borrowing the iv chord from the natural minor (which would be Ebm), not sure.

Wait, but the presence of G natural (from Bb Dorian's sixth degree) would mean that the F in Abm6 is diatonic? Wait, Abm6 has F natural as the sixth. In Bb Dorian, F is the fifth scale degree, so F natural is present.

Wait, Abm6 notes: Ab, Cb, Eb, F.

If in Bb Dorian, Ab is the VII, and the chord would be Ab major (Ab, C, Eb). To make it minor, we need to lower the third to Cb, which is not in the Dorian mode. So Abm6 would be a borrowed chord, perhaps from Bb Aeolian (natural minor).

Bb natural minor has Ab major as VII, Bb Dorian has Ab major as VII as well. Wait:

Wait, no: In Bb natural minor, the VII chord is Ab major (Ab, C, Eb). In Bb Dorian, since Dorian has a major sixth (G natural), the seventh degree Ab still forms a major chord because C natural is still the third (scale degree for Ab chord: Ab, Bb, C... wait no).

Wait, scale degrees in Bb Dorian:

Pitch: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab

So for chord on Ab (VII):

Ab is the note, next scale degrees: Ab, Bb, C. Wait, no: chord is Ab, C, Eb.

Because the Ab chord: Ab (root), C (major third), Eb (fifth). But in Dorian mode, does C natural exist?

Yes, in Bb Dorian, the notes include C natural (second degree). So Ab major chord (VII) is diatonic: Ab, C, Eb.

Therefore, Abm6 with a minor third (Cb) is not diatonic. Unless...

Wait, the Abm6 chord has Cb which is B natural. So B natural is not in Bb Dorian (which has Bb, C, D etc.). So B natural would be a raised fifth.

This is perplexing. Maybe the key is Gb major, but the tonic is Bbm? No, Gb major's vi chord is Ebm.

Wait, let's list all the chord roots:

Bbm, Gb, Db, Abm6. The roots are all major keys a minor third apart? Not sure.

Wait, another method: look for the most common chords and see relative majors/minors.

Bbm's relative major is Db major (Bbm i = Db III). Gb's relative minor is Ebm. Not sure.

But the progression centers on Bbm, with Gb and Db as prominent chords. In the key of Bb minor, Gb is VI and Db is III. As mentioned before, i - VI - III is a common minor progression.

If we accept that Abm6 is a variation of the VII chord (normally Ab major), perhaps in the progression it's using a different mode where the VII chord is minor. When is the VII chord minor in a minor key?

In natural minor, VII is major. In harmonic minor, VII is diminished (if the seventh is raised). Wait:

Bb harmonic minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

Chord on Ab: does Ab exist? No, the seventh note is A, so scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. So no Ab, thus chord on Ab wouldn't be diatonic.

Bb melodic minor ascending: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A. Still no Ab.

Bb melodic minor descending is natural minor, so Ab appears.

This is tricky. Maybe the Abm6 is actually functioning as a iv chord in Bb minor? But iv in Bb minor is Ebm.

Wait, Abm6 root is Ab. Transposed to Bb minor, Ab is the minor seventh degree. So chord built on the minor seventh is usually major in natural minor.

But here it's minor sixth chord. However, the "6" in Abm6 refers to the sixth added, not the chord being in first inversion. Abm6 is a four-note chord: minor triad plus major sixth interval from the root.

Given that the progression ends with Abm6 going back to Bbm, it might be using Abm as a subtonic chord. But why the sixth?

Alternatively, maybe the key is Ab minor, and Bbm is a IV chord or something. But progression starts on Bbm.

Wait, consider the following: the chords Bbm, Gb, Db are all related by the circle of fifths. Bbm to Db is minor third up, Db to Gb is minor third up. This is characteristic of the diminished scale, but probably not relevant here.

Wait, common minor key progressions: The progression i - VI - III - VII is very common (e.g., "Don't Stop Believin'"). In Bb minor, that would be Bbm - Gb - Db - Ab.

Our progression matches this except for the Abm6 instead of Ab major, and that interloper B/Bb.

Assuming B/Bb is meant to be Ab (VII), then it fits perfectly: Bbm - Gb - Bbm - Db - Ab - Bbm... etc.

But the user wrote "Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm", so after Db/Ab comes B/Bb. If B/Bb is Ab major, but written incorrectly as B/Bb. Maybe a misprint where "Ab" was written as "B" due to similar shape in handwriting or typo. For example, in some fonts, Ab and B might look similar? Unlikely, but possible.

Given that all other chords fit perfectly into Bb natural minor (i, VI, III, VII), I think it's safe to assume that "B/Bb" is a typo for "Ab" or "Ab/Bb" (which would be Ab major second inversion). Ab/Bb is Ab chord with Bb in bass, but Bb isn't in Ab major. Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. So Bb isn't part of it; thus Ab/Bb would be non-diatonic.

Alternatively, maybe "B/Bb" is supposed to be "Bb", so Bb major. But in Bb natural minor, Bb major is the III+ chord? No, in Bb minor, III is Db major.

Wait, another thought: if "B/Bb" is actually "F/Bb", which would make sense as the V chord in Bb minor. Because V in natural minor is minor, but in harmonic minor it's major. If we use F major as V, that would fit harmonic minor.

Let's see: progression would be ... Db/Ab, F/Bb, Bbm...

F major with Bb bass is second inversion F chord. F major is V in Bb harmonic minor.

Then the progression has Bbm (i), Gb (VI), Db (III), F (V) — but the sequence is i - VI - i - III - V - i, which is plausible.

But where does Abm6 fit in? Before last chord is Abm6.

Wait, user wrote: ...Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm.

So after returning to Bbm a couple times, it goes to Abm6 then Bbm.

If Abm6 is functioning as a VII chord, even if minor, and in the context of Bb minor, with possible melodic minor influence (raised sixth), let's see:

Bb melodic minor ascending has G natural instead of Gb. So scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A.

Chord on Ab: Ab, C, Eb which is Ab major — but wait, Ab isn't in the scale. The seventh note is A, so scale degrees don't include Ab. Hmm.

Wait, descending melodic minor is natural minor, which has Ab. But usually melodic minor ascending and descending differ.

This is getting too bogged down. Given the prominent chords are Bbm, Gb, Db, and the resolution to Abm6 before Bbm, and assuming the "B/Bb" is an error, the most straightforward answer is Bb natural minor.

Even though Abm6 is not strictly diatonic (should be Ab major), sometimes in pop music the VII chord is minor due to mixture or other influences. Alternatively, Abm6 could be analyzed as a borrowed chord from Dorian mode (which has a minor iv chord), but that's stretching.

Wait, another angle: Abm6 can be seen as the iv chord in Bb minor if we consider F minor.

Wait, Bb minor, iv chord is Ebm. Not related.

Hold on: Abm6 contains F natural, which is the fifth of Bb minor. Abm6: Ab, Cb, Eb, F. If we voice this as F - Ab - Cb - Eb, it's F minor 7th (F, Ab, Cb, Eb). So Abm6 is enharmonically equivalent to Fm7. Maybe it's functioning as a v chord? Bb minor's v chord is Fm. Yes!

In Bb natural minor, the v chord is F minor. So an Fm7 chord would fit. But the chord is written as Abm6. Depending on voicing, chords can be respelled. Abm6 (Ab, Cb, Eb, F) is the same as Fm7 (F, Ab, Cb, Eb). Yes! So it's an Fm7 chord in first inversion or something else. But named as Abm6.

This is a crucial insight. So Abm6 is enharmonically equivalent to Fm7. The fifth chord in Bb natural minor is Fm. Therefore, this chord is actually the v chord (Fm), but voiced with Ab as the root, making it Abm6.

How does that fit into the progression?

Original progression after B/Bb is Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb,..., then:

Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, [B/Bb], Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6 (Fm7), Bbm.

Wait, let's map it:

- Up to Db/Ab: This is Db major (III)

- Next chord B/Bb (problem)

- Then two Bbms

- Then Gb/Bb (VI)

- Two Bbms

- Then Abm6 (Fm7 as v), leading to Bbm

Ah! So if the Abm6 is actually the v chord (Fm7), then the progression ends with v - i, which is a perfect cadence. But in natural minor, v is minor, so Fm - Bbm is a minor v-i cadence.

So reinterpreting Abm6 as Fm7 (same notes), the progression makes sense: ... Fm7 (v) → Bbm (i)

That's a standard cadence.

Similarly, the chord before the final Abm6/Fm7: it's Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb,... wait, the order is:

... Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Abm6 Bbm

So two Bbms, two Gb/Bbs (VI), two Bbms, then Abm6 (v), then Bbm (i).

Wait, but then where does Db/Ab fit in? Earlier we have:

Bbm Bbm Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbm Bbm Db/Ab B/Bb Bbm...

Assuming Db/Ab is Db major (III), then:

i, i, VI, VI, i, i, III, ?, i, i, VI, VI, i, i, v, i

If "B/Bb" is a mistake, and the following chords make sense without it, or if it's another chord.

But if Abm6 = Fm7 = v, then the progression uses i - VI - i - III, and later i - VI - i - v - i.

This is plausible. Common progressions in minor keys often use v (minor fifth) for cadences, though in harmonic minor it's major (V).

Given that the final cadence uses Abm6 which functions as v-i, this suggests the mode is natural minor, since v is minor. If it were harmonic minor, we'd expect V major (F major) leading to i.

Therefore, the key is Bb natural minor.

Let's verify all chords:

- Bbm = i

- Gb = VI

- Db = III

- Abm6 = Fm7 = v (enharmonically equivalent)

All of these chords exist in Bb natural minor:

i: Bbm

III: Db

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab (but we're using v instead)

Wait, yes, in natural minor:

i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII

So III (Db), v (Fm), VI (Gb) are all present.

The Db/Ab is Db major (III) with Ab in bass (second inversion), which is fine.

Abm6 as Fm7 is the v chord, which explains its presence.

The B/Bb chord—if we consider it might be F major (V), but written incorrectly. If "B/Bb" is supposed to be "F/Bb", which is F major second inversion (F, Ab, C with Bb bass? No, F major is F, A, C. So F/Bb would be non-diatonic. Wait, no, Bb isn't in F major.

Alternatively, if "B/Bb" is supposed to be "Bb", but Bb major isn't diatonic to Bb minor.

Given the Abm6 makes sense as v, and assuming "B/Bb" might be a typo for F (or Fm), but without more info, the predominant chords fit Bb natural minor.

Therefore, the key is Bb minor, natural minor mode.

The chord progression provided can be analyzed as follows to determine its key and mode:

---

### **Chord Breakdown**
- **Bbm**: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F) — the tonic chord.
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb major in first inversion (Bb, Gb, Db) — VI in Bb natural minor.
- **Db/Ab**: Db major in second inversion (Ab, Db, F) — III in Bb natural minor.
- **Abm6**: Ab minor 6th (Ab, Cb, Eb, F) — enharmonically equivalent to **Fm7** (F, Ab, Cb, Eb), functioning as the **v chord** (Fm) in Bb natural minor.
- **B/Bb**: Likely a **typo** for **F/Bb** (F major with Bb bass) or **Ab**, which would align with the progression. Assuming this is **Fm7** (v) or **Ab major** (VII), but the **Abm6** (v) at the end confirms the use of natural minor.

---

### **Key and Mode Analysis**
1. **Tonic Identification**:  
   The progression centers around **Bbm**, which acts as the **tonic chord (i)**. This strongly suggests the key is **Bb minor**.

2. **Chord Relationships in Bb Natural Minor**:  
   The **Bb natural minor scale** is:  
   **Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab**.  
   Diatonic chords in this scale are:  
   - **i**: Bbm  
   - **ii°**: C diminished  
   - **III**: Db major  
   - **iv**: Ebm  
   - **v**: Fm  
   - **VI**: Gb major  
   - **VII**: Ab major  

   The progression uses:  
   - **Bbm (i)**, **Gb (VI)**, **Db (III)**, and **Fm7 (v)** (enharmonically written as **Abm6**).  
   These chords all align with **Bb natural minor**.

3. **Resolution and Cadence**:  
   The progression ends with **Abm6 → Bbm**, which functions as **v → i** (Fm7 → Bbm). This is a **minor perfect cadence**, characteristic of **natural minor** (where **v** is minor).  
   In **harmonic minor**, the **v chord** would be **major (F major)**, but here **Fm7** (v) is used, confirming the use of **natural minor**.

4. **Resolving Ambiguities**:  
   - **Abm6** is enharmonically equivalent to **Fm7**, the **v chord** in Bb natural minor. This explains its presence in the progression.  
   - The **B/Bb** chord is likely a typo or misnotation. If interpreted as **F/Bb** (F major second inversion) or omitted, the progression remains coherent in **Bb natural minor**.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **Bb minor**  
- **Mode**: **Natural minor**  

This progression follows a common natural minor pattern:  
**i – VI – i – III – v – i**, with **Abm6** functioning as **v (Fm7)** before resolving to the tonic (Bbm). The consistent use of minor v (Fm) and absence of a raised 7th (characteristic of harmonic minor) confirms **natural minor** as the mode.

### **Final Answer**
- **Key**: **Bb minor**  
- **Mode**: **Natural minor**
