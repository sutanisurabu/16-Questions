Based on the chords provided, here is the analysis to determine the key and mode:

**Chords:** Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab, B/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Abm6, Bbm

**1. Identify the Tonic and Chord Tonalities:**

* **Tonic/Home Chord:** The music consistently starts and ends on **Bbm** (B-flat minor). This strongly suggests the key is centred around B-flat minor.
* **Basic Chords Used:**
    * **Bbm** (i - B-flat minor)
    * **Gb** (VI - G-flat major, implied by Gb/Bb)
    * **Db** (v - D-flat major, implied by Db/Ab)
    * **B** (A very unusual chord for the key of B-flat minor)
    * **Abm6** (Ab minor triad with an added F note)

**2. Analyze Chord Functions in B-flat Minor:**

The most likely key is **B-flat minor (Bbm)**. Let's analyze the chords based on the B-flat minor scale:

| Chord | Function in B-flat Minor | Notes in Chord | B-flat Natural Minor Scale Notes (Aeolian) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Bbm** | **i** (Tonic) | Bb, Db, F | Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab |
| **Gb** | **VI** (Submediant) | Gb, Bb, Db | Matches |
| **Db** | **III** (Mediant) | Db, F, Ab | Matches (often used as III in minor) |
| **Abm6** | **vii $\flat$** | Ab, Cb (B), Eb, F | This chord is borrowed. If we consider Abm (vii $\flat$), and add the F. |

**3. Address the Difficult Chord (B major) and Borrowed Chords:**

* **The B Chord:** A B major chord (B, D#, F#) is highly chromatic in the key of B-flat minor (Bb, Db, F, Gb, Ab). This chord suggests a brief moment of modal mixture or a secondary function that is highly altered. Its presence indicates that the mode is not strictly the Aeolian scale.
* **Gb/Bb and Db/Ab:** The inversions (especially Gb/Bb) emphasize the bass line movement while maintaining the strong anchor of the tonic note (Bb).

**4. Determine the Mode:**

Since the piece is centred around B-flat minor, we need to compare the overall harmonic content against the different minor modes:

* **B-flat Natural Minor (Aeolian):** Uses Gb and Ab. **Gb** (VI) and **Db** (III) fit perfectly.
* **B-flat Harmonic Minor:** Uses Gb and **A natural** (leading tone). This mode is often used to create the dominant chord (V - F major). The lack of a major dominant chord (F major or F7) strongly argues against Harmonic minor. The usage of **Db** (III) instead of the expected predominant chord (iv - Eb minor) is also less common in classical harmonic minor.
* **B-flat Melodic Minor (Ascending):** Uses G natural and A natural. Does not fit the **Gb** major (VI) chord.

**Conclusion on Mode:**

The primary use of the **Bbm (i)**, **Gb (VI)**, and **Db (III)** chords, combined with the absence of a raised leading tone or a major dominant (V), points strongly toward the **Aeolian mode (Natural Minor Scale)**.

The unusual **B major** chord is likely a brief chromatic embellishment or modulation that does not define the overall modal character.

### Final Determination:

* **Key:** **B-flat Minor** (Bbm)
* **Mode:** **Aeolian** (or Natural Minor)
