Let’s analyze the chord progression you provided:

**Chord Sequence:**
Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Db/Ab – B/Bb –  
Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Abm6 – Bbm

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center
The progression keeps returning to **Bbm**, suggesting **B♭ minor** as the tonal center.

---

### Step 2: List all chords involved (simplify inversions)
- **Bbm** → B♭ minor (i in B♭ minor)
- **Gb/Bb** → G♭ major with B♭ in the bass → same as **Gb major** (VI in B♭ minor)
- **Db/Ab** → D♭ major with A♭ in the bass → **Db major** (III in B♭ minor)
- **B/Bb** → B major with B♭ in the bass → this is **enharmonic to C♭ major**, but more likely a **chromatic mediant or altered chord**. B major is **not diatonic** to B♭ minor. However, **B major = V of VI** (V/VI), since G♭ is VI, and the V of G♭ is D♭... wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, **B major = augmented sixth chord?** Let's hold that thought.
- **Abm6** → A♭ minor with added 6th (F). In B♭ minor, A♭ is **VII**, so Abm is **♭VII**, and Abm6 adds a 6th (F). This is a common modal mixture or borrowed chord.

But let's double-check **B/Bb**. B major spelled out: B–D♯–F♯. With B♭ in the bass, that creates a highly dissonant cluster (B and B♭ together). This may be a **tritone substitution** or **chromatic passing chord**.

Alternatively, is it possible that **B/Bb** is a typo or misnotation? Because **B major over B♭ bass** is extremely unusual. Perhaps it’s meant to be **B diminished** or **B°**, or even **B♭7**? But assuming notation is intentional...

Another interpretation: **B/Bb** might actually be **B7♯9 or altered dominant**, but again, that’s speculative.

However, note that **B = C♭**, and **C♭ major = enharmonic to B major**, and **C♭ is the ♭II** in B♭ minor. ♭II is a Neapolitan chord! But Neapolitan in minor is usually **major triad on ♭II**, which in B♭ minor would be **C♭ major** (C♭–E♭–G♭) = **B major** (enharmonically). So **B major = ♭II (Neapolitan)** in B♭ minor!

Yes! So:

- **B major = ♭II (N)** in B♭ minor → used in first inversion often (N6), but here it’s over B♭ (the tonic), which is unusual but possible as a color chord or passing voicing.

So we can reinterpret **B/Bb** as the **Neapolitan chord (♭II)** with a tonic pedal in the bass.

### Step 3: Map chords to B♭ natural minor (Aeolian)
B♭ natural minor scale: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭

Diatonic chords:
- i: Bbm
- ♭III: D♭ major → present as **Db/Ab**
- iv: E♭m (not present)
- v: Fm (not present)
- ♭VI: G♭ major → present as **Gb/Bb**
- ♭VII: A♭ major → but we have **Abm6**, which is **A♭ minor**, not major.

Wait: **Abm6** = A♭–C♭–E♭–F  
→ This is **A♭ minor (♭VII minor)**, which is **not diatonic** to B♭ natural minor (where ♭VII is A♭ **major**).

But **A♭ minor** is the **iv chord in E♭ minor**, or it could be a **modal mixture** from B♭ Phrygian or other modes.

Alternatively, **Abm6** may function as a **iiø7** of G♭ (VI), but not quite.

However, **Abm6** contains **C♭ (enharmonic to B)** and **F**, which both appear in the B major chord as well—possible voice-leading connection.

---

### Step 4: Consider mode
The consistent use of:
- i (Bbm)
- ♭VI (Gb)
- ♭III (Db)
- ♭II (B = C♭)

...is characteristic of **minor key (tonic Bbm)** with **modal mixture** and **chromaticism**, common in jazz, film music, or Romantic harmony.

The presence of **♭VI (Gb)** and **♭III (Db)** supports **B♭ natural minor (Aeolian)** as the base.

However, the **Neapolitan (♭II)** and **Abm6 (♭VII minor)** suggest **borrowing from other modes or chromatic mediant usage**, but **not necessarily a shift in mode**.

Also note: no leading tone (A♮) is used—no dominant (F or F7) appears, which suggests **modal minor** (Aeolian) rather than harmonic or melodic minor.

So: **Key = B♭ minor**, **Mode = Aeolian (natural minor)** with chromatic alterations (Neapolitan, modal mixture).

---

### Final Answer:
- **Key:** B♭ minor  
- **Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor), with chromatic chords (Neapolitan ♭II, modal mixture such as Abm6)

The absence of a dominant (V) chord and use of ♭VI, ♭III, and ♭II are hallmarks of modal minor (Aeolian) harmony with chromatic color.
