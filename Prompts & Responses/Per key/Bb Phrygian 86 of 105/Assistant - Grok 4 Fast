### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Determined Key: B♭ minor
- **Reasoning**: 
  - The progression strongly revolves around B♭m as the tonal center—it opens, repeats, and resolves back to B♭m multiple times, giving it a clear role as the tonic (i chord).
  - Most chords derive from or align closely with the B♭ minor scale (natural minor: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭).
    - B♭m = i (B♭ D♭ F)
    - G♭/B♭ = VI with B♭ bass (G♭ B♭ D♭; G♭ = VI in B♭ minor)
    - D♭/A♭ = III with A♭ bass (D♭ F A♭; D♭ = III in B♭ minor)
  - The overall structure feels unresolved and cyclical, typical of minor keys, with a dark, introspective quality.
- Slash chords (e.g., G♭/B♭, D♭/A♭) emphasize bass movement that reinforces the B♭ root or supports the minor tonic (e.g., B♭ bass under G♭ creates a i6/4-like tension resolving back to i).
- The B major chord (B D♯ F♯, or enharmonically B E♭ G♭ / B♭ bass) acts as a chromatic passing chord or secondary dominant (possibly V/iii or borrowed for color), adding tension before returning to B♭m.
- A♭m6 (A♭ B E♭ F) functions as a vii chord (substitute for leading-tone resolution to i), though it borrows the B natural (C♭) from outside the strict scale—common in minor key practice for color without changing the key center.

#### Determined Mode: Aeolian (Natural Minor)
- **Reasoning**:
  - The progression uses the natural minor scale without consistent raising of the 7th degree (A♭ remains natural, as seen in D♭ and A♭-related chords; no prominent A natural for harmonic minor flavor).
  - A♭m6 emphasizes the flattened 7th (A♭ root with minor third B/C♭), aligning with Aeolian's subtonic (VII) rather than harmonic minor's leading tone.
  - No strong V chord (Fm) or raised 7th suggests Dorian (which would include a major VI, but G♭ is minor-key flavored). It's not Phrygian (lacks E♭ emphasis) or Locrian.
  - The repetitive, moody loop evokes Aeolian's characteristic minor sound without modal mixture dominating (e.g., borrowed major chords are minimal).

This progression has a jazz/R&B or pop-ballad vibe (possibly from a song like an Adele or Sam Smith track?), but fits squarely in B♭ minor's Aeolian mode. If this is from a specific piece, more context could refine it further!
