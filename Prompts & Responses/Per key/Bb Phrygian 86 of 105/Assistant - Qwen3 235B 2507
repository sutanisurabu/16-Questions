Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

> Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Db/Ab – B/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbm – Bbm – Abm6 – Bbm

---

### Step 1: Identify the Root Notes and Chords

Let’s write out the chords with their **roots** (ignoring inversions for now):

- Bbm = Bb minor
- Gb/Bb = Gb major with Bb in the bass → chord is **Gb**, bass note is **Bb**
- Db/Ab = Db major with Ab in the bass → chord is **Db**, bass note is **Ab**
- B/Bb = B major with Bb in the bass → chord is **B**, bass note is **Bb** — **This is a chromatic anomaly**
- Abm6 = Ab minor 6th (Ab–Cb–Eb–F)

Wait — **B chord over Bb bass (B/Bb)**? That’s unusual.

B major is **B–D#–F#**. Bb is **A#**, so having B over Bb is enharmonically **B over A#**, which is a very dissonant half-step clash. But **B/Bb** likely indicates a **B major triad over Bb bass** — this is highly chromatic and probably a **misinterpretation or typo**.

But let's look again: Could it be **Bb dim** or **B diminished** over Bb? Or is **"B/Bb"** meant to be **C♭ / Bb**?

Wait — perhaps it's not **B natural**, but **Bb** — could this be a **notation error**?

In jazz or popular music notation, **"B" over "Bb"** is extremely rare. But **C♭** is enharmonic to **B**, so **C♭/Bb** is possible.

But **Db/Ab** just before it, followed by **B/Bb** — that would make more sense as **C♭/Bb**? But that still doesn't resolve smoothly.

Alternatively, could **B/Bb** be a **misprint** for **Bb**? Or maybe **Bdim**?

Wait — let's re-express the chords:

Let’s go back:  
- Bbm – Bbm  
- Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb → Gb major with Bb bass  
- Bbm – Bbm  
- Db/Ab → Db major with Ab bass  
- B/Bb → B major over Bb bass — very strange  
- Bbm – Bbm  
- Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
- Bbm – Bbm  
- Abm6 – Bbm

That **B/Bb** stands out.

But here’s a possibility: In **jazz or gospel** contexts, **B** over **Bb** could be **enharmonically** reinterpreted.

But B = enharmonic to C♭

So B/Bb = C♭/Bb — which is a **Cb major triad over Bb** — still odd.

But **Cb major** is not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps it's **B°** (B diminished) over Bb? That would be: B° = B D F → over Bb → creating a **Bb7(♭9)** sound? That could make sense in a resolution to Bbm.

So maybe **B/Bb** is actually meant to represent a **Bdim chord over Bb bass**, which functions as **Bb7♭9**? That’s a common way to voice **dominant7♭9** chords: use a dim chord a **half-step above the root**.

- B dim over Bb = creates **Bb7♭9** (Bb D F Ab Cb)  
  - B dim = B D F = same as **C♭ D F** = **enharmonic to 7♭9** of Bb7

Yes — this is a **common substitution**.

So: **B/Bb** is likely functioning as **Bb7♭9**, which is the **V7♭9 of Bbm**.

That makes sense harmonically.

So we reinterpret:

- **B/Bb** → **Bdim/Bb** → functions as **Bb7♭9** → **V7♭9 of Bbm**

So it’s a **secondary dominant** leading back to **Bbm**.

Similarly, **Db/Ab** — Db major over Ab bass → root is **Db**, bass Ab (5th of Db) — so it’s just Db major in second inversion. But **Db major** is **bVI** in Bbm.

And **Gb/Bb** = Gb major over Bb → Gb is **bIII** in Bb minor? Let's check.

---

### Step 2: Consider Key of Bb Minor

Let’s assume **tonic = Bb minor**

In Bb natural minor (Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb)

Chords built on degrees:

- i = Bbm
- ii° = Cdim
- III♭ = Db
- iv = Ebm
- v = Fm
- VI♭ = Gb
- VII♭ = Ab

Now look at our chords:

- Bbm = **i** — tonic
- Gb/Bb = Gb major — that’s **VI♭** (Gb) — so **bVI** — common in minor keys (borrowed from Phrygian or natural minor)
- Db/Ab = Db major — that’s **III♭** — **bIII** — also common in minor
- B/Bb = as analyzed, likely **Bb7♭9** → **V7♭9 of i** — very common in minor
- Abm6 — Ab minor 6 (Ab–Bb–Eb–F) — that’s **viiø6**? Wait:

In Bb minor:

- Ab = 7th scale degree
- Ab minor = Ab–Bb–Eb → but Abm6 adds **F**, the 6th
- So Abm6 = Ab Cb Eb F → that’s the **viiø7** chord if you use **Bbb (A)** — but here Cb = B, so **Ab–C♭–Eb–F** = Ab–B–Eb–F → but that has **B natural**, which is **not in Bb minor**.

Wait — **Abm6 = Ab–Cb–Eb–F**

In standard spelling:

- Cb = enharmonic to B, but in Ab minor, the third is **C♭** (instead of C♮)

So Abm6 = **Ab–C♭–Eb–F**

But that’s:

- Ab (root)
- Cb (minor third)
- Eb (fifth)
- F (sixth)

So intervals: 1, b3, 5, 6

That's **i6** in **Ab minor**, but here it's being used as a **chord in Bb minor**

In **Bb minor**, the **7th degree** is Ab, and a chord built on Ab with Cb, Eb, F — is that diatonic?

Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab

So:

- Ab (7th degree)
- Cb? Cb = B, but the **2nd degree is C**, so Cb is **not in scale**
- So **Cb** is **not diatonic** to Bb natural minor
- But **C** is in Bb **harmonic** minor!

Ah — here we go.

---

### Step 3: Consider Bb Harmonic Minor

Bb harmonic minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb A

Scale: 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 7

So:

- 7th degree is **A natural**, not **Ab**

But our chord is **Abm6**, not A dim.

So can't be A-based.

Abm6 uses **Ab**, so root is Ab — flat 7.

But in harmonic minor, we raise the **7th**, so **A natural**, not **Ab**.

So **Abm6** is not in **Bb harmonic minor**.

But maybe **melodic minor**? Bb melodic minor ascending: Bb C Db Eb F G A

Still, **A natural**, not Ab.

So Abm6 has **Ab**, so it's **lowered seventh**, not raised.

So it’s **not** in harmonic minor.

But Abm6 contains **F natural** as the 6th.

In **Bb natural minor**, F is diatonic.

But Abm6 = Ab–Cb–Eb–F

Cb = B, which is not in Bb natural minor (has C, not B)

So **Cb (B)** is **enharmonic to the leading tone**, but it’s spelled **Cb**, not B.

Wait — in **Ab major**, Cb would be the flat third? No.

Wait — perhaps **Abm6** is used as a **borrowed chord**, or perhaps there's a modal mixture.

Another idea: maybe this is in **Bb dorian**?

Bb dorian: Bb C Db Eb F G Ab Bb

So: 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7

Yes — contains **Ab (b7)** and **G (6)**

So Abm6 chord: Ab–Cb–Eb–F

- Cb = B — but dorian has **C natural**, not **Cb**

So still no Cb.

**Cb** is **B**, not **C natural**

There's a problem: **Cb ≠ C natural** — **Cb = B**

So **Abm6 with Cb** contains **B**, not **C**

So the chord has **B**, not **C**

So in terms of pitches: Abm6 = **Ab, B, Eb, F**

That’s: Ab (root), B (major second), Eb (fifth), F (sixth)

That interval is **Ab to B** = **augmented second** — very exotic.

Wait — is **Abm6** spelled correctly?

Standard **Ab minor 6** is: Ab–Cb–Eb–F

- Cb = B (enharmonic), so pitches: **Ab, B, Eb, F**

But **Ab to B** is a **major third**, not a minor third?

Wait — **minor third from Ab** is **Cb**, which is **B** — yes, **Ab to B is a major third**, because Ab to C is major third, Ab to B is **greater than major third**.

Hold on:

- Ab to B:  
  - Ab to A = minor second  
  - A to B = major second  
  - So Ab to B = two half steps = major second — no, **Ab to B is 3 half steps**: Ab–A (1), A–Bb (2), Bb–B (3) → Ab to B is **augmented second** (same as minor third enharmonically, but spelled differently)

In equal temperament, **Cb = B**, so **Ab–Cb = Ab to B**, which sounds like **Ab to B**, which is a **major third** interval (4 semitones):

- Ab to B:  
  - Ab–A = 1, A–Bb = 2, Bb–B = 3? No:
  - Ab → A = 1 semitone (Ab = G#, G# to A = 1)
  - A to B = 2 semitones
  - Total Ab to B = 3 semitones = **minor third**

Ah! **Ab to B is 3 semitones**, same as **Ab to Cb** — so **Cb is correct** spelling for **minor third of Ab minor**

In 12-TET, **Cb and B are the same pitch**, but in notation, for **Ab minor**, the third is **Cb**, not **B**

So **Abm6** = Ab–Cb–Eb–F → same as Ab, B, Eb, F in sound

So pitches: **Ab, B, Eb, F**

Now, which scales contain all of these?

- Ab, Eb, F → common tones
- B = leading tone

So if we're in **Ab minor**, then B = Cb = minor third — fine

But **B natural** is the **raised seventh in Ab harmonic minor**

Ab harmonic minor: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G

Yes! **7th degree is G**, so **V** is **Eb**, **V7** includes **G**, and **i** is **Abm**

But here, we have **Abm6**, which is **Ab–Cb–Eb–F**

F is the **6th** — in Ab minor, F is the **6th scale degree only in natural and melodic**, but **melodic minor ascending** has **F#**, so not F.

In **Ab natural minor**: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb → has **Fb** = E, not F

So no F

In **Ab harmonic minor**: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G → Fb = E, so still **no F natural**

So where do we get **F natural**?

This is confusing.

Wait — perhaps **Abm6** is not Ab minor with 6th, but **6th chord** meaning **minor triad with sixth above root**, which is standard.

But still, same pitches.

But here's another idea: **Abm6** is the **iv6** chord in **Bb Dorian**

Let’s check Bb Dorian: Bb C Db Eb F G Ab

So:

- iv chord = Ebm (Ebm7) — not Abm

Abm would be **vii** chord in Bb Dorian:

- Bb Dorian: i Bbm, ii Cm, iii°, IV Eb, V F, vi G, vii° Ab° — no Abm

So not dorian.

Back to Bb minor.

Wait — what if we reconsider the **B/Bb** chord.

We already think it's **Bb7♭9** function (V7♭9 of Bbm), which is very common in minor.

So that supports **Bbm** as tonic.

Similarly, **Gb major** is **bVI** in Bb minor — common in minor key progressions (e.g., "House of the Rising Sun")

**Db major** is **bIII** — also common in minor (e.g., in "Cry Baby", "All Along the Watchtower")

So bVI (Gb), bIII (Db), i (Bbm) are all common **borrowed chords** in **minor keys**, but actually, in **natural minor**, **bIII** and **bVI** are diatonic:

- Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab
- So **Db = III**, **Gb = VI**, so **Db and Gb are diatonic**, not borrowed.

Wait — in **Bb natural minor**:

- i = Bbm
- III = Db major
- VI = Gb major

Yes! So:

- Bbm = i
- Gb = VI
- Db = III

But in minor keys, **III** and **VI** are **major**, not minor.

Yes — that’s correct.

So Gb/Bb = Gb major in first inversion — **VI**
Db/Ab = Db major in second inversion — **III**

So the progression has:

- i – i – VI – VI – i – i – III – ?
- Then **B/Bb** → which we’ve interpreted as **Bb7♭9** (V7♭9 of i)
- Then back to i

Then: i – i – VI – VI – i – i – **Abm6 – Bbm**

What is **Abm6**?

In Bb natural minor:

- vii° = Ab° (Ab, Cb, Eb)

But **Abm6** = Ab, Cb, Eb, F → adds **F**, the **b6** of Ab scale, but in Bb minor, F is the **5th** degree.

So Abm6 = **Ab–Cb–Eb–F**

In Bb natural minor:
- Ab = 7th degree
- Cb = enharmonic B, but in scale, 2nd degree is **C natural**, not Cb
- Wait — in key signature of Bb minor, B is not lowered — so **Cb is not in the scale**

But in minor keys, the **third of the chord** is **already lowered** — so when spelling **triads**, we use flat accidentals.

In Bb minor, the **C is natural**, but the **third of Ab chord** is **Cb** (because Ab to C is major third, but we need **minor third**, so Cb)

So **Cb** is used to spell **minor third of Ab minor**, even though it's the same pitch as B.

But in the **scale**, the **second note** is **C**, not **Cb**

So when **Cb** appears in a chord, it's just the spelling — it's not altering the key.

So **Abm6** is **vii** chord with added 6th.

What is the function?

Abm6 = **Ab–Cb–Eb–F**

In Bb minor, that’s:

- b7 – b2 – b4 – 5

But as a chord, it’s **vii** with added sixth.

But **vii** in minor is diminished, but here it's **minor**? No, **Abm** is minor, but in Bb minor, the **vii chord** should be **Ab diminished** (Ab–Cb–Ebb), but Ebb = D.

But here we have **Eb**, not **D**

So **Abm** = Ab–Cb–Eb → that’s **Ab minor**, which is **not** the diatonic vii chord.

The diatonic **vii chord** in Bb minor is **Ab diminished**: Ab–Cb–Ebb (Ab–Cb–D)

But here we have **Ab–Cb–Eb**, which is a **minor third (3 semitones)** from Cb to Eb? Cb = B, Eb = E — B to E = 5 semitones = **diminished fourth**, not minor third.

Wait:

- Cb to Eb:  
  - Cb to D = major seventh? Messy.

Ab–Cb–Eb:
- Ab to Cb = minor third (3 semitones)
- Cb to Eb = major third (4 semitones)
- Ab to Eb = perfect fifth (7 semitones)

So it's a **minor triad** — yes.

But in **Bb minor**, the **vii chord** built on Ab should be:

- Ab, B, D → but B and D are not in key — Bb minor has **C**, not **B**, and has **Db**, not **D**

Wait — the **vii degree chord** is built from scale degrees:

- 7 (Ab), 2 (C), 4 (Eb)

So Ab–C–Eb

But **Ab–C–Eb** is **Ab major**, because Ab to C is **major third**

But in minor key, we don't alter chord qualities — the diatonic chord on vii is **Ab major**, not minor.

Wait a minute!

Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab

Chords:

- i: Bbm (Bb-Db-F)
- ii°: C° (C-Eb-Gb)
- III: Db (Db-F-Ab)
- iv: Ebm (Eb-Gb-Bb)
- v: Fm (F-Ab-C)
- VI: Gb (Gb-Bb-Db)
- VII: **Ab (Ab-C-Eb)** → **Ab major**

Oh! So the **VII chord** in Bb natural minor is **Ab major**, not Ab diminished.

I made a mistake earlier.

In natural minor, the **vii chord** is **major**, built on the b7.

So:

- **Ab major** = Ab–C–Eb

But our chord is **Abm6** = Ab–Cb–Eb–F

Which is **Ab minor** — so **not diatonic**

To make it **minor**, we need to **lower the third** — so **C to Cb**

So **Abm6** has **Cb**, which is **not in Bb natural minor**

Therefore, **Abm6** is a **non-diatonic chord**, probably used for color.

But in **Bb harmonic minor**, we have:

- Scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb A

Chords:

- i: Bbm
- II°: Cdim
- bIII+: Ebm (wait, no)

Actually, in harmonic minor, the **III chord** is augmented, but **VI** is diminished, etc.

The **vii chord** is **Ab–**C–E, but A is not in scale — Ab is not a root.

Roots:

- i: Bbm
- ii°: Cdim
- III+: Eb aug? No

Better to build:

Scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A

Chords:

- i: Bbm
- ii°: C–Eb–Gb = Cdim
- III+: Db–F–A = Db aug
- iv: Ebm
- V: F major (because A is leading tone)
- vi°: Gbdim
- VII: Ab–C–Eb = **Ab major**

So again, **vii is Ab major**, not minor.

To get **Ab minor**, we’d need to **lower the third from C to Cb**, which would give **Abm**, but that would require **Cb**, which is not in any Bb minor mode.

So **Abm6** is likely a **chromatic chord** or **misinterpretation**.

Perhaps it's **Ab6** (major 6th) instead of **Abm6**?

But it's labeled **Abm6**

Another idea: perhaps it's **G#m6**, but notated as Ab for consistency.

Unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the key is **Ab minor**, and the progression is modulating.

But the overwhelming number of Bbm chords suggests **Bbm is tonic**.

Perhaps **Abm6** is a **borrowed chord** from another mode.

But let's step back.

Best explanation:

- The chord progression is in **Bb minor**
- **Tonic**: Bbm
- **Gb major** = **VI** (diatonic)
- **Db major** = **III** (diatonic)
- **B/Bb** = Bdim/Bb → **Bb7♭9**, functioning as **V7♭9 of i** (common in minor)
- **Abm6** — less common, but possible as a **chromatic passing chord**

Abm6 to Bbm: Ab to Bb = whole step, so could be a **modal** or **chromatic transition**

But why not **Ab major**? That would be diatonic.

Perhaps **Abm6** is a typo for **Ab6** or **Ab**?

But assuming it's intentional, it might be from **Bb Phrygian** or something.

Bb Phrygian: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab — so **b2**, which is Cb.

Then:

- ii chord = Cb–Eb–Gb = Cb major
- iv = Ebm
- VI = Gbb = F diminished?

Not helpful.

But in Phrygian, the **i** chord has a **b2**, so **C minor** second.

But our progression has no such melody.

Given that most chords fit **Bb natural minor**, and the non-diatonic Abm6 is likely a **color chord** or the spelling is off, I think the intended key is:

### **Bb minor** (specifically **natural minor** or **Aeolian**)

With chromatic passing chords.

And the **B/Bb** functions as **secondary dominant** (V7♭9 of i), strengthening the minor tonic.

### Final Answer:

**Key**: Bb minor  
**Mode**: Natural minor (Aeolian)

> Although Abm6 is not diatonic, it may be used for color or there might be a notation issue. The rest of the progression strongly supports Bb natural minor.
