Bb minor (natural minor/Aeolian mode)

### Explanation
- **Tonal center**: The progression strongly revolves around Bbm as the tonic (i), with repetition at the start, throughout, and end. This establishes Bb minor as the key.
- **Supporting chords** (Roman numeral analysis in Bb minor):
  - Bbm: i
  - Gb/Bb: ♭VII (inversion; common borrowed chord from parallel major)
  - Gb/Bb: ♭VII (repeated)
  - Db/Ab: III (inversion)
  - B/Bb: Chromatic/non-diatonic (possibly a borrowed dominant or passing chord; enharmonically tense with the D♯, but doesn't disrupt the overall center)
  - Abm6: vii (borrowed/secondary minor with added 6th; leads back to tonic)
- **Key signature**: 5 flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb), consistent with natural minor (no consistent use of raised 7th/A harmonic minor elements like F major).
- **Why not other keys?** 
  - Not major (e.g., Gb major or Eb major) due to heavy use of Bbm and lack of dominant pull to a major tonic.
  - Fits better than relatives (e.g., Db major) because Bbm dominates tonally.
- This progression has a moody, repetitive feel typical of pop/R&B in minor keys (e.g., similar to sections in songs like "Wicked Games" by The Weeknd). If this is from a specific song or you have more context (e.g., melody), I can refine the analysis.
