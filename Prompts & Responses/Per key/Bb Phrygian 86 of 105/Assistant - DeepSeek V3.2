Let’s break this down step by step.

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:

**Bbm  Bbm  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbm  Bbm  Db/Ab  B/Bb  Bbm  Bbm  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbm  Bbm  Abm6  Bbm**

- **Bbm** = B♭ D♭ F  
- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ B♭ D♭ (first inversion) — that’s just a G♭ major chord over B♭ in bass.  
- **Db/Ab** = D♭ F A♭ (second inversion) — D♭ major chord.  
- **B/Bb** = B D♯ F♯ over B♭ bass — unusual, but B major triad over B♭ bass creates a B♭7♯5♯9 sound (B♭ alt chord).  
- **Abm6** = A♭ C♭ E♭ F — that’s A♭ minor with an added 6th (F).

---

## **2. Look for tonal center**

The progression starts and ends on **Bbm**, and Bbm appears frequently.  
Likely key: **B♭ minor**.

---

## **3. Check scale/chord relationships in B♭ natural minor**

B♭ natural minor scale:  
B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭

Chords in B♭ natural minor:  
- B♭m (i)  
- Cdim (ii°)  
- D♭ (III)  
- E♭m (iv)  
- Fm (v)  
- G♭ (VI)  
- A♭ (VII)

---

**Gb** = G♭ major = VI chord in B♭ minor.  
**Db** = D♭ major = III chord in B♭ minor.  
**Abm6** = A♭ C♭ E♭ F = A♭ minor with a 6th = ivm6 in B♭ minor? Wait — A♭ minor would be A♭ C♭ E♭, but in B♭ natural minor, A♭ is major (A♭ C E♭). So Abm is **not** diatonic to B♭ natural minor — it’s borrowed.

---

## **4. Check B♭ harmonic minor**

B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♮ B♭

A♭m doesn’t occur in harmonic minor either — A becomes A♮, so A♭ is lowered.

So **Abm** must be borrowed from **B♭ Phrygian** (B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭) — that’s B♭ minor with a ♭2 and ♭6 relative to natural minor? Wait, B♭ Phrygian is from G♭ major scale: G♭ A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F. Yes — in G♭ major, B♭ Phrygian chord built on A♭ is A♭ minor.

But simpler: Abm is the **iv of E♭ minor**? Actually, Abm is the **ii of G♭ major** — but here it’s in B♭m context, so it’s **♭VI minor** — a rare borrowed chord.

---

## **5. The B/Bb chord**

B major triad = B D♯ F♯.  
Over B♭ bass = B♭ B D♯ F♯ → enharmonically B♭ C♭ E♮ G♭? Let’s respell:  
B = B D♯ F♯  
B♭ bass = B♭ + B D♯ F♯ → notes: B♭, B, D♯, F♯.  
That’s B♭, C♭, E♮, G♭.  

In B♭ minor harmonic: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♮.  
We have C♭ (not C), E♮ (not E♭), G♭ (in scale).  
So this is B♭7♯5♯9: B♭ D F♯ A♭ C♭ — yes:  
B♭ (root), D (3rd) — wait, we have E♮ (D♯) not D. So it’s B♭ minor-major? No — 3rd is D♯ = E♭? No, D♯ is E♭? No, D♯ is enharmonic to E♭ only in 12-TET but functionally different. Actually, D♯ is E♭ in equal temperament, so B major triad = B E♭ G♭? That’s wrong — B to D♯ is major third, D♯ to F♯ is minor third. B major = B D♯ F♯. D♯ = E♭. So B major = B E♭ G♭. Yes! So B major triad is B E♭ G♭.  

So B/B♭ = B♭ + B E♭ G♭ = B♭ B E♭ G♭ = B♭ C♭ E♭ G♭.  
That’s just a B♭7sus♭9: B♭ E♭ G♭ C♭.  
But E♭ is the 4th (sus4), G♭ is ♭7, C♭ is ♭9.  
So it’s B♭7sus4(♭9).  
In B♭ minor, E♭ and G♭ are scale tones (iv and VI), C♭ is the ♭2 (C♭ = B).  
So it’s a Phrygian ♭2 sound.

## **6. Mode determination**

We have:  
- B♭m (i)  
- G♭ (VI)  
- D♭ (III)  
- Abm (♭VI minor — borrowed)  
- B♭7sus♭9 (borrowed from Phrygian)

The B/B♭ chord suggests **B♭ Phrygian** or **B♭ Phrygian Dominant** influence.  
B♭ Phrygian = B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭.  
In that scale:  
B♭m, G♭, D♭, Abm all fit.  
B/B♭ = B♭ C♭ E♭ G♭ = B♭7sus♭9 fits as v7sus♭9 in B♭ Phrygian.

---

## **7. Conclusion**

The key is **B♭ minor**, but the mode is **B♭ Phrygian** (a minor mode with ♭2, ♭6, ♭7 relative to natural minor — actually Phrygian has ♭2, ♭3, ♭6, ♭7 relative to major).  
B♭ Phrygian is the 3rd mode of G♭ major.  
All chords except possibly the B/B♭ are diatonic to B♭ Phrygian, and B/B♭ is just a Phrygian suspension.
