### Reasoning

**Analyzing harmonic structure**

I’m noticing that the bass shifts between Bb and Ab, suggesting a pedal-type alternation primarily around Bb with occasional Ab. This indicates the harmony could involve chromatic planing or a pedal tone rather than being diatonic. I wonder if the piece is in Bb since Emaj7 and Gb might be borrowed chords. It’s possible Bbdim serves as a leading-tone chord to B major, given its relation to B♭, which feels quite intricate!**Exploring chord functions**

I’m figuring that Bbdim is enharmonically equivalent to A#dim, serving as the leading-tone triad to B major. In B, the leading-tone triad on A# is fully diminished. This would make Bbdim the vii°/B chord. I also notice B/Bb acting like a tonic over Bb bass, hinting at a Lydian sound. It seems like B major is the gravitational center. While Bbdim often alternates with Gb/Bb, there’s a brief arrival at a B chord over Bb, suggesting a connection to the key of B major! Emaj7 appears later, adding more context.**Clarifying chord relationships**

I realize that Gb is enharmonic to F#, and since the IV in B major is E major, the V is F# major. This makes the Gb major triad functionally the V of B, but it’s noted as Gb, possibly to keep consistent with the rest of the flat notation like Bbdim and Dbm. I see that Emaj7 uses sharps, creating a mix. Then there's Dbm, which is enharmonically C#m, the ii of B major. I think Dbm/Ab as a ii chord over the 6th scale degree seems to connect the dots!**Analyzing chord inversions**

I’m breaking down the chord structure here: the root is C# with the 3rd E and 5th G#. The bass note G# suggests I'm in a second inversion, so Dbm/Ab functions as ii6/4 in B major with G# as a pedal tone. Then, B/Bb acts as I with a chromatic neighbor (Bb/A#), and I see how Bb is enharmonic to A#. That means B/A# is I over the leading tone, which is interesting. Gb/Bb becomes V over that leading tone, a unique usage! Finally, Emaj7/Ab is IVmaj7 over G#.**Determining key and mode**

So, I'm thinking that if I reinterpret every flat as its sharp equivalent, it all points to B major. The chords like Bbdim, Gb/Bb, and Dbm/Ab align nicely to confirm this. Repeated Bbdim emphasizes the leading-tone diminished triad, often with Bb as the bass. Given the presence of several chords and their functions, I’m concluding clearly: the key is B major in the Ionian mode. This fits all observed harmonic functions together quite well!

B major (Ionian).

Reason: Interpreting the flats enharmonically gives a clear B-major progression: Bbdim = A#dim (vii° of B), Gb = F# (V), Dbm = C#m (ii), Emaj7 = IV, and there’s an explicit B chord. The bass alternates mostly between A# (leading tone) and G# (6), reinforcing B major.
