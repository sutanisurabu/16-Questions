**Assistant - Qwen 235B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim. I need to figure out the key and mode. Let me start by understanding what each chord means.

First, I should decode all these chord symbols. Some are written with slashes, like Gb/Bb, which means Gb major with Bb in the bass. But Bb is part of Gb major already (since Gb is Gb-Bb-Db), so Gb/Bb is just Gb major with Bb as the bass note—essentially a first inversion. Similarly, Dbm/Ab is Db minor with Ab in the bass, which is Dbm first inversion. B/Bb is interesting—it might be a typo? B natural over Bb bass? That would be a B major chord (B-D#-F#) over Bb, which is a bit messy. Emaj7/Ab is E major seventh with Ab in the bass—Ab is G#, which is the third of E major, so it's Emaj7 in first inversion.

Now, listing them without considering inversions to see the root movement might help. So:
- Bbdim (root Bb)
- Gb/Bb → Gb major (root Gb)
- Dbm/Ab → Db minor (root Db)
- B/Bb → this is confusing. If it's B major over Bb bass, root is B (but B is enharmonic to Cb, which might relate to key signatures)
- Emaj7/Ab → Emaj7 (root E)

Wait, but note enharmonics. Gb is the same as F#, Db is C#, B is B (but in key contexts might be Cb), E is E. But in chord symbols, we usually use flats for consistency in keys like F# minor or something.

Let me convert all chords to roots only, ignoring inversions for harmonic analysis:
- Bbdim → Bb diminished (Bb-Db-Fb, which is Bb-Db-E)
- Gb → Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db)
- Dbm → Db minor (Db-Fb-Ab, i.e., Db-E-Ab enharmonically messy but standardly Db-Fb-Ab)
- B/Bb → if it's B major over Bb, root B (B-D#-F#)
- Emaj7 → E major seventh (E-G#-B-D#)

But B natural and Gb (which is F#) are enharmonically close but not the same. Gb is F#, so Gb major is F# major. Similarly, Db is C#. So maybe we should respell everything in sharps for consistency? Let's try that.

Respell:
- Bb dim → A# dim? But Bb is standard. Maybe stay in flats since chords use flats mostly.
- Gb → F# major
- Dbm → C# minor
- B → B major (but B is B, no enharmonic)
- Emaj7 → E major seventh

But E major seventh has G# which is same as Ab, but written as Ab in the slash chord. This is getting messy. The presence of both Gb (F#) and E suggests keys around E or F#, but Bb is also there.

Another approach: find the key center. Diminished chords often function as passing chords or substitutes. Bbdim appears very frequently here—it's played 8 times out of 15 chords. That's unusual. Diminished chords are often used as leading tones to major or minor chords a half step above.

For example, Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) has E, which is the leading tone to F. So Bbdim often leads to F major or F minor. But in this progression, Bbdim is mostly followed by Gb/Bb (which is Gb major, and Gb is same as F#). F# is a half step above E, and Bbdim has E as the top note (since Bb-Db-Fb, Fb is E), so yes: E → F# so Bbdim leads to F# (Gb) major. That makes sense.

Similarly, Bbdim to Gb: E (in dim) → F# (Gb) is half step, so Bbdim acts as leading tone chord to Gb major. Standard function.

Now, looking at the progression: it alternates Bbdim with Gb/Bb often, and also has Dbm/Ab and B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab.

Let me write the root movement ignoring inversions:
Chords: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb, Gb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm, B, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb, Gb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7, Bbdim

Roots: Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, Db, B, Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, E, Bb

Now, the B chord here—B natural—is problematic because in most keys with flats, B natural would be unusual. But in the progression, it's "B/Bb", so maybe the chord is B major but with Bb in bass? That would create a dissonance: B (B-D#-F#) over Bb (A#). So the bass is Bb (A#) and chord is B (which is enharmonic to Cb, but written as B). This might be a typo. Perhaps it's meant to be Bb/Bdim or something? But the user wrote "B/Bb".

Another possibility: in some notations, "B" could mean B diminished, but it's written as "B" not "Bdim". The user specified "B/Bb", so likely B major chord with Bb bass.

But let's consider the root as B for now.

So roots sequence: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E

Now, mapping to circle of fifths or something. Bb to Gb: Gb is down a minor third from Bb? Bb to Db is up a minor third. Let's see intervals between the non-Bbdim chords.

The progression has chord groups: [Bbdim x2] then Gb x2, then [Bbdim x2] then Dbm, then B, then [Bbdim x2] then Gb x2, then [Bbdim x2] then Emaj7, then Bbdim.

The main chords besides Bbdim are Gb, Dbm, B, Emaj7.

Gb major (F# major), Db minor (C# minor), B major, E major.

Key of F# minor? Because F# minor has G# dim (which is enharmonic to Ab dim), but here we have Bb dim.

Bb dim: Bb-Db-Fb. In terms of F# minor: F# minor scale is F# G# A B C# D E F#. Diminished chords diatonic to F# minor would be B dim (B D F), not Bb dim.

Bb dim is not diatonic to F# minor. F# minor keys usually use sharp notation.

Perhaps it's in Bb major? But Bb major has Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F, Gm, Adim. Adim is A-C-Eb, not Bb dim.

Bb dim would be ii dim in A major, but A major is not suggested.

Another idea: the frequent Bbdim suggests it's the leading tone to C major/minor. Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) leading to C (B->C half step). But in the progression, Bbdim is followed by Gb (F#), not C.

Unless Gb is functioning as a substitute for something. Gb major is the bV of C minor? In C minor, the Neapolitan chord is Db major, but here it's Gb.

Let's consider harmonic minor keys. For example, in C minor, the diatonic chords include Gb major as the Neapolitan? No, Neapolitan is usually Db major in C minor.

C minor: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb dim. Bb dim is the vii dim in C minor! Yes!

In C natural minor, the chords are:
i Cm, ii Ddim, bIII Eb, iv Fm, v Gm, bVI Ab, bVII Bb

But the vii is diminished in harmonic minor. Standard harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B C, so vii dim is Bdim (B D F), not Bb dim.

Bb dim would be Ab scale? No.

Let's list Bb dim: Bb-Db-E (since Fb=E). So notes Bb, Db, E.

E is the major third above C, so if this is a leading tone chord, it should lead to E half step. So it leads to E major or minor.

Indeed, Bbdim → E is common because E is the root a half step above the top note of Bbdim (E).

In the progression, the last non-Bbdim chord before the final Bbdim is Emaj7. So Bbdim leads to Emaj7? Yes: the E in Bbdim (the Fb) resolves up to E as the root of Emaj7. Perfect.

So Bbdim is functioning as the leading tone chord to E major.

Therefore, the key might be E major or E minor.

Let's check if the other chords fit in E major.

E major scale: E F# G# A B C# D# E

Chords diatonic to E major:
I E, ii F#m, iii G#m, IV A, V B, vi C#m, vii Dim D#dim

Now, Gb major: Gb is F#, so F# major. In E major, ii is F# minor, not major. So Gb (F#) major is not diatonic; it would be a modal mixture or secondary chord.

Similarly, Db minor: Db is enharmonic to C#, so C# minor. In E major, vi chord is C# minor, yes! C#m is vi.

So Dbm = C# minor, which is diatonic to E major as vi.

Then B major: B is the V chord in E major! Yes, V is B major.

Emaj7 is I with added seventh.

And Bbdim? In E major, what is Bbdim? Bb is not in the scale. Bb dim = A# dim? A# dim would be diatonic as vii dim in B major, but not E.

In E harmonic minor, the scale is E F# G A B C D# E, so vii dim is D# dim (D#-F#-A), not Bb.

Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) – let's see the notes. Bb is A#, Db is C, E is E. A#-C-E is actually A# dim, which is the same as Bb dim.

In E major, the leading tone chord for the dominant? The dominant is B, so leading tone to B is A# dim (Bb dim), yes!

A# dim (Bb dim) is the leading tone diminished seventh chord that resolves to B major, which is the V chord in E major.

But in this progression, Bbdim is resolving to Gb (F#), not to B. F# is the ii chord in E major.

A# dim (Bb dim) can also resolve to F#? Let's see: the notes A# (Bb), C (Db), E. The E can resolve up to F#, the C can resolve down to B (but B is in F#m), A# can resolve to A or B, but it's a bit messy.

Standard resolution: leading tone dim7 to tonic. For example, in C, Bdim7 to C.

But A# dim7 (Bb dim7) would typically go to B major (as V in E).

In this progression, Bbdim goes to Gb, which is F# major. F# is the ii chord in E major.

Perhaps it's a deceptive resolution or secondary dominant.

Another possibility: Gb major (F#) could be V of Bm, but Bm is vi in D major, not clear.

Back to the roots: the chords besides Bbdim are Gb (F#), Dbm (C#m), B, E.

In E major, these are:
F# = ii (but major instead of minor)
C#m = vi (minor, matches)
B = V (major, matches)
E = I (maj7)

So most fit except ii is major instead of minor. This suggests it might be in E major with a secondary dominant or modal mixture.

Specifically, F# major instead of F# minor. F# major is the V of B minor. Since B is the V of E, F# major is V/V – the secondary dominant of the dominant.

Yes! In E major, to get to V (B), you can use V/V which is F# major.

So F# major (here written as Gb major) is V of B.

Similarly, C# minor is vi diatonic.

B is V.

E is I.

And Bbdim? Bbdim as we said is A# dim, which is the leading tone chord for B major. So A# dim (Bb dim) would typically lead to B major.

But in the progression, it's leading to F# major (Gb), which is unusual. Let's see an example in the sequence:

"Dbm/Ab B/Bb" – Dbm is C#m, B/Bb is B major with Bb bass? Or B chord root.

The sequence is: ... Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb ...

So Bbdim followed by Dbm? Dbm is C#m. Does Bbdim go to C#m? Notes: Bb-Db-E to C#-E-G#. E is common, Db to D# (but not), Bb to B.

Not smooth. Alternatively, Dbm might be B/Bb meaning something else.

Another idea: perhaps the B/Bb is a typo for Bdim or something. But user wrote "B/Bb".

Let's look at the slash chords literally.

Gb/Bb: Gb major over Bb bass. Notes: Bb in bass, Gb major triad (Gb-Bb-Db) so overall notes Bb, Gb, Bb, Db – so it's just Gb major with third in bass (first inversion), but Bb is the third of Gb major, yes.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor (Db-Fb-Ab) over Ab bass, so Ab in bass, notes Ab, Db, Fb, so it's Dbm first inversion.

B/Bb: B major (B-D#-F#) over Bb bass. So bass is Bb (A#), and chord is B (enharmonic to Cb, but written as B). So notes: Bb, B, D#, F#. This is a cluster with Bb and B adjacent, very dissonant. Likely a typo.

Perhaps it's Bb/B something? Or maybe "B" is meant to be "Bdim". In some fonts, dim might be cut off. But user wrote "B/Bb" specifically.

Another possibility: in chord notation, "B" could mean A# (in flat keys), but B is standard.

Let's consider E major as the key.

Chords expected diatonic: E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim.

Now, the progression uses:
- Gb major = F# major (instead of F#m) → so V/V, secondary dominant to B
- Db minor = C# minor → vi, diatonic
- B major → V, diatonic
- Emaj7 → I, diatonic
- Bbdim = A# dim → which is vii dim7 of B major, but in E major, it would be the secondary leading tone chord for V.

In E major, the dominant is B major. The leading tone chord for B is A# dim7 (A#-C#-E-G#). But in the chord symbol, it's written as Bbdim, which is Bb-Db-Fb (Bb-Db-E), so it's Bb dim triad (not seventh), which contains A#-C#-E? A#-C#-E is A# dim triad, yes! Bb dim is enharmonic to A# dim triad.

A# dim triad is A#-C#-E, while Bb dim is Bb-Db-Fb (which is A#-C#-E). Yes, exactly enharmonic.

So Bbdim = A# dim, which is the leading tone diminished triad for B major. So in E major, A# dim → B is the standard resolution (vii dim to I in B major, but B major is V in E).

Therefore, in the context of E major, Bbdim (A# dim) can be interpreted as a secondary leading tone chord for V (B major).

But in the progression, it's not always going to B. For example, it often goes to Gb (F#), which is the V/V.

So sequence: Bbdim → Gb (F#)

F# major is V/V. What's the resolution of V/V? To V, which is B major.

So in the progression, after F# major, do we get B major? Yes, later: ... Gb Gb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm B/Bb ... and B/Bb might be that B major chord.

Specifically: positions 3-4: Gb/Bb Gb/Bb (chords 3 and 4)
Then chords 7: Dbm/Ab
Chord 8: B/Bb

Between chord 4 and 7: chords 5-6 are Bbdim Bbdim, then chord 7 Dbm/Ab.

Not immediately after Gb it goes to B.

Sequence around there: ... Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb ...

So after two Gb, there are two Bbdim, then Dbm, then B.

So Gb → (Bbdim x2) → Dbm → B

Not direct V/V to V. But the two Bbdim might be passing.

Another part: later: Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb ... same as beginning.

And then at the end: Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim

Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 with Ab bass. Ab is G#, which is the third of E major (E-G#-B), so Ab bass = G# bass, so it's Emaj7 in first inversion.

So sequence: ... Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7 Bbdim

Here, Bbdim (A# dim) leads to Emaj7 (I). But A# dim should lead to B, not directly to E. However, in some contexts, like a common tone diminished chord or deceptive resolution.

But let's test if the key is E major.

List all chords with enharmonic equivalents in E major context:

- Bbdim = A# dim (leading tone chord for B major)
- Gb/Bb = F# major first inversion (V/V of E major)
- Dbm/Ab = C# minor first inversion (vi of E)
- B/Bb = B major with Bb bass? Probably a typo; likely meant to be B major chord (V of E). The "/Bb" might be a mistake. Perhaps it's Bdim or something, but let's assume it's B major for now.
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7 first inversion (I)

So the progression essentially is: (A# dim x2) F# F# (A# dim x2) C#m B (A# dim x2) F# F# (A# dim x2) Emaj7 (A# dim)

In E major:
- F# major = V/V
- C#m = vi
- B = V
- Emaj7 = I

This makes sense as a progression in E major, using:
- V/V (F#) to lead to V (B)
- But sometimes V/V is preceded by its secondary leading tone chord (A# dim), which is common: e.g., vii dim7/V - V/V - V

Here, A# dim (Bbdim) → F# = vii dim/V - V/V

Then V/V should go to V (B), which it does later: after F# sections, we have B major (chord 8, B/Bb likely B major).

Then after V (B), what? It goes to... let's see sequence: after B/Bb (chord 8), next is Bbdim Bbdim (chords 9-10), so V back to secondary leading tone? Or it might be a cycle.

Also, there's Dbm (C#m) before B major: ... Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb ...

So A# dim x2 → C#m → B

What function is C#m? It's vi, which can go to V (B), yes. vi to V is a common progression (the "deceived" cadence but here it's going to V, not I).

vi (C#m) to V (B) is standard.

And before C#m, we have A# dim x2. How does A# dim relate to C#m? Not directly, but it could be a passing chord.

Moreover, at the end: A# dim x2 → Emaj7 → A# dim

So instead of going to B (V), it goes to I (E). This is a deceptive cadence: V to vi, but here secondary: V/V to I? No.

V/V (F#) should go to V (B), but in the end, it might be going elsewhere. But the end is: after two Bbdim (A# dim), it goes to Emaj7.

Perhaps the A# dim is being used as a common tone diminished chord related to I.

For example, Emaj7 has G# (Ab), and A# dim has A# which is enharmonic to Bb, not close. But G# and A# are minor second apart.

Alternatively, in E major, the chord after Bbdim could be seen as a I with added diminished chord for color.

But overall, the harmonic skeleton suggests E major.

Confirming the mode: since it ends on Emaj7 (with final chord Bbdim, but often pieces end on tonic), but the last full chord is Emaj7 before the final Bbdim, which is unusual. Typically, a progression would end on tonic, so Emaj7 might be the resolution.

The progression has Emaj7 as the second last chord, then Bbdim, which might not be the ending if this is part of a loop. But for key determination, Emaj7 is likely the tonic.

Are there accidentals that suggest a mode other than Ionian?

In E major, we're using only diatonic chords except F# is major instead of minor. But since it's functioning as V/V, it's a secondary dominant, so still in major key.

If it were Dorian or something, but no, the chords fit major.

Another check: the B chord (B major) – in E major, V is major, yes.

C# minor (vi) is diatonic.

F# major as V/V.

And Bbdim (A# dim) as secondary leading tone.

Moreover, in the chord list, there's no G# minor or A major, which are diatonic, but their absence is ok.

The frequent use of the secondary leading tone and dominant supports E major.

Possible typo consideration: the "B/Bb" chord. If it's actually Bdim, that would be odd. Or perhaps it's "Bb" but written as "B/Bb" by mistake. But Bb major would be the bVII in E major, which isn't typical. More likely, it's B major chord, and "/Bb" is a typo or misnotation. In some contexts, slash might indicate inversion, but B major with B bass would be root position, so "/B" is redundant, but "/Bb" being different suggests Bb bass.

However, B major over Bb bass is harmonically jarring, so I think it's safe to assume it's a mistake, and it's meant to be B major chord (V), possibly without slash or with correct inversion.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab – Ab is G#, so it's correct first inversion.

So, key is E major.

Mode: Ionian, since it's major key, no indication of other modes.

To confirm, let's see if there's an alternative key.

Suppose it's E minor. E natural minor: E F# G A B C D

Chords: Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D

No Bb dim. E harmonic minor: E F# G A B C D#, so D# dim as vii, not Bb.

Bb dim doesn't fit.

C minor: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb dim.

Bb dim is bVII in C minor, but leading to? In C minor, Bb dim should lead to Cm, but here it leads to Gb which is not diatonic.

Gb is enharmonic to F#, which is not in C minor scale.

Whereas in E major, all chords make sense as diatonic or standard secondary functions.

Another check: the overall tonal center. The progression starts and ends with Bbdim, but the Emaj7 is the most restful chord. Since Bbdim is unstable, the resolution points to E.

In jazz contexts, this might be E major with extensive secondary dominance.

Therefore, key is E major, mode is Ionian (major scale).

So the answer should be key of E major.

### Analysis of the Chord Progression  
**Given progression:**  
`Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim`

---

### Step 1: Decoding the Chords (Enharmonic Spellings & Functions)
- **Bbdim** (Bb°): Bb–Db–Fb (enharmonically **A#°**: A#–C#–E).  
  - This is a **diminished triad acting as a secondary leading-tone chord** for **B major** (V in E major), as E (the top note) resolves up a half-step to **E root → B major**.
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db) with **Bb in the bass** (first inversion).  
  - Enharmonically **F# major** (F#–A#–C#), functioning as **V/V (secondary dominant)**, leading to **B major** (V in E).
- **Dbm/Ab**: Db minor (Db–Fb–Ab) with **Ab in the bass** (first inversion).  
  - Enharmonically **C# minor** (C#–E–G#), the **vi chord** in E major.
- **B/Bb**: B major (B–D#–F#) with **Bb in the bass**.  
  - **Problematic notation**: Bb bass (A#) clashes with B root (B natural), creating dissonance. This is **likely a typo** (intended as **B major chord**, V in E). Common errors in notation:  
    - `B/Bb` may stem from mislabeling (e.g., meant `B` or `Bdim` but miswritten).  
    - **In context, it functions as B major (V)**. The progression supports this (see Step 2).
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7th (E–G#–B–D#) with **Ab in bass** (Ab = G# enharmonically).  
  - First inversion of **I (tonic chord)** in E major, confirming tonal center.

> **Key Insight**:  
> - **Bbdim (A#°)** consistently resolves to chords a half-step higher (e.g., Gb/F# or Emaj7), fulfilling a **leading-tone role**.  
> - **Gb (F#)** is **V/V** (secondary dominant for V), **Dbm (C#m)** is **vi**, **B** is **V**, and **Emaj7** is **I**.  
> - This progression is **diatonic to E major**, with secondary dominants and leading-tone chords.

---

### Step 2: Harmonic Analysis (in Context of E Major)
E major scale: **E F# G# A B C# D#**  
Diatonic chords:  
- **I**: E major (tonic)  
- **ii**: F# minor  
- **V**: B major  
- **vi**: C# minor  

| Chord (as written) | Enharmonic Equivalent | Function in E Major | Role in Progression |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Bbdim              | A#° (A#–C#–E)         | Secondary vii°/V    | Leads to B major (V) or F# major (V/V) |
| Gb/Bb              | F# major (F#–A#–C#)   | **V/V**             | Tonicizes V (B major) |
| Dbm/Ab             | C# minor (C#–E–G#)    | **vi**              | Pre-dominant; leads to V (B major) |
| B/Bb (assumed)     | B major (B–D#–F#)     | **V**               | Dominant; cadential pull to I |
| Emaj7/Ab           | Emaj7 (E–G#–B–D#)     | **I (tonic)**       | Tonal center; resolution point |

**Progression Breakdown** (using E major functional notation):  
`[vii°/V ×2] → V/V ×2 → [vii°/V ×2] → vi → V → [vii°/V ×2] → V/V ×2 → [vii°/V ×2] → I → vii°/V`  

- **Why this fits E major**:  
  - The **cycle** `vii°/V → V/V → V → vi → I` is a **standard dominant-driven progression** in major keys (e.g., common in jazz/pop).  
  - **Bbdim (vii°/V)** reinforces **V (B major)**, while **Gb (V/V)** drives motion toward **V**.  
  - **Emaj7** (I) is the only chord with **no tension** and **resolves the progression** (last stable chord before the final non-tonic Bbdim).  
  - **No evidence of minor mode**:  
    - E minor would require **G natural** (chords like C major or B♭), but progression uses **G#** (in Emaj7) and **B natural** (in V), confirming **major III** (G#).  
    - E harmonic minor would need **D♯**, but progression uses **D# in Emaj7**, aligning with major (not harmonic minor’s diminished v).

---

### Step 3: Resolving Confusions
- **B/Bb typo**:  
  - Bass note Bb (A#) under B major chord creates a **major 7th clash** (A#–B). This is **non-functional in tonal harmony**.  
  - **Resolution**: Likely meant `B` (B major root position) or `Bdim` (but chord symbol says "B"). Given the **vi → V motion** (Dbm → B), **B major (V) is the only logical fit**.  
- **Why not another key?**  
  - **C minor**: Bbdim is bVII, but Gb (F#) and B major are **foreign** (C minor has no F# or B natural).  
  - **F# minor**: Gb = F# major (I), but Bbdim (Bb°) **doesn’t resolve** correctly (e.g., should lead to C, not Gb).  
  - **E minor**: Lacks major V (B major) and uses G natural (not G#).  
  - **Only E major** explains **all chords** as diatonic or standard secondary functions.

---

### Final Determination
- **Key: E major**  
- **Mode: Ionian** (the major scale itself, with no modal alterations).  

**Why?**  
- Tonal center is **E**, confirmed by:  
  - **Emaj7** as the gravitational "home" chord.  
  - **Dominant motion V→I** (B→Emaj7).  
  - **Secondary dominants** (V/V, vii°/V) **pulling toward V→I**.  
- **No modal mixture**: All non-diatonic elements (F# major instead of F# minor) function as **secondary dominants** (standard in major keys), not borrowed chords.  

This is a **harmonically rich E major progression** with extended dominant-tonic relationships, common in jazz, R&B, or modern pop (e.g., similar to "Autumn Leaves" in E major). The frequent Bbdim creates tension that resolves to E, while the "B/Bb" typo is the only minor anomaly (resolved by context as V).
