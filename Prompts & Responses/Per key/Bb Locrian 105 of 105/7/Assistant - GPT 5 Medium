### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to determine the key and mode from this chord progression, which includes several Bbdim and Gb/Bb chords. I notice that Bbdim likely refers to a diminished triad, namely Bb-Db-Fb, with Fb being enharmonically E natural. It's interesting that E natural appears in both Bbdim and later with Emaj7/Ab, raising questions about potential key implications. I’m considering the diatonic relationships and how Bbdim might function as a leading-tone diminished chord. Let's break this down further!**Clarifying chord functions**

So, I’m trying to figure out how Bbdim fits into different keys. It seems to be the vii° of Cb major, but that feels a bit messy. When considering Gb major, I spot that the only diminished triad is vii°, which is Fdim. This means Bbdim isn’t diatonic in Gb major. However, the Gb/Bb chord functions as a first inversion tonic in Gb major. This means the Gb major triad is over Bb, which clarifies its function! Let’s solidify these relationships.**Exploring chord relationships**

It looks like we might be in Gb major, which is promising! The appearance of B/Bb is a bit odd since it's a B major chord over a Bb bass. This may act as a chromatic passing chord. Then there's the Dbm/Ab chord, indicating a Db minor triad in second inversion over Ab. In Gb major, the dominant is actually Db major, so seeing Db minor hints at borrowing from parallel Gb minor. This adds a layer of complexity to the harmonic analysis!**Analyzing Gb minor and chords**

In Gb minor, which is enharmonically F# minor, the v chord should be C# minor. However, if the tonic is Gb minor, then the dominant is Db, making Dbm the v in Gb natural minor, consistent with what I see. Now, the Emaj7/Ab chord presents itself: it’s an E major chord with Ab in the bass. This means it’s in first inversion. In Gb minor, E natural corresponds to Fb in the key signature, indicating a lowered scale degree. Let’s confirm these scale degrees!**Understanding harmonies in Gb minor**

I’m exploring chromatic colors in this piece, starting with Emaj7/Ab; it appears to function as a bVIImaj7 in Gb minor, suggesting a modal mixture from either Gb Mixolydian or minor. The progression feels anchored in Gb minor since Dbm appears, indicating a borrowed chord from harmonic minor. The recurring chords, like Bbdim, suggest a chromatic neighbor around a tonic I6. Overall, the frequent use of Ab and the specific chord spellings point towards a center in Gb minor, with a minor mode and rich harmonic color from borrowed chords.**Analyzing key centers and chords**

It looks like the key center is predominantly Gb major due to the recurring Gb/Bb chord, which indicates a major tonic. The presence of Dbm suggests borrowed elements from the minor mode. I’m also observing the Emaj7 chord, potentially a bVIImaj7 borrowed from Mixolydian. While interpreting this, I need to consider how the D# in Emaj7 relates to the overall harmony. The Bbdim chord functions as a chromatic alteration, enhancing the major sound, making my conclusion lean towards Gb major with modal mixture and some borrowed chords for color.**Determining key and mode**

I think the exercise is indeed looking for "Gb major" as the key. The instruction to "Determine key and mode" suggests it's based on Nashville number analysis or ear training, possibly expecting "Gb major, Ionian" or "F# major." However, since they used Gb/Bb, I lean towards Gb major. 

The presence of Dbm/Ab shows a minor v isn't typical for major but can work in pop contexts. The progression is anchored by Gb/Bb, establishing the tonal center. Overall, I’d conclude: Key center is Gb major, mode is Ionian. If further clarification is needed, I can mention both Gb and F# major.

Gb major (Ionian)

Notes:
- Gb/Bb functions as I6; the recurring Bbdim is a common-tone diminished neighbor to I6 (Fb resolving to Gb).
- Dbm (v) and Emaj7 (bVIImaj7) are modal/borrowed colors against the Gb major center.
