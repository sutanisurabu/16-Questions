Let’s break this down step by step.  

---

## 1. Chord identification

- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–Fb(E)  
  Enharmonically, Bb–Db–E.  
  Diminished chords are symmetrical (dim7 would be Bb–Db–E–G, but here it’s just a triad, so Bb diminished).

- **Gb/Bb** = Gb–Bb–Db.  
  That’s the same notes as Bbdim (Bb–Db–E vs. Gb–Bb–Db).  
  Actually, check: Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb (=E)  
  Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db.  
  They share Bb and Db, but Gb has Gb, Bbdim has E.  
  So they’re not the same chord, but they share two notes.

- **Dbm/Ab** = Ab–Db–Fb(E).  
  That’s Ab–Db–E.  
  Enharmonically, Ab–Db–E = Abdim triad (Ab–Cb–Ebb? No, that’s wrong — Ab diminished triad is Ab–Cb–Ebb = Ab–B–D, but here it’s Db–Fb = Db–E, so Ab–Db–E is not a diminished triad, it’s Ab–Db–E = Abdim? No, diminished triad is min b5: Ab–Cb–Ebb = Ab–B–D. But here Ab–Db–E is actually E–Ab–Db = E dim triad? Yes! E–G–Bb–Db is Edim7, so E–G–Bb is E dim triad. So Ab–Db–E is first inversion of E dim triad (E–G–Bb).  

  So Dbm/Ab = Ab–Db–Fb = Ab–Db–E = E dim triad in first inversion.

- **B/Bb** = B–D#–F# with Bb in bass.  
  That’s a polychord, functionally maybe a B major over Bb bass — very dissonant.

- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G#–B–D# with Ab in bass.  
  Ab against G# is a minor second clash.

## 2. Look for key clues

The progression is:  

Bbdim → Gb/Bb → Bbdim → Dbm/Ab → B/Bb → Bbdim → Gb/Bb → Bbdim → Emaj7/Ab → Bbdim  

Bbdim appears frequently as a pivot or passing chord.  
Gb/Bb is Gb major with Bb bass — could be bVI in Bb minor?  

Let’s test Bb minor:  
Bbm scale: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab–Bb  
Chord Gb = Gb–Bb–Db = bVI  
Chord Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab = ii° (but Dbm/Ab is Ab–Db–Fb = Abdim? Wait, Dbm is Db–Fb–Ab, so Dbm/Ab = Ab–Db–Fb = Abdim? No, that’s Ab–Db–E = E dim triad, as we saw. E dim triad = E–G–Bb, which is not in Bb natural minor (has G natural? Bb minor has Gb, not G). So E dim triad is from Bb harmonic minor: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–A (A natural, not Ab). E–G–Bb is in Bb harmonic minor? Bb harmonic minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb A. E–G–Bb: E is not in that scale (E natural? No, scale has F, not E). So E dim is foreign.  

---

## 3. Check Gb major / Eb minor

Gb major: Gb–Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F  
Bbdim = Bb–Db–E — E not in Gb major.  
So not Gb major.

---

## 4. Check chromatic mediant / symmetrical diminished

Bbdim = Bb–Db–E = same as Gdim? No, Gdim = G–Bb–Db.  
Bbdim = Bb–Db–E = same as Edim? Edim = E–G–Bb. Yes! Bb–Db–E permutes to E–G–Bb.  
So Bbdim and Edim are the same set class: (E–G–Bb) = Edim triad.  

So Bbdim = Edim = Gdim = Bdim? Let’s check:  
Edim = E–G–Bb  
Gdim = G–Bb–Db  
Bbdim = Bb–Db–E  
Ddim = D–F–Ab  
All different. Actually, diminished triad has only 4 distinct transpositions, not 8 like dim7.  
Bbdim = Bb–Db–E  
Edim = E–G–Bb — same notes? Bb–Db–E vs E–G–Bb — yes, same 3 notes.  
So Bbdim = Edim.  

So Bbdim and Dbm/Ab (which is E dim / Ab bass) are the same chord essentially.  

---

## 5. Look at the non-diminished chords

Gb/Bb = Gb–Bb–Db  
B/Bb = B–D#–F# / Bb — very dissonant, maybe working as a dominant of E.  
Emaj7/Ab = E–G#–B–D# / Ab — again, Ab against G#.  

This Ab–G# clash suggests a tonic of E major or C# minor, with Ab as a blue note or borrowed tone.  

---

## 6. Try E major as tonic

In E major:  
Bbdim = Bb–Db–E = could be seen as E–G–Bb? No, G natural is not in E major (E major has G#). So Bbdim is foreign.  
But B/Bb could be V with b9 in bass (B major over Bb) — common in jazz as altered dominant.  
Emaj7/Ab is Imaj7 with b2 in bass — Phrygian inflection.  

So maybe E Phrygian? E–F–G–A–B–C–D.  
Bbdim = Bb–Db–E — Bb and Db not in E Phrygian.  

---

## 7. Try C# minor (relative of E major)

C# minor harmonic: C#–D#–E–F#–G#–A–B#(C)  
Bbdim = Bb–Db–E — none of Bb or Db in C# minor.  

---

## 8. Likely interpretation

The constant return to Bbdim (which is same as Edim) and the final Emaj7/Ab suggests that **E** is the tonal center, but the mode is **E Phrygian dominant** (E–F–G#–A–B–C–D) from A harmonic minor? No, E Phrygian dominant is E–F–G#–A–B–C–D — fifth mode of A harmonic minor.  

But Bb and Db appear in A harmonic minor? A harmonic minor: A–B–C–D–E–F–G#. Bb no, Db no.  

So Bb and Db are borrowed — maybe from E double harmonic major (E–F–G#–A–B–C–D#) — not matching Db.  

Given the symmetrical diminished triads and the final Emaj7 chord, I’d say the key is **E major** with a lot of chromaticism, borrowing from E Phrygian (hence Ab) and using diminished chords as passing.  

---

## 9. Final answer

**Key: E  
Mode: Major (with Phrygian b2 inflection via Ab)**  

The Bbdim chords are functioning as leading-tone diminished chords to E (Bbdim = E–G–Bb, which is an incomplete leading-tone diminished of E, missing the D#).  

\[
\boxed{E\ major}
\]
