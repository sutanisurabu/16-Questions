This is a great exercise in analyzing chord progressions, especially those that contain a high density of non-diatonic or altered chords.

Here is the chord progression again:

**Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Dbm/Ab | B/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Emaj7/Ab | Bbdim**

*Note: The slash chords indicate the bass note (e.g., Gb/Bb is a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass).*

Let's analyze the chords:

| Chord | Notes | Possible Functions | Key Implications (Dominant or Tonic roots) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bbdim** | Bb - Db - E (F is missing, but diminished is minor 3rd, minor 3rd) | **Tonic Function:** $i^\circ$ (e.g., C minor key - $B^\circ$) **Dominant Function:** $vii^\circ$ (most common) or highly altered dominant (e.g., $Bb^o$ is often $G7b9$ or $Db7b9$ resolution to C) | The sheer repetition suggests it's a foundation or the *Center of Gravity*. |
| **Gb/Bb** | Gb - Bb - Db (Bb in bass) | Gb major. In the context of a potential $\text{minor key}$, $\text{Gb}$ is often the $\text{bVI}$ (Neapolitan) or the $\text{bII}$. Its movement to $\text{Bb dim}$ is unusual. | $\text{Gb} \to \text{Bb}$ could suggest $\text{Bb} \text{minor}'s}$ Neapolitan $\text{(Gb)} \to \text{V}$ (fugal bass line). |
| **Dbm/Ab** | Db - Fb - Ab (Ab in bass) | Db minor. This is $\text{bii}^\circ$ in $\text{C}$ minor (too far). If we consider the $\text{Bb}$ centricity, $\text{Db}$ is the $\text{biii}$ or $\text{iii}$ (enharmonically $\text{C} \sharp \text{m}$). | |
| **B/Bb** | B - D - F$\sharp$ (Bb in bass) | B major. Highly dissonant due to the B major triad over $\text{dissonant}$ $\text{Bb}$ bass. B major is often the $\text{VII}$ (or $\text{V}$ of $\text{E}$ minor). | |
| **Emaj7/Ab** | E - G$\sharp$ - B - D$\sharp$ (Ab in bass) | E major 7th. E is the $\text{V}$ (dominant) of $\text{A}$ minor or the $\text{III}$ (mediant) of $\text{C}\sharp$ minor. Over $\text{Ab}$ bass, it creates an $\text{Ab}$ augmented sound. |

## Detailed Analysis: Finding the Key and Mode

The most significant structural element here is the heavy use of the **$Bb$ diminished chord ($Bb^\circ$)**. This chord is repeated more than any other.

### 1. Determining the Center of Gravity (Tonic Area)

Given the extreme repetition, we must assume that **$Bb$ is the tonal center.**

If $Bb$ is the tonic, the $Bb^\circ$ chord ($Bb, Db, E$) must serve a tonic or dominant/substitute function that never resolves traditionally.

If $Bb$ is the root, the notes of $Bb^\circ$ imply a certain scale structure:
* $Bb$ (Root)
* $Db$ (Minor third, suggests a minor-based sound)
* $E$ (Tritone, suggests a highly raised 4th or flat 5th, giving a diminished sound)

### 2. Testing Potential Scales (Modes) around Bb

The presence of $Db$ and $E$ is crucial.

| Chord Note | Degree | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Db | b3 (Minor) | Minor-based mode (Aeolian, Phrygian, Dorian, Locrian, Harmonic/Melodic Minor) |
| E | ♯4/b5 | Diminished sound, or an ascending leading tone to F (V) |

**A. Bb Locrian (The Natural Diminished Chord):**
* Scale: Bb - Cb (B) - Db - Eb - Fb (E) - Gb - Ab (B $\text{Locrian}$ is $\text{C} \text{b} \text{major}$ scale from $\text{Bb}$)
* The tonic chord is $Bb^\circ$ (Bb, Db, $\text{Fb} \equiv \text{E}$). This fits perfectly.
* **The Problem:** The progression contains **Gb major** and **B major**.
    * $\text{Gb}$ is the $\text{b6}$ in $\text{Bb Locrian}$, so $\text{Gb}$ major fits.
    * $\text{B}$ major (B, D$\sharp$, F$\sharp$) does **not** fit, as the scale uses $C\flat$ (B) but has no $D\sharp$ or $F\sharp$.

**B. Harmonic Minor / Phrygian Dominant (for $Bb^\circ$ as $vii^\circ$ or specialized $i$):**
These do not naturally produce $Bb^\circ$ as the $i$ chord.

### 3. Considering the Harmonic Language: Jazz/Extended Tonality

The sound is not simple Locrian. The movement of $Bb^\circ \to Gb / Bb$ (b1 $\to$ b6 $/ \text{b1}$) suggests a highly chromatic, perhaps symmetrical or non-functional harmonic world often found in Impressionism or highly chromatic Jazz.

Let's examine the common tones and surrounding chords:
* **Bb, Db, E (F$\flat$)**
* **Gb, Bb, Db**
* **Db, E, Ab (implied $\text{Ab}^7$ from $\text{Emaj7/Ab}$)**
* **B, D, F$\sharp$**

Notice the large number of minor third relationship roots (Bb, Db, B (Cb), E, Gb). This strongly suggests a **Diminished Scale** tonality.

### 4. The Answer: $Bb$ Octatonic Scale (Half-Whole Diminished)

The **Half-Whole Diminished Scale** (also known as the Octatonic Scale) is built entirely on alternating half steps and whole steps (H-W-H-W...).

* **Bb Octatonic (H-W):** Bb - Cb (B) - Db - D$\sharp$ (E$\flat$) - E - F$\sharp$ (Gb) - G - A

Let's check how many chords fit into this scale:
| Chord | Notes | Fit in Bb H-W Octatonic? |
|---|---|---|
| **Bbdim** | Bb, Db, E | **PERFECT FIT** |
| **Gb/Bb** | Gb, Bb, Db | **PERFECT FIT** (Gb is F$\sharp$) |
| **Dbm/Ab** | Db, E, Ab | **Db, E fit.** Ab is G$, not A$. The $Ab$ is the only potential outlier in the simplest form. |
| **B/Bb** | B, D$\sharp$, F$\sharp$ | **PERFECT FIT** (B is $Cb$; $D\sharp$ is $E\flat$; $F\sharp$ is $Gb$) |
| **Emaj7/Ab** | E, G$\sharp$, B, D$\sharp$ | **E, B, D$\sharp$ fit.** G$\sharp$ is the only outlier (the scale uses G natural and A natural). |

**Conclusion on Scale:**

The vast majority of the progression's pitch material (including the defining $Bb^\circ$, $Gb$, and $B$ chords) is derived from the **Bb Half-Whole Octatonic Scale**.

The small number of non-Octatonic notes (primarily $Ab$ in the bass and $G\sharp$ in the Emaj7) are common embellishments or passing tones when using the octatonic mode. For example, $Emaj7/Ab$ often functions as an $\text{Ab} \text{alt}$ chord that wants to resolve to $\text{Db}$ (a common key center within this scale).

## Final Determination

**Key Center:** **Bb** (Determined by the consistent root of the most frequent chord, $Bb^\circ$)

**Mode:** **Half-Whole Octatonic Scale (Diminished Scale)**

* **Name/Description:** Bb Half-Whole Diminished Scale (Bb - B - Db - D$\sharp$ - E - F$\sharp$ - G - A)

This mode naturally generates numerous diminished (Bb°, Db°, E°, F#°) and dominant 7b9 chords, which are often used as substitutes for one another and explain the root movement in minor thirds ($Bb \to B \to Db \to E$). This high symmetry is characteristic of the Octatonic Mode.
