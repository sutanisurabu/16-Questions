Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chord Sequence:**
```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

---

### Step 1: Interpret the Chords

First, write out the actual pitches in each chord and understand their functions.

#### 1. **Bbdim (Bb°)**  
- Bb diminished = Bb, Db, Fb (which is enharmonic to E)
- This is a fully diminished triad: 1, b3, b5 of Bb
- Function: Often acts as a passing chord or a leading tone chord

#### 2. **Gb/Bb**  
- Gb major triad with Bb in the bass = Bb, Db, Gb
- That's Bb–Db–Gb → this is the **Bb minor triad** (Bb, Db, Fb? Wait — Gb ≠ Fb)
- Let's clarify: Gb = F#, but **Gb ≠ Fb**
  - Fb = E (but flatted twice), while Gb is a perfect fifth below Bb
- So: Bb (bass), Gb, Db → rearranged: Bb, Db, Gb
- That’s **Bb–Db–Gb** → **Bb minor 6th?**
  - Bb minor is Bb–Db–F
  - But Gb is **b6** of Bb → so Bb–Db–Gb = Bb minor triad with a **b6**
  - But Bb–Db–Gb is actually the **same pitches as a Gb major triad over Bb root** → Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db → so **Gb/Bb = Gb major in first inversion**

✅ So **Gb/Bb** is **Gb major over Bb bass** → same as **Gb major in first inversion**, which is a very common way to write it.

#### 3. **Dbm/Ab**  
- Db minor over Ab bass → Ab, Db, Fb (Ab–Db–Fb = Ab–Db–E)
- Fb is enharmonic to E, but in Db minor, the 5th is Abb (G), so Fb is not standard.
Wait: Db minor = Db–Fb–Abb
- So Dbm = Db, Fb (E), Abb (G)
- So **Dbm/Ab** = Ab, Db, Fb → Ab–Db–E (Fb)
- That’s Ab–Db–Fb → intervals: P5 (Ab–Db) and b9 (Ab–Fb)? That seems odd.

Wait — **Ab is the 5th of Dbm**, so **Dbm/Ab** is **Db minor in second inversion** (5th in bass)

So pitches: Ab, Db, Fb (Ab–Db–E) — yes.

But Fb is E, so enharmonically: Ab–Db–E

Hmm — that’s Ab–Db–E → tritone + augmented 4th

But correct spelling: Fb (not E), so we keep it as Fb.

So: **Dbm/Ab = Db, Fb, Abb** with **Ab in bass**

Wait — Abb is G. So pitches are: Ab, Db, G (Fb = E, Abb = G)

Wait, Db minor is:
- Root: Db
- Minor 3rd: E♭♭ → which is D (but more clearly: Fb)
- Perfect 5th: Abb → = G

So Dbm = Db–Fb–Abb → enharmonic to D–E–G → but better to keep as Db–Fb–G (since Abb = G)

So Dbm/Ab → Ab in bass, Db, Fb → **Ab–Db–Fb**

But Ab to Fb is a **diminished 6th**, which sounds like a perfect 5th.

This is **Db minor triad in second inversion**

No harmonic issue.

#### 4. **B/Bb**
- B major triad over Bb bass → Bb–B–D#–F#
- That’s a very harsh cluster: Bb and B (minor 2nd), Bb and D# = augmented 4th, Bb and F# = tritone
- So pitches: Bb, B, D#, F#
- That’s an extremely dissonant cluster — possibly a typo?

But let’s consider: is "B" meant to be **B natural** or could it be **Bb**?

B/Bb = B major triad (B–D#–F#) with Bb in bass → very unusual.

Alternatively, is "B" meant to be **A#?** A# is enharmonic to Bb — no. A# = Bb.

Wait: B is B natural. Bb is A# — same pitch.

So B/Bb has two notes: Bb and B — only a semitone apart.

This is a **very harsh polychord** unless it's a typo.

Possibility: Could this be **Bdim/Bb**? Or **Ab/Bb**?

Wait — let’s look at context.

Earlier chords: Bbdim, Gb/Bb, now B/Bb?

And then back to Bbdim.

But **B** has D# and F#. D# = Eb, F# = Gb.

So pitches: Bb, B, D#, F#

That’s almost like a **Bb7b9** without the 7th?

Bb7b9: Bb–Db–F–Ab–Cb (B)

So Bb, Db, F, Ab, B → includes B (the b9)

But here we have B, D#, F# — not Db, F, Ab

So it doesn't match.

Wait: D# = Eb, F# = Gb

Could this be a **Cbb?** Not likely.

Alternative: Is "**B**" a typo for "**Bb**"? Then Bb/Bb = just Bb — but that wouldn't make sense.

Or is "**B**" meant to be "**Ab**"? Then **Ab/Bb** would make more sense — Ab over Bb = Bb–Ab (6th)

Or "**B**" = "**D**"? Unlikely.

Alternatively — in some notations, "B" = **Bb** in European systems?

No — in American notation:
- B = B natural
- Bb = B flat

So **B/Bb** = B major over Bb bass.

Very unusual. But possible in jazz or chromatic harmony.

Alternatively, perhaps **"B"** is meant to be **"D"**, so **D/Bb**?

D major over Bb → Bb–D–F# → F# = Gb → so Bb–D–F#

D major = D–F#–A → so D/Bb = Bb–D–F#–A

That's Bb–D–F# → major triad with #11? Or a D major chord over Bb – possible.

But still, no A mentioned.

Wait — let's analyze the **harmonic motion**.

### Let's look at the bass line:

From the slash chords:

1. Bbdim → bass: **Bb**
2. Gb/Bb → bass: **Bb**
3. Dbm/Ab → bass: **Ab**
4. B/Bb → bass: **Bb**
5. Emaj7/Ab → bass: **Ab**

So bass movement:
- Bb → Bb → Ab → Bb → Ab → Bb

So mostly **Bb** with some **Ab**

Now look at the chords:

- Bbdim (Bb, Db, Fb)
- Gb/Bb (Bb, Db, Gb) → same as Gb major
  - Gb major: Gb–Bb–Db → all in chord
- So Gb/Bb = Gb major in 1st inversion

So chords:
- Bbdim → Gb → Bbdim → Dbm (2nd inv) → B/Bb → ?

Now, **Gb major** and **Bbdim** are closely related.

Note: Gb major and Bb diminished share notes:
- Gb: Gb–Bb–Db
- Bbdim: Bb–Db–Fb
→ Common tones: Bb, Db

So Bbdim is like **vii° of Gb major** — yes!

- In Gb major, vii° = Bbdim

So Bbdim → Gb is **vii° → I** in **Gb major** — very standard

Then we go Bbdim → Gb → Bbdim → Dbm/Ab

Dbm = Db–Fb–Abb

Is Db minor related to Gb major?

Gb major: Gb–Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F

So Db is the **5th** degree.

So **Db minor** could be **ii** chord in **Cb major**, or **iv** in Ab minor, etc.

But in **Gb major**, the ii chord is **Ab minor**, not Dbm.

Wait — Dbm is **not** in Gb major.

In Gb major, the iii chord is **Bbm**, not Dbm.

Dbm has Fb (Eb) and Abb (G) — G is not in Gb major (which has Gb or F, not G natural).

So Dbm has G natural → **not in Gb major**

Wait: Fb = E, Abb = G → so Dbm = Db–E–G → which is **Db augmented**, not minor.

Wait — this is critical.

If we spell **Db minor**, it should be:
- Root: Db
- Minor 3rd: Fb (E double flat) → enharmonic to E
- Perfect 5th: Abb (G double flat) → enharmonic to F

But **Fb** = E, and **Abb** = G → so Db–E–G → that’s **Db augmented**!

So unless the chord is spelled correctly, **Dbm** cannot have E and G.

So if the chord is **Db–Fb–Abb**, that’s Db–E–G → Db augmented.

But it's written as **Dbm**, so presumably it's **Db–Fb–Abb** with correct spelling, even if enharmonically ugly.

But in practice, **Fb = E**, and **Abb = G**, so pitches are **Db, E, G**

That’s **Db–E–G** → which is Db augmented triad (Db, F, A would be augmented; Db, E, G → is Db, E, G = major third + minor third → Db–E = M3, E–G = m3 → so it's a **Db augmented 2nd?** No — not a standard chord.

Wait: Db to E is an augmented 2nd (3 semitones) — but enharmonically that's a minor third? No:

- Db to E: C# to E = two semitones (C#-D-D#-E) = 3 semitones → minor third.

But spelled as augmented 2nd.

In equal temperament, **Fb = E**, so **Db–Fb** = **Db–E** = **minor third**? No:
- D to F = minor third (3 semitones)
- Db to Fb = same → D to E = 2 semitones? Wait no:

- Db = C#
- Fb = E
- C# to E = 3 semitones → minor third → so yes, **Fb = minor third above Db**

- Then Fb to Abb: Fb = E, Abb = G → E to G = 3 semitones → minor third.

So **Db–Fb–Abb = Db–E–G** → minor third + minor third → **diminished triad**

But diminished triad from Db:
- Db–Fb–Abb → yes, that's **Db diminished**, not **Db minor**

Ah! Here’s the error.

- **Db minor** = Db–Fb–Ab
- **Db diminished** = Db–Fb–Abb

So if the chord is written as **Dbm**, it should be Db–Fb–Ab

But if it’s **Dbm/Ab**, then bass is Ab

So pitches: Ab, Db, Fb

- Ab to Db = P5
- Db to Fb = m3
- So Ab–Db–Fb → Ab–Db–E → that’s **Ab–Db–E**

- Ab to E = augmented fifth → A5

So **Ab–Db–E** = **Ab aug** (Ab–C–E), but here it's Ab–Db–E → Db = G# → so Ab–G#–E → G# and E = minor third, Ab to G# = major 7th

This is messy.

Alternatively, if the chord is **Db diminished**, then **Db° = Db–Fb–Abb**, and **Db°/Ab** means Abb = G in bass?

Abb = G, so if bass is G, it's **Db° in 2nd inversion**

But it's written as **Dbm/Ab**, so bass is Ab

Ab is the **5th of Db minor**, so **Dbm/Ab** makes sense as **second inversion Db minor**

But only if the 5th is **Ab**, not Abb

So for **Db minor**, it must be **Ab**, not **Abb**

Therefore, unless it's a typo, we must assume **Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab**

So pitches: Db, Fb (E), Ab

Then **Dbm/Ab** = Ab, Db, Fb

So notes: Ab–Db–Fb → enharmonic to Ab–Db–E

Which is **Ab minor 6th?** Ab–C minor → but it's Fb = E, not E natural.

E is Fb — so Ab–Db–E = same as Ab–Db–Fb

Interval:
- Ab to Db = P5
- Ab to Fb = m7 (Ab to G is M7, Ab to Gb is m7, Fb = E = about Gb, so yes — m7)

So Ab–Db–Fb = **Ab7** without the 3rd?

Ab7 = Ab–C–Eb–Gb

We have Ab–Db–Fb → Db = #11, Fb = Gb = b7

But missing the C (3rd)

So it's an incomplete Ab7 chord, missing the 3rd.

Alternatively, it's a **Dbm6**? Unlikely.

Perhaps it's better to look at function.

### Let's refocus.

We see **Bbdim** and **Gb/Bb** repeating.

Bbdim → Gb is **vii° → I** in **Gb major**

So **Gb major** is a strong candidate tonic.

Then we see **Dbm/Ab**

In **Gb major**, the V chord is **Db**, and if it's minor, that would be **borrowed from minor** — Gb minor?

But Gb minor has Db minor, yes.

So **Dbm** could be **v chord in Gb minor**

So perhaps there's a modal mixture: Gb major borrowing from Gb minor

Then **B/Bb** — let's look at this chord.

B/Bb — B major over Bb bass

B major = B–D#–F#

Bb = Bb

So combined: **Bb, B, D#, F#**

D# = Eb, F# = Gb

So pitches: Bb, B, Eb, Gb

Sort them: Bb, B, Eb, Gb

Intervals:
- Bb to B = minor 2nd
- Bb to Eb = P4
- Bb to Gb = b6

Eb to Gb = m3

B to Eb = m3

B to Gb = m3

So it's a cluster with a lot of minor thirds — possibly a **fully diminished chord?**

Let’s see: B, D#, F#, A → Bdim7

But we don't have A, we have Bb

So B + Bb = minor 2nd

But Bdim7 = B–D#–F#–A

Here we have B–D#–F#–Bb → Bb = A#

A# = Bb, yes.

So B–D#–F#–A# = B–D#–F#–Bb

Is that a diminished 7th chord?

- B to D# = M3
- D# to F# = m3
- F# to Bb (A#) = m3

Wait: B–D#–F#–A# → yes, that's **B diminished 7th** — fully diminished

- B–D# = M3? No — B to D is m3 (3 semitones), B to D# is M3 (4 semitones)

Then D# to F# = 3 semitones = m3

F# to A# = 4 semitones = M3

A# to C# = m3? Not closing.

A fully diminished 7th has alternating m3 and M3? No — **all intervals are minor thirds** (3 semitones)

So:
- B to D# = 4 semitones = **M3** → not m3

So **not a diminished 7th chord**

But D# = Eb

So B–Eb–F#–Bb

Now in 3-semitone steps:
- B to Eb = 3 semitones (m3)
- Eb to F# = 4 semitones (M3) → no

F# to Bb = 3 semitones (m3)

No.

Wait — let's try **Bb7b9**:
- Bb7 = Bb–Db–F–Ab
- Bb7b9 = Bb–Db–F–Ab–B

So notes: Bb, Db, F, Ab, B

Our chord: Bb, B, D#, F#

D# = Eb, F# = Gb

So we have Bb, B, Eb, Gb

Missing Db, F, Ab

So not matching.

But notice: **D# = Eb, F# = Gb**

And Gb is in the key of Gb major.

B natural is **not in Gb major** — Gb major has Bb, not B natural.

B natural is the **leading tone of Cb**, but also the **augmented fourth** of Gb.

So **B natural in Gb major** is **#11** — a sharp eleventh.

So B/Bb = Bb + B (b9), D# (Eb = #9?), F# (Gb = 5th)

Bb to F# = tritone → b5

So if we interpret as **Bb7alt** chord: Bb7b9#9#11

Notes:
- Bb (root)
- Cb = B (b9)
- D## = E#? No.

Standard altered: b9, #9, #11, b13

So pitches:
- b9 = B
- #9 = C## = D# (Eb)
- #11 = E (Fb)? No, #11 of Bb is E (natural), but E is not in chord.

We have F# = Gb, which is **b5** of Bb

So notes: Bb, B (b9), D# (#9), F# (b5)

So: **Bb7b9#9b5**

Which is a **fully altered dominant chord** — very tense, resolving typically to a major or minor chord a semitone down, like **A major or A minor**

But we are in Gb context?

Alternatively, it resolves to **Emaj7/Ab**

Next chord: **Emaj7/Ab**

E major 7th over Ab bass

E major 7 = E–G#–B–D#

Ab in bass → so notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Ab to E = augmented fifth

So this is a very dissonant chord.

Ab = G#, so G# in bass and G# in chord — so G#–G# = unison

So pitches: G# (Ab), E, G#, B, D#

So actual notes: E, G#, B, D#, G#

Sort: E, G#, B, D#, G#

So G# is repeated in bass and chord.

So it's **Emaj7 with G# in bass** → so **Emaj7/G#**

But written as **Emaj7/Ab** — since Ab = G#

So **Emaj7/G#** = same thing.

Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D#

So chord: E, G#, B, D# with G# in bass.

That’s fine.

Now, **E major** is not in Gb major (which has Eb, not E)

E natural is **#4 / #11** of Bb or of Gb.

In Gb major:
- C is the fifth
- E would be #4 (Lydian)

So **Emaj7** could be **IVmaj7 of Bb major**, or **bIIImaj7** of Cb, but not in Gb.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is **Bb Dorian** or something.

Let’s back up.

### New approach: bass line and harmonic function

Bass movement:
- Bb → Bb → Ab → Bb → Ab → Bb

Chords:
- Bbdim (Bb°)
- Gb/Bb (Gb major)
- Dbm/Ab (Db minor over Ab)
- B/Bb (B major over Bb)
- Emaj7/Ab (Emaj7 over Ab/G#)

Now notice:
- Gb major is common
- Bbdim = leading tone chord to Gb
- So Gb is likely a tonic

Then Dbm/Ab — Db is the **dominant** of Gb, but **minor** instead of major

So possibly **borrowed from Gb minor** (iv or v)

Then B/Bb — contains B natural, D#, F#

D# = Eb, F# = Gb

B natural = enharmonic Cb? No.

But **B major** is the **V of Em**.

Then next chord is **Emaj7/G#**

So B major → Emaj7 is **V–I** in **E major**

But E major has F#, C#, G#, D#

G# is in the bass.

So **B major to E major** is a perfect cadence in **E major**

But then the whole thing is in **E major**?

But first chord is Bbdim — Bb is not in E major.

E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

Bb is foreign.

But Bb is enharmonic to A#, which is not in E major.

So not likely.

Unless it's a **borrowed chord**.

But multiple Bbdim and Gb chords?

Gb is F#, enharmonic.

G = Gb? No.

Wait — **Gb = F#**

And **F#** is the **leading tone of G**, but also the **5th of B**

But in **E major**, F# is the **second degree**

So F# major = **ii chord**

But here we have **Gb major = F# major**

So **F# major** in E major is **ii** — which is usually minor in major keys.

So F# major is **not diatonic** — it's **borrowed from E minor** or **chromatic**

And Bbdim = A#° = **vii° of B**

B is the **V of E**

So maybe **Bbdim = A#°**, which is **vii° of B**, resolving to B major

Then B → E = V–I in E

Yes!

So let’s reinterpret with **enharmonic spellings**.

### Enharmonic Equivalents

- Bbdim = **A#°** = A#, C#, E, G
- Gb/Bb = **F#/A#** = A#, C#, F#
- Gb = F#
- Bb = A#
- So Gb/Bb = F# over A# bass → **F#/A#** = first inversion F# major
- B/Bb = B over A# bass → **B/A#**
- Dbm/Ab = Db minor over Ab
- Emaj7/Ab = E major 7 over G# (since Ab = G#)

Now let’s rewrite the progression enharmonically:

Original:
```
Bbdim    Bbdim    Gb/Bb    Gb/Bb    Bbdim    Bbdim    Dbm/Ab    B/Bb
A#°      A#°      F#/A#    F#/A#    A#°      A#°      Dbm/G#    B/A#
```

Then:
```
Bbdim    Bbdim    Gb/Bb    Gb/Bb    Bbdim    Bbdim    Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
A#°      A#°      F#/A#    F#/A#    A#°      A#°      Emaj7/G#  A#°
```

So now, **A#°** is the **vii°7 of B**, functioning as leading tone to **B major**

Then **B major → Emaj7** = V–I in **E major**

Perfect cadence.

But what about **F#/A#**?

F# is **ii** in E major, but normally **F# minor**.

F# major is a **chromatic mediant** or **borrowed from E minor's parallel major?** Not standard.

But F# major is **III of D# minor**, not helpful.

Alternatively, **F# major** can be a **secondary dominant**.

But here, F#/A# is **F# over A#**, and A# = Bb = leading tone to B.

But F# major to A#° doesn't make sense.

Unless the bass is the important part: **A#** in bass for most of the sequence.

A# is the **leading tone to B**

So A#° → B = vii° → I in **B major**

But then B → E = V of E

Not consistent.

But we have **Emaj7** as a chord, suggesting **E** is tonic.

So perhaps the key is **E major**

Chords:
- A#° (vii° of B) = **vii° of V in E**
- So A#° → B = **vii°7/V → V/V** — but V/V is C# major, not B.

In E major:
- V = B
- V/V = C# major
- vii°7/V = C#°7 = C#–E–G–Bb

Not A#°.

A#° = A#–C#–E–G

- A# = Bb
- C# = 3rd of key
- E = 5th
- G = b7

So A#° = root of Bb, but in E major, this could be **bii°7** — a Neapolitan or something.

But Neapolitan is usually bII, not bii°.

Alternatively, **A#° -> F#** = unusual.

But F# major is **II in E minor**, so borrowed.

Perhaps the progression is **chromatic** around **B–E**, with the bass A# supporting the approach to B.

Then the Dbm/Ab = Dbm/G#

Ab = G#

G# is the **leading tone of A**, not related.

Dbm = chromatic.

Perhaps the only stable chords are **B** and **E**, and the others are passing.

But the structure is symmetric, with Bbdim–Bbdim–Gb/Bb–Gb/Bb repeating, then Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, back to pattern, then Emaj7/Ab.

So perhaps the key is **E major**, and this is using chromatic harmony to approach B and E.

Given that the final cadence is **B/Bb -> Emaj7/Ab**, which is **B -> E** with chromatic bass A# and G#, it's possible that **Emaj7** is the tonic chord.

Moreover, Emaj7 with G# in bass is **Emaj7/G#**, which is first inversion — common.

The earlier Gb = F# = ii in E major, but major instead of minor — so it's a **mode mixture** or **chromatic chord**.

Bbdim = A#° = could be **vii°7 of B**, the dominant.

So progression might be:

**[vii°7/V]** – **[vii°7/V]** – **[II]** – **[II]** – **[vii°7/V]** – **[vii°7/V]** – [chromatic] – **V** – then later **V** – **IVmaj7?** No, Emaj7 is I.

Wait, Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# = I6

So likely the last chord is **tonic**.

So the key is **E major**

Mode: **Ionian** (major)

But let's see if it fits.

### Conclusion

After careful analysis, the most coherent resolution is:

- The final cadence is **B major to E major** (V–I)
- The "B/Bb" and "Emaj7/Ab" are **B major** and **Emaj7/G#**
- Bbdim = A#° = **vii°7 of B**, functioning as **secondary leading tone chord to V**
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# = F# major chord with A# in bass — possibly a chromatic approach or borrowing
- F# major is **II** in E minor, so **borrowed from parallel minor**
- Dbm/Ab = Dbm/G# — this is more obscure, but could be a passing chord

Given that the only stable resolution is to **E major**, and the B chord acts as dominant, the **key is likely E major**.

The mode is **major (Ionian)**.

### Final Answer:

**Key: E major**  
**Mode: Ionian**
