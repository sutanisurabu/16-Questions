To determine the key and mode from this chord progression, let's analyze it step by step.

---

### **Given Chord Progression:**

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Root Movement and Common Tones**

- **Bbdim** appears **10 times** — this is clearly the **tonic function** or **central chord**.
- **Gb/Bb** — Gb major with Bb in bass → **Bb is the third of Gb**, so this is a **first inversion Gb major chord**.
- **Dbm/Ab** — Dbm with Ab in bass → Ab is the **5th** of Dbm → **second inversion Dbm**.
- **B/Bb** — B major with Bb in bass → this is a **chromatic bass line**, B major over Bb (tritone in bass).
- **Emaj7/Ab** — Emaj7 with Ab in bass → Ab is the **#11** of Emaj7 → this is a **highly chromatic voicing**.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Bbdim**

Bbdim is:

- **Bb – Db – E – G** (fully diminished 7th chord: root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th, diminished 7th)

This is **Bbdim7**, which is **symmetrical** — it can function as:

- **vii°7** in **Cb major** (enharmonic to B major)
- **ii°7** in **Ab minor**
- **vii°7** in **C minor** (as vii°7/ii)
- Or **as a passing chromatic chord**

But since **Bbdim7 is the center**, we must ask:

> **What key treats Bbdim7 as the tonic or central chord?**

---

### **Step 3: Consider Diminished as Tonic — Implies Symmetrical or Modal Context**

In **traditional tonality**, **diminished chords are unstable** — they *resolve*, they are *not* tonics.

But in **modal or symmetrical contexts**, especially in **diminished scales** or **octatonic music**, **diminished chords can be centers**.

So we must consider:

- **Octatonic scale** (symmetrical, 8 tones)
- **Diminished tonic** — rare, but possible in **modal jazz**, **film music**, or **modern classical**

---

### **Step 4: Check for Scalar Consistency**

Let’s extract **all unique pitches** from the chords:

#### **Chord Tones:**

- **Bbdim7**: Bb – Db – E – G
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb – Bb – Db
- **Dbm/Ab**: Db – E – Ab
- **B/Bb**: B – D# – F# – Bb
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E – G# – B – D# – Ab

#### **All Unique Pitches:**

Bb, Db, E, G, Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#

That’s **10 unique pitches** — **more than 7**, so **not diatonic**.

But **Bbdim7** is **fully diminished**, and **fully diminished chords are symmetrical** — they divide the octave into **minor 3rds**.

So let’s check:

> **Does this progression revolve around the Bb diminished scale?**

---

### **Step 5: Check Bb Octatonic (Diminished) Scale**

The **Bb octatonic scale** (half-whole or whole-half) includes:

**Bb – C – Db – Eb – E – F# – G – A**

But we have:

- **G#** (from Emaj7)
- **D#**
- **Ab**
- **B natural**

These are **outside** the Bb octatonic.

So **not purely octatonic**.

---

### **Step 6: Consider Enharmonic Reinterpretation**

Let’s **respell** Bbdim7 enharmonically:

- **Bbdim7 = A#dim7 = C#dim7 = Edim7 = Gdim7**

So **Bbdim7** is **enharmonically identical** to:

- **C#dim7**
- **Edim7**
- **Gdim7**

This is **symmetrical** — **every fully diminished chord is 4 chords in one**.

So **Bbdim7** is **not a tonic** in traditional terms — it is **a pivot** or **a passing chord**.

But here, **it is repeated** — **it is the center**.

---

### **Step 7: Consider Modal or Chromatic Center**

Since **Bbdim7 is the center**, and **no major or minor tonic is established**, we must conclude:

> **The key is centered on Bbdim7 — a chromatic, symmetrical center — not a traditional major or minor tonic.**

Thus:

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

- **Key Center:** **Bb** (by bass and repetition)
- **Mode:** **Chromatic / Diminished-centered**  
- **Scale:** **Bb diminished (octatonic) with chromatic alterations**
- **Functional Tonality:** **Non-functional / post-tonal**
- **Best Description:**  
  **"Chromatic progression centered on Bbdim7, implying Bb diminished symmetry with chromatic upper structures"**

---

### 🔍 TL;DR:

> **This is not in a traditional key or mode.**  
> **It is a chromatic, diminished-centered progression with Bbdim7 as the tonal center — essentially a **symmetrical, post-tonal chimera** built around the **Bb fully diminished chord**.**
