### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I need to analyze the chord progression provided: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim." There’s a focus on the repeating Bbdim chords and the Gb/Bb slash chords, along with some chromaticism or borrowed chords.

When considering enharmonic spellings, Bbdim translates to a B flat diminished triad: Bb, Db, and Fb, which is enharmonically equivalent to E natural. This suggests a relationship that could lead to B being the key center, but it feels a bit odd as a leading-tone triad to B in that context.**Exploring leading-tone triads**

I'm thinking about leading-tone triads built on the seventh degree, particularly in C# major where the leading-tone is C. That's not quite right. I'm considering that Bbdim often functions as the leading-tone diminished to B, with the tonic being Cb.

I should write out the relevant scale candidates for Gb major and E major. The Gb/Bb chord suggests Gb major over Bb in bass, which could be a first inversion chord (I6) if in Gb major. So I need to figure out how Bbdim fits within the Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F.**Examining triads in Gb major**

I'm analyzing triads in Gb major: I is Gb, ii is Abm, iii is Bbm, IV is Cb, V is Db, vi is Ebm, and vii° is Fdim. However, Bbdim contains Bb, Db, and Fb (which is E) but isn’t diatonic since vii° is actually Fdim. So maybe Bbdim could function as ii° of Ab, but then in Gb major, the third scale degree is Bbm—definitely not diminished.

Now looking at Emaj7/Ab, E turns into Fb enharmonically. But E major can’t fit diatonically, which makes me consider that Emaj7 might be enharmonically equivalent to F♭maj7/Ab. And about Dbm/Ab, it’s the same as Db minor in first inversion!**Analyzing chord inversions**

Dbm/Ab is indeed a second inversion chord, with Ab being the fifth of Db minor in the bass. In the context of Gb major, the ii chord is Ab minor, while Db minor acts as the v of Gb minor, but it’s not within the diatonic set for Gb major. So, that makes it a borrowed chord.

Looking at B/Bb, that’s B major over Bb bass, which is kind of odd because it’s tritone distance from E or F. In Gb major, B natural would equate to Cb, and B enhances to Cb. So, B/Bb ends up as Cb/Bb, giving me a Cb major over Bb in bass. 

Also, with Emaj7/Ab, the notes are E, G#, B, and D# over Ab in the bass.**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing if the key is Gb major or B major, focusing on chords like Dbm/Ab as second inversion of Db minor. Bbdim equals A#dim in B major, while Gb/Bb matches F#/A# as the V chord in first inversion. I am putting these together to confirm that the progression goes from vii° to V6. The use of enharmonics shows that the key is indeed B major.

Final conclusion: B major (Ionian). I'll include a short reasoning bullet mapping the chords to their functions.**Crafting a concise answer**

The key is B major (Ionian). All chords fit diatonically into B major, and the enharmonic spellings break down as follows: Bbdim equals A#dim (vii°), Gb/Bb equals F#/A# (V6), Dbm/Ab equals C#m/G# (ii6/5), B/Bb is the I chord over a leading tone pedal, and Emaj7/Ab is IVmaj7 with the third in bass. Additionally, the progression from Bbdim to Gb/Bb represents a move from vii° to V in B.

B major (Ionian).

Reason: The chords are diatonic to B major with enharmonic spellings:
- Bbdim = A#dim (vii°)
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# (V6)
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# (ii6)
- B/Bb = I over leading-tone pedal (A# in bass)
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# (IVmaj7 in first inversion)

The repeated Bbdim → Gb/Bb motion is vii° → V in B major.
