This chord progression you've provided is:

> **Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim**

Let’s analyze it step-by-step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the chords

#### Chord Types:
- **Bbdim** = B♭ diminished triad = B♭–D♭–F♭ (or E)
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major triad with B♭ in the bass → Gb–Bb–Db with B♭ bass.  
  This is a **Gb major chord in first inversion**.
- **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor triad with Ab in the bass → Db–Fb–Ab with Ab bass.  
  So: Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab → Fb = E. So Dbm = Db–E–Ab.  
  Bass is Ab → This is **Db minor in second inversion**.
- **B/Bb** = B major triad with B♭ in the bass → B–D#–F# with B♭ bass.  
  This is unusual: **B major over B♭ bass** — a **chromatic bass motion**.
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th chord (E–G#–B–D#) with Ab in the bass →  
  So: **Ab–E–G#–B–D#**. A very rich, dissonant sonority.

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal center

We see a **repeating pattern**:
> Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
> ...then again...  
> Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
> ...then  
> Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

So the **Bbdim** chord is acting as a **recurring pedal or anchor**.

Let’s look at **Bbdim** = B♭–D♭–F♭ (F♭ = E).  
That’s the **ii° chord** in the key of **C major/minor**? Not quite.  
Also, **Bbdim** = the **vii° chord** in C major — yes, that fits.

Wait — **B♭ diminished** is **vii° of C major**, and also **vii° of C minor**.  
But we also have **Gb major** (smoothly spelled as **F# major**, but written as Gb).

Gb = F# — that’s the **major dominant** of **C major**? No:  
- Gb is a **tritone** away from C.

Wait — here’s a better idea.

### Step 3: Consider **Bb diminished** as tonic?

Bbdim = B♭–D♭–F♭.  
That’s the same set of notes as **D♭–F♭–A𝄫**? No — wait.

Actually, **Bb diminished** = B♭, D♭, F♭.  
The **full diminished 7th chord** would be B♭–D♭–F♭–A𝄫, but we have just triad.

But note: **B♭dim** = D♭dim = F♭dim = A𝄫dim — all are enharmonic equivalents (same notes).

So if we treat Bbdim as **tonic**, we’re in **B♭ diminished tonality** — which is possible in jazz or film music, but rare as “key” in functional harmony.

But let’s look at **Gb/Bb**.

**Gb/Bb** = Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db), bass on Bb → that’s a **major chord built on the 5th degree of Bb major**?  
Wait — Gb is **not** the V of Bb. V of Bb is **F**.

But **Gb is tritone away from C**, and **Bb is the 7th scale degree of C**.

Wait — **Gb is a tritone substitution for D7**, which would be the V of G.

This feels more like **Bb minor**?

Let’s test **Bb minor** as tonic:

- Bb minor: Bb–Db–F
- vii° chord: A° (A–C–Eb)
- But we have Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb — which is **not** natural minor.

Wait — Bb natural minor is:  
**Bb – C – Db – Eb – F – Gb – Ab**

So the **vii°** chord would be **Ab dim** = Ab–Cb–Eb → not Bbdim.

But the **ii°** chord in **C minor** is **D°** — not Bb.

Wait — here’s a breakthrough.

### Step 4: Consider **Db minor** as tonic?

We have **Dbm/Ab**, so Db minor is clearly featured.

Let’s try key: **Db minor**

Db minor scale:  
**Db – Eb – Fb – Gb – Ab – Bbb (A) – Cb (B)**

Chords:
- i: Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab
- ii°: Eb° = Eb–Gb–Bbb
- III: Fb major (enharmonic E) = Fb–Ab–Cb
- iv: Gbm = Gb–Bbb–Db
- v: Ab minor? (but usually harmonic minor raises 7th to C natural)

Wait — we have a **Gb major** chord in the progression.

Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db

In Db minor, Gb is **iv** — yes, **D natural minor** would have **Gb** as iv.

But let’s check:

**Db minor natural**:  
Tonic: Db  
IV = Gb → **major IV chord?**  
But in natural minor, IV is minor: **Gbm** = Gb–Bbb–Db = Gb–A–Db

But we have **Gb major** → **Gb–Bb–Db**

Bb is **not** in Db minor scale — Db minor has **Bbb** (A)

So Bb = **chromatic #4** — so **Gb major** here is a **borrowed chord** — specifically, from **Db Major**!

Ah! Now we’re getting somewhere.

### Step 5: Borrowed chords — **Db Major**?

Let’s suppose tonic is **Db major**:

Db Major: **Db – Eb – F – Gb – Ab – Bb – C**

Chords:
- i = Dbm
- ii° = Eb°
- III = F major
- **iv = Gbm** — we have **Gb major** — that’s **V of C**? Not iv.

Wait — **Gb is the IV chord in Db major** — yes, IV = Gb major!

Yes! In Db major:  
- I: Db  
- ii: Ebm  
- iii: Fm  
- **IV: Gb** ✅  
- V: Ab  
- vi: Bbm  
- vii°: Cdim

But we don't have Db major — we have **Bbdim** and **Gb/Bb**

Wait — Bbdim = B♭–D♭–F♭

In **Db major**, Bb is a **vi** chord (Bbm), not diminished.

Bbdim = B♭–D♭–F♭

D♭ is the **third** of Db major → so **Bbdim** = **vi°**? But in major key, vi is minor, not diminished.

Wait — **Bbdim** is **the vii° of C major**, or **the ii° of Cm**.

Here’s a better theory: **"Bbdim" is the diminished chord built on the ♭7 scale degree of Db major**?

In Db major, the 7th is **C**, so Cdim.

But Bb is the 6th scale degree.

**Bbdim** is **the vi° chord** — but that doesn't exist in major key.

### Step 6: Listen for **B/Bb** — this is critical!

**B major over B♭ bass** = **B–D#–F# / B♭**

That’s **B major chord** = **#1, #3, #5** relative to Bb!

So this is: **B = ♯1, D# = ♭3? No.**

Let’s think in terms of **Db** tonality.

B is **♯6** of Db (Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab–Bb–C → B is not in scale)

But **B** is enharmonic to **C♭**

So B = C♭ → so **C♭ major over Bb bass**

C♭ major = C♭–E♭–G♭

Which is **same as B major** → B–D#–F#

So **C♭ major / B♭ bass** = chord with notes: **B♭, B, D#, F#**

→ That’s **B♭–B–D#–F#** — a **B♭ augmented with melodic upper neighbors**? Or it’s **a polychord**: B major over B♭ bass.

This is **very chromatic** and **avant-garde**.

But let’s see: B is the **♯5** of Gb? No.

Wait — what is **B major** in relation to **Db**?

→ B is **♯6** of Db. So this is a ♯6 major chord over ♭7 bass — very strong use of chromaticism.

This suggests **modal mixture/alteration**, maybe **Db minor with altered chords.**

Bolstered by **Emaj7/Ab**

Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D#  
With Ab bass → **Ab–E–G#–B–D#**

Now, Eb = G#? No, Ab is the root.

In Db major or minor, what is **E**?

- Db major: C is 7th, so E is ♯3? Not even in scale.
- Db minor: C is ♯7 (harmonic minor), so E is ♭5.

**E is the ♭5 of C!**

But **Ab is the ♭6** of Db minor?

Wait — if tonic is **Db**, then:

- **Ab** = ♭6
- **E** = ♭5 (because Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab–Bbb–Cb → E = D# = ♭5? Let's count)

Actually in **Db minor**, the scale is:

**Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab–Bbb–Cb**

Bbb = A, Cb = B

So E? E is **not in** this scale.

E = **#4** of Db (Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–A -> fifth degree is Ab; so E is 4 steps above: Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab = 5 steps)

Wait — **E** is **♯4** of Db?  
Db → Eb → Fb → Gb → **A** → Bbb → Cb  
So: E is **♯4?**

Let’s map semitones:

Db = 0  
Eb = 2  
Fb = 3  
Gb = 5  
Ab = 7  
Bbb = 8 (A)  
Cb = 10 (B)

E is 8 semitones above Db? Db to E:  
Db–D–D#–E → 4 semitones? No.

Wait — **Db to E** is **enharmonic to Db to F♭**? No.

Let me count actual pitch:

Db = 38 (MIDI)  
E = 52  
Difference: 52 – 38 = 14 semitones → **Augmented 5th**

So **E** is **#5 (augmented 5th)** above Db.

So **Emaj7/Ab** = #5 maj7 over ♭6 bass.

This is **highly chromatic** — typical of **jazz, film noir, or modal jazz with altered scales**.

---

### Step 7: Synthesis

Yours chords feature:

- **Bbdim** — functions as pedal or tonic substitute
- **Gb/Bb** — Gb major (IV in Db major)
- **Dbm/Ab** — i6 in Db minor (i chord, second inversion)
- **B/Bb** — B major over B♭ bass = ♯5 major over ♭7 bass (in Db)
- **Emaj7/Ab** = #5 maj7 over ♭6 bass

This doesn’t follow traditional functional harmony, but the **tonal center** is clearly **Db**.

All chords can be viewed as **extensions or chromatic alterations** around **Db**.

Lines:

- Bbdim = B♭–D♭–F♭ — D♭ is the tonic, so **Bbdim** = **♭6dim** (vi° from Db Major)
- Gb/Bb = IV in Db major, bass on ♭7
- Dbm/Ab = i in Db minor, bass on ♭6
- B/Bb = ♯5 maj over ♭7
- Emaj7/Ab = #5 maj7 over ♭6

So this is **Db** as the tonic, and the mode is **a blend of Db minor and Db major**, with **intense chromaticism and modal interchange**.

**Functionally**, this resembles **jazz minor** or **Dorian with chromatic passing chords**.

But the **most accurate classification** is:

> 🟩 **Key: Db**  
> 🟩 **Mode: Db minor with heavy modal mixture and chromatic alterations (Phrygian, harmonic minor influences)**

### Why Db minor?

- We have clear **Db minor triad (Dbm)**.
- We have **Gb major**, which is **borrowed from Db major** (as IV).
- We have **Bbdim**, which can be seen as ♭6dim — very common in **Phrygian** or **Dorian with b2** context.
- The **B/Bb** is very characteristic of **Phrygian dominant** or **Harmonic minor** blurring — B acts as the #5 in Db harmonic minor? In Db harmonic minor, 7th is C, and #5? There is **no #5** in Db harmonic minor.

Wait — \( \text{Db harmonic minor: } \text{Db}\ \text{Eb}\ \text{Fb}\ \text{Gb}\ \text{Ab}\ \text{Bbb}\ \text{C} \) — 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Still no E.

But E = **#5** of C? If we think of **C** as dominant seventh of F, we get too far.

Actually, **E** is the **leading tone of F** — perhaps a secondary dominant?

**Emaj7** = E–G#–B–D# — that’s a **VII7 in A major**? Or **V of A?** No, V of A is E7 = E–G#–B–D.

Emaj7 is **non-dominant**, just tonal center on E.

In the context of **Db**, E is **♯5** and a **chromatic passing tone** from D# (to Db).

So in summary:

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: Db**  
> **Mode: Db minor with chromatic alterations and modal mixture (especially borrowed from Db major and with Phrygian/harmonic minor inflections)**

This progression uses **chromatic bass movement** (Bb → Ab → Bb → Ab) and **non-diatonic chords** to create a dark, cinematic, jazzy feel. Within the Db tonality, the chords highlight the **minor mode** as home, while borrowing colorful, highly altered sonorities — typical of **modern jazz compositions** or **film scores**.

If you need a **scale**, use **Db harmonic minor** or **Db melodic minor descending** to support the raised 7th (C natural, if present) — though here the C’s absence is notable.

Note: The **B/Bb** and **Emaj7/Ab** are so chromatic they might be **passing chords** or **statements of a contrasting tonality**, but the consistent return to **Bbdim** and **Dbm/Ab** anchors the center on **Db**.

**So, definitively:  
👉 Key: Db  
👉 Mode: Db minor (with chromaticism/mode mixture)**
