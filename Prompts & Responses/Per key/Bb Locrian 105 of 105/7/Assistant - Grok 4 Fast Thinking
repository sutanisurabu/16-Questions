**Key:** Ab minor  
**Mode:** Aeolian  

This progression centers tonally around Ab minor, with Bb as a prominent subdominant bass (II) and the inverted chords over Ab (I) reinforcing the tonic. The repeated Bbdim functions as a chromatic iiÂ°-like approach (with leading tones), Gb/Bb as VII (in first inversion), and Dbm/Ab as diatonic iv/i. The Emaj7/Ab (enharmonically highlighting Ab as the 3rd of E maj7) acts as a chromatic resolution back to the tonic area, while B/Bb serves as a passing chromatic chord. Some notes (e.g., E natural, B natural) introduce mild chromaticism typical in jazz/classical progressions but don't alter the overall Ab minor tonality.
