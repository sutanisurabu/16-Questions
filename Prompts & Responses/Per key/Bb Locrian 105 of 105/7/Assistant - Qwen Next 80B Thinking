**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to analyze these chords. Let me write them out clearly. The chords are: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

Hmm, some of these are slash chords, meaning the bass note is specified. So Gb/Bb means Gb with Bb in the bass. Similarly, Dbm/Ab is Db minor with Ab in the bass, B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass, and Emaj7/Ab is E major 7 with Ab in the bass.

I should figure out what the actual chords are without the slashes first, and then the bass notes might give a clue about the inversions or perhaps the tonal center. But typically, for key determination, we look at the root notes of the chords and how they function in a key.

Let me list out all the root notes first:

- Bbdim (B flat diminished)
- Gb/Bb → root is Gb, but bass is Bb
- Dbm/Ab → root is Db minor, bass Ab
- B/Bb → root is B major, bass Bb
- Emaj7/Ab → root is E major 7, bass Ab
- Bbdim again

Also, the slashes: Gb/Bb is Gb chord with Bb in the bass. So Gb major? Wait, but it's written as Gb/Bb, which is a slash chord. Typically, when a chord is written as X/Y, X is the chord, Y is the bass note. So Gb/Bb means a Gb chord with Bb as the bass note.

But Gb is a diminished chord. Wait, the first one is Bbdim, which is B flat diminished. Then Gb/Bb – Gb is a root, but diminished? Let's check.

First, Bbdim is B♭, D♭, F♭ (but F♭ is actually E natural in some contexts). Diminished chords have minor thirds stacked. B♭ diminished would be B♭, D♭, F♭ (which is E). But F♭ is not common; sometimes people write it as B♭dim7 which includes A♭. But typically Bbdim might be B♭, D♭, F♭ (E), but in practice, it's often played as B♭, D♭, F♭ for a triad, but dim7 is B♭, D♭, F♭, A♭♭ (which is G). Hmm, this is getting messy.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using simplified notation. Let's consider common diminished chords.

Bbdim is likely B♭ diminished triad: B♭, D♭, F♭ (but F♭ is E), so actually B♭, D♭, E. But sometimes written as B♭dim.

But Gb/Bb. If it's Gb/Bb, that's a Gb chord with Bb bass. So the chord is Gb, and the bass is Bb. So the Gb chord could be Gb major? But Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. But if it's written as Gb/Bb, that's a Gb chord with bass note Bb, so it's an inversion. So the notes would be Bb (bass), then Gb, Db (since Gb chord is Gb, Bb, Db).

But wait, the chord symbol is "Gb/Bb" which is Gb major triad in first inversion (since Bb is the third of Gb). For a Gb major chord: root Gb, third Bb, fifth Db. So in first inversion, bass is Bb, so the chord is Bb, Gb, Db. So yes, Gb major triad in first inversion.

But the user wrote the first chord as Bbdim. Bbdim is Bb diminished. Diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Bb dim triad: Bb, Db, Fb (which is E natural).

Now, let's look at Dbm/Ab. Db minor chord with Ab in bass. Db minor chord: Db, Fb (E), Ab. So in root position. But here it's Dbm/Ab, which means bass note is Ab. So the chord is Db minor with Ab in bass, so Ab is the fifth of Db minor. So the chord notes would be Ab, Db, Fb (E).

But Ab is the fifth, so it's second inversion of Db minor.

Next, B/Bb. B major with Bb in bass. So B major triad: B, D#, F#. With bass Bb. So Bb, B, D#, F#? Wait, but that seems odd because the bass note Bb is a half step below B. So it's a dissonant chord. So the chord is B major, but with Bb bass. So the notes would be Bb (bass), B, D#, F#. So this would be a B major chord with a non-chord tone in the bass? Or it's a different chord. But perhaps it's a typo? Or maybe it's B major with Bb as part of the chord, but the slash notation specifies bass note. So yes, bass is Bb, chord is B major. So the chord would have Bb, B, D#, F# – but that has a major 7th interval between Bb and B, which is a minor second, very dissonant. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the chord is Bb maj7 or something else.

Wait, maybe the user meant B/Bb as B minor? But it's written as B/Bb, which would be B major chord with Bb bass. But that's unusual. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and they meant Bb/Bb, but that's just Bb. But no, it's written B/Bb.

Alternatively, maybe it's "B over Bb" but that would be a polychord? Like B major chord over Bb bass. So root B, but bass Bb. So the chord is B major with Bb bass. That would create a minor 9th interval between Bb and B. So possible in jazz, but not common in common practice.

Alternatively, maybe the slash is indicating a different chord. For example, in some contexts, people write things like B/Bb meaning B with Bb in the bass, but maybe it's a typo for Bb major? But that seems unlikely.

Another thought: maybe the user confused slash chords with something else. Let's see. But proceeding.

Emaj7/Ab: E major 7 chord with Ab in bass. So E major 7 is E, G#, B, D#. Inversion with Ab bass. So Ab is the bass note. So the chord would be Ab, E, G#, B, D#. But Ab is a minor third above G#, but in E major 7, the notes are E, G#, B, D#. Ab would be a diminished 5th above E (since E to Ab is a diminished fifth: E, F, G, Ab – yes, that's a diminished fifth. But E major 7 normally has a perfect fifth B. Ab is a tritone from E. So it's a bit odd. So Emaj7/Ab would have the notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. That seems like a very dissonant chord. Alternatively, maybe the slash chord is Ab bass over E major 7. So in terms of note spelling, it's Ab, E (root), G# (major third), B (fifth), D# (seventh). So the bass is Ab, but the chord is E major 7. So perhaps this is a type of altered chord or a passing chord.

This is getting complicated. Maybe instead of analyzing each chord strictly, I should look for the common tonal center. Let's list all the distinct pitch classes that appear in the chords.

Let's break down each chord into their notes.

First, Bbdim: B♭, D♭, F♭ (but F♭ is E natural), so notes: B♭, D♭, E.

But in standard notation, B♭dim is B♭, D♭, F♭. But F♭ is equivalent to E. So yes.

But often in practice, B♭dim7 would be B♭, D♭, F♭, A♭♭ (G). But as a triad, B♭dim triad is B♭, D♭, F♭.

But maybe the user is using Bbdim as B♭dim7? Not sure. Let's proceed.

Next chord: Gb/Bb. So if it's Gb major chord in first inversion (Bb bass), then the chord notes are Bb (bass), Gb, Db. So notes: Gb, Bb, Db.

Then Dbm/Ab. Db minor triad with Ab bass. Db minor: Db, Fb (E), Ab. So in bass Ab, so notes are Ab, Db, Fb (E).

B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. So B, D#, F# with bass Bb. So bass Bb, then chord notes B, D#, F#. So the chord has Bb, B, D#, F#.

Emaj7/Ab: E major 7 with Ab bass. E major 7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, so Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

Okay, so let's list all the notes in the progression:

- B♭dim: B♭, D♭, E (F♭)
- Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db (but Gb is same as F#, so maybe in enharmonic spelling)
Wait, Gb is enharmonic to F#. But in key analysis, sometimes it's better to think in terms of flats or sharps.

Similarly, Db is C#, but this could complicate things.

Alternatively, let's try to write all in sharps for consistency, but maybe first check if there's a key that fits.

Alternatively, list all the pitches that occur:

From Bbdim: B♭, D♭, E (F♭)

From Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db. Gb is same as F#, Db is same as C#. Bb is Bb.

Wait, but this might not be helpful. Let's collect all unique note names:

- From first chord (Bbdim): Bb, Db, E

Second chord (Gb/Bb): Gb (F#), Bb, Db (C#)

Third chord (Dbm/Ab): Db, E, Ab

Fourth chord (B/Bb): Bb, B, D#, F#

Fifth chord (Emaj7/Ab): Ab, E, G#, B, D#

So compiling all notes:

Bb, Db, E (from Bbdim)

Gb (F#), Bb, Db (from Gb/Bb) – but Gb is F#, Db is C#

Dbm/Ab: Db, E, Ab

B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

So possible pitches: A, Bb, B, C, C#, Db, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, Ab (which is same as G#), etc.

Let me list all distinct notes with standard notation (using flats and sharps as appropriate):

Bb, Db, E (which is Fb, but commonly E), Gb (F#), Db (C#), B, D#, F#, Ab (same as G#), G#, etc.

So let's see if these notes fit into a certain key.

But this seems messy. Let's consider the chords as functioning in a key. Maybe a common key signature.

Let's think: Bbdim is a common diminished chord. In key of C minor, the diminished chord on Bb is the vii° chord. But let's see.

Wait, perhaps the key is Bb minor? Let's check.

In Bb minor key: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab.

But that's a lot of flats. Alternatively, Ab major: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb – no, Ab major is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Wait, common keys. Let's see. If there's a Bbdim chord – which is a diminished triad. Diminished chords usually occur on the leading tone (vii° in major key), or on other degrees.

Also, Dbm chord – Db minor. So if Db minor is a chord, maybe the key is Db major or Bb minor.

Let's think about chords that can appear in a key.

For example, suppose the key is Bb minor. The chords would be:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db major

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb major

VII: Ab major

But Bbdim is a diminished chord. In Bb minor, the vii° chord would be A°. So A diminished. But here we have Bbdim, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, in C minor: chords are Cm, D°, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb.

So Bbdim isn't in C minor.

In Eb major: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bbm, Cm, D°

No Bbdim.

Wait, maybe the key of Gb major? Gb major: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Chords:

I: Gb

ii: Abm

iii: Bbm

IV: Cb

V: Db

vi: Ebm

vii°: Fdim

But here Fdim, which is same as E dim. But in our progression, we have Bbdim – Bb dim. In Gb major, the iii chord is Bb minor, not diminished. The iii chord in Gb major would be Bb minor, so no dim.

Hmm.

Another thought: if we see Gb major chords, Db minor chords, etc. Let's see. The chords that keep coming up are Bbdim, Gb, Dbm, etc.

Wait, another approach: look at the bass notes. The progression has slash chords with bass notes specified. So for instance:

Bbdim – bass Bb

Bbdim – bass Bb

Gb/Bb – bass Bb

Gb/Bb – bass Bb

Bbdim – bass Bb

Bbdim – bass Bb

Dbm/Ab – bass Ab

B/Bb – bass Bb

Bbdim – bass Bb

Bbdim – bass Bb

Gb/Bb – bass Bb

Gb/Bb – bass Bb

Bbdim – bass Bb

Bbdim – bass Bb

Emaj7/Ab – bass Ab

Bbdim – bass Bb

So looking at the bass line: mostly Bb, then Ab, then Bb, Ab, Bb. So bass notes going mostly Bb and Ab.

In a key, a descending bass line of Bb, Ab might suggest a IV to III movement, if in a major key. For example, in C major: F (IV) to Eb (III), but descending a whole step. Or in Bb major: Gb (which would be V of F? Not sure. Wait.

If bass is moving from Bb to Ab, that could be a descending chromatic bass line. For example, in the key of Ab major, the bass might move Bb (supertonic) down to Ab (tonic), but not sure.

Wait, Ab major: chords would be Ab, Bb, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.

The bass note Ab would be tonic. Bb would be supertonic. But here bass is descending from Bb to Ab. That would fit in Ab major. If we're going from Bb to Ab, that would be supertonic to tonic.

But let's see the chords:

If the key is Ab major, let's see what the chords are.

Chords of Ab major:

I: Ab

II: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gdim

Now, looking at the chords in the progression:

Bbdim – in Ab major, the ii chord is Bbm, which is minor, not diminished. So Bbdim doesn't fit.

But maybe it's Ab minor?

Ab minor key: Ab, Bbb (or A), Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb (E)

Chords would be:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbb dim (but that's A dim)

III: Bb

iv: Cbm

v: Dbm

VI: Eb

VII: Fb (E)

Not sure. Let's see Bbdim – if it's a diminished triad on Bb, but in Ab minor, the v chord is Db minor, etc.

Alternatively, let's consider Bb as the tonic. If the key is Bb major.

Chords:

I: Bb

ii: Cm

iii: Dm

IV: Eb

V: F

vi: Gm

vii°: Adim

So Bbdim is not directly present. But maybe vii° in Bb major is A°, not Bbdim.

Hmm. How about Bb minor?

Bb minor: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: DbM

iv: Ebm

v: Fbm (Ebm)

VI: Gb

VII: AbM

So in Bb minor, the chord on the third degree is Db major (III), etc.

But in our progression, we have Bbdim, which would be on the root. A diminished chord on root? Not typical. In minor keys, the diminished chord usually appears on the ii or vii°.

Alternatively, looking at the Gb/Bb chords. Gb is the same as F#. If it's a Gb chord, which in a key with flats would be used.

Another idea: maybe the key is B major? But B major has a lot of sharps. Let's check:

B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

But we have chords like Emaj7, which would be V chord in B major. Yes! So if key is B major, then Emaj7 is the V chord? No, V chord in B major is F# major. Emaj7 doesn't fit. Wait, Emaj7 would be a major seventh chord on E. In B major chords:

I: B

ii: C#m

iii: D#m

IV: E

V: F#M

vi: G#m

vii°: A#dim

So the IV chord is E major. But in the progression, there's Emaj7. E major with major 7th (E, G#, B, D#). But in key of B major, the IV chord is E major, which is usually a major triad, but the IV chord in major key is indeed E major. However, a maj7 chord could be used as IVmaj7, which is common in jazz. So Emaj7 would be IVmaj7 in B major.

Also, other chords: Bbdim – but Bb is a flat note. In B major, all notes are sharp, so Bb would be a chromatic note. However, in B major, the Bbdim chord might be considered as a chromatic chord.

But let's check if Bbdim can fit. In B major key, vii° is A#dim, so not Bb. But Bb is the major b2, so a Neapolitan chord or something else.

But also, Dbm/Ab. Db minor: Db, Fb, Ab. In B major key, Db would be a chromatic chord.

Alternatively, if the key is Db major? Let's see. Db major:

Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

Chords:

I: Db

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

v: Abm

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

So if key is Db major. Then:

Bbdim – Bb diminished. In Db major's chords, the vi chord is Bbm (minor), not diminished. The vii° is Cdim. So Bbdim doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Another approach: the bass notes are mostly Bb and Ab. So maybe it's moving around Ab and Bb as roots. Ab and Bb are a whole step apart.

Let's consider chords related to Ab and Bb.

If we look at the Dbm/Ab chord: Dbm in first inversion? Dbm with Ab bass. Ab is the fifth of Dbm.

Also, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7 with Ab bass. So E major 7, with Ab in bass. How does that fit?

Another thought: perhaps this progression is using chords from the harmonic minor scale or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Bb major, and Bbdim is a ii° chord or something, but in Bb major, the ii chord is Cm, not diminished.

Wait, perhaps the Bbdim is actually the diminished chord from the seventh scale degree in a minor key.

For example, in C minor key: leading tone is Bb, so vii° is Bbdim. Yes! In C minor, the vii° chord is Bb diminished. Bb, Db, Fb (E). Yes!

Let's check. C minor:

Natural minor: C, D♭, Eb, F, G♭, Ab, B♭

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: D♭dim

III: EbM

iv: Fm

v: G♭m

VI: AbM

VII: B♭M

Wait, no. Wait, in natural minor, the vii° chord is actually diminished. Wait, in C natural minor, the scale degrees:

1 C

2 D♭

3 Eb

4 F

5 G♭

6 Ab

7 B♭

So the VII chord would be B♭, D♭, F. But that's a B♭ minor chord, not diminished.

Wait, no. To get a diminished chord on the leading tone, you need to raise the seventh note. In harmonic minor, the seventh degree is raised. So C harmonic minor: C, D♭, Eb, F, G♭, Ab, B.

So chord on VII (B): B, D♭, F. Which is B diminished (Bdim: B, D♭, F). Yes, because B to D♭ is minor third, D♭ to F is minor third, so diminished triad.

So in C harmonic minor, the VII° chord is Bdim.

But the chord we have is Bbdim. B♭dim. Which would correspond to the VII° chord in A harmonic minor? Let's see.

A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#.

Chords: vii° would be G#dim (G#, B, D). Not Bb.

Wait, but B♭dim chord: B♭, D♭, F♭. Which would be the vii° chord in some key.

For example, in C# minor harmonic: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B# (C). The vii° would be B#dim = Cdim. Not sure.

Wait, maybe in Cb major? Probably not.

Alternatively, look at the Gb/Bb chord. Gb is the same as F#. If the key has F# in it. Let's see.

Wait, another angle: the presence of Gb major chord. Gb and Bb are in it. If it's a Gb major triad. But Gb is a flat key.

Let me think about the common chords. If there's a Gb chord and a Dbm chord. So Gb to Db minor – that could be a progression in Ab major: because Ab major has Db as its IV chord. Wait, Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb. So chords:

I: Ab

II: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gbdim

Ah! Here, Gb is the major seventh chord? No, in Ab major, the v chord is Eb, and the vii° is Gbdim.

But if Gb is used as a chord, perhaps as a major chord – but in Ab major, the VII chord should be diminished. So if someone is using Gb major chord instead of diminished, that might be a borrowed chord or something.

Alternatively, if the key is Db major. Db's VII chord is Cdim. Not Gb.

Wait, C minor: let's see. Chords of C natural minor: Cm, Ddim, EbM, Fm, Gm, AbM, BbM.

But if we're in C minor, the vi chord is Ab major, which can be a strong chord.

Also, in C minor harmonic: Cm, Ddim, EbM, Fm, G, Ab, Bdim.

Wait, the V chord is G major (if raised seventh), so in harmonic minor, V chord is G major, and vii° is Bdim.

But Bbdim is not directly in there. Wait, Bbdim would be a different chord.

Another idea: Bbdim chord is also the diminished chord in the key of A minor harmonic? Let's see.

A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G

Harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#

Chords:

i: Am

ii°: Bdim

III: C+

iv: Dm

v: Em

VI: F

VII: G#

So no Bb. Not matching.

Wait, the chord Emaj7/Ab: E major 7 with Ab bass. So E, G#, B, D# in bass Ab. Ab is a minor third above G#? No, G# to Ab is a semitone. So in terms of the chord, if we think of it as an Ebmaj7 over Ab bass or something else. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as Ab minor 7th with a G#? Not sure.

Alternatively, Ab as the bass note, and the chord above is E major 7. So the full chord would be Ab, E, G#, B, D#. But that's actually an Abmaj7#11 or some extended chord? Or maybe it's a G# diminished with Ab bass? No, probably not.

Alternatively, think of it as E major 7 with added Ab, but the slash is bass note.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe it's best to consider that the bass movement is from Bb to Ab repeatedly. Like in a descending bass line.

Another common chord progression: Bb dim, Gb, Db minor – wait.

Wait, in A minor: the ii° chord is Bdim, iii chord is C, IV is Dm, V is Em, VI is F, VII is G. Not sure.

Wait, let's consider the possibility that the key is Bb major, and there's a lot of chromatic chords.

But let's check the Emaj7 chord. If key is Bb major, the IV chord is Eb major. But Emaj7 is E major, which is a half step above Eb. So it's like a neighboring chord.

Alternatively, in the key of Eb major. Let's see.

Eb major: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D

Chords:

I: Eb

ii: Fm

iii: Gm

IV: Ab

V: Bb

vi: Cm

vii°: Ddim

Not sure. Bbdim would be not present. Bb is V chord.

But the chord Gb/Bb: Gb is a chord. In Eb major, Gb would be the flat VI chord. So VI chord is Cm, but Gb would be the bVI.

Similarly, Dbm is bV of Eb major? Db minor is not standard in Eb major.

Another idea: look at Bbdim and Dbm chords. Bb dim and Db minor.

Db minor could be i in Db minor. But Bbdim as the vii° chord of C minor.

Wait, earlier idea: C harmonic minor, vii° is Bdim. But Bb is a different note. Wait.

C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B

So the VII chord (B) would be B, D, F? Wait, B is the root, so B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third? B to D is minor third? B to C is a semitone, so B to D is a minor third. Yes, B to D: B, C, D – three semitones, yes. And D to F: also three semitones (D, Eb, F). So Bdim: B, D, F.

So in C harmonic minor, VII° is Bdim.

But the chord in question is Bbdim (B♭ dim), which is Bb, Db, Fb.

So if it's Bbdim, then it would be the VII° chord in the key of C# minor harmonic? Let's see.

C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#

So VII chord is B# which is C. So C diminished? C, Eb, Gb. So that's Cdim. Not Bb.

Alternatively, Bb dim as VII° chord: what key would have Bb as the leading tone? The key would be Bb minor – no, leading tone is raised seventh. Wait, in key of Bb major, the leading tone is A, so vii° chord is A dim. In C minor (harmonic), leading tone is B, vii° is B dim.

To get Bb as the leading tone, the key would be B natural minor? Wait, in scale, the leading tone is the seventh tone. So for a leading tone Bb, the scale would be A, Bb... but in minor scale: if we have A natural minor, the seventh is G. If harmonic minor, A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. So leading tone is G#.

To have Bb as the leading tone, it would be in a key where the tonic is Cb. Because in the key of Cb (B), the leading tone would be Bb.

But that's extremely rare in practice.

Alternatively, maybe it's not about the leading tone. Maybe the chords are from a different mode. Or perhaps the key has a lot of chromaticism.

But let's look at the Emaj7/Ab. E major 7 with Ab bass. Ab to E is a minor sixth? A to E is a fifth, but Ab is a semitone lower. The interval from Ab to E is an augmented fifth: Ab to E is Ab, A, Bb, B, C, D, E? Wait, Ab to E: Ab, A, Bb, B, C, D, E – that's 9 semitones. Which is a minor sixth (8 semitones) plus one more? Wait, no. Minor sixth is 8 semitones. A to F# is minor sixth (8 semitones), but Ab to E: let's count semitones.

Ab (A flat) to E: Ab to A is 1, A to A# (Bb) 2, Bb to B 3, B to C 4, C to C# (Db) 5, Db to D 6, D to D# 7, D# to E 8? No, actually:

Start from Ab:

Ab -> A: 1 semitone

A -> Bb: 2

Bb -> B: 3

B -> C: 4

C -> C#: 5

C# -> D: 6

D -> D#:7

D# -> E:8. So that's 8 semitones, which is a minor sixth interval.

But the chord has Emaj7 with Ab bass. So notes: Ab bass, then E, G#, B, D#. So the entire chord would have Ab, E, G#, B, D#. What kind of chord is that?

If we arrange the notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Let's order from lowest pitch: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. But Ab is lowest, then E would be higher than Ab? Ab to E is a minor sixth, but if it's Ab in bass, then the top notes are E, G#, B, D#. This seems like a highly dissonant chord.

Alternatively, maybe the chord is written as Emaj7/Ab meaning that it's E major 7, but with Ab in the bass – so inversion. But it's an unusual inversion. E major 7 is E, G#, B, D#. If bass is Ab, then the chord would be Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

But that chord can also be thought of as Abmaj7#5 or something else, but it's complicated.

Perhaps another angle: let's look at the progression as mostly Bbdim and Gb/Bb and Dbm/Ab.

Bbdim: B♭, D♭, F♭ (E)

Gb/Bb: if Gb is the chord, then Gb, Bb, Db.

Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb (E), Ab (but Ab in bass)

So if we list all the chord roots with their basses:

Bbdim (root B♭)

Gb/Bb (root Gb)

Dbm/Ab (root Db)

B/Bb (root B)

Emaj7/Ab (root E)

Now, let's see if there's a pattern in the roots. The roots are B♭, G♭, D♭, B, E. Not sure.

B♭ to G♭ is a tritone down (six semitones). G♭ to D♭ is a perfect fourth down? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the chords are related to Ab major scale.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb.

Chords:

I: Ab

II: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gbdim

Now, Gbdim is the vii° chord. But in the progression, we have Gb/Bb – if Gb is major chord, but in Ab major, vii° is diminished. So maybe they're using Gb major instead of diminished as a chromatic chord.

Similarly, Bbdim could be the ii chord if in a different context. Wait, in Ab major, the ii chord is Bbm, which is minor.

But we have Bbdim. If it's a diminished version, but not sure.

Another possibility: the progression is in Ab minor. Let's check.

Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

Chords:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: CbM (B)

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: FbM

VII: GbM

Wait, this looks promising.

Let's verify:

Ab minor (natural minor): Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb

So:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim (Bb, Db, Fb)

III: Cb major (which is B major in enharmonic)

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fbm (Ebm)

VII: Gb major

Yes! This fits quite well.

So in Ab minor scale, ii° chord is Bbdim. Which matches the Bbdim in the progression.

Also, the VII chord is Gb major. So Gb major chord.

Then Dbm chord is iv minor. Yes.

Now, let's check the other chords.

Dbm/Ab – in Ab minor key, the iv chord is Db minor. Dbm/Ab would mean Db minor chord with Ab bass. Since Db minor is Db, Fb, Ab. So Ab is the fifth of Db minor. So it's second inversion.

Yes, that would make sense.

Then B/Bb: what's that? B major with Bb bass. B chord would be B, D#, F#. Not sure. In Ab minor scale, what chord is B? B is the major third degree, but in natural minor, that's Cb. Wait, the third degree is Cb (B major enharmonic). Hmm. The note B in Ab minor natural would be Cb, but B is actually the enharmonic equivalent of Cb? Wait, Cb is a B natural. Wait, yes.

In Ab minor natural scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Cb is B natural enarmonic. So the third degree is Cb, which is the same pitch as B natural. So the III chord would be Cb major, which is enharmonic to B major.

So III chord in Ab minor is B major. So Bmaj. Then B/Bb would mean B major with Bb in bass. Which is first inversion of B major chord. Because B, D#, F# with bass Bb would be... Wait, B major triad is B, D#, F#. With Bb bass, the chord would be Bb, B, D#, F#. But that creates a minor 2nd between Bb and B. However, if the III chord is Bmaj, then in a chord context of Bmaj with Bb bass, that might be used as a passing chord or something.

Alternatively, maybe the B/Bb is actually referring to the Bb in the bass with the chord Bm or something else. But the slash notation says B/Bb, which is B major with Bb bass. Alternatively, it could be a typo.

Next, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7 with Ab bass. In Ab minor, what is the E chord? The VI chord is Fbm, which is Ebm enharmonic. But E major? Not sure.

Wait, in the Ab minor scale, the notes are Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb.

So Fb is E. So the VI chord is Fbm = Ebm. But the chord is Emaj7/Ab. So Emaj7 would be E major 7. E, G#, B, D#. But in key of Ab minor, does E belong?

Let's check the diatonic chords of Ab minor.

Natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

So chord on VI degree: the sixth scale degree is Fb, which is E natural. The chord would be Fbm = Fb, Ab, Cb. Which is Ebm (since Fb = E).

But Emaj7 has an F# or G#? Wait, Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. In the Ab minor scale, the notes present are Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb. So E is present. But G# – is G# part of Ab minor? No, natural minor has Gb (A flat). G# is F##, which is not in scale. So Emaj7 chord has G# which isn't diatonic to Ab minor.

Hmm. So maybe this is a borrowed chord or chromatic.

But let's check another thing. In Ab minor, the dominant chord for a cadence would usually be Ebm or maybe Eb major (if using harmonic minor), but here it's unclear.

Another idea: if it's Ab harmonic minor. Ab harmonic minor scale is: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G.

So the seventh scale degree is G natural (raised from natural minor Gb).

Then chords would be:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III+: CbM (B)

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fbm

VII: G major (since seventh scale degree is G natural)

So VII chord is G major.

But still, Emaj7 might not fit. But the note G# would need to be in the scale, which it isn't.

Alternatively, in Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G

But that's not standard.

Another thought: perhaps the key is Bb minor. Let's check.

Bb minor natural: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cb dim (B dim)

III: Db major

iv: Ebm

v: Fbm (Ebm)

VI: Gb major

VII: Ab major

Here, the II° chord would be Cb dim (which is Bdim). But in the actual progression, we have Bbdim. Which would be Bb diminished. If Bbdim is Bb, Db, Fb. In Bb minor scale, the iii chord is Db major (III), not diminished. So Bbdim doesn't fit.

Wait a second, looking back at the progression: there's a Gb/Bb and Dbm/Ab.

In Ab minor, Gb is the VII chord (natural minor), which is Gb major. So Gb major chord – yes. And Dbm is iv chord. Ab is the tonic root.

So if the bass line is moving between Bb and Ab for the chords:

- Bbdim chord (which is ii° in Ab minor) – yes.

- Gb/Bb: Gb chord with bass Bb. Gb has root Gb, so Bb is the third of Gb major. So Gb major chord with third in bass – first inversion.

Yes, Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. First inversion is Bb, Db, Gb. So written as Gb/Bb.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. Db minor is Db, Fb, Ab. So Ab is fifth, so second inversion.

B/Bb: in Ab minor, III chord is Cbm (Cb major), which is B major. So Bmaj chord. B/Bb could be B major with Bb bass. But as before, that's a bit odd.

Emaj7/Ab: in Ab minor, if we have Fbm (Eb minor), but Emaj7 is a different chord.

Wait, Emaj7 in context of Ab minor could be a borrowed chord from another mode. But let's see what the Emaj7 would be. E is Fb (enharmonic), so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is C minor. Let's check.

C minor natural: C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Dbdim

III: Ebmaj

iv: Fm

v: Gbm

VI: AbM

VII: BbM

Here, the VII chord is Bb major. So BbM chord.

If the progression has Bbdim – which would be same as C dim chord, but in C minor, ii° is Dbdim, not Bbdim.

But if the key is A minor:

A natural: A, B, C, D, E, F, G

Chords:

i: Am

ii°: Bdim

iii: C

iv: Dm

v: Em

VI: F

VII: G

But Bbdim is not here.

Wait, going back to the Ab minor idea. Let's list all the chords in Ab natural minor:

Tonic i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: CbM (B)

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fbm (Em)

VII: GbM

So all these chords: Bbdim (ii), GbM (VII), Dbm (iv), etc.

Now look at the progression:

"Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim"

- Bbdim: ii°

- Gb/Bb: VII chord in first inversion (since Gb major chord with Bb bass)

- Dbm/Ab: iv chord in second inversion (since Db minor chord with Ab as fifth)

- B/Bb: this would be the III chord (CbM/Bb). Cb major chord with Bb bass. So Cb, Eb, Gb with bass Bb → Bb, Cb, Eb, Gb. Which is first inversion of Cb major, but also could be seen as Eb minor 7 or something. But Cb major is same as B major, so B major chord, which has notes B, D#, F#. But with Bb in bass – Bb, B, D#, F# – that's very dissonant.

- Emaj7/Ab: In Ab minor, the VI chord is Fbm which is Ebm. But here it's Emaj7. E major 7. If we consider Fb (Eb) and E natural – but in Ab minor, the sixth degree is Fb, which is E natural. So VI chord is Fbm = E minor? Wait, Fbm is Fb, Ab, Cb. Which is Eb minor chord (enharmonic). But Emaj7 would be E, G#, B, D#. G# isn't in the scale. But Fbm is Eb minor, but if we're seeing Emaj7, that might be a different spelling.

Alternatively, if we consider the VI chord as E major? In a different context.

Wait, maybe the key is Ab major. But earlier analysis didn't fit. Wait, another idea.

If the key is Bb major, there's a Bbm7 to Gb chord etc. Not sure.

Wait, the bass note of the Emaj7/Ab chord is Ab. In Ab minor scale, Ab is tonic. So if the bass is Ab for the Emaj7 chord, but the chord is over Ab bass – but Ab is tonic, that would make it a tonic chord with some extension.

But Emaj7 with Ab bass: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. What chord is that? If we stack it: Ab bass, then E (minor sixth above Ab), then G# (major seventh above Ab), but this seems too dissonant.

Wait, maybe it's supposed to be Abmaj7? But it's written as Emaj7/Ab.

Alternatively, perhaps the Emaj7/Ab is a typo. Maybe it's Ebmaj7/Ab? Because in Ab minor, the III chord is Cb (B), but if it's Eb, which is in the scale.

Wait, Ebmaj7: Eb, G, Bb, D. With Ab bass: Ab, Eb, G, Bb, D. That would be Ab-7 (Ab, Cb, Eb, Gb), but modified.

This is confusing.

Let's try another approach. Let's list all the chord symbols and their roots:

- Bbdim: root Bb

- Gb/Bb: root Gb, bass Bb

- Dbm/Ab: root Db, bass Ab

- B/Bb: root B, bass Bb

- Emaj7/Ab: root E, bass Ab

Now, looking at the roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E.

Bb, Gb, Db all are descending by whole steps? Bb to Gb is a minor third down (Bb to Ab to Gb), which is a minor third interval. Bb to Gb is a flat fifth, or a tritone up.

Not obvious.

Wait, Gb, Db, Ab... Gb to Db is down a fifth (or up fourth), Db to Ab is down a fifth.

If we look at the circle of fifths: Gb is 6 flats, Db is 5 flats, Ab is 4 flats. So descending by fifths? Gb (Gb), Db (C#), Ab. Yes, descending by fifths: Gb -> Db -> Ab.

So the root movement of the chords might be in descending fifths.

If Gb, Db, Ab – each descending a fifth. Which would fit a circle of fifths progression.

But in the chord symbols, we have:

...Dbm/Ab (Db as root), then B/Bb (B root), then Emaj7/Ab (E root). Hmm.

Perhaps another way: let's assume that the progression is in Ab minor because of the Bbdim (ii°), Gb major (VII), Db minor (iv). And the Ab in bass of Dbm/Ab makes sense for iv chord in Ab minor.

Then B/Bb – B major chord with Bb bass. If III chord is Cb = B major, then the Cb major chord would have notes Cb, Eb, Gb. With bass Bb? That seems odd. Or if bass note is Bb, for Cb major chord first inversion would be Eb, Gb, Cb. But bass Bb isn't part of it.

Alternatively, maybe the "B/Bb" is a typo for "Bb/Bb" which would be Bb major or something. But not sure.

Emaj7/Ab: if key is Ab minor, the only E available would be Fb = E. So if the VI chord is Fbm, which could be written as Em, but Emaj7 would be different.

But if Emaj7 has G#, which isn't in Ab minor, unless they're using the harmonic minor where G# is present.

Let's check Ab harmonic minor.

Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G

Scale notes: Ab, Bb, B (Cb), Db, Eb, F (Fb), G

So Fb here is E.

Now, the chords:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim (Bb, Db, Fb)

III+: Cb (B) major

iv: Dbm

v: Ebdim or perhaps Eb major? In harmonic minor, v chord is usually minor (because raised seventh affects V chord). Wait, in harmonic minor, the V chord is major because seventh is raised.

Wait, in Ab harmonic minor scale: notes are Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G.

So the fifth degree (Eb) chord: for v chord, we take Eb, Gb, Bb (but Gb is not in scale). Wait, the scale has Db, Eb, Fb (E), G.

Wait, V chord in harmonic minor is major. So for Ab minor harmonic, V chord should be Eb major.

Let's build the chord on Eb: Eb, G, Bb. But in the scale, the sixth degree is Fb (E), seventh is G. So Eb major chord: Eb, G, Bb. Yes, because Eb to G is major third, G to Bb is minor third. Yes, so V chord is Eb major.

Similarly, the vii° chord would be G, Bb, Db – G diminished. But we don't have that.

Now, the VI chord is on Fb (E), so chord is Fb, Ab, Cb → which is E minor chord (since Fb = E). But if it's a major VI chord? No, in harmonic minor, the VI is minor.

But in the progression, there's Emaj7. If the VI chord is Em, then Emaj7 would be E, G#, B, D#. But the scale doesn't have G# (it's Ab harmonic minor has G natural), so G# isn't there. So still an issue.

Wait, Ab harmonic minor scale has G natural, not G#. So G# would be chromatic.

But let's suppose we consider the Emaj7/Ab chord. If bass is Ab, and the chord is Emaj7, which has G#, that G# would be a chromatic note.

This is getting too convoluted. Let's think outside the box.

Another idea: Bbdim chord. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or for chromaticism.

Looking at the chord progression, it starts with Bbdim repeated, then Gb/Bb – which is essentially Gb major with Bb bass, then Dbm/Ab (Db minor with Ab bass). So moving from Bb dim to Gb major to Db minor.

In terms of Roman numerals, what would that be? In a key where:

- Bbdim is ii°

- Gb major is VII

- Db minor is iv.

Which fits Ab minor natural minor.

Yes! For Ab natural minor:

- ii° = Bbdim

- VII = Gb major

- iv = Db minor

So the chords fit perfectly.

Then "B/Bb" would likely be the III chord. In Ab minor natural, III is Cb major (which is B major). So B major chord. B/Bb as bass note would mean B major with Bb as bass, which is unusual but possible as some type of inversion or passing chord.

Then Emaj7/Ab: maybe the VI chord. In Ab natural minor, VI is Fbm (E minor), but here it's Emaj7, so maybe it's a major seventh chord on the VI degree. But in natural minor, VI chord is minor, so Emaj7 would be from harmonic minor? Or it's an error.

Alternatively, maybe the sixth degree in this context is E major, but in the key of Ab minor, the VI is Fb minor. But if they're writing it as Emaj7, perhaps Fbm as E minor but then adding major seventh – but E minor seventh would be E, G, B, D, not maj7.

Wait, Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. If it's a major seventh chord on VI, but in Ab minor, that's non-diatonic.

But perhaps in context of the progression, it's a borrowed chord.

Alternatively, could the key be B minor?

B natural minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A

Chords:

i: Bm

ii°: C#dim

III: D

iv: Em

v: F#m

VI: G

VII: A

Not really fitting. Bbdim doesn't fit.

Another angle: look at Dbm/Ab as the fourth degree in a key with Ab tonic. Yes, Ab tonic, Db minor is the IV chord.

The Gb chord would be VII in Ab minor. Yes.

So Ab minor key. Tonic: Ab minor.

Chord functions:

- Bbdim: ii° (supertonic diminished)

- Gb/Bb: VII chord (Gb major) in first inversion

- Dbm/Ab: iv chord (Db minor) in second inversion

- B/Bb: III chord (Cb major/B major) – but why would it have Bb bass?

- Emaj7/Ab: VI chord? If VI is Fbm (Eb minor), but Emaj7 is not matching. Unless they consider the VI chord as E major, but that's not natural.

Wait, if the key is Cb major? That's highly unusual.

Cb major: Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb

Chords:

I: Cbm

No. I: Cb major

But Cb major has a lot of flats, and Bbb = A natural. Not likely.

Let's consider that maybe the B/Bb is actually meant to be Bb. Like a typo. If it were "Bb" instead of "B/Bb", then Bb could be bVII of Ab minor, which is common. Because in Ab minor, bVII would be Gb, but if it's Bb, that's the minor supertonic? Not quite.

Bb in Ab minor is second scale degree. Bb is the root of the ii°, but it's a minor chord.

Wait, in Ab minor, Bb is the second degree, which forms the Bbdim chord. Not sure.

Alternatively, consider that B/Bb is a B major chord with Bb bass – this could be a chromatic passing chord between Bb and B or something. But still.

The Emaj7/Ab chord. If we look at it in the context of Ab, the chord Emaj7 might be considered as a chord with root E. But in Ab minor, E is the sixth degree (Fb). So maybe it's a VI chord. If it's Emaj7, that would be unusual, but perhaps in the key of Ab minor, using a major seventh chord on VI (which is usually minor in natural minor).

But it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a key of E minor, but not sure.

Wait, another idea: the chord progression has a lot of Bbdim, which in some contexts can be a ii° of C minor, but also, Bbdim can be used as a diminished passing chord.

But let's tally up all the possible key centers.

If we have chords like Bbdim, Gb, Dbm, Ab bass – it's very likely that the tonic is Ab. Because the Dbm chord has Ab in bass, which is the fifth of Db minor, but in context of Ab tonic, Dbm would be the iv chord.

Yes, definitely. In Ab minor:

- Tonic: Abm

- ii°: Bbdim

- IV: Dbm

- VII: GbM

So the progression has Bbdim for ii°, GbM for VII, Dbm for iv. This makes sense.

For example, a common phrase in minor keys might be ii° - VII - iv. Which is exactly what we have here.

So the chords would be:

Bbdim (ii°), Gb/M7 (but wait, Gb is VII, which in minor is normally major chord).

Yes. In natural minor, the VII is major chord.

So in Ab minor:

- ii°: Bb, Db, Fb

- VII: Gb, Bb, Db

- iv: Db, Fb, Ab

So all fitting.

Now the B/Bb – in the key of Ab minor, this could be the III chord: Cb major = B major. So III chord. So B major chord. And B/Bb might be a way of writing the first inversion, but it's a bit odd. However, B major chord in first inversion would be D# major triad with B as bass. No, first inversion of B major is D# F# B. So bass D#. Not related to Bb.

Alternatively, if it's a Bb bass note with B chord, it might be B major with added minor second or something.

But perhaps it's a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be Bb/Bb, but unlikely.

Emaj7/Ab: If it's VI chord. In Ab minor, VI is Fbm. But written as Emaj7, which could be a typo. If it's Ebmaj7/Ab or Fbm/Ab, that would make sense. But Fbm as E minor. Hmm.

Alternatively, in context of the key Ab minor, the tone A is present (Ab is tonic), so E is sixth degree (Fb). But if they write Emaj7, it's using E natural instead of Fb. But in practice, sometimes the VI minor chord is voiced as Em for simplicity in writing.

Wait, Fbm is spelled with Fb, but in reality, it's the same as E minor. So Fbm = E minor chord. Yes! Exactly. Because Fb is E natural, so Fbm = E minor. Similarly, Fb = E.

So if the scale is Ab minor, the sixth degree is Fb (E), and the minor chord on it is E minor (Fbm), which is written as Em in practice for simplicity. So if they write "Emaj7/Ab", it might be a mistake, and perhaps it's supposed to be E minor 7 or Em. But it's written as Emaj7.

But perhaps in the key of Ab minor, the vi chord is Em, which could have a major seventh added. However, Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. But in Ab minor, the natural minor has Gb, so G# is a chromatic note. But in harmonic minor, the seventh is raised, so G natural. So if we're in Ab harmonic minor, then the vi chord (E minor) would have a G natural, not G#.

This is still messy. But given the other chords fit perfectly in Ab minor, even if Emaj7 is a bit outside, maybe the key is Ab minor.

So summarizing:

- Bbdim: ii° (supertonic diminished)

- Gb chord: VII

- Dbm: iv

- Ab bass in many places suggests tonic Ab.

Yes. Even with Emaj7, which may be a typo or a chromatic chord, the overall structure points to Ab minor.

Also, the bass movement throughout often includes Ab and Bb, which are tonic and supertonic notes in Ab minor.

Another check: Emaj7/Ab. If the key is Ab minor, and someone wrote Emaj7/Ab thinking it's related to E chord, but perhaps it's a secondary dominant or something else.

Alternatively, if Ab is tonic, and Emaj7 is a borrowed chord from another scale. For example, Eb major's V chord is Bb7, not sure.

Alternatively, Emaj7 could be the V chord of Am, but not sure.

But given all that, the most likely key is Ab minor.

But modes: the key is minor, so natural minor mode. But sometimes people consider minor key as Aeolian mode.

So key: Ab minor, mode: Aeolian.

But let's verify the exact mode.

In Western music theory, minor key usually refers to the Aeolian mode, but sometimes they use harmonic or melodic minor for cadences.

But the diatonic scale for natural minor is Aeolian.

So if the chords fit the natural minor, then it's Ab Aeolian.

Now, let's confirm each chord:

- Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb (Eb? Wait no: Bb diminished triad: Bb, Db, Fb. Fb is E. So yes. In Ab natural minor scale: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb. Yes, Bb is ii, and the triad on Bb is Bb, Db, Fb – diminished.

- Gb major: VII chord. Gb, Bb, Db. Yes.

- Db minor: iv chord. Db, Fb, Ab. Yes.

- The bass note of Dbm/Ab is Ab, which is the fifth of Db minor, so that fits.

- B/Bb might be III chord: Cb major (B major), but in the Ab natural minor scale, the third degree is Cb (B), and chord is Cb major. Which would be spelled Cb, Eb, Gb. But written as B major chord: B, D#, F#. But in key of Ab minor, we're using Cb instead of B. But it's common in notation to write B major instead of Cb for simplicity, even though the scale degrees are different.

So B/Bb could be the III chord in first inversion but not sure.

Then Emaj7/Ab: if the VI chord is Fbm = Em, and if they wrote Emaj7 instead of just Em or Em7, it's possible a typo. Or perhaps Fbm7 or something. If it's meant to be the VI chord as E minor with major seventh, but that's non-standard.

But overall, the chord progression fits very well in Ab minor. So the key is Ab minor, and the mode is Aeolian (natural minor).

Alternatively, to confirm the key signature: Ab minor has four flats in key signature: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. So key signature of Ab minor is four flats.

But yes, that makes sense.

Thus, the key should be Ab minor, and the mode is Aeolian (natural minor).

But sometimes in practice, people just say key of Ab minor, and the mode is implied. But the question says "determine key and mode".

So key is Ab minor, mode Aeolian. Or key and mode are both specified.

Another point: when a piece uses natural minor scale, the mode is Aeolian. If it uses harmonic or melodic, it's different. But unless there's evidence of raised seventh or raised sixth, the default is Aeolian.

Given that the VII chord is major (Gb major), which in natural minor is already major, because seventh degree is Gb in natural minor. Wait, in Ab natural minor scale:

Notes: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

So seventh scale degree is Gb. So chord on Gb is Gb, Bb, Db (Gb major chord). Which is correct for natural minor. In natural minor, the VII chord is major. Which matches. So yes, this is the natural minor (Aeolian) mode.

So all signs point to Ab minor, Aeolian mode.

To recap:

- Bbdim = ii°

- Gb major = VII

- Dbm = iv

- The presence of Ab in the bass (especially as chord root or bass note) confirms Ab tonic.

- The chords fit the diatonic scale of Ab natural minor (Aeolian).

Thus, the key is Ab minor with mode Aeolian.

But let's check if there's another possible key. For example, if the key was Gb major, but let's see.

Gb major has key signature of six flats: Gb Ab Bbb Cb Db Eb Fb.

Chords: I Gb, ii Abm, iii Bbb (A), IV Cb, V Db, vi Ebm, vii° Fbdim.

Not matching the progression.

If key was Bb minor, as before, doesn't fit Bbdim.

So yes, Ab minor is the best fit.

Final answer: The key is Ab minor, and the mode is Aeolian.

The chord progression provided contains several key clues that point to a specific key and mode. Let's break it down systematically:

---

### **Step 1: Analyze the Chord Symbols**
The progression is:  
**Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**

- **Bbdim**: B♭ diminished triad (B♭, D♭, F♭/E).  
- **Gb/Bb**: G♭ major triad with B♭ in the bass (first inversion of G♭ major).  
- **Dbm/Ab**: D♭ minor triad with A♭ in the bass (second inversion of D♭ minor).  
- **B/Bb**: B major triad with B♭ in the bass (unusual, but likely a chromatic passing chord or typo).  
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7th chord with A♭ in the bass (highly chromatic, but consistent with a key centered on A♭).

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Tonic and Scale**
#### **Key Signature Clues**
- **Bbdim** is the **ii° chord** in the **A♭ minor scale** (natural minor).  
- **Gb/Bb** (G♭ major) is the **VII chord** in A♭ minor (chord on the **7th degree**).  
- **Dbm/Ab** (D♭ minor) is the **iv chord** in A♭ minor (chord on the **4th degree**).  
- A♭ appears consistently as a **bass note** (e.g., Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab), confirming A♭ as the **tonic**.  
- The progression resolves around **A♭**, with descending fifths (Gb → Db → Ab) and a clear harmonic structure centered on A♭ minor.

#### **Scale Compatibility**
The **A♭ natural minor scale (Aeolian mode)** includes the following notes:  
**A♭, B♭, C♭ (B), D♭, E♭, F♭ (E), G♭**

This matches:
- **Bbdim (ii°)**: B♭, D♭, F♭ → *B♭, D♭, E* (enharmonically F♭ = E).  
- **Gb major (VII)**: G♭, B♭, D♭ → fits perfectly.  
- **Dbm (iv)**: D♭, F♭, A♭ → fits perfectly.  
- **Emaj7/Ab**: While E major 7 (E, G♯, B, D♯) is chromatic in A♭ minor (G♯ is outside the scale), it’s consistent with **chromatic embellishment** typical in minor keys. Alternatively, this may be a mislabeling of **Em (E minor)** or **E♭m7**, which aligns with **F♭ minor (VI chord)** in A♭ minor (where F♭ = E).

#### **B/Bb Chord**
- B major with B♭ bass is unusual in A♭ minor, likely due to **chromatic passing tone** or a typo. In context, it may represent the **III chord (C♭ major)**, spelled as B major for simplicity.

---

### **Step 3: Determine Mode**
- The **A♭ natural minor scale** is the **Aeolian mode**.  
- The progression uses **diatonic chords** from A♭ minor (ii°, VII, iv), which is standard for Aeolian.  
- There’s **no evidence of raised 7th (G♯)** or **raised 6th (F♯)**, ruling out Harmonic or Melodic Minor.  

---

### **Conclusion**
The chord progression is consistent with the **A♭ minor (Aeolian) mode**. The tonic is **A♭**, and the harmonic structure aligns with the natural minor scale.

- **Key**: **A♭ minor**  
- **Mode**: **Aeolian**

This is confirmed by:
- Bbdim as ii° (supertonic diminished),  
- Gb major as VII (major chord on the 7th degree),  
- Dbm as iv (subdominant minor),  
- Consistent use of A♭ as a tonal center (bass notes and implied resolution).  

---

### **Final Answer**
**Key: A♭ minor  
Mode: Aeolian**
