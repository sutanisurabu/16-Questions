Let's carefully analyze the chord progression:

**Progression:**
```
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb –
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim
```

### 1. Identify the chords and spell them

| Chord | Spelling | Notes |
|:------|:----------|:------|
| **Bbdim** | Bb – Db – E (enharmonic Fb) | diminished triad (implies A major/C major distance) |
| **Gb/Bb** | Gb – Bb – Db | Gb major in 1st inversion |
| **Dbm/Ab** | Db – Fb – Ab | Db minor in 1st inversion |
| **B/Bb** | B – D# – F# over Bb | This is interesting, like a B major triad over Bb (sort of a “Lydian-type” tension chord) |
| **Emaj7/Ab** | E – G# – B – D# over Ab | basically Emaj7 with Ab in the bass (sounds like C#min7♭5 / Ab if reinterpreted) |

### 2. Recognize tonal center or gravity

- **Gb** and **Dbm** both suggest *Gb major / Gb minor* environment (Db is the V of Gb).
- **Bbdim** → notes Bb–Db–E (enharmonic Fb). That can function as **vii° of Cb / Gb**, because Bb° is the leading-tone diminished chord to **Cb minor** (the vi in Gb major).

Note the prominent **Gb/Bb** chords – they appear repeatedly and are the only major stable sonority.  
**Bbdim** alternates with **Gb/Bb**, giving a feeling of **passing diminished** function between I (Gb) and its leading-tone.

So already the **sound world is Gb major**, or possibly **Gb Mixolydian** because of later chords.

### 3. Examine the special chords

- **Dbm/Ab**: functions nicely as **ii in Gb minor** (Dbm – Gbm relationship).
- **B/Bb** and **Emaj7/Ab** both add bright color (likely borrowed or secondary functions).  
  Especially **Emaj7/Ab**, which shares many tones with **Abm7** (Ab–B–E–G# — enharmonically Ab–Cb–Fb–G: fits minor region).

### 4. Overall motion and feel

The constant **Bbdim ⇄ Gb/Bb** exchange points toward a tonic (Gb) with a neighbor diminished color (the vii°/Gb). The **Bbdim** lacks an Ab note (the leading tone to Bb), implying the #i diminished version of tonic—common in major keys.

The **Dbm/Ab** section confirms the **Gb** tonal hub, since Dbm can act as a **ii** or **v**-related chord.

✅ **Likely Key:** **G♭ Major**

**Mode:** Ionian (major), though the use of diminished and altered chords gives it a chromatic, jazzy flavor.

You could also hear moments of **G♭ Lydian** or **G♭ Mixolydian** depending on voicing, but the primary center is **G♭ Major (Ionian).**

### **Final Answer**
- **Key:** G♭ major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (Major) with chromatic diminished passing chords
