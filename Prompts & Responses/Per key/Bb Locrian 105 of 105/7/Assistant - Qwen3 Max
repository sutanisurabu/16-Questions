The chord progression you provided is:

**Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim**

This is a highly chromatic and ambiguous progression that doesn’t strongly conform to a traditional diatonic key. However, let’s analyze it step by step to infer a likely tonal center and mode.

---

### Step 1: Identify the most recurring chord
- **Bbdim** appears very frequently—**10 times** out of 16 chords.
- This strongly suggests **Bb** as a tonal center or at least a central pitch.

### Step 2: Analyze the nature of Bbdim
- Bbdim = Bb – Db – E – G (enharmonically, E = F♭; G = A𝄫 in strict spelling, but often thought as Bb–Db–E–G).
- A diminished chord is symmetrical (built in minor thirds), so it’s inherently ambiguous and can resolve in multiple directions.
- However, repeated use implies it’s being treated as a **tonic function**, possibly in a diminished or altered context.

### Step 3: Look at other chords
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db) with Bb in the bass. This is **Bb minor 7♭5** (Bb–Db–Gb–Bb → Bb–Db–Gb = half-diminished: Bbø).
- **Dbm/Ab**: Db minor (Db–Fb–Ab) over Ab → spells **Ab7** (Ab–C–Eb–Gb), but here it’s Ab in bass with Dbm = Ab–Db–Fb = **Ab7♭9♭13** or **Dbm/Ab** as a modal interchange.
- **B/Bb**: B major over Bb bass → highly dissonant; this is **B/Bb = Bb in bass with B major (B–D#–F#)** → implies **Bb with #9 and #11**, possibly a **tritone substitution** or altered dominant.
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7 (E–G#–B–D#) over Ab bass → Ab = G#, so this is enharmonically **Emaj7/G#**, which is the **third inversion of Emaj7**, functioning as a **V7/vi in G# minor** or **secondary dominant**, but in this context over Bb, it’s **extremely chromatic**.

### Step 4: Consider possible keys
Given the prominence of **Bb**, Db, Gb (which are all part of the **Gb major / E♭ minor** key signature), but also the symmetrical nature of diminished harmony, consider:

- **Bb diminished scale** (half-whole or whole-half)?
  - Bb half-whole diminished scale: Bb–B–Db–D–E–F–G–Ab–(Bb)
  - Contains: Bb, Db, E (F♭), G → matches Bbdim.
  - Gb = F# is **not** in this scale, but enharmonically, F# = G♭ appears as the **#4 / ♭5**—which is **not** in the standard diminished scale. However, **Gb** can be interpreted as **F#**, the major third of **D major**, which doesn’t help.

- Alternatively, think **jazz/neo-soul chromaticism**: frequent use of **diminished chords as passing chords** or **tritone substitutions**.

But note: **Gb/Bb = Bbø7** → this is the **iiø7** chord in **Ab minor** (Ab natural minor: Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb).
- In **Ab minor**, the chords would be:
  - iiø7 = Bbø7 → matches Gb/Bb (since Gb = F#, but in Ab minor, the 6th is Fb, not F#... wait).
  - Actually, in **Ab harmonic minor**: Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–G → so G natural, not Gb.
  - So **Gb** doesn't fit Ab minor.

Wait—what if we **reinterpret enharmonically**?

### Step 5: Enharmonic reinterpretation
- **Bbdim = Ao7** (A diminished 7th): A–C–Eb–G♭
- **Gb = F#**, so **F#/A** = F# major over A → that’s **D#maj7/A**... messy.

But notice: **Emaj7/Ab** → Ab = G#, so this is **Emaj7/G#**, which is **C#m9** without the 5th (C#–E–G#–B–D# = C#m9). So perhaps **C# minor**?

But **Bbdim** is far from C# minor.

Alternative idea: **Polytonality or atonality**—but the repetition of Bbdim suggests a center.

### Step 6: Consider Phrygian or Locrian mode
- If **Bb** is tonic, what mode has Bb as root and includes Db, Gb, etc.?
  - **Bb Locrian**: Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab → very rare, unstable (diminished tonic).
  - **Bb Phrygian**: Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab → includes Gb and Db, but Cb is problematic (not used in progression).

But we don’t see **Cb**, so maybe not.

### Step 7: Jazz/Modern context — Diminished as Tonic
In some modern jazz or film scoring, **a diminished chord can be used as a tonic**, especially in **octatonic (diminished) scale** contexts.

The **Bb half-whole diminished scale** (used over diminished chords on strong beats) is:
**Bb–B–Db–D–E–F–G–Ab**

Check other chords:
- **Gb** = F# → **not in this scale** (scale has F natural, G, but not F#/Gb).
- **Dbm** = Db–Fb–Ab → Fb = E, which **is** in the scale (E is the 5th note).
  - So Dbm = Db–E–Ab → all in Bb half-whole diminished.
- **Emaj7** = E–G#–B–D# → G# = Ab (in scale), D# = Eb (not in scale; scale has D natural and E, but not Eb).
  - But **D# = Eb**, and **Eb is not in Bb half-whole diminished** (it has D natural and E natural).
  - So Emaj7 is **outside** the scale.

However, **Emaj7/Ab** = G# in bass, so G#–E–G#–B–D# → this is **E major over G#**, which is the **third inversion**, and G# = Ab is in the Bb diminished scale.

But D# = Eb is **not** in the Bb half-whole diminished scale.

Wait—**Bb whole-half diminished scale**:
Bb–C–Db–Eb–E–F#–G–A

Now check:
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–E–G → all present.
- Gb = F# → present.
- Dbm = Db–Fb(=E)–Ab(=G#?) → G# not in scale (scale has G natural and A).
- Ab = G# → **not** in whole-half (has G natural and A).

Hmm.

### Step 8: Look at voice leading
- Bbdim → Gb/Bb: Bb stays in bass, chord changes from Bb–Db–E–G to Bb–Db–Gb.
  - E → Gb is a **chromatic move** (E–F–Gb), common in diminished resolution.
- Dbm/Ab → B/Bb: Ab → Bb (bass up a whole step), chord Dbm → B major = **chromatic mediant** or tritone sub.

This progression uses **chromatic planing** and **diminished harmony** more than functional tonality.

### Conclusion

Given:
- Extreme chromaticism
- Bbdim as pedal/central chord
- Use of chords like Emaj7/Ab and B/Bb (highly altered)

The most plausible explanation is that this is **centered on Bb**, using the **Bb half-whole diminished scale** (octatonic), with occasional **borrowed or passing chromatic chords**.

Thus:

- **Tonal center**: **Bb**
- **Mode**: **Half-whole diminished (octatonic)** — not a traditional mode, but a synthetic scale.
- If forced to name a "key," it's **Bb diminished**, functioning in a **symmetrical diminished context**.

In jazz theory, this would be described as **Bb°7 as tonic**, using the **Bb half-whole diminished scale**.

✅ **Final Answer**:
- **Tonal center**: B♭  
- **Mode/Scale**: **B♭ half-whole diminished (octatonic) scale**  
- Not in a traditional major/minor key; it’s **chromatic/diminished-based harmony**.
