The chord progression you've provided is:

**Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim**

To determine the key and mode, we need to analyze the harmonic and voice-leading relationships. This is a bit unusual, as it heavily features diminished chords and non-diatonic bass notes, suggesting either modal interchange, chromaticism, or a more modern/jazz-influenced harmonic language.

---

### Step 1: Look for a tonal center
The **Bbdim chord appears very frequently**—in fact, it appears **9 times** in 16 chords. This strongly suggests **Bb** is a central pitch, possibly the tonic.

Also, many chords are **inversions with Bb in the bass**:
- Gb/Bb
- B/Bb
So Bb appears often in the bass, reinforcing its importance.

Thus, **Bb is likely the tonal center**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze chord qualities and possible scales

Let’s look at the chords in terms of Bb:

- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–E–G (fully diminished 7th if extended: Bb–Db–E–G)
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major chord (Gb–Bb–Db) in root position, but written as Gb/Bb just to emphasize Bb in bass
- **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor (Db–E–Ab) over Ab bass → Ab–Db–E (which is enharmonically Ab–Db–Fb? Wait: Db minor = Db–E–Ab? No: Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab. But E = Fb enharmonically.)
- **B/Bb** = B major over Bb bass → Bb–B–D#–F# – extremely dissonant, chromatic
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G#–B–D# over Ab bass

These last two chords (**B/Bb** and **Emaj7/Ab**) are highly chromatic and non-diatonic.

---

### Step 3: Consider diminished symmetry

The **Bbdim7 chord** is a **fully diminished 7th chord**, which is **symmetrical** (built in minor 3rds). It can resolve to **four different dominant chords**, and is often used in jazz as a **passing or substitute dominant**.

The notes of Bbdim7: **Bb–Db–E–G**

These are the same as:
- Dbdim7 (Db–E–G–Bb)
- Edim7 (E–G–Bb–Db)
- Gdim7 (G–Bb–Db–E)

Each can act as a **leading-tone chord** to a dominant or tonic:
- E°7 → F (E is leading tone to F)
- G°7 → Ab
- Bb°7 → B (very unusual)
- Db°7 → D

But in your case, **Bbdim** keeps returning, not resolving traditionally.

---

### Step 4: Look at Gb/Bb

**Gb major** contains **Gb, Bb, Db** — all of which are in the **Bb Aeolian (natural minor)** scale:
- Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

So **Gb major** is the **bVI chord** in Bb minor.

**Db minor** is the **bIII** in Bb minor.

So far, **Bb natural minor (Aeolian)** fits Gb and Dbm.

But then we have:
- **B/Bb**: B major chord = B–D#–F# → all **chromatic** relative to Bb minor
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major = E–G#–B–D# → also **foreign**

However, **Emaj7** can be seen as a **V7 of A**, and **A** is the **V of D**, but not obviously related to Bb.

But consider **Emaj7/Ab**: the bass is **Ab**, which is the **b7 of Bb**.

Emaj7 contains **G#**, which is **enharmonic to Ab** — so this chord may be using **tritone substitution** or **chromatic mediant** relationships.

---

### Step 5: Consider Octatonic or Diminished Scale

Given the heavy use of **Bbdim**, and the presence of **chromatic major chords (B, E)**, this may be using the **half-whole diminished scale** (octatonic) centered on Bb.

**Bb half-whole diminished scale**:  
Bb – B – Db – D – E – F – G – Ab – (Bb)

This scale contains:
- Bbdim7 (Bb–Db–E–G)
- B major (B–D#–F#) → D# = Eb, F# = Gb → not quite, but B is in the scale
- E major (E–G#–B) → G# = Ab (in scale), B = B (in scale), E = E (in scale)

So **E major** and **B major** can both come from the **Bb half-whole diminished scale**!

Similarly, **Gb major** (Gb–Bb–Db) — Gb = F#, which is **not in the Bb half-whole scale** (which has G, not Gb). Hmm.

Wait: Bb half-whole: **Bb, B, Db, D, E, F, G, Ab**

No **Gb (F#)**, so Gb major is not native to this scale.

But **Gb** is **enharmonic to F#**, which is not in the scale—but **G** is. So maybe not.

Alternatively, consider that **Gb/Bb** is just a **Bb minor chord with a b6** in the melody: Bb–Db–Gb = Bb–b3–b6 = characteristic of **Bb Aeolian**.

So perhaps the progression **mixes Bb Aeolian with chromatic/diminished color**.

---

### Step 6: Final assessment

- **Tonal center**: Bb (strongly implied by repetition and bass usage)
- **Modal flavor**: Primarily **Bb Aeolian (natural minor)**, given Gb (bVI) and Dbm (bIII)
- **Chromatic alterations**: Use of **Bbdim** as a pedal or embellishment, and **Emaj7/Ab** and **B/Bb** as **chromatic passing chords** or **tritone substitutions**
- The presence of **Emaj7** (E–G#–B–D#) over **Ab** (G#) suggests **enharmonic reinterpretation**: Ab = G#, so **Emaj7/Ab = Ab7#9 or altered dominant**?

In fact, **Emaj7** and **Ab7** share the same tritone (G#–D# = Ab–D#), so **Emaj7/Ab could be heard as Ab7#5 or Ab7alt**, which would be the **bVII7** in Bb minor — a common chord in jazz minor or Dorian.

Wait: **Ab7** is the **bVII7** in Bb, and **Ab7** can support the **Bb Dorian or Aeolian** sound.

But **Emaj7** is not Ab7 — unless reinterpreted enharmonically.

However, **Emaj7/Ab = Ab bass + E major** = Ab–E–G#–B–D# → this is a **polychord**: Ab in bass, E major on top. This is a **highly dissonant, modern jazz** sonority, possibly implying **Ab7#9#5** or **altered dominant**.

---

### Conclusion

- **Key center**: **Bb**
- **Most likely mode**: **Bb Aeolian (natural minor)** as the harmonic foundation
- **But with heavy use of chromaticism, diminished chords, and possible octatonic/diminished scale color**
- The progression does **not stay strictly diatonic**, so it’s **modal mixture** or **post-tonal** with a Bb pedal

> **Answer**: The progression is **centered on Bb**, with a **modal flavor of Bb Aeolian (natural minor)**, enriched by **chromatic diminished harmony** and **non-diatonic major chords** typical of jazz or modern harmonic practices.
