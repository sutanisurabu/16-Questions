This chord progression:

> **Bbdim - Bbdim - Gb/Bb - Gb/Bb - Bbdim - Bbdim - Dbm/Ab - B/Bb - Bbdim - Bbdim - Gb/Bb - Gb/Bb - Bbdim - Bbdim - Emaj7/Ab - Bbdim**

is rich in chromaticism and diminished harmony, but we can determine the **key and mode** by analyzing **tonal center**, **function**, and **voice leading**.

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their functions

Let’s spell out the chords and analyze them:

#### 1. **Bbdim** = B♭ - D♭ - F♭ (or E)  
→ This is a **B diminished triad**. Commonly used as **ii° in C minor**, or **vii° in C major**, or as a passing/violin chord.

But in this context, it’s repeated and tied to B♭-centered harmonies.

#### 2. **Gb/Bb** = B♭ in bass, Gb major triad on top → **Gb major / B♭** = **B♭ - D - Gb**  
→ This is a **Gb major chord with B♭ in bass** = **Gb major 1st inversion**.

Note: **Gb = F#**, so this is **F# major / B**? No — B♭ is spelled B♭, so we're in **flat land**.

Wait — **Gb major triad = Gb - Bb - Db**

But you wrote **Gb/Bb** → so bass is **Bb**, chord is **Gb major** → **Bb - Gb - Db** → that’s **Gb major triad in first inversion**.

But **Gb major + Bb bass** = chords notes: **Bb (bass), Gb, Db**

→ Bb is the **5th** of Gb major → yes, that’s 1st inversion.

So Gb/Bb = **Gb major 1st inversion**

But **Gb major** is **enharmonic to F# major**, but we’re using flats — so we'll stick with flats.

#### 3. **Dbm/Ab** = Ab in bass, Db minor triad → chord tones: **Ab - Db - Fb (E)**  
→ This is **Db minor chord in 1st inversion**

#### 4. **B/Bb** = B in bass, Bb chord on top? → That doesn’t make sense unless it’s a **B major chord with Bb bass**, which would be **B major / Bb** = Bb - B - D# - F#? That’s a **dissonant cluster**.

Wait — **B/Bb** — this is likely a **B major chord with Bb in the bass**? That would be **B major over Bb**, meaning bass = Bb, upper structure = B major triad = B - D# - F#.

So chord: **Bb - B - D# - F#**

This is a **highly dissonant chord** — a **minor 9th apart** between Bb and B — it’s essentially **B major with a flattened 9th** — or **B(add♭9)**, or perhaps **B7♭9** without the 5th? But there's no F natural.

Actually, this is more likely a **notation error or shorthand**.

But let’s consider possibility: **B/Bb** might mean **B major chord**, with **Bb in the bass** → **B major / B♭**

This would imply **B major triad (B, D#, F#) + Bb bass** → which creates:

- **Bb (bass)**
- **B (root of chord)**
- D#
- F#

→ So tones: **Bb, B, D#, F#**

This is an **augmented major 7th chord?** No.

Actually, this is **B major with a ♭9** — **Badd♭9** (but with no 5th or 7th).

In jazz or modern contexts, this is a **"B major 7#11"**? Not really.

This chord is **extremely chromatic** — and it’s likely meant to be a **passing chord** or **color chord**.

But here’s a better interpretation:

### Re-examining: What is the most tonally centered pitch?

Look at the **bass notes**:

> **Bb - Bb - Bb - Bb - Bb - Bb - Ab - Bb - Bb - Bb - Bb - Bb - Bb - Bb - Ab - Bb**

**ALL bass notes are either Bb or Ab!**

This strongly suggests **Bb** is the **tonal center**.

Let’s list the bass notes in order:

1. Bb  
2. Bb  
3. Bb  
4. Bb  
5. Bb  
6. Bb  
7. **Ab**  
8. **Bb**  
9. Bb  
10. Bb  
11. Bb  
12. Bb  
13. Bb  
14. Bb  
15. **Ab**  
16. Bb  

So **Ab appears twice**, all others are Bb. So Bb is **overwhelmingly** the tonic bass note.

So — **the key is likely Bb minor or Bb major?**

But we have **Bbdim** chords — diminished chords on Bb — which in a major key would be unusual unless as vii°.

Let’s try to interpret the chords as **extensions or pedal point** over Bb bass.

---

### Interpretation: Is this a **Bb minor** progression?

Let’s try to hear it in **Bb minor**.

In Bb minor:

- i = Bb minor
- ii° = C° (C-Eb-Gb)
- iii = Db major
- iv = Eb minor
- v = F minor
- VI = Db major
- VII = Ab major

Wait — **we don't have Bb minor**, we have **Bbdim** — which is **Bb, Db, Fb?** That’s actually **Bb° = Bb - Db - Fb**

But **Bb minor is Bb - Db - F**, so that’s **Bb minor = Bb, Db, F** — **F natural**, not Fb.

So **Bbdim ≠ Bb minor** — **Bbdim is a diminished chord** — triad of Bb - Db - Fb (E).

That is **NOT the tonic of Bb minor** — it’s a **different chord**.

Bb minor tonic = Bb - Db - F

Bbdim = Bb - Db - Fb (which is E)

So **Bbdim** is **not the i chord**.

What is Bbdim?

In **E minor**: vii° = D# dim = E - G - B? Not Bb.

In **C harmonic minor**: vii° = B dim = B-D-F — again not Bb.

Bbdim is the **vii° of C major** — C major: B-D-F → Bdim

But here, we’re seeing Bbdim — which would be vii° of **C major**, if spelling were B, D, F — but this is Bb, Db, Fb.

Bbdim = Bb - Db - E (French 6th enharmonic) — this chord is **enharmonically equivalent to** **D#°** = D# - F# - A → which is vii° of **B major**

So this suggests **the tonal center is not Bb**, but perhaps **E major**?

But our basses are all **Bb and Ab** — **not E**.

This is getting confusing — let’s take a better approach.

## 🔍 Critical Insight: The Chord "Gb/Bb"

Gb/Bb is **G# major over B#**? No — we’re in flats.

**Gb/Bb = Bb bass, Gb major triad = Gb - Bb - Db**

So the full chord is: **Bb (bass), Gb, Db**

That’s **Db major in 2nd inversion?** No — wait: Gb - Bb - Db is **Gb major**

So **Gb major with Bb in bass**.

What key has **Gb major** as a chord?

- Gb major scale: Gb - Ab - Bb - Cb - Db - Eb - F

So **Gb major is the I chord in Gb major**

But we’re seeing Gb major — **not Bb major**

And the bass is **Bb** — which is the **V** note of Gb major? No — Bb is the **III** note.

Wait — in **Gb major**, Bb is the **third**

So **Gb/Bb** is **Gb major chord with third in bass** — that’s **first inversion**

So this **does NOT indicate Gb as tonic** — it’s a **chord based on Gb** — with Bb bass.

Now, what key has **both Bb and Gb as functional chords**?

Let’s consider the key of **E major** — since Bbdim = Bb - Db - Fb = D# dim — which is **vii° of E major**

And **Gb = F#** — so **F# major / B** — but we have **Gb/Bb**, not F#/B.

Wait — here's the breakthrough.

**Bbdim = Bb - Db - Fb** enharmonically = **A# - C# - E** — which is **A# dim** = vii° of **B major**

But we have **Gb/Bb** — Gb = F# — so **F# major / Bb**

F# major = F# - A# - C#

With Bb in bass → **Bb - F# - A# - C#**

That’s **F# major with a ♭9 (Bb)** — extremely dissonant — **brutal alteration**

But then we have **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor = Db - Fb - Ab → Ab in bass → so Ab - Db - Fb

That’s **Db minor in 1st inversion**

And **B/Bb** = B major = B - D# - F# with Bb bass → **B major with ♭9** — same as above

And **Emaj7/Ab** = Ab - E - G# - B - D#? That’s **E major 7th with Ab bass** → Ab - E - G# - B - D#

That’s **E major 7th with a ♭6 (Ab)** — which is a **Lydian ♭6** sound? Or altered dominant?

Wait — we’re seeing **Emaj7/Ab**

So bass = Ab

Upper chord = E major 7 = E - G# - B - D#

So full chord: **Ab - E - G# - B - D#**

This is **highly chromatic** — the combination of Ab and E is a tritone apart → **Ab-E = ♭5 / #11** — this sounds like a **polytonal** or **altered dominant** sound.

But here’s the realization:

Let’s look at the **second chord from the end**: **Emaj7/Ab**

This suggests **Emaj7** is the **upper structure**, and **Ab** is the **bass note**

If we think of this as an **E major 7 chord over Ab**, we might interpret this as **AbM7#5** or something else — but let’s think **bass-driven**.

In **jazz harmony**, chords like **Emaj7/Ab** can be **contextualized as a polychord or altered dominant**

But perhaps the **entire progression is over a Bb pedal** — and **all these chords are upper structures over Bb bass**

Let’s assume **Bb is a drone or pedal tone**

So every chord has **Bb in the bass**, except two: **Dbm/Ab** and **Emaj7/Ab**

So:

- **Bbdim** = Bb - Db - Fb
- **Gb/Bb** = Bb - Gb - Db
- **Dbm/Ab** = Ab - Db - Fb
- **B/Bb** = Bb - B - D# - F#
- **Emaj7/Ab** = Ab - E - G# - B - D#

Wait a minute — **Dbm/Ab** and **Emaj7/Ab** have **Ab bass**, so **Ab is a temporary tonic** (or at least bass center).

So we have a **cadence or modulation** to **Ab major/minor**?

Let’s try interpreting the progression as **ending in Ab**

Look at the last 4 chords:

> ... - **Dbm/Ab** - **B/Bb** - **Bbdim** - **Bbdim** - **Gb/Bb** - **Gb/Bb** - **Bbdim** - **Bbdim** - **Emaj7/Ab** - **Bbdim**

Actually, last four:

> ... - **Bbdim** - **Emaj7/Ab** - **Bbdim**

So **Emaj7/Ab** is followed by **Bbdim** — which is **Bb - Db - Fb**

What’s a **Bbdim** after **Emaj7/Ab**?

E major 7 = E, G#, B, D#  
Ab bass = Ab

So chord = **Ab, E, G#, B, D#**

Now **Bbdim = Bb, Db, Fb**

If we think of **Bbdim** as **chromatic passing chord**, or **secondary chord**...

But here’s a radical thought:

## What if this is **Bb minor** in **Dorian mode with alterations**?

In **Bb Dorian**: Bb C Db Eb F G Ab — but we have **Gb** — which isn't in Bb Dorian.

But let’s try this: the progression revolves around **Bb minor** with borrowed chords.

### Bb minor key:  

- i: Bb minor (Bb - Db - F)  
- ii°: C° (C - Eb - Gb)  
- III: Db (Db - F - Ab)  
- iv: Ebm (Eb - Gb - Bb)  
- v: Fm (F - Ab - C)  
- VI: Db (same as III)  
- VII: Ab (Ab - C - Eb)

We have **Bbdim** = Bb - Db - Fb  
But **Fb ≠ F** → so **not i**

Now, **Bbdim** = enharmonic to **A# dim** — and A# is the 7th of B major — so perhaps key of **B major**?

But basses are all Bb/Ab — **not B**

So we are stuck — unless...

### 🎯 Revelation: The Harmonic Context is **C minor**

Try this: **C minor** key

C minor scale: C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb

Chords:

- i: Cm
- ii°: D° → D F Ab
- III: Eb → Eb G Bb
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm
- VI: Ab → Ab C Eb (major)
- VII: Bb → Bb D F (major)

Wait — we have **Bbdim** = Bb - Db - Fb — which is **not** Bb major

**Bbdim = Bb - Db - E** — in C minor, the **VII chord is Bb major**, not diminished.

But — **Bbdim = vii° of C# major?**

Still not helping.

---

## ✅ Final Analysis: This is **Bb minor with chromatic passing chords**, but the **true key is C minor**, and the Bbdim is the **vii° of C minor**

Wait — **C minor**: vii° = B° = B D F

We have **Bbdim** = Bb Db Fb — which is enharmonic to **A# C# E** = A#° — vii° of **B major**

But if we **reinterpret**:

**Bbdim = C°**? Enharmonically, **Bb** = A# → A#° = vii° of B major, not C minor.

**Wait — transpose everything to C minor** — would Bbdim make sense?

No.

But here’s the answer:

> **This progression is centered on Bb, and uses Bbdim as a substituted tonic or altered chord, and Gb/Bb as a Lydian #4 chord, making it most likely:**

---

## ✅ **Key: Bb minor**  
## ✅ **Mode: Bb Aeolian (natural minor) with heavy chromaticism and altered chords**

### Why?

- **Bbdim** appears repeatedly — while **Bb minor** would be Bb - Db - F, the **Bbdim (Bb - Db - Fb)** functions as a **chromatic variation of the tonic**, creating a darker, more unresolved feel — common in **melodic minor** or **jazz minor** contexts.
  
- **Gb/Bb**: This is **F# major over Bb** — enharmonically **F# = Gb**, and in **Bb minor**, F# is the **augmented 4th (or #11)** if we think **Bb F# = #11** — so this chord implies **Bb Lydian #4** or **Bb altered**

  But more accurately: **Gb major over Bb bass = Bb7#11** sound? Let’s see:  
  - Bb7 = Bb D F Ab  
  - Add #11 = E = Fb? But Gb is Gb, not F#  
  - Gb = F# — so F# in context of Bb = #11 → but spellings are different

  But musically, **Gb** (F#) is **#4 of Bb**, so **Bb7#11** = Bb - D - F - Ab - **F#**

  Yes — we have:  
  - Bass: Bb  
  - Chord: Gb - Bb - Db = **Gb major triad → F# - B - D#** — wait, no: Gb = Gb, Bb = Bb, Db = Db

  What is **Gb major = Gb - Bb - Db**

  Relative to Bb bass:  
  - Bb = 1  
  - Gb = #11 (enharmonic to F#)  
  - Db = b7? No — Db = b3 in Bb  
  - So chord = **Bb - Db - Gb** → Bb minor triad + #11?  
  - Bb - Db = minor 3rd  
  - Gb = #11? But #11 of Bb is F# — Gb is **perfect 5th**, not #11.

  Wait — **Gb = perfect 5th of Db**, but relative to **Bb**, Gb is a **minor 6th**

  So **Bb - Db - Gb** = **Bb minor + minor 6th (Gb)** — so chord = **Bbm6**? But Bbm6 = Bb - Db - F - Gb

  We don’t have F.

  So we have **Bb - Db - Gb** — that’s **triad of Db major?**

  No — **Bbdim (Bb Db Fb)** is the same as **Bb - Db - E**

  And **Gb/Bb = Bb - Gb - Db**

  That’s **Bb - Db - Gb**

  If we re-order: **Bb, Gb, Db** = **Bb - Ab# - Db**? Clunky.

  Musically, this chord **Gb/Bb** sounds like a **Bb minor with an upper structure of Gb triad** — which implies **Bb phrygian** or **Bb altered dominant**

---

## ✅ Best Answer:

Despite the chromaticism, **the persistent Bb bass tones** and **mood** suggest a **dark, modal tonic center**.

The recurrence of **Bbdim as the primary chord**, and the use of **Gb/Bb and Dbm/Ab**, creates a **melancholic, modal minor** atmosphere.

The **Emaj7/Ab** is the only chord suggesting a modulation — but it’s immediately followed by **Bbdim**, pulling back to Bb.

So we can conclude:

> ### **Key: Bb minor**  
> ### **Mode: Bb Aeolian (natural minor)**, but with **heavy alterations** — specifically, **vii° substituting i**, and **#4/#11 substitutions** (Gb/Bb = #11 over Bb), making it a **chromatic Bb minor** progression with **jazz/neo-classical color**

This is common in **modern jazz, film scores**, and **progressive rock** — where the **minor tonic is voiced as diminished** for tension, and **raising the 4th** (Gb instead of F) creates a **Phrygian #4** or **Lydian b2** color over Bb.

## FINAL VERDICT:

> **Key: Bb minor**  
> **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**, **with frequent chromatic alterations** — the progression is essentially **Bb minor** with **bass pedal on Bb**, featuring **altered movements** (especially #11 and b6) for dramatic effect.

The chord **Emaj7/Ab** is an **outside chord** — possibly a **borrowed or deceptive resolution** — but it doesn’t change the overall tonal center: **Bb remains master**.

✔️ So we say:

> ### 🔑 **Key: Bb minor**  
> ### 🎹 **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**  
> ### 💡 **Character: Highly chromatic, jazz-influenced minor progression with pedal bass**

This is not a traditional functional progression — it’s more **textural and coloristic**, but rooted in **Bb minor**.

✅ **Answer: Bb minor, Aeolian mode**
