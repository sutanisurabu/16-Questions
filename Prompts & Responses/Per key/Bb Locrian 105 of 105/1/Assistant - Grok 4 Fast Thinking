**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast Thinking**

**Key:** Ab major  
**Mode:** Ionian  

This progression centers on Ab as the tonal anchor, with the bass emphasizing Bb (bII pedal point for tension) and dipping to Ab for resolution points. The slash chords like Gb/Bb (inverted Gb major, functioning as a subdominant or tritone substitute), Dbm/Ab (Ab sus4#5, Lydian-like color), B/Bb (chromatic tension), and Emaj7/Ab (enharmonic Ab = G#6, adding leading-tone resolution) support Ab major harmony, with chromaticism typical in jazz-style writing. The repeated diminished and inverted structures build suspense resolving toward Ab.
