### Key and Mode Analysis

This chord progression is tonal and fits diatonically within **Ab minor** (natural minor, or Aeolian mode). Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and functional analysis:

#### Overall Structure
- The progression is repetitive and vamp-like, centering on a static bass (mostly Bb, with Ab substitutions). This creates tension and resolution around Ab as the tonic.
- Bass notes: Primarily Bb (the ♭2/♯ii degree, common in minor vamps for color), with Ab (tonic) under the iv and VI maj7 chords for grounding.
- No strong V-i cadence, but the diminished (ii°) and subtonic (VII) chords imply the minor tonic via leading tones and common-practice resolution tendencies.
- All chords are diatonic to Ab natural minor (scale: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb), with no need for accidentals beyond the key signature (7 flats: Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb).

#### Diatonic Scale and Key Signature
- **Key**: Ab minor
- **Mode**: Aeolian (natural minor) — no raised 7th (Gb, not G natural), emphasizing the pure minor sound without harmonic minor or Dorian alterations.
- **Scale degrees**: Ab (1), Bb (♭2), Cb (♭3), Db (4), Eb (5), Fb (♭6), Gb (♭7)
- **Key signature**: 7 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭, F♭)

#### Chord Functions and Enharmonic Equivalents
All chords resolve within Ab minor. I've included roman numeral analysis (based on Ab minor) and enharmonic rewrites where needed for clarity (e.g., Fb = E, Cb = B, etc.):

1-2. **Bbdim** (repeated) = ii° (Bb Db Fb)  
   - Diatonic diminished chord built on ♭2. Creates tension, leading toward tonic (Ab) or III. Repeated for ostinato effect.

3-4. **Gb/Bb** (repeated) = VII6 (Gb Bb Db over Bb bass)  
   - Subtonic major chord in 1st inversion (Bb is the 3rd of Gb). Common in minor keys for a "Phrygian" or modal flavor; the Bb bass keeps the ♭2 pedal.

5-6. **Bbdim** (repeated) = ii° (same as above)  
   - Reinforces the vamp.

7. **Dbm/Ab** = iv6 (Db Fb Ab over Ab bass)  
   - Subdominant minor in 1st inversion (Ab is the 5th of Dbm). Grounds the phrase on the tonic bass (i).

8. **B/Bb** = III / ♭2 (Cb Eb Gb over Bb bass; enharmonic to B D# F#)  
   - Mediant major chord (diatonic III in minor) over ♭2 bass. Adds a brief lift before returning to the vamp; the tritone (B to F# = Cb to Gb) resolves internally.

9-10. **Bbdim** (repeated) = ii° (same as above)

11-12. **Gb/Bb** (repeated) = VII6 (same as above)

13-14. **Bbdim** (repeated) = ii° (same as above)

15. **Emaj7/Ab** = VImaj7 / i (Fb Ab Cb Eb over Ab bass; enharmonic to E G# B D#)  
   - Submediant major 7th (diatonic VI in minor) over tonic bass. The maj7 (Eb) adds richness; common in jazz/minor contexts for a "modal" resolution.

16. **Bbdim** = ii° (same as above; ends on tension, implying loop back to tonic)

#### Why Ab Minor Fits Perfectly
- **No chromatics needed**: Every note (Bb, Db, Fb/E, Gb, Ab, Cb/B, Eb) appears in the Ab minor scale. The slash chords are inversions or bass substitutions that stay diatonic.
- **Tonal center**: Ab bass anchors the subdominant and VI chords, while the ii°-VII oscillation (Bbdim to Gb/Bb) acts as a pre-dominant vamp typical in minor keys (e.g., evoking Phrygian or Aeolian tension without resolving to V).
- **Mode confirmation**: 
  - Aeolian: Flat 3rd (Cb), flat 6th (Fb), flat 7th (Gb) throughout. No G natural (harmonic minor) or raised 6th (Dorian).
  - If it were harmonic minor, we'd expect Gb to become G natural in V or VII chords—but it doesn't.
- **Style context**: This has a jazz/fusion or modal jazz vibe (e.g., reminiscent of vamps in tunes by Miles Davis or Gil Evans), where ii°-VII loops emphasize the minor mode over strong cadences.

If this is from a specific song or you have melody notes/context, it could refine the analysis further—but based on the harmony alone, Ab minor (Aeolian) is the clear fit. If you'd like a lead sheet, reharmonization, or scale suggestions for improvisation (e.g., Ab Aeolian with ♭2/Bb pedal), let me know!
