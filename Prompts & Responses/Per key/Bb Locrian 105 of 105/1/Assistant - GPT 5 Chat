Let's analyze the chord progression:

```
Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb |
Bbdim | Bbdim | Dbm/Ab | B/Bb |
Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb |
Bbdim | Bbdim | Emaj7/Ab | Bbdim
```

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center candidates

The chords pivot around **B♭ diminished (Bbdim)** — repeated throughout. This chord (B♭–D♭–E) functions as **vii°** in **B major (or B minor)**, **leading-tone chord** in **B**.

We also see:
- **Gb/Bb** — 1st inversion of **G♭ major**, i.e. G♭–B♭–D♭.
- **Dbm/Ab** — D♭ minor (D♭–E–A♭).
- **Emaj7/Ab** — E–G#–B–D# over A♭ (A♭ as bass note, interesting chromatic voice).
- **B/Bb** — a "slash chord" adding strong tension.

The combination of **G♭ major** and **E major**, along with **D♭ minor**, suggests we’re not in a purely diatonic context, but rather a *chromatic mediant cycle* built around **B♭ diminished**.

### Step 2: Possible tonal centers

- **G♭ major** appears stable (Gb major chord appears multiple times).
- **B♭ diminished** functions strongly as a common-tone leading-tone diminished chord to G♭ (in G♭ major, vii°/I would be **Fdim**, though).
- However, B♭ diminished (B♭–D♭–E) can resolve to **G♭** smoothly (outer voices: B♭ → A♭, E → G♭).

The **Emaj7/Ab** near the end also implies motion toward **G♭ major** (since E major is the ♭VII of G♭).

### Step 3: Mode and coloration

Given:
- Gb major tonality implied by **Gb/Bb** chords
- Chromatic embellishment through **Bbdim** and **Dbm/Ab**
- Borrowed chords and mediant relationships (from parallel modes)

This progression sounds **modal / non-functional**, but its center is **G♭** (major quality).

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Key center:** G♭  
- **Mode:** Major (with heavy chromatic/borrowed diminished color)

---

### In short:
**Overall tonality:** G♭ major  
**B♭ diminished** acts as chromatic embellishment and common-tone diminished chord prolonging **G♭ major’s tonic**.
