Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided and determine the **key** and **mode** (if applicable). The progression is:

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

### Step 1: Understand the chords

Let’s first clarify the chord spellings. All chords are written with **Bb** (B-flat) as a common tone in many bass notes. Let’s parse each chord.

#### 1. **Bbdim**  
- Bb diminished: Bb–Db–E (enharmonic to Fb) or Bb–Db–Fbb (usually spelled Bb–Db–E)
- More correctly: **Bb° = Bb–Db–Fb (E)**
- Functionally, diminished chords like this are symmetrical (every minor third), so they can act as vii° chords in minor keys or passing chords.

#### 2. **Gb/Bb**
- Gb major chord with Bb in the bass → Bb–Gb (first inversion)
- Gb = Gb–Bb–Db → so Gb/Bb = Bb–Db–Gb
- Notes: Bb, Db, Gb

This is enharmonically equivalent to a **Bdim** chord? Let’s see:
- Bdim = B–D–F → enharmonically different from Bb–Db–Gb.

But wait: **Bb–Db–Gb** is a **Bb minor 6th chord**? Bb–Db–F–Gb → no, we only have Bb, Db, Gb.

Actually:
- Bb–Db–Gb = **Bb minor chord with a flat 6?** Unusual.

But look: **Gb major chord over Bb** = **Bb–Db–Gb** → this is the same as a **Neapolitan chord in Ab major or minor**?

Wait: Gb is the **b2** scale degree in **F minor** or **Ab major**.

But let’s consider **Ab major**:
- Ab major key: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

→ Gb is **bII**, which is **not diatonic**. Gb is not in Ab major.

But **Gb major** is the **bII** chord → this is characteristic of a **Neapolitan chord**, which is **common in minor keys**.

In **Ab minor**, the Neapolitan chord is **Bbb major**, but that would be written as Gb (enharmonic Bbb = A), no.

Wait — let's think carefully.

### Let’s look at **Ab minor**:
- Natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

→ Gb is the **7th degree (vii)** → Gb major is not diatonic (vii° would be diminished).

But the **Neapolitan chord** in **Ab minor** is **Bbb major**, which is enharmonic to **A major**, but often respelled as **Gb major** in flat keys.

Yes! In **Ab minor**, the **Neapolitan chord** is **Bbb major (Bbb–Db–Fb)**, which is enharmonically **A–C#–E**, but in Ab minor context, it’s written as **Gb–Bb–Db** to fit the key signature.

So **Gb major** is the **Neapolitan (bII)** chord in **Ab minor**.

→ **Gb/Bb** = Gb major in first inversion → very common for Neapolitan.

So: **Gb/Bb** is a strong indicator of **Ab minor**, especially since it's a **characteristic chord**.

#### 3. **Dbm/Ab**
- Db minor with Ab in the bass = Ab–Db–F
- Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab → so chord is Ab–Db–Fb? No, Ab–Db–F is **Ab major**, not Dbm.

Wait — something’s wrong.

**Dbm** = **Db–Fb–Ab**  
**Dbm/Ab** = **Ab–Db–Fb**

Fb = E, so notes: **Ab–Db–E**

But that’s **not** a Db minor chord — because Fb is E, so if we have **E natural**, it's **F natural**, which is wrong.

Wait — is this a typo?

Hold on. **Dbm = Db–E–Ab**? No — **minor third is E double flat**, which is **D**, but usually spelled as **Fb**.

So Db minor: **Db–Fb–Ab** → Fb = E (enharmonically), but not F.

So **Dbm/Ab** = **Ab–Db–Fb**

Fb = B–C–Db–D–E–Fb (which is E) → but **Fb is not F natural**.

So the notes are: **Ab, Db, Fb** → Fb = E, so **Ab–Db–E**

But that’s **Ab augmented**? Ab–C–E → but we have **Db**, not C.

Ab–Db–E → that’s **Ab–(P4)–(b7)**? Not a standard chord.

Wait — perhaps there is an **enharmonic reinterpretation**.

Alternative: **Dbm** may be a typo? Or perhaps it's **Dm**?

No — let's consider **C#m/Ab**? That wouldn’t make sense.

Wait — **Db minor over Ab**: could this be interpreted as a **chord from Ab harmonic or melodic minor**?

In **Ab harmonic minor**, we have:
- Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G

Wait no: **Ab harmonic minor**: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, **G (natural)**

So notes: G natural.

But **Dbm** is diatonic in Ab minor — yes, **iv chord**.

Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab → which is the **iv chord** in Ab minor.

So **Dbm/Ab** = Ab–Db–Fb → which is **first inversion of iv chord in Ab minor** → makes perfect sense.

So **Dbm/Ab** = iv⁶ → common chord in minor keys.

So far, strong evidence for **Ab minor**.

#### 4. **B/Bb**
- B major chord over Bb bass → B–D#–F# over Bb
- Notes: **Bb, B, D#, F#** → cluster

This is a very dissonant chord.

But B major = B–D#–F#  
Over Bb → so **Bb and B** together = minor second

This seems like a **chromatic passing chord**, or possibly a **misinterpretation**.

Wait — could this be a typo?

Because **B/Bb** = B major over Bb = highly chromatic.

But in **Ab minor**, what function could this have?

Let’s look enharmonically:
- B = Cb
- So **Cb major = Cb–Eb–Gb**

Then **Cb/Bb** → Bb–Cb–Eb–Gb → which is Bb–(b9)–(3)–(b6)

Still odd.

Alternatively, could **B/Bb** mean **B diminished?** But it's written as **B**, not **B°**.

Wait — earlier we have **Bbdim**, and now **B/Bb** — perhaps it's meant to be **Bdim/Bb**?

That would make more sense.

Because **Bdim** = B–D–F → over Bb bass → Bb–B–D–F → still cluster.

But **Bdim** is enharmonic to **Ddim, Fdim, Abdim** — symmetrical chord.

Wait — in **Ab minor**, the **vii°** chord is **G#°**, not B°.

**Bdim** = B–D–F → which is the **vii° of C minor**, or **ii° in A minor**, etc.

But in **Ab minor**, the **leading tone chord** is **G#° = G#–B–D**

G# = **enharmonic to Ab**

Wait — **G# = Ab**, so **G#° = Ab–C–E**? No:

G#–B–D → enharmonically **Ab–B–D**? B is Cb? Messy.

But **Ab–Cb–Ebb**? No.

Wait: **G#° = G#, B, D** → over Bb bass → Bb–G#–B–D

But Bb and G# = **diminished third**? G# to Bb is diminished third, enharmonic to minor third.

Wait — maybe **B/Bb** is a miswriting of **Ab°/Bb**? Or **B°/Bb**?

But **B°** is not diatonic in Ab minor.

Alternatively — could **B** be meant to be **Bbb**? Bbb = A.

But **A minor over Bb**? Still odd.

Wait — **in Ab minor**, the **Neapolitan** is **Bbb major**, which is **A** or **Gb**, depending on spelling.

But we already have **Gb/Bb**.

Alternatively, perhaps **B/Bb** is meant to be **Ab/Bb**, a first-inversion tonic?

But **Ab/Bb** would be **i⁶ in Ab minor**.

But it's written **B/Bb**, not **Ab/Bb**.

Another idea: typo — maybe **B** is meant to be **Bb**? So **Bb/Bb** = just Bb.

Still not helpful.

Wait — look at the chord **after**: **Emaj7/Ab**

#### 5. **Emaj7/Ab**
- E major 7th chord with Ab in bass → Ab–E–G#–B?
- E major 7th = E–G#–B–D#
- So chord: **Ab, E, G#, B, D#** → very dissonant

But again, **Ab and E** = tritone

But **E major** is **not** in Ab minor.

But wait — **E = G##**, and in **Ab minor**, the **harmonic minor** has **G natural**, not G#.

But **G#** is the **leading tone** in Ab minor: **G#–Ab**.

So in **Ab harmonic minor**, the **V chord** is **Eb–G–Bb** → **Eb major**, not related to E.

But **E major** = E–G#–B → enharmonically, **Fb–Ab–Cb** → which would be **bVI in Ab minor?** But bVI is **Fb major** = **E**.

Yes! In **Ab minor**, the **bVI chord** is **Fb major**, which is enharmonically **E major**.

So **E major** = **enharmonic bVI** in **Ab minor**

And **Emaj7** = E–G#–B–D# → D# is enharmonic to **Eb**

So **D# = Eb**, which is the **5th of Ab minor**.

So **Emaj7** = **bVI7** → possible, though rare.

But **bVI chord** is major in minor keys — yes (e.g., in C minor, Ab major is bVI)

So **E = Fb**, so **Fb major 7th = Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb** → enharmonically **E–G#–B–D#** → yes, matches **Emaj7**

So **Emaj7 = bVIM7 in Ab minor**

Even with the odd spelling, it makes sense as a **bVI7** chord.

And it's over **Ab bass** → **Emaj7/Ab** = **bVI7 in first inversion?** Not quite — Ab is the **3rd** of E (G#), so **E–G#–B–D# over Ab** → Ab is **same as G#**, so it’s **E/G#**, not E/Ab.

Wait — **Ab = G#**, so **Emaj7/Ab** is just **Emaj7/G#** → third inversion.

So it's a **bVI7 chord in third inversion** in **Ab minor**

That makes sense musically — a chromatic mediant or expressive chord.

So despite the enharmonic spelling, it’s usable.

Now back to **B/Bb**

Could this be **Cb/Bb**? Cb = B

Cb major = Cb–Eb–Gb → same as B–D#–F#

But Cb is the **b9 of Bb**, still odd.

Wait — in **Ab minor**, what chord has **B natural**?

Not diatonic.

But consider: could **B** be a **miswriting of Bb**?

Possibility.

Alternatively — could it be **Bdim/Bb**, meaning **B°7** passing chord?

For example, **Bdim** = B–D–F–Ab → over Bb → passing between Bb and Cb or something?

But unlikely.

Wait — let’s step back.

We have repeated **Bbdim**

Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb

Fb = E → so Bb–Db–E

This is **not diatonic in Ab minor** — Ab minor has Eb, not E natural.

But **E natural = leading tone**, so in **Ab harmonic minor**, we have **G#, not E**.

Wait — **E natural** is the **augmented 4th** of Ab.

But in **C minor**, Bbdim = **vii°** chord.

Check that.

**C minor key**: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

So **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–F → but F, not Fb.

Fb = E → so **Bb–Db–E** = **not Bbdim**, it’s **Bb–Db–E**, which is **Bb augmented?** No — augmented is Bb–D–F#

Bb–Db–E = **Bb–(m3)–(b5)–(b7?** ) — wait, E = **major 6th** of Bb?

So **Bb–Db–E** = **Bb minor 6 chord**, missing 5th.

But if it's truly **Bbdim**, it should be Bb–Db–Fb (E), but **Fb is E**, and **diminished fifth from Bb to Fb is E**, which is **enharmonically correct**, but in equal temperament, it's the same as E.

But in **C minor harmonic**, the **vii°** is **Bb–Db–F**, not E.

F is the **5th**, Fb would make it **doubly diminished**.

This is messy.

Wait — **diminished chord built on Bb** must have:
- Bb (root)
- Db (min 3)
- Fb (dim 5) = E
- Abb (dim 7) = G

So **Bbdim7** = Bb–Db–E–G

But a diminished chord without 7th could be just Bb–Db–Fb (E)

So in **Cb major?** Unlikely.

Alternatively, **Bbdim** could be a **common-tone diminished chord** on Bb.

For example, **ct°7** for **Ab major or minor** chord.

A **common-tone diminished chord** shares a note with the tonic.

So **ct°7 on Bb** supporting **Ab** chord?

For example: Bb–C–Eb–Gb → that’s not Bbdim.

Standard ct°7 for Ab would be **B dim7:** B–D–F–Ab → which resolves to Ab.

But we have **Bbdim**, not Bdim.

Wait — **Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb = Bb–Db–E**

If used as a **passing chord**, perhaps between **Bb and Cb** or something.

But consider this: in **Ab minor**, the **ii° chord** is **Bb dim7** — yes!

In **Ab minor**, natural minor:
- i: Ab
- ii°: Bb–Db–Fb
→ **Fb = E**, but in notation, we call it **Fb**

So **Bbdim** = **ii° chord** in **Ab minor**

Yes! So **Bbdim = ii° in Ab minor**

And it’s **not fully diminished 7th** in your notation — just **dim** (triad), but often in harmonic contexts, it implies the diminished triad.

So **Bbdim = ii°**, which is **diatonic** in **Ab minor**.

So now all the chords make sense in **Ab minor**:

- **Bbdim** = **ii°** → diatonic in Ab minor
- **Gb/Bb** = **bII/Bb** = Neapolitan chord (first inversion) → very common in minor keys
- **Dbm/Ab** = **iv⁶** (first inversion of subdominant minor) → very common
- **B/Bb** → problematic, but could be a typo?

Wait — **B/Bb** still doesn’t fit.

But what if it’s **Bb/Bb**? Just Bb major?

But Bb major is not in Ab minor — it's **II**, but in minor, II is diminished.

Unless it’s a **modal mixture**?

**B major chord** — could it be **bIII augmented** or something?

Ab minor: bIII chord is **Cb major** = B

Yes!

In **Ab minor**, the **bIII chord** is **Cb major**, which is enharmonically **B major**

So **B major = bIII in Ab minor**

And **B/Bb** = B major over Bb bass

So notes: **Bb (bass), B, D#, F#**

But **Cb major** = Cb–Eb–Gb → enharmonically **B–D#–F#**

Yes — so it's spelled enharmonically, but it’s the **bIII chord** in **Ab minor**

And the bass is **Bb**, not **Cb** — so it's not root position.

But in functional harmony, it's common to use **bIII** in minor keys.

So **B/Bb** = **bIII with Bb in bass** — a bit awkward, but possible as a chromatic voice leading.

Alternatively, it could be seen as a **passing bass** from Bb to Ab.

But overall, this chord, despite the spelling, can be interpreted as **bIII in Ab minor**, albeit with enharmonic spelling.

Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab** = **bVI7 in Ab minor**, as discussed.

### Final Analysis

All chords fit **Ab minor**, with chromatic and diatonic harmony:

- **Bbdim** → ii° (diatonic)
- **Gb/Bb** → bII⁶ (Neapolitan, common in minor)
- **Dbm/Ab** → iv⁶ (diatonic)
- **B/Bb** → bIII with Bb bass → unusual, but bIII is a valid modal chord in minor
- **Emaj7/Ab** → bVIM7, 3rd inversion

Chords are used in a chromatic, expressive way, possibly for a jazzy or dramatic effect.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: Ab minor**  
**Mode: Natural minor / Harmonic minor (with modal mixture)**

The progression uses:
- Diatonic chords (ii°, iv)
- Characteristic minor-key chords (Neapolitan bII, bIII, bVI)
- Enharmonic spellings for chromatic effect

There is no
