Let's break this down step by step.

### 1. **List the Chords**
The progression is:

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

### 2. **Simplify the Chords**
First, let's simplify the chords to their basic forms (ignoring bass notes for now):

- **Bbdim** → Bb, Db, E (a diminished triad)
- **Gb/Bb** → Gb major (Gb, Bb, Db), with Bb in bass
- **Dbm/Ab** → Dbm (Db, E, Ab), with Ab in bass
- **B/Bb** → B major (B, D#, F#), with Bb in bass
- **Emaj7/Ab** → Emaj7 (E, G#, B, D#), with Ab in bass

### 3. **Analyze the Notes**
Now, let's list all the unique notes from these chords:

- From **Bbdim**: Bb, Db, E
- From **Gb/Bb**: Gb, Bb, Db (same as Bbdim but with Gb)
- From **Dbm/Ab**: Db, E, Ab
- From **B/Bb**: B, D#, F#, Bb
- From **Emaj7/Ab**: E, G#, B, D#, Ab

Combining all unique notes:
```
Bb, Db, E, Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#
```

### 4. **Look for a Scale**
This is a lot of notes! Let's see if we can find a key that fits most of them. 

First, let's consider **Bbdim** as a **vii°** chord (the diminished chord built on the 7th scale degree). In major keys, the vii° chord is diminished. 

If **Bbdim** is vii°, then the tonic (I) would be **Cb major** (since Bb is the 7th note in Cb major). But **Cb major** is enharmonically equivalent to **B major**, which is a much simpler key to think in.

Let's try **B major**:
- B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#
- The vii° chord in B major is A#dim (A#, C#, E), which is enharmonically equivalent to Bbdim (Bb, Db, E). So this fits!

Now, let's check the other chords against **B major**:
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb major is not diatonic to B major (Gb is the b5 of B). However, Gb is enharmonic to F#, so this could be a **bVII** chord (F# major is diatonic, but Gb major is not). This suggests a **borrowed chord** or **mode mixture**.
- **Dbm/Ab**: Dbm is not diatonic to B major (D# is the minor 3rd, Db is the minor 2nd). This is likely a **borrowed chord** from **B minor** (where Dbm is the iv chord).
- **B/Bb**: B major is the I chord, but the Bb bass is a **chromatic passing tone** or **pedal tone**.
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major is the IV chord in B major, but the Ab bass is chromatic (Ab is the b9 of B). This could be a **chromatic bass movement** or **altered chord**.

### 5. **Conclusion on Key and Mode**
The progression is **centered around B major**, but it uses **chromatic bass lines** and **borrowed chords** from **B minor** (like Dbm). The **Bbdim** acts as a **vii°** substitute for the **V7** (F#7) in B major, which is common in jazz and pop.

The **mode** is best described as **B major with mode mixture** (borrowing from B minor). The **constant Bbdim** and chromatic bass movements create a **diminished-passing-chord** feel, but the overall tonic is **B**.

### Final Answer:
- **Key**: **B major**
- **Mode**: **B major with mode mixture** (borrowing from B minor) and chromatic bass movements.
