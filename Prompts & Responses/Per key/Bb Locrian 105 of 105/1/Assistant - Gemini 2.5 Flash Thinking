### Reasoning

**Deciphering the Chords**

\n\n

I'm currently breaking down the chord progression. So far, I've got a handle on the diminished chords and the inversions. My next step is to understand the function of each chord within the overall tonality. The bass movement is interesting, and I'm starting to see some patterns. I'm focusing on identifying any secondary dominants or borrowed chords.


**Unraveling the Key Signature**

\n\n

Okay, I'm now zeroing in on the key. The frequent `Bbdim` makes me lean toward B-flat as the tonal center, though the diminished nature of the tonic is unconventional. I'm exploring the function of each chord, noting that `Gb/Bb` and `Dbm/Ab` share notes with `Bbdim`.  I'm also considering what impact `Emaj7/Ab` has on the overall feel, and how the bass notes contribute to the sense of key.


**Refining the Theory**

\n\n

Aha!  I'm now focusing on how the B major chord fits, and that's an issue. It doesn't align with my initial half-whole diminished scale hypothesis. I'm going to revisit my initial observations. I'll need to account for this. Perhaps it's a chromatic passing chord or borrowed from another key.  I'm also considering the potential for a modulation, perhaps a temporary shift.


**Examining the B/Bb Chord**

\n\n

I'm now grappling with the inclusion of B/Bb. It's becoming increasingly clear that a single key isn't sufficient to explain the entire progression, and I'm reconsidering the initial hypothesis of a diminished-tonic mode. This chord strongly suggests a chromatic element and a potential shift. I'm exploring a few modulation options and a potential secondary dominant function.


**Exploring Modal Implications**

\n\n

I'm now examining the modal possibilities suggested by the diminished tonic, and its relationship to the other chords. I'm focusing on the shared tones between `Bbdim`, `Gb/Bb`, and `Dbm/Ab`. The "Lydian" mode, as well as the notes used, are pointing to a potential key. I'll need to work through how the B major chord is working. I need to consider exotic modes.


**Reflecting on Locrian**

\n\n

I'm now settling on Bb Locrian as the likely mode. All of the key notes fit perfectly, and the `Bbdim` functioning as the tonic aligns with Locrian's inherent diminished nature. I'm exploring the implications for the harmonic function of `Gb/Bb` and `Dbm/Ab`. I will now start evaluating how the `B` major chord fits.


**Addressing Chromatic Tones**

\n\n

I'm now considering how chromatic alterations, specifically the B major chord, fit within the framework. I've re-examined the Locrian hypothesis, and I'm realizing the B major chord is not a part of the scale. I'm considering secondary dominants and borrowed chords to explain it.


**Examining Locrian's Foundation**

\n\n

My current thinking centers on the Locrian mode, specifically B-flat Locrian. The core chords align perfectly, and I'm now testing the hypothesis. I'm taking a close look at the b6, `Gb/Bb`, and how it functions. The diminished nature of the tonic seems to validate it. I will see if other chords conform to this theory.


**Pinpointing Locrian**

\n\n

I'm now zeroing in on a Locrian mode, specifically Bb. The shared notes between the chords are now obvious, as are the problems the B major presents. I'm focusing on the dominant quality to add chromaticism and provide that tension that allows the piece to resolve back to the diminished tonic.




This chord progression is highly unusual because its tonal center is defined by a diminished triad.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Identify the Tonal Center (Tonic):**
    The vast majority of the progression is spent on the **Bbdim** chord. The progression starts and ends on this chord, making B-flat the undisputed tonal center.

2.  **Determine the Quality of the Tonic Chord:**
    The tonic chord is **Bbdim** (B-flat diminished). The notes are $B\flat$, $D\flat$, and $F\flat$ (which is enharmonically $E$). This gives the interval structure: Root (Bb), minor third ($D\flat$), and diminished fifth ($F\flat / E$).

3.  **Determine the Mode based on the Tonic Quality:**
    In traditional Western music theory, there are only two modes that place a diminished triad on the first scale degree:

    *   **Locrian Mode:** This is the 7th mode of the major scale, resulting in a diminished tonic triad (minor third, diminished fifth).
    *   **Phrygian $\text{b}4$ (Locrian $\text{b}3$):** This is a rarer mode, sometimes known as the Double Harmonic Minor scale starting on the 7th degree, but its structure is often identical to Locrian (depending on the definition).

    The standard mode for a diminished tonic ($\text{I}^{\circ}$) is the **Locrian Mode**.

4.  **Test the Chords against Bb Locrian:**
    The scale for **B-flat Locrian** (7th mode of C-flat Major) is:
    $B\flat - C\natural - D\flat - E\flat - F\flat (E\natural) - G\flat - A\flat$

    *   **Bbdim ($B\flat, D\flat, E\natural$):** Fits perfectly. (Tonic)
    *   **Gb/Bb ($G\flat, B\flat, D\flat$):** Fits perfectly. ($G\flat$ is the $\text{b}6$ major chord over a tonic pedal point.)
    *   **Dbm/Ab ($D\flat, F\flat, A\flat$):** Fits perfectly. ($D\flat$ is the $\text{b}3$ minor chord.)

    *Non-Diatonic Chords (Chromaticism):*
    *   **B/Bb ($B, D\sharp, F\sharp$):** This uses notes ($B, D\sharp, F\sharp$) completely outside the Locrian set. This is a highly chromatic passing chord, functioning primarily as tension before returning to Bbdim.
    *   **Emaj7/Ab ($E, G\sharp, B$):** This also uses notes ($G\sharp, B$) outside the scale.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the inclusion of highly chromatic passing chords (B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab) that momentarily disrupt the framework, the consistent anchor on the $\text{B\flat}$ root and the constant return to the $\text{B\flat}$ diminished quality define the modal flavor.

**Key:** B-flat
**Mode:** Locrian
