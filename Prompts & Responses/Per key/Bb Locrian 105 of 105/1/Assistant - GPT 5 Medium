### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking at the given chord progression to determine the key and mode. It includes repeated Bbdim (B-flat diminished) and slash chords like Gb/Bb and Dbm/Ab. The bass pattern seems to alternate between Bb and Ab, which suggests a possible key of B minor since Bbdim appears frequently. However, I note the diminished triad consists of Bb, Db, and E natural. Exploring all this, I've considered the scale in Gb major, noting its structure.**Clarifying diminished chords**

I’ve realized that the Gb major scale includes notes Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F. The vii° chord for Gb major is actually F diminished, not Bb diminished. I’m considering what keys use Bb diminished as diatonic. In C minor, B diminished serves as the leading tone. Then I explore Cb major, where the vii° is Bb diminished, built from the Cb major scale. The triad on Bb includes Bb, Db, and Fb, correcting my spelling to Bbdim as Bb-Db-Fb.**Examining chord symbols and diatonic context**

I noticed they wrote E instead of Fb for the chord symbol, likely for readability. Bbdim is indeed diatonic in Cb major or its relative, Ab minor. In Ab minor, the scale is A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭. I’m considering the leading-tone diminished chord, which is G diminished in harmonic minor if I include G#. However, in natural Ab minor, the vii° chord would not be Gb major. I'm checking keys where Bbdim is vii°, including Cb major and exploring other contexts like the Gb/Bb slash chord.**Clarifying chord relationships**

I’m observing the chords used: Gb, Dbm, B major, and Emaj7. These roots come from the E major/B major area. However, I realize Bbdim isn’t part of E major. Enharmonically speaking, Bb diminished equals A# diminished, where Bb is Bb-Db-Fb. Also, converting to sharps makes it easier for me to navigate these relationships. 

With Gb/Bb, I see that it’s a Gb major triad over Bb bass, which is indeed in first inversion. So the bass is Bb, the third of the Gb triad.**Mapping chord progressions**

I’m recognizing that Gb/Bb represents a first-inversion Gb chord. Bbdim and Gb/Bb alternate, and since they share notes, it suggests a diminished substitution approach. Then I analyze Dbm/Ab, which isn't diatonic to Gb major. Instead, it’s a borrowed V minor chord in Gb major. Realizing that Bbdim aligns with Ab minor as the ii° chord, I also see Gb major functions as VII. 

When I look at B major's role, it corresponds to Cb major enharmonically, forming the bIII in Ab minor. Emaj7 becomes Fbmaj7 enharmonically, aligning with my earlier findings.**Analyzing chord functions**

I’m recognizing that Emaj7/Ab functions as Fbmaj7/Ab, making it a bVImaj7 over the tonic in Ab minor. This leads me to see how many chords are expressed in first inversion, matching their bass lines. Chords like Bbdim (ii°), Gb/Bb (VII6), and Dbm/Ab (iv6/4) create a solid connection to Ab minor. 

However, I notice these chords can also be in Cb major, and their functions align nicely. It raises an interesting question about whether we favor Ab minor or Cb major depending on the progression and bass notes. The relationship between them keeps it ambiguous, which is intriguing!**Determining the key and mode**

I’m assessing the mode, comparing natural minor (Aeolian) to major (Ionian) due to both IV major and v minor chords present. Notably, there’s no dominant chord or altered harmonies with Eb, and Bbdim acts as ii° in Ab minor or vii° in Cb major. The presence of Emaj7 indicates a strong connection to Ab minor, suggesting that while both key signatures are valid, Ab minor (Aeolian) seems more likely due to characteristic chords and bass notes that support familiar minor progressions.

Key signature: 7 flats. The harmony is diatonic to Cb major / Ab natural minor.

- If Ab is the tonal center: Ab minor (Aeolian)
  • Bbdim = ii°
  • Gb/Bb = VII6
  • Dbm/Ab = iv6/4
  • B/Bb (Cb/Bb) = bIII over 2
  • Emaj7/Ab (Fbmaj7/Ab) = bVImaj7/3

- If Cb is the center: Cb major (Ionian)
  • Bbdim = vii°
  • Gb/Bb = V6
  • Dbm/Ab = ii6/4
  • B/Bb (Cb/Bb) = I over 7
  • Emaj7/Ab (Fbmaj7/Ab) = IVmaj7/3

Without a cadence to tonic, both readings are valid; most likely Ab minor (Aeolian).
