The chords listed are:

*   **Bbdim:** B diminished triad (B - D - F)
*   **Gb/Bb:** G major chord in the second inversion (D - G - B - D)
*   **Dbm/Ab:** C# diminished triad (C# - E - G)
*   **B/Bb:** B major chord (B - D# - F#)

The progression is:

Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Dbm/Ab | B/Bb | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Emaj7/Ab | Bbdim

Analyzing the roots and the overall harmonic landscape:

1.  **Chords based on B (or variants):** Bbdim, B/Bb. These heavily emphasize the note B.
2.  **Roots in the progression:** B, Gb/F#, Db/C#, E. These scale degrees suggest the key of **F# major** (or its relative D# minor).
    *   B is the IV in F# major.
    *   Gb is the I in F# major.
    *   Db is the V in F# major.
    *   E is the bVII (modal borrowing).

However, the quality of the chords (mostly diminished) and the use of the term "Bbdim" (which is technically B diminished, not Bb diminished, based on the notes B-D-F) are confusing. Let's assume standard notation rules where a "Bbdim" triad is built on the root $\text{B}\flat$ ($\text{B}\flat - \text{D}\flat - \text{F}\flat$).

If we use the actual notes for the chord names:

| Chord Name | Notes | Functional Root | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bbdim** | B - D - F | B | **B diminished** (not Bb dim) |
| **Gb/Bb** | B - D - Gb | Gb | Gb major second inversion |
| **Dbm/Ab** | Ab - Cb - Eb | Db | Db minor first inversion (or **C# minor**) |
| **B/Bb** | Bb - D# - F# | B | B major with Bb in the bass |
| **Emaj7/Ab** | Ab - B - D# - E | E | E major 7 with Ab in bass |

The most common root is **B**. The other major roots are Gb (F#) and Db (C#).
These roots (B, F#, C#) are the IV, I, and V of F# Major.

Despite the highly chromatic and ambiguous nature of the diminished chords, the roots and the overall stability points toward **F# (Gb) Major** or a highly altered/modal version thereof, potentially emphasizing the IV chord (B) as a false tonic.

The dominant and subdominant chords (C# minor/Db minor, F# major/Gb major) strongly suggest **F# Major**.

### Determining the Mode

The presence of the diminished tonic substitute (Bdim, the IV chord) and the extensive use of dissonant chords make classical functional harmony difficult to apply.

1.  **Pitch Collection:** The aggregate pitches used in the progression are: B, D, F, Gb, Db, Cb (B), Eb (D#), Bb, Ab, E.

Since B, F#, and C# are the primary roots, we stick to **F# Major**.

2.  **Modal Alterations:**
    *   The Bdim chord (B-D-F) contains the altered tones **D natural** and **F natural** (F# Major scale contains D# and F#). This diminished chord is commonly used in place of the $i$ chord in minor keys or as a highly colorful chromatic passing chord.
    *   The Emaj7/Ab introduces **E natural** (F# Major has E#). This is a characteristic of **F# Mixolydian** or borrowed from a parallel minor/Dorian mode.

Given the tonal center is F# and the most significant harmonic alteration is the flat 7th (E natural), the most likely mode is **F# Mixolydian** or a variation of it.

If we analyze the section containing the Bdim chord as a substitution, the use of Bdim (B-D-F) suggests the potential for a **Diminished scale** or **Phrygian/Dorian** influence around the B chord substitution.

However, based on the overall roots (I, IV, V motion) and the only major chromatic alteration (E natural), the best fit remains:

**Key:** **F# (Gb)** (Tonal Center)
**Mode:** **Mixolydian** (or a chromaticized Major key)
