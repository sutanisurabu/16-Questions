Let’s break this down step by step.  

The progression is:  

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

**1. Identify the chords and their possible functions**

- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–E–G (fully diminished 7th chord).  
  In classical theory, a diminished 7th chord can be any of four possible roots, but here it’s spelled Bb–Db–E–G (enharmonic to Bb–Db–Fb–G? No, E natural, not Fb). Actually: Bb–Db–Fb–Abb? Let’s check:  
  B diminished 7 = B–D–F–Ab.  
  Bb diminished 7 = Bb–Db–Fb–Abb (Fb = E, Abb = G). Yes, so Bbdim7 = Bb–Db–E–G.

- **Gb/Bb** = Gb–Bb–Db over Bb bass. That’s just Gb major triad in first inversion. Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db.

- **Dbm/Ab** = Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab, with Ab bass. So Db–Fb–Ab over Ab = Db minor in first inversion.

- **B/Bb** = B major triad (B–D#–F#) over Bb bass. This is a slash chord with a non-diatonic bass.

- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G#–B–D# over Ab bass. So E major 7 with Ab in bass.

---

**2. Look for key clues**

Bbdim7 is symmetrical, but in a key it usually acts as vii°7 of something.  
Bbdim7 = vii°7 of Cb major (or B major).  
Also, Bbdim7 = vii°7 of C minor.

But let’s see the other chords:

- Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db) is the bVI in B major / B minor? Or IV in Db major?  
- Dbm (Db–Fb–Ab) is the iv in Ab minor? Or i in Db minor?  
- B major (B–D#–F#) is V in E major.  
- Emaj7 is I in E major.

**3. Try to find a tonal center**

The progression keeps returning to Bbdim, then Gb/Bb, then Bbdim, then Dbm/Ab and B/Bb, then again Bbdim–Gb/Bb, then Bbdim–Emaj7/Ab–Bbdim.

B/Bb is a chromatic passing chord: B triad over Bb bass — maybe just a voice-leading effect.

Emaj7/Ab is E major with Ab bass — that’s an enharmonic German augmented 6th chord in some key?  
E–G#–B–D# with Ab in bass = Ab–C–D#–G#? That’s Ab–C–E–G# = Ab augmented major 7? No, let’s respell:  
Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D#.  
Emaj7/Ab = notes: Ab–B–D#–G#.  
Ab–B–D#–G# = Ab–B–E–G# (D#=Eb? No, D# is in E major, so keep as is).  
Actually, Ab–B–E–G# = Ab–Cb–E–G#? No, B is not Cb.  
Let’s respell Ab as G#: G#–B–D#–G# (plus E) — messy.  

Better: Ab–B–D#–G# = Ab–B–E–G#.  
Ab–B–E–G# = Ab–B–E–Ab? No, G# = Ab enharmonically, so Ab–B–E–Ab = Ab–B–E. That’s just an incomplete chord? Actually G# = Ab, so we have Ab and Ab, plus B and E. That’s Ab–B–E = Amb5? Not standard.  

Let’s treat it as an augmented 6th chord: Ab–C–E–G# is Ab–C–E–Ab? No, G# is not Ab in just intonation but in equal temperament enharmonic.  
Ab–C–E–G# = Ab–C–E–G# = Ab–C–F–G#? No, E to G# is major third.  

Actually: Ab–C–E–G# = Ab augmented major 7? No, Ab aug would be Ab–C–E, but here E natural, not Eb, so Ab–C–E is Ab augmented triad, plus G# (Ab) so it’s Ab–C–E–Ab, i.e., Ab+ (aug triad) with maj7? That’s weird.  

Maybe simpler: Emaj7/Ab is actually the **V/vi** in some key but with Ab bass for chromatic descent.

**4. Voice-leading approach**

Bass line segments:  
Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Ab → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Ab → Bb.  
So bass is mostly Bb, with two Ab’s: one under Dbm, one under Emaj7.

The B/Bb chord seems like a passing harmony: B (D# F#) / Bb — maybe just a chromatic approach to Bbdim.

---

**5. Possible key**

Given Bbdim, Gb major, Dbm, B major, Emaj7 — these don’t fit neatly in one diatonic major/minor scale.  
But Bbdim as common-tone diminished to Gb: Gb major and Bbdim share Bb and Db.  
Bbdim to Dbm: shares Db and Fb (E).  
B/Bb to Bbdim: half-step motion B→Bb in bass, D#→E, F#→G.  
Emaj7/Ab to Bbdim: Ab→G, E→E, G#→G, B→Bb.

This looks like it’s **centered around Bb** with lots of chromatic voice-leading, using diminished seventh as a pivot.

Given the final chord is Bbdim and the piece keeps returning to it, the tonal center feels like **Bb minor** (or possibly Bb major?).

In Bb minor:  
- Bbdim = vii°7 / Cb (B) major? No, in Bb minor, vii°7 = A–C–Eb–Gb, not Bbdim. So Bbdim is not diatonic to Bb minor.  
But Bbdim could be #iv°7 in F minor (or vii°7 of Cb major = B major).  

Given the presence of Gb major (bVI in Bb minor) and Dbm (iv of Ab minor? or bii in Bb minor?), and B major (V of E), Emaj7 (I of E) — this is really **chromatic and possibly non-functional**, maybe **Bb tonality** with mode mixture.

---

**6. Best guess for key and mode**

The recurring Bbdim and Gb/Bb suggest **Gb major** as tonic? But start/end on Bbdim, not Gb.  
Bbdim could be common-tone diminished of Gb (ct°7).  
But final chord Bbdim — maybe it’s like a film noir style — unresolved diminished.

Given the chords, the most consistent diatonic collection is **Gb major** (Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F).  
Bbdim is not in Gb major, but borrowed.  
Dbm is iv of Ab minor (relative minor of Cb major? not Gb’s relative).  
B major and E major are far from Gb.

So maybe it’s **Bb minor**? In Bb harmonic minor: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–A.  
Bbdim not in that.  
Bbdim is from Bb melodic minor? No.

Given the symmetry and non-diatonic chords, it’s likely **Bb minor key** (with heavy chromaticism) or possibly **no clear key** — but if forced:  
The Gb major and Dbm fit in **Db major** (Gb = IV, Dbm = ii).  
In Db major: Bbdim is not diatonic.  
B major and E major are foreign.

---

**7. Conclusion**

The only key that fits several chords is **Gb major** (or Eb minor).  
Gb major contains: Gb (I), Dbm (v), Bbdim? No.  
Eb minor contains: Gb (III), Dbm (vi), Bbdim? No.

Given the ambiguity and the fact that Bbdim starts and ends the progression, it might be **Bb minor** with borrowed chords, but functionally it’s very chromatic.

If I must pick one:  
**Key: Bb minor** (with extensive chromaticism).

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Bb\ minor}
\]
