### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to analyze the user's query regarding the chord sequence provided. The progression includes Bbdim, Gb/Bb, and others, and the user is curious about the key and mode. 

For Bbdim, I see it's a diminished triad made up of Bb, Db, and possibly Fb (though some might use E instead). It seems I’m not certain whether it’s a triad or a seventh chord. Gb/Bb appears to be a second inversion of the Gb major chord. Let’s work through this step by step!**Examining chord details**

I’m analyzing the chord notes further. The Gb-Bb-Db progression has Bb in the bass, which indicates it's in second inversion. 

Next, for Dbm/Ab, the D flat minor triad has its A flat bass note, leading to another second inversion setup. There's some complexity here since Db minor connects with Fb, which is enharmonically C#. I also see B major over Bb bass creates a clash; it might suggest Bb9#. 

Finally, Emaj7/Ab includes notes outside of E major, creating an unusual polychord. The overall pattern is quite intriguing!**Exploring key and chords**

I'm thinking the progression might be in the key of Gb major since both Gb and Db are diatonic to that key. The scale includes Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F. 

Bbdim isn't diatonic here; Bbm is the iii minor chord. I’m trying to figure out where Bbdim fits in. In Gb major, Bbdim serves as the leading-tone diminished chord to Cb, but I’m getting mixed up about what the leading tone is. I need to clarify which notes belong where!**Re-evaluating note names**

I’m re-examining the notes, starting with the Bbdim triad: Bb, Db, Fb (which is enharmonically E). In the Gb major scale, I see it includes Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F. Since Fb appears chromatically, I’m considering Gb/Bb as the diatonic second inversion I chord. 

The Dbm/Ab suggests a borrowed modal mixture from the parallel minor. I'm also noting that Emaj7 with Ab as the bass creates an odd relationship with Gb, making Fb the flat seventh in context!**Finalizing key and mode**

I’m breaking down the progression again with accurate note naming. The Bbdim chord functions as a leading-tone to B major and resolves nicely to Gb/Bb enharmonically, which aligns it with V6 in B major!

Moving along, Dbm over Ab shows a second inversion motion while remaining diatonic to B. B/Bb could act as a passing tone. After analyzing how the bass moves stepwise and how Emaj7 fits as IV, I’m concluding this strongly suggests B major as the key, confirmed by the enharmonic relationships throughout the progression.**Determining key and mode**

The key is B major (Ionian), primarily using V, ii, and IV chords, with the leading tone diminished chord being Bbdim. To keep it concise, I’ll state: "B major (Ionian)." 

I briefly considered B minor, but that doesn’t hold since Emaj7 wouldn’t typically appear there. Enharmonically, Bbdim is A#dim, and these functions suggest a strong pull to B. I'll finalize with: "Key: B major (Ionian). Enharmonic spellings: Bbdim = A#dim (vii°), Gb/Bb = F#/A# (V6), Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# (ii6/4), Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# (IVmaj7/5)." That should cover it!

B major (Ionian).

Reason: Interpreting enharmonically, Bbdim = A#dim (vii° of B), Gb/Bb = F#/A# (V6), Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# (ii6/4), and Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# (IVmaj7/5), all fitting B major.
