**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are many diminished chords, it might be in a minor key or using some modal interchange. Diminished chords often function as leading tones or passing chords.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb (which is Gb major with Bb in the bass, so it's a first inversion Gb chord)

- Gb/Bb

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Dbm/Ab (Dbm with Ab in bass, so first inversion Dbm chord)

- B/Bb (B major with Bb in bass? That seems odd. B major is B-D#-F#, and Bb is A#, so this might be a polychord or something. But probably it's B major over Bb bass, which could be interpreted as a specific chord.)

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb

- Gb/Bb

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Emaj7/Ab (E major 7th with Ab in bass? E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#, and Ab is G#, so this is actually Emaj7 in first inversion? Since Ab is the same as G#, so Emaj7/G#)

- Bbdim

Now, Emaj7/Ab: since Ab is equivalent to G#, this is Emaj7 with the third in the bass, so Emaj7/G#.

Similarly, B/Bb: B major chord with Bb in bass. B major is B-D#-F#, and Bb is A#, which is not in the B major chord. This might be a slash chord meaning B chord over Bb bass, which could be interpreted as a B7b9 or something? Let's see the notes: B chord has B, D#, F#; Bb is A#. So together, B, D#, F#, A#. A# is the enharmonic of Bb, but in context, A# is the major 7th of B? But B major 7th would have A#, but B major chord is usually triad, so with A# it becomes Bmaj7? But Bmaj7 has A#, not Bb. Bb is A#, so yes, Bmaj7 has A#. But here it's written as B/Bb, which might imply B major triad over Bb note. So the chord is B-D#-F# with Bb in bass. But Bb is not in the B major scale, so this could be a different chord.

Perhaps it's a typo or it's meant to be something else. Maybe B/Bb is B major with a flat bass, but let's keep it for now.

I should look at the overall progression and find common tones or functional harmony.

Let me consider the key based on the chords. The chords are Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Emaj7/Ab.

Bbdim is a diminished chord. Diminished chords are often vii° chords in major or minor keys, or they can be common-tone diminished chords.

First, what is Bbdim? Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G? Diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Bbdim is Bb, Db, E? But E is not E, it's Fb? No, in music theory, diminished triad is Bb, Db, Fb. But Fb is E? Enharmonically, but technically it's Fb. But in chord symbols, Bbdim usually means Bb diminished triad, which is Bb, Db, Fb. But in practice, often written as Bb, Db, E? But E is not correct because from Bb to E is an augmented fourth, not diminished fifth. From Bb to Fb is diminished fifth.

I think I'm confusing myself. Standard diminished triad: root, minor third, diminished fifth. So for Bb: minor third is Db, diminished fifth is Fb (which is E natural? No, Fb is equivalent to E only in equal temperament, but in spelling, Fb is not E. E is a different note.

In chord symbols, Bbdim typically refers to a diminished seventh chord? In jazz and popular music, "dim" often means diminished seventh chord, which has four notes: root, minor third, diminished fifth, and diminished seventh. So Bbdim7 would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb? But Abb is G? That's messy.

In many contexts, "dim" alone might imply diminished seventh, but sometimes it's just the triad. Looking at the progression, I see Emaj7, which is a four-note chord, so probably the dim chords are diminished seventh chords.

Let me assume that Bbdim means Bb diminished seventh chord. So Bbdim7 would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb. But Abb is G natural, so enharmonically, Bb, Db, E, G? But E is actually Fb, and G is Abb? No, from Bb to Db is minor third, Db to Fb is minor third, Fb to Abb is minor third, so it's a symmetrical chord.

In practice, Bbdim7 is often spelled as Bb, Db, E, G? But E should be Fb, and G should be Abb? But that's impractical. So in many scores, it's written with notes like Bb, Db, E, G, meaning Bb, Db, Fb, Abb? But E is Fb? No, Fb is E only if we ignore spelling, but in terms of sound, it's the same.

To avoid confusion, I'll think in terms of pitch classes. Bbdim7 consists of the notes: Bb, Db, E, G? Let's list the intervals properly.

A diminished seventh chord has three minor thirds stacked. So from Bb: minor third to Db, minor third to Fb (E), minor third to Abb (G). So the notes are Bb, Db, Fb, Abb. But since Fb is enharmonic to E, and Abb is enharmonic to G, it's often written as Bb, Db, E, G. But in strict theory, E should be Fb and G should be Abb for Bbdim7.

However, in chord symbols, "Bbdim" likely means Bb diminished seventh chord, so I'll proceed with that.

Similarly, Gb/Bb is Gb major chord with Bb bass. Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So with Bb in bass, it's still a Gb major chord in first inversion.

Dbm/Ab is Dbm minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm is Db, E, Ab? Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab? Fb is E? Dbm is Db, E, Ab? No, Db minor is Db, Fb, Ab. So with Ab in bass, it's first inversion Dbm chord.

B/Bb is B major with Bb bass. B major is B, D#, F#. With Bb bass, the notes are Bb, B, D#, F#. This sounds like a B7 chord with b9? B7 is B, D#, F#, A, but here we have Bb which is A#? A# is the enharmonic of Bb, but in B7, the dominant seventh is A, not A#. So B, D#, F#, A# is Bmaj7? But Bmaj7 has A#, which is the major seventh. But here the chord is B major triad over Bb bass, so the bass is Bb, which is not in Bmaj7. Bmaj7 would have B in bass with A# on top, but here bass is Bb, so it's different.

Perhaps it's a B chord with a flat root or something. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be Bb/B or something else. Another thought: in some notations, B/Bb might mean B major over Bb, which could be interpreted as a B7b9 chord without the root? Let's see the notes: B, D#, F#, and Bb. If we consider Bb as the minor ninth, then it's B7b9, but B7b9 would have B, D#, F#, A, Bb. But here we have no A, so it's missing the seventh. So it's not complete.

Perhaps it's B major with an added Bb, which is conflicting.

I recall that in some progressions, chords like this might be used for voice leading. Let's look at the context.

Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7 with Ab bass. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, and Ab is G#, so it's Emaj7 with the third in bass, so Emaj7/G#.

Now, let's list all the chords with their likely notes:

- Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G? (assuming dim7)

- Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db (so notes Bb, Db, Gb)

- Dbm/Ab: Db, E, Ab? (Dbm: Db, Fb, Ab so notes Ab, Db, Fb i.e. Ab, Db, E)

- B/Bb: B, D#, F# with Bb bass, so notes Bb, B, D#, F#

- Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D# with Ab bass, and Ab=G#, so notes G#, E, B, D# which is same as Emaj7/G#

Now, let's see the key signatures. Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. Gb major has Gb, Bb, Db. Dbm has Db, Fb, Ab. B major has B, D#, F#. Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D#.

Notice that Bbdim shares notes with other chords. Bbdim has Db, which is in Gb and Dbm. Bbdim has E, which is in Dbm as Fb? Dbm has Fb which is E, so yes. Bbdim has G, which is not in Gb or Dbm directly, but Gb has Gb, which is F#, so G natural is different.

Perhaps I should think in terms of a common key.

Let me consider the possibility that the key is Gb major or something.

Gb major scale: Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F Gb? Cb is B, Eb is D? Let's list: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb. So notes: Gb, Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, F.

But Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. E is not in Gb major; Gb major has B (Cb) and F, but not E natural. E natural would be Fb? In Gb major, the sixth is Eb, so E natural is not in the scale.

Similarly, B major has D# and F#, which are not in Gb major.

Emaj7 has G# and D#, which are not in Gb major.

So probably not Gb major.

Perhaps it's in a minor key. Let's try Eb minor? But let's see the chords.

Another approach: diminished chords often resolve to chords a half step above or below. For example, Bbdim might resolve to Bb major or minor, or to A major or minor, etc.

In the progression, Bbdim is followed by Gb/Bb, which has Bb in bass, so perhaps Bbdim is acting as a leading chord to Gb.

Bbdim and Gb/Bb share Bb and Db? Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G; Gb/Bb has Bb, Db, Gb. So they share Bb and Db, and Gb is a step from G? G to Gb is half step, so voice leading: G to Gb, E to? E to Gb? Not directly.

Bbdim to Gb/Bb: notes Bb common, Db common, E to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, but could be. G to Gb? G to Gb is diminished second? Not smooth.

Perhaps Bbdim is functioning as a vii° chord relative to Gb. In Gb major, the vii° chord would be Fdim? In Gb major, the leading tone is F, so vii°7 would be F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? But Fdim7 would be F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? Ebb is D, so F, Ab, B, D? But we have Bbdim, which is not Fdim.

Bbdim in Gb major? The chord built on Bb in Gb major is Bb minor? Bb is the second scale degree, so ii chord is Bbm? But Bbdim is not diatomic.

Perhaps it's in Db minor? Db minor scale: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Bbb is A, Cb is B? Let's list: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, A, B, Db? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B.

Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. Bb is not in Db minor? Db minor has Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B. So Bb is not there; Bb would be the flat second, so it could be Phrygian mode or something.

Dbm/Ab is in Db minor, so that fits. Gb/Bb is Gb major, which is the IV chord in Db minor? In Db minor, the IV chord is Gb major, yes. So Gb major is diatomic in Db minor.

Bbdim has Bb, which is not diatomic in Db minor; it would be the neapolitan chord if Bb major, but here it's Bbdim, so not exactly.

B/Bb has B, D#, F#, Bb. B is in Db minor? Db minor has B natural? In harmonic minor, the seventh is Cb, which is B, so yes, B natural is the leading tone in Db harmonic minor. But D# is not in Db minor; Db minor has Eb, which is D#? Eb is D# enharmonically, but in scale, Eb is the second, so D# would be the raised first? Not typically.

In Db harmonic minor, the notes are Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? No, harmonic minor has raised seventh. So from natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Then raised seventh means C instead of Cb? Cb is B, so raised seventh would be C? But C is B#? Let's clarify.

Db natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Bbb is A, Cb is B. So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B.

Harmonic minor: raise the seventh, so from B to C? But B is already the seventh? In Db minor, the seventh scale degree is Cb, which is B natural. So to raise it, we would have C natural? But C natural is not raised from B; B to C is a half step, but in terms of scale degrees, the seventh should be a half step below the tonic, so from Db, the seventh should be C, so in natural minor, it is Cb, which is B, so B is a whole step below Db? Db to B is a minor third? No, Db to C is a major second, so Db to Cb is a minor second? Db to Cb is a diminished second? This is messy.

Standard Db minor: key signature has flats, so Db minor has Bb and Eb? Let's think in terms of relative major. Db minor is relative to Fb major? Fb major is E major? No, relative major of Db minor is Fb major, but Fb major is not practical.

Db minor is often written with key signature of its relative major, which is Fb major, but since Fb is E, it's easier to think in terms of E major? But E major has four sharps, so Db minor would have many flats.

To simplify, let's list the notes of Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? But Bbb is A, and C is natural? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, C? But from Db to C is a major seventh, so for harmonic minor, the seventh should be raised, so from natural minor, the seventh is Cb (B), so raised would be C? But C is not raised from B; B to C is a half step, but B is already Cb, so raising Cb to C? But Cb is B, so raising to C natural? But C natural is not in the key signature.

I think I'm confusing myself. Let's use enharmonic equivalents. Db minor is the same as C# minor. C# minor has key signature of E major, which has four sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#. So C# natural minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B. C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#. So notes: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B# which is C.

So for Db minor, enharmonic to C# minor, so Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? But Bbb is A, and C is B#? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, C? But C is not B#; B# is C, so yes.

But in terms of chords, Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab, which is Db, E, Ab. So in Db harmonic minor, the V chord is Ab major? Ab major is Ab, C, Eb? But in Db harmonic minor, the V chord should be Ab major with raised seventh? In minor keys, the V chord is often major, so Ab major is diatomic in Db harmonic minor? Ab major has Ab, C, Eb. But in Db harmonic minor, we have C natural? From above, Db harmonic minor has C natural? From C# harmonic minor, we have B# which is C, so yes, C natural is the raised seventh? In C# harmonic minor, the seventh is B# which is C, so in Db harmonic minor, the seventh is C? But Db to C is a major second, so for harmonic minor, the seventh should be a half step below tonic, so Db to C is a major second, so it should be Cb? But Cb is B, so Db to B is a minor second, so in Db harmonic minor, the seventh is B? So why did I have C? I think I have a mistake.

Standard harmonic minor: the seventh scale degree is raised from the natural minor. In natural minor, the seventh is a whole step below tonic. In harmonic minor, it is raised to a half step below tonic.

So for C# natural minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B. So seventh is B, which is a whole step below C#? C# to B is a half step? C# to B is a minor second? Let's calculate: C# to B: from C# to B is down one half step? C# to C is half step, C to B is half step, so C# to B is two half steps? No, from C# to B: on piano, C# is one key left of D, B is one key right of A#? Let's use semitones.

C# to D: 1 semitone? No, C# to D is 1 semitone? C# to D is a minor second, so 1 semitone? But from C# to D is actually a half step? In terms of pitch, C# is the same as Db, so from Db to D is a half step? I'm getting tangled.

Let's start over with a different approach.

Perhaps I should look at the chord progression and find where it resolves or what the tonic might be.

Notice that the progression ends with Emaj7/Ab and then Bbdim. Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#, which is a chord that might resolve to A major or minor? But then Bbdim follows, which doesn't seem to resolve to A.

Emaj7/G# could be a secondary dominant or something.

Let's list the roots of the chords based on the bass notes or the chord names.

From the sequence: Bbdim, Gb/Bb, so bass notes: Bb, Bb, then Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, so bass: Ab, then B/Bb, so bass: Bb, then Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, so bass: Ab, then Bbdim.

So bass notes are mostly Bb and Ab, with some Bb from B/Bb.

The chords are often Bbdim and Gb/Bb, so Gb/Bb has Bb bass, so overall, Bb is a common bass note.

But Bbdim is unstable, so perhaps the tonic is Bb? But Bbdim would then be the vii° chord? In Bb major, vii° would be A dim? A dim is A, C, Eb, Gb? But Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G? So not the same.

In Bb minor, vii°7 would be A dim7, which is A, C, Eb, Gb, so still not Bbdim.

So Bbdim is not the vii° of Bb.

Perhaps Bbdim is a common-tone diminished chord for Bb major? But we have Gb/Bb, which is not Bb major.

Another idea: perhaps the key is Eb minor or major? Let's see.

Eb major scale: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb.

Chords: Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G - Db and E are not in Eb major. Eb major has Db? No, Eb major has D natural, so Db is flat seventh? E natural is not in Eb major; Eb major has E? No, Eb major has F? Notes are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So no Db or E.

So not Eb major.

Eb minor: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb? So notes: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, B, Db? Cb is B, so yes. So Eb minor has Db and B? But Bbdim has E natural? E natural is not in Eb minor; Eb minor has Gb and B? B is Cb, so no E natural.

So not Eb minor.

Let's consider the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, Ab is G#, so it's Emaj7/G#. This chord often functions as a dominant chord in A minor or major? Emaj7 is not typically a dominant chord; E7 is dominant. Emaj7 is a major seventh chord, which is tonic-like.

But in context, it might be used as a chromatic chord.

Perhaps the key is Ab major or minor.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab.

Chords: Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G - E and G are not in Ab major; Ab major has Eb and G? G is in Ab major, but E is not; E would be Fb? So no.

Ab minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab? So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb? So Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G - E is in Ab minor? Ab minor has Fb which is E, so yes! And G? Ab minor has Gb, so G natural is not in Ab minor; it has Gb. So Bbdim has G natural, while Ab minor has Gb, so G natural is the raised sixth? But in minor keys, the sixth is often raised in melodic minor, but let's see.

In Ab melodic minor: ascending: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab? So F and G natural? So yes, in Ab melodic minor ascending, we have G natural.

So Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. In Ab melodic minor, we have Bb, Db, E? E is Fb? In Ab melodic minor, the notes are Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. So we have Db, E? No, we have Db and F? F is E? No, F is F, E is not there? Cb is B, so notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. So we have Bb, Db, G, but we have F, not E. So Bbdim has E, which is not in Ab melodic minor.

Bbdim has E, which is the same as Fb? In Ab natural minor, we have Fb, which is E, so yes! In Ab natural minor, the notes are Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab. So Fb is E, and Gb is F#? So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb? So we have Bb, Db, E, but we have Gb, not G natural. So Bbdim has G natural, while Ab natural minor has Gb.

So for Bbdim to fit, we need both E and G natural, which would be in Ab harmonic minor? Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G? So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G? Yes! So in Ab harmonic minor, we have Bb, Db, E, G? So Bbdim is exactly the notes of Ab harmonic minor? Let's see: Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G. So the notes Bb, Db, E, G are all in Ab harmonic minor. So Bbdim is actually the vii°7 chord in Ab harmonic minor! Because in Ab harmonic minor, the seventh scale degree is G, so the vii°7 chord is G, B, Db, E? But G, B, Db, E is Gdim7, which is enharmonic to Bbdim7? Let's see: Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E? No, diminished seventh chord: from G, minor third to Bb, minor third to Db, minor third to E? But E is Fb? From Db to Fb is minor third? Db to E is major second? No, from Db to Fb is diminished third? Let's calculate intervals.

G diminished seventh chord: G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, Db to E is? Db to E is augmented second, which is not minor third. So for diminished seventh chord, all intervals must be minor thirds. So from G, minor third to Bb, minor third to Db, minor third to Fb? But Fb is E, so Db to Fb is minor third? Db to Fb: from Db to D is half step, D to E is whole step, so Db to E is two half steps? Db to D is one semitone, D to E is two semitones? No, in terms of semitones, from Db to E: Db to D is 1 semitone? Db to D is actually a half step? Db is the same as C#, so from C# to D is a half step? But from Db to D is a half step? Yes, because Db is one semitone below D. So from Db to D is 1 semitone, and from D to E is 2 semitones, so from Db to E is 3 semitones, which is a minor third? Yes! Because minor third is 3 semitones. So from Db to E is 3 semitones: Db to D is 1, D to D# is 2, D# to E is 3? But D# is Eb, so from Db to E: Db to D is 1 semitone, D to E is 2 semitones, total 3 semitones? No, from Db to D is 1 semitone, but from D to E is 2 semitones? From D to E is a whole step, which is 2 semitones, so from Db to E is 1+2=3 semitones, which is a minor third. So yes, Db to E is a minor third. So Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E? But E is Fb? enharmonically, but in terms of note names, if we spell Gdim7 correctly, it should be G, Bb, Db, Fb. But Fb is E, so often written as G, Bb, Db, E. So yes, Gdim7 has notes G, Bb, Db, E.

Now, in Ab harmonic minor, the vii°7 chord is built on G, which is the leading tone. So Gdim7: G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is E, and Bb is Cb? In Ab harmonic minor, the scale has Cb and Fb? Cb is B, and Fb is E. So the notes of Gdim7 should be G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Bb is not in the scale; the scale has Cb, which is B, so the chord should be G, B, Db, Fb? But B is Cb? Let's build the chord from the scale.

Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. So from G, the seventh degree: G, Bb? But Bb is the second degree? From G, the third should be B? But B is not in the scale; the scale has Cb, which is B? Cb is B, so yes, the third of G is B? But B is Cb, so the chord built on G: G, B (Cb), Db, Fb? So notes G, B, Db, E? So G, B, Db, E. But this is not a diminished seventh chord because from G to B is a major third? G to B is 4 semitones, which is major third. But for diminished seventh, we need minor third from root. So from G to B is major third, so it should be G to Bb for minor third? But in the scale, we have Bb? No, in Ab harmonic minor, we have Bb as the second degree, but for the chord on G, we use the notes from the scale, so the notes available are G, Bb, Db, Fb? But G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, Db to Fb is minor third? Db to Fb is 3 semitones? Db to D is 1, D to E is 2, E to F is 3? But Fb is E, so Db to E is 3 semitones, yes minor third. So G, Bb, Db, Fb is indeed a diminished seventh chord? But Fb is E, and Bb is A#? So notes G, Bb, Db, E? But in terms of scale, Bb is not the third of G; the third of G should be B or Bb? In the scale, the note between G and Db is Bb? From G to Bb is minor third, so yes, Bb is the minor third of G. But in Ab harmonic minor, the note is Bb, which is the second scale degree, so for the vii chord, we use the scale degrees: 7, 2, 4, 6? So G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is the sixth scale degree? In Ab harmonic minor, scale degrees: 1 Ab, 2 Bb, 3 Cb, 4 Db, 5 Eb, 6 Fb, 7 G. So vii chord: 7, 2, 4, 6? So G, Bb, Db, Fb? So yes, G, Bb, Db, Fb. And since Fb is E, it's often written as G, Bb, Db, E. So this is Gdim7.

But notice that Gdim7 has notes G, Bb, Db, E. And Bbdim7 has notes Bb, Db, E, G? So they are the same set of notes! Gdim7 and Bbdim7 are enharmonically the same chord? Let's see: Gdim7: G, Bb, Db, E. Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G. So yes, exactly the same notes. So Bbdim7 is equivalent to Gdim7.

And in Ab harmonic minor, the vii°7 chord is Gdim7, which is the same as Bbdim7. So Bbdim is the vii°7 chord in Ab harmonic minor.

Now, let's check the other chords in Ab harmonic minor.

Gb/Bb: Gb major chord. In Ab harmonic minor, what is Gb? The sixth degree is Fb, which is E, so Gb is not in the scale? Ab harmonic minor has G natural, so Gb is flat sixth? So Gb major would be the flat VI chord? In minor keys, the flat VI chord is common, but let's see the notes of Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db. And these notes are in Ab harmonic minor? Ab harmonic minor has Bb, Db, but Gb? No, it has G natural, so Gb is not in the scale. So Gb major is not diatomic in Ab harmonic minor.

But in the progression, Gb/Bb is used, which has Bb in bass, and notes Bb, Db, Gb. So it has Gb, which is not in the scale.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Dbm is Db, E, Ab? Db, Fb, Ab? So notes Ab, Db, E? In Ab harmonic minor, we have Ab, Db, E? Yes, because Db is the fourth, E is Fb which is the sixth? So Dbm is the iv chord in Ab harmonic minor? In minor keys, the iv chord is minor, so Dbm is the iv chord. And with Ab in bass, it's in first inversion, so iv6 chord.

Now, B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. B major is B, D#, F#. With Bb bass, notes Bb, B, D#, F#. In Ab harmonic minor, we have B? No, we have Cb which is B, so yes, we have B natural? But we have B natural as Cb? But B natural is the same as Cb? In terms of pitch, yes, but in spelling, Cb is B? But in chord, B major has D# and F#. D# is not in Ab harmonic minor; Ab harmonic minor has Eb? So D# is enharmonic to Eb? But Eb is in the scale, so D# is Eb? But in chord, if we have B major, it implies B, D#, F#, which are not all in the scale. B is in the scale as Cb, but D# is not Eb because Eb is D#? Enharmonically yes, but in functional harmony, it might be different.

Finally, Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, Ab is G#, so notes G#, E, B, D#. In Ab harmonic minor, we have E? Yes, as Fb? We have B? Yes, as Cb? We have G#? G# is not in the scale; we have G natural? So G# is the leading tone of A? But we have Ab, so G# is the same as Ab? But in chord, Emaj7 has G#, which is Ab, so it's conflicting because in Ab harmonic minor, the tonic is Ab, so G# is not used; we use Ab. So Emaj7/Ab has G# which is Ab, so it's like having Ab and G# together, which is odd.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is actually functioning as a German augmented sixth chord or something.

Let's think about the B/Bb chord. B/Bb might be a way to spell an augmented sixth chord.

In Ab minor, the augmented sixth chord typically resolves to the dominant Eb. The augmented sixth chord has notes like Ab, C, Eb, F#? Or something.

Recall: in Ab minor, the German augmented sixth chord would be built on Fb? Actually, the augmented sixth interval is from Fb to D? Standard augmented sixth chords: Italian augmented sixth: Ab, C, F#? But F# is Gb? Let's use Ab as tonic.

In Ab minor, the augmented sixth chord has the lowered sixth scale degree and the raised fourth scale degree? Typically, the augmented sixth chord built on the flattened sixth scale degree. In Ab minor, the sixth scale degree is Fb, so flattened sixth would be Fbb? That doesn't make sense.

Usually, augmented sixth chords are built on the b6 scale degree. In Ab minor, the natural sixth is Fb, which is E, so b6 would be E? But E is already flat? Perhaps it's easier to think in terms of notes.

The augmented sixth chord has characteristic augmented sixth interval between b6 and #4. In Ab minor, b6 is Fb (E), and #4 is C? But C is not in key; #4 would be C#? Let's see the resolution to dominant Eb.

The augmented sixth chord typically resolves to the dominant chord. So in Ab minor, dominant is Eb major. The augmented sixth chord has notes that chromatically approach the dominant notes. For example, the Italian augmented sixth has Ab, C, F#? But F# resolves to G? But Eb has G? No, Eb has G? Eb major has Eb, G, Bb? So from F# to G is half step? F# to G is half step, yes. And from C to Bb? C to Bb is whole step? Not smooth.

Standard Italian augmented sixth in A minor: built on F, so F, A, D#? resolving to E major? I need to recall.

Perhaps for Ab minor, the German augmented sixth chord would be spelled as Eb, G, Bb, C#? But C# resolves to D? But in Ab minor, the dominant is Eb, so resolution to Eb? Eb chord has Eb, G, Bb, so from C# to Bb? Not direct.

Let's think of the notes in B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#. If we consider this in Ab minor, these notes could be part of an augmented sixth chord. The German augmented sixth chord typically has the notes: b6, 1, b3, #4? In Ab minor, b6 is Fb (E), 1 is Ab, b3 is Cb (B), #4 is C#? But we have D# and F#? Not matching.

Another thought: B/Bb might be a misinterpretation. Perhaps it's Bb/B, meaning Bb major with B bass? But that would be Bb, D, F with B bass, so notes B, Bb, D, F? Still odd.

Perhaps it's B7/Bb, but it's written as B/Bb.

Let's look at the sequence: after Dbm/Ab, we have B/Bb, then Bbdim. So from Dbm/Ab to B/Bb to Bbdim.

Dbm/Ab is iv6 in Ab minor, so it might resolve to V or something. B/Bb might be a chromatic chord.

Notice that B/Bb has B and Bb together, which is a minor ninth, so it might be a dominant chord with b9.

Perhaps B/Bb is actually an E7 chord with b9? E7b9 would be E, G#, B, D, F? But here we have B, D#, F#, Bb? D# is G#? Let's see: if we consider B/Bb as B major with Bb bass, the notes are Bb, B, D#, F#. If we reinterpret D# as Eb, then notes Bb, B, Eb, F#. If we consider F# as Gb, then Bb, B, Eb, Gb. This looks like an Eb7 chord with alterations? Eb7 would be Eb, G, Bb, Db? But here we have B natural and Gb? B natural is Cb, and Gb is F#? So Eb, G, Bb, Db vs Bb, B, Eb, Gb? So if we take Eb as root, then we have Eb, Gb? But Gb is not G, so it's Eb, Gb, Bb, B? So it's Eb7b9? Eb7b9 would be Eb, G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is E? So Eb, G, Bb, Db, E? But here we have B natural and Gb? So if Eb is root, then Gb is b10? Not standard.

Perhaps it's a diminished chord or something.

Another idea: perhaps the key is Bb minor or major, but let's see the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#, which is often used as a secondary dominant to A? But then A is not in the progression.

Let's list the chords in terms of their function in Ab minor.

From earlier, Bbdim is vii°7 in Ab harmonic minor.

Dbm/Ab is iv6 in Ab minor.

Gb/Bb is not diatomic, but Gb major is the flat VI chord in Ab minor, which is common in minor keys for a borrowed chord from the parallel major? In Ab major, the VI chord is F minor? Not Gb.

Gb major is the Neapolitan chord in F minor? Not sure.

Perhaps Gb/Bb is acting as a dominant chord? Gb major has notes Gb, Bb, Db. In Ab minor, if we consider Gb as the dominant of Cb? No.

Another thought: in the progression, Bbdim and Gb/Bb are often together, and since Bbdim is vii°7 of Ab, it should resolve to Ab major or minor. But here it resolves to Gb/Bb, which is not Ab. So perhaps Bbdim is not resolving to Ab.

Perhaps Bbdim is functioning as a common-tone diminished chord for Gb? But Gb/Bb has Bb bass, so maybe.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Db major or minor.

Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db.

Chords: Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G - E and G are not in Db major.

Db minor: as before, Db natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B? So Bbdim has Bb, which is not in Db minor? Db minor has B? So Bb is not there.

But Gb/Bb is Gb major, which is IV in Db minor? Yes, Gb major is diatomic in Db minor.

Dbm/Ab is i chord in first inversion? Dbm is the i chord in Db minor? Yes, Dbm is the tonic chord in Db minor.

B/Bb has B, D#, F#, Bb. B is in Db minor? Db minor has B? In harmonic minor, yes, because raised seventh? In Db harmonic minor, the seventh is C, so B? No, in Db harmonic minor, the seventh is C? From earlier, Db harmonic minor would have C natural? Let's see Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, C? So B is not there? B is not in the scale; we have A and C, so B is between A and C? So no B natural.

So B/Bb has B natural, which is not in Db minor.

Emaj7/Ab has E, G#, B, D#? G# is Ab, so it has Ab, but also E, B, D#? D# is Eb? So notes Ab, E, B, Eb? In Db minor, we have Eb, Ab, but E and B are not diatomic.

So not Db minor.

Perhaps the key is E major or minor? But then Bbdim would be far away.

Let's list all the chords and see if there is a common note or pivot.

Notice that in the progression, Bbdim appears frequently, and it has notes Bb, Db, E, G.

Gb/Bb has Bb, Db, Gb.

So shared Bb and Db.

Dbm/Ab has Ab, Db, E? So shared Db and E.

B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#. So shared Bb with others? But B natural is new.

Emaj7/Ab has E, G#, B, D#? with Ab bass, so shared E? But G# is Ab, so shared Ab? 

Also, Emaj7/Ab has B and D#, which are in B/Bb.

So perhaps there is a connection through B and E.

Another idea: perhaps the Bbdim is not functioning as a vii° but as a passing chord or as a dominant of another key.

Bbdim7 is symmetrical, so it can be used in multiple keys.

Perhaps the key is Gb major? But we have Emaj7/Ab which doesn't fit.

Let's consider the first and last chords. The progression starts with Bbdim and ends with Bbdim, so it might be that Bbdim is the tonic? But diminished chords are not stable, so unlikely.

Perhaps the tonic is Ab, and Bbdim is the vii°7, but it doesn't resolve to Ab.

In the progression, after Bbdim, we have Gb/Bb, which might be a deception resolution.

But let's look at the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#, which is a chord that can be used in A minor or C# minor etc.

But then Bbdim follows, which doesn't resolve to A.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is functioning as a dominant of A, but then it should resolve to A, but it doesn't; it goes to Bbdim.

So maybe it's not.

Another thought: perhaps the mode is something like Phrygian or Locrian.

Let's list the scale from the chords.

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G

From Gb/Bb: Bb, Db, Gb

From Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E

From B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

From Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, B, D#? but Ab is G#, so E, G#, B, D#

So common notes: Bb, Db, E, G, Ab, B, D#, F#, Gb? 

But Gb and F# are the same, D# and Eb are the same, but in context, let's see.

Notice that E and B are common in several chords.

Perhaps the key is E minor or major.

In E major, we have E, G#, B, D# for Emaj7, so that fits. Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G? E is in E major, but Bb, Db, G are not in E major. E major has F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#? So no Bb, Db, G.

So not E major.

E minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D? So Bbdim has Bb, Db, etc., not in E minor.

So not E.

Perhaps the key is B minor? But then Emaj7 doesn't fit.

Let's consider the chord B/Bb. If we think of B/Bb as a B7 chord with b9, then it might be the dominant of E? But then it should resolve to E, but it resolves to Bbdim, which is not E.

In the progression, after B/Bb, we have Bbdim, which has E, so perhaps it does resolve to E? But Bbdim is not E major or minor; it has E but as a chord tone, so if Bbdim has E, it might be heard as an E chord with additions? But Bbdim is diminished, so not stable.

Perhaps Bbdim is acting as an incomplete dominant of E? But Bbdim has E, so it might be like an E7b9 without root? Let's see: E7b9 would be E, G#, B, D, F? But Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G? So if E is the root, then G# is not there; we have G natural and Bb and Db? So not E7.

Another idea: perhaps the B/Bb is actually a misspelling of Bbdim? But why would it be written as B/Bb?

Perhaps it's B5/Bb or something.

Let's look at the sequence: Dbm/Ab to B/Bb to Bbdim.

Dbm/Ab is Ab, Db, E? B/Bb is Bb, B, D#, F#? Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G.

So from Dbm/Ab to B/Bb: the bass moves from Ab to Bb, which is stepwise? Ab to Bb is whole step.

The chords: Dbm has Db and E, B/Bb has B and D# and F#? No common tones.

Then B/Bb to Bbdim: bass Bb to Bb, so same bass? B/Bb has Bb bass, Bbdim has Bb root? So bass Bb to Bb.

Notes: B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#; Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. So common Bb, and then B to Db? D# to E? F# to G? So voice leading: B to Db is minor third, D# to E is half step, F# to G is half step. So somewhat smooth.

Similarly, from Bbdim to Gb/Bb: Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G; Gb/Bb has Bb, Db, Gb. So common Bb and Db, then E to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, G to Gb? G to Gb is diminished second? So not smooth, but G might move to Gb.

So overall, the voice leading might be chromatic.

Perhaps the key is not traditional, and we need to find the most frequent chord or the chord that sounds like home.

Since the progression ends with Bbdim, it might be that Bbdim is the tonic, but that seems unlikely because diminished chords are dissonant.

Perhaps the tonic is Ab, and Bbdim is the vii°7, and the progression avoids resolving to Ab, creating tension.

But let's check the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#, which in Ab context, could be seen as a chromatic mediant or something.

Emaj7/G# has notes G#, E, B, D#. In Ab minor, G# is Ab, so it's like Ab, E, B, D#? So it has Ab and E, which is like an Ab chord with major third? Ab major has Ab, C, Eb, so not E. So it's not Ab major.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is actually an altered dominant of Ab? For example, in Ab minor, the dominant is Eb, so Emaj7/Ab would be E major over Ab, which is not related.

Another thought: Emaj7/Ab might be functioning as a French augmented sixth chord in Ab minor? Let's see.

In Ab minor, the French augmented sixth chord typically has notes: Ab, C, D, F#? But we have E, G#, B, D#? So not matching.

Perhaps for Db minor? In Db minor, the French augmented sixth would have Db, F, G, B? But we have E, G#, etc.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Bb minor.

In Bb minor, the chords: Bbdim is not diatomic, but could be vii°7 of Cb? Not.

Perhaps Bb harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A? So notes: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. So Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G? But E and G are not in Bb harmonic minor; we have Gb and A, so no E or G.

So not.

I recall that in some jazz progressions, diminished chords are used as passing chords, and the key might be determined by the overall tonality.

Perhaps from the chords, the most stable chord is Gb/Bb? But it appears in first inversion, so maybe not.

Let's list the roots: from the chord symbols, the roots are Bb, Gb, Bb, Dbm, B, Bb, Gb, Bb, Emaj7, Bb. So roots are mostly Bb, with Gb, Dbm, B, Emaj7.

So Bb is frequent, but Bbdim is unstable, so perhaps the tonic is Bb major or minor.

In Bb major, Bbdim is not diatomic, but could be borrowed from minor.

In Bb major, the diatomic diminished chord is on C#? No, on A? vii° is A dim? A dim7 is A, C, Eb, Gb? So not Bbdim.

In Bb minor, vii°7 is A dim7, same as above.

So Bbdim is not diatomic in Bb.

Perhaps Bb is the dominant of Eb? But then why Emaj7/Ab?

Let's consider that Emaj7/Ab might be a typo or something else.

Another idea: perhaps Emaj7/Ab is meant to be Ebmaj7/Ab? But Ebmaj7/Ab would be Ebmaj7 with Ab bass, but Ab is the fifth of Eb, so Ebmaj7/Ab is Ebmaj7 in second inversion? But then notes Ab, Eb, G, B, D? But written as Emaj7/Ab, so not.

Perhaps it's E7/Ab? But it says Emaj7.

Let's look at the original progression: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim"

Perhaps in context, this is from a song or something.

Perhaps the key is Ab major, and the chords are borrowed from minor.

In Ab major, the chords: Bbdim is not diatomic, but could be from Ab minor? In Ab minor, Bbdim is vii°7, as we said.

Gb/Bb is not diatomic in Ab major; in Ab major, the VI chord is F minor, so Gb major is the flat VI, which is common in minor keys but not in major.

Dbm/Ab is iv chord in Ab minor, so borrowed from minor.

B/Bb is not diatomic; could be a secondary dominant or something.

Emaj7/Ab is not diatomic.

So perhaps the key is Ab minor, and all chords are from Ab minor or chromatic alterations.

In Ab minor, the diatomic chords include: i Abm, ii° Bbm? But Bbm is diminished? In natural minor, ii chord is diminished? In Ab natural minor, chords: i Abm, ii° Bbm? Bbm is Bb, Db, Fb? So Bb, Db, E? So yes, Bbm is diminished? But Bbm is Bb minor, which is diminished? No, Bb minor triad is Bb, Db, F? But in natural minor, the ii chord is diminished because the triad on the second degree is minor? Let's see: in natural minor, the second degree triad is built on Bb, with notes Bb, Db, Fb? So Bb, Db, E? So it is a diminished triad? Yes, in natural minor, the ii chord is diminished. So Bbm is actually Bb diminished triad? But usually, we write it as Bbm? But Bbm typically means Bb minor, which would be Bb, Db, F? But in minor key, the second degree triad has minor third and diminished fifth? So it is diminished? So in Ab natural minor, the chord on Bb is Bb, Db, Fb, which is Bb diminished triad? So we should write it as Bbdim? So yes, in Ab natural minor, the ii chord is Bbdim triad? But in the progression, we have Bbdim, which might be the ii° chord in Ab natural minor? But in the progression, Bbdim is likely a seventh chord, so Bbdim7, which is not diatomic in natural minor because in natural minor, the seventh chord on ii would be Bb half-diminished? Bb half-diminished would be Bb, Db, Fb, Ab? But Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, Fb, Abb? So Abb is G? So Bbdim7 has G instead of Ab? So Bbdim7 is not the ii°7 in natural minor; it is the vii°7 in harmonic minor.

So in Ab natural minor, ii°7 is Bb half-diminished: Bb, Db, Fb, Ab.

But in the progression, we have Bbdim, which is probably Bbdim7, so it has G instead of Ab, so it is from harmonic minor.

So in Ab harmonic minor, the vii°7 is Gdim7, which is the same as Bbdim7.

So indeed, Bbdim7 is the vii°7 in Ab harmonic minor.

Now, for Gb/Bb: in Ab harmonic minor, Gb major is not diatomic, but it could be the Neapolitan chord? The Neapolitan chord is usually built on the flattened second degree, so in Ab minor, the flattened second is Bbb, which is A? So Neapolitan chord would be A major? But here we have Gb major, which is not the Neapolitan.

Gb major is the flat VI chord in Ab minor? In Ab minor, the VI chord is Fb major? Fb major is E major? So flat VI would be? From Ab, the sixth is Fb, so flat VI would be Fbb? No, flat VI means lowering the sixth scale degree, so from Fb to Fbb? That doesn't make sense.

Typically, in minor keys, the chord from the parallel major are used, so from Ab major, the VI chord is F minor, so not Gb.

So Gb major is not diatomic in Ab minor.

But in the progression, it is used frequently, so perhaps it is a borrowed chord from Ab major? In Ab major, the chord on Gb is Gb major? In Ab major, the seventh degree is G, so Gb is not in the scale.

So not.

Perhaps Gb major is the dominant of Cb major? But Cb is B, so dominant of B major? But then why in Ab minor?

Let's consider the function of Gb/Bb. Since it has Bb in bass, and Bb is the second scale degree of Ab, so it might be acting as a dominant substitute? But Gb major is not related to Ab.

Another idea: Gb/Bb might be interpreted as a Bb7 chord? Bb7 would be Bb, D, F, Ab? But Gb/Bb has Bb, Db, Gb? So not Bb7.

Perhaps it's Gb major with added bass, but still.

Notice that Gb/Bb and Bbdim share Bb and Db, so perhaps Gb/Bb is like a resolution of Bbdim? But Bbdim has E and G, which resolve to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, G to Gb is half step, so perhaps.

Then Dbm/Ab is the iv chord, which is common in minor keys.

B/Bb is puzzling. But if we consider B/Bb as an altered chord, it might be a German augmented sixth chord in Ab minor? Let's see the spelling of German augmented sixth in Ab minor.

In Ab minor, the German augmented sixth chord typically spells as Eb, G, Bb, C#? But C# resolves to D? But in Ab minor, the dominant is Eb, so it resolves to Eb? But Eb chord has Eb, G, Bb, so from C# to Bb? Not direct.

The German augmented sixth has notes: b6, 1, b3, #4? In Ab minor, b6 is Fb (E), 1 is Ab, b3 is Cb (B), #4 is C#? So notes E, Ab, B, C#? But we have B/Bb with Bb, B, D#, F#? If we reinterpret D# as Eb? But then Bb, B, Eb, F#? If we consider F# as Gb, then Bb, B, Eb, Gb? So if we take Eb as root, then it's Eb, Gb, Bb, B? So it's Eb7 with b9 and b5? Eb7 would have Eb, G, Bb, Db? So here Gb instead of G, and B instead of Db? So it's Eb7b9b5? But B is not Db; B is Cb, so from Eb to Cb is diminished sixth? Not standard.

Perhaps it's a diminished chord in disguise.

B/Bb has notes Bb, B, D#, F#. If we consider this as a whole-tone cluster or something, but let's see the voice leading to Bbdim: B to Db, D# to E, F# to G, Bb to Bb. So it's chromatic motion down except B to Db.

B to Db is down a minor third, which is not chromatic, but the other voices move by half step.

So perhaps B/Bb is a passing chord.

Now for Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7/Ab has notes Ab, E, B, D#? So Ab, E, B, D#. In Ab minor, this could be seen as an Ab chord with major third? But Ab major has C, not E? So it's Ab augmented? But has E and B and D#? So it's like an E major chord over Ab bass? So it might be a polychord.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is functioning as the dominant of A? But then it should resolve to A, but it goes to Bbdim, which has E, so maybe it resolves to E? But Bbdim is not E major.

Another thought: perhaps the key is E major, and Emaj7/Ab is actually Emaj7/G#, which is I chord in first inversion? But then why Bbdim? Bbdim would be far from E major.

Perhaps the key is C# minor? Because Emaj7 is the V chord in C# minor? In C# minor, the V chord is G# major? But Emaj7 is E major, which is not G#.

In C# minor, the V chord is G# major, so E major is the III chord? But III chord is major in minor key? In C# natural minor, III chord is E major? So Emaj7 could be the III chord in C# minor? Then Bbdim? Bbdim is enharmonic to G#dim7? In C# harmonic minor, the vii°7 is G#dim7, which is the same as Bbdim7? Because G#dim7 is G#, B, D, F? and Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? So G#dim7 and Bbdim7 are the same? Let's see: G#dim7: G#, B, D, F? But from G# to B is minor third? G# to B is 3 semitones? G# to A is 1, A to A# is 2, A# to B is 3? So yes, minor third. B to D is minor third? B to C is 4, C to C# is 5, C# to D is 6? No, from B to D: B to C is 1 semitone, C to C# is 2, C# to D is 3? So yes, 3 semitones, minor third. D to F is minor third? D to D# is 1, D# to E is 2, E to F is 3? So yes, so G#dim7 is G#, B, D, F? But F is not F#? So notes G#, B, D, F. And Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? So are they the same? G# to Bb is the same as Bb? G# is A? Let's list pitch classes: G#dim7: G#, B, D, F. Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G. So pitch classes: G#=Ab, B, D, F? and Bb, Db, E, G? So for them to be the same, we need G#=Bb? No, G# is not Bb. So they are not the same set. But if we take G#dim7 and transpose it, it might be the same as Bdim7? No.

G#dim7: G#, B, D, F. Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G. So for example, if we take G#dim7 and lower each note by half step, we get G, Bb, Db, E? which is Gdim7? So G#dim7 and Bbdim7 are different.

But in terms of sound, since diminished chords are symmetrical, any diminished seventh chord can be seen as one of three possible roots? But the pitch class set is the same for all diminished seventh chords? No, there are only three distinct diminished seventh chords because each diminished seventh chord covers four notes, and there are 12 notes, so 12/4=3 distinct sets? Let's see.

One diminished seventh chord set: C, Eb, Gb, A? another: C#, E, G, Bb? another: D, F, Ab, B? So yes, three distinct sets.

So Bbdim7 has notes Bb, Db, E, G? which is the same set as Db dim7? Db dim7: Db, E, G, Bb? Yes! So Bbdim7 is the same as Db dim7, E dim7, G dim7? So it's one of the sets.

Similarly, G#dim7 has notes G#, B, D, F? which is the same as B dim7, D dim7, F dim7? So different set.

So for Bbdim7, it is in the set that includes Bb, Db, E, G.

Now, in C# minor, the vii°7 is G#dim7, which is from the set G#, B, D, F, so not the same as Bbdim7.

So for Bbdim7 to be the vii°7, it must be in a key where the seventh degree is G? So for example, if the key is Ab minor, seventh degree is G, so vii°7 is Gdim7, which is the same as Bbdim7? Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E? So yes, same as Bbdim7? Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? So yes, same notes. So in Ab minor, vii°7 is Gdim7, which is enharmonic to Bbdim7? But Bbdim7 has Bb, which is not G? But the notes are the same: Bb, Db, E, G is the same as G, Bb, Db, E? So yes, same chord. So when we see Bbdim7, it can be functioning as vii°7 in Ab minor.

So back to Ab minor.

So for the progression in Ab minor, we have:
- Bbdim7 (vii°7)
- Gb/Bb ( flat VI chord? but not diatomic)
- Dbm/Ab (iv6)
- B/Bb (?
- Emaj7/Ab (?

So for B/Bb, if we consider it in Ab minor, what could it be? Perhaps it is a German augmented sixth chord? Let's spell the German augmented sixth in Ab minor.

The German augmented sixth chord is built on the flattened sixth degree. In Ab minor, the sixth degree is Fb (E), so flattened sixth would be? Actually, the augmented sixth chord is built on the b6 scale degree, but in minor, the natural sixth is already flat, so usually, the augmented sixth chord uses the natural sixth? I need to recall.

In minor keys, the augmented sixth chord typically uses the lowered sixth scale degree from the natural minor? Let's take A minor as example.

In A minor, the augmented sixth chord has notes: F, A, C#? This is Italian augmented sixth? But F is the b6? In A natural minor, the sixth is F, so b6 is F? But F is already there? So the Italian augmented sixth in A minor is F, A, C#? and it resolves to E major? So notes F, A, C#? So the augmented sixth is between F and C#? F to C# is augmented sixth? Yes.

So in Ab minor, the Italian augmented sixth would be on Fb? But Fb is E, so E, Ab, C? But C is not C#? So for German augmented sixth, in A minor, it is F, A, C#, D#? But D# is E? So notes F, A, C#, E? So in Ab minor, it would be E, Ab, C, F? But C is not C#? So for German, it should be E, Ab, C, F#? But F# is Gb? So notes E, Ab, C, Gb? But we have B/Bb with Bb, B, D#, F#? So if we compare, for German augmented sixth in Ab minor, we expect E, Ab, C, Gb? But B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#? So if we reinterpret B as C? B is Cb? So B is Cb? In Ab minor, Cb is the third, so for German augmented sixth, we have E, Ab, C, Gb? So notes E, Ab, C, Gb. But B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#? So if we take B as Cb, then B is Cb, and D# as Eb? But Eb is not in the chord? So not matching.

Perhaps B/Bb is the French augmented sixth? In A minor, French augmented sixth is F, A, B, D#? So notes F, A, B, D#? So in Ab minor, it would be E, Ab, Bb, D#? But D# is Eb? So E, Ab, Bb, Eb? But B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#? So if we have E, Ab, Bb, Eb? But B/Bb has B instead of Ab? So not.

So B/Bb doesn't match any standard augmented sixth chord.

Perhaps B/Bb is a secondary dominant? For example, if it is B major, it could be the dominant of E? But then why over Bb bass?

Another idea: perhaps B/Bb is meant to be Bb7? But Bb7 would be Bb, D, F, Ab? but here we have B, D#, F#? so not.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Gb major.

In Gb major, the chords: Bbdim is not diatomic, but could be from Gb minor? etc.

I think I need to accept that for this progression, the key is Ab minor, and B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab are chromatic chords for color.

So for the purpose of this exercise, I'll go with Ab minor.

So key: Ab minor

Mode: harmonic minor? Since Bbdim7 is used, which is from harmonic minor.

So answer: key of Ab minor.

But let's confirm with the Emaj7/Ab. In Ab minor, Emaj7/Ab has notes Ab, E, B, D#? which can be seen as an E major chord over Ab, which is chromatic, but might be used as a borrowed chord from Ab major? But in Ab major, E major is not diatomic.

Perhaps it's a modulation to E major, but then back to Bbdim.

But since the progression ends with Bbdim, which is vii°7 of Ab, it suggests Ab minor.

So I think Ab minor is the key.

So for the response, I'll say key of Ab minor.

But the user asked for key and mode, so mode is minor.

So final answer: Key of Ab minor.

The chord progression features Bbdim7 chords, which function as the vii°7 chord in Ab harmonic minor. This is supported by the presence of Dbm/Ab, which is the iv6 chord in Ab minor, and the overall tonal center suggests Ab as the tonic. The use of diminished chords and minor chords aligns with the harmonic minor mode, where the raised seventh scale degree (G natural) creates the leading tone tension resolved through the vii°7 chord.

The chords Gb/Bb and B/Bb are chromatic alterations or borrowed chords that add color but do not change the fundamental key. Emaj7/Ab is a chromatic chord that may serve as a secondary dominant or borrowed chord, but it does not disrupt the established key of Ab minor.

Thus, the key is **Ab minor**, and the mode is **minor** (specifically harmonic minor due to the use of the diminished seventh chord).
