This chord progression:

**Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim**

...is rich in chromaticism, diminished harmony, and slash chords — suggesting it’s **not in a traditional major/minor key** but likely in a **modal or chromatic context**, possibly from **jazz, film score, or modern pop/rock theory**.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Chords

Let’s write out the chords in root-position for easier analysis:

| Chord | Notes | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Bbdim | Bb, Db, F | Diminished triad on bII |
| Gb/Bb | Bb, Gb, Db | **Gb major triad with Bb in bass** → inverted Gb major |
| Dbm/Ab | Ab, Db, Fb (E) | **Db minor triad with Ab bass** → inverted Dbmin |
| B/Bb | B, F#, D# | **B major triad with Bb in bass** — very dissonant! |
| Emaj7/Ab | Ab, E, G#, B#, D# | **E major 7 with Ab bass** → highly unexpected |

Note: The chord **B/Bb** is a **major triad (B-D#-F#) over Bb bass** — this is an **augmented second interval (Bb to B)**, creating strong tension.

---

### Step 2: Look for Key Centers

Let’s look at **most common tonal anchors**.

#### The **Bbdim** chords repeat often — this is a strong hint. Bb diminished = Bb, Db, F.

This is the **ii° chord in C minor** — but we never see C minor tonal center clearly.

But wait — **Gb major** appears twice as **Gb/Bb** (i.e., Gb major in first inversion).

Gb major = Gb, Bb, Db — which is the **same notes as Bbdim**!  
**Bbdim = Bb, Db, F** → **not the same as Gb major = Gb, Bb, Db**

Wait! Look:

- **Bbdim**: Bb – Db – F  
- **Gb major**: Gb – Bb – Db → So both contain **Bb and Db**

The only difference is **F (in Bbdim)** vs **Gb (in Gb)**.

So:  
- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–F  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb–Bb–Db → this is **Gb major in 1st inversion**

So we’ve got **Bbdim** and **Gb major** alternating — both share two notes (Bb and Db) — they’re a **tritone apart** (Bb to Gb = tritone). That’s classic **diminished/whole-tone** space.

In jazz harmony, **Bb dim** and **Gb maj** are **enharmonically related** and often treated as substitutions because they share the same **tritone interval**:

- Bbdim: Bb–Db–F → tritone: **Bb–F**  
- Gb maj: Gb–Bb–Db → tritone: **Gb–Db**

But **Bb–F** is the same as **F–B**, and **Gb–Db** = **Db–Gb**, which are enharmonically **same tritone**!

Actually:  
**Bb–F** = tritone  
**Gb–Db** = same as F#–C# → **NOT same as Bb–F**

Wait — **Bb to F = 6 semitones**  
**Gb to Db = Gb–G–Ab–A–Bb–B–C–Db → 8 semitones**

Oops! So not the same tritone.

Let’s correct:  
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–F → tritone = **Bb–F** (6 semitones)  
- Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db → tritone = **Gb–Db** (6 semitones? Gb→Db: Gb–G–Ab–A–Bb–B–C–Db → 8 semitones? Let's count properly):

From **Gb to Db**:
- Gb → G = 1
- G → Ab = 2
- Ab → A = 3
- A → Bb = 4
- Bb → B = 5
- B → C = 6
- C → Db = 7 → **That’s 7 semitones?**

Wait! No — **Gb to Db** is **5 steps up** in the circle of fifths.

Actually, **Gb to Db is a perfect fifth down** → **Db is a perfect fifth below Gb**.

So **Gb to Db is 7 semitones (perfect fifth)** — **not a tritone!**

Let’s find the tritone in Gb major:  
Gb–Bb–Db → the tritone is **Gb to Db?** No — Gb to Db is P5.  
The tritone in a major triad is **between the root and the fifth?** No — in a major triad the intervals are M3 and P5.

The **tritone** is between **the 3rd and the 7th** — but this is a triad, no 7th.

So perhaps **Bbdim and Gb major** form a **chromatic mediant relationship**?

### Step 3: Look for the strongest tonal center

The chord **Emaj7/Ab** is extremely telling.

Let’s write it out: **Emaj7 with Ab in bass**

So notes:  
E (root), G# (3rd), B# (7th = C), D# (9th?) → but maj7 = E, G#, B#, D#  
Then bass = **Ab**

So chord = **Ab–E–G#–B#–D#**

But B# = C, so: **Ab, E, G#, C, D#**

That’s a **five-note sonority**: Ab, C, D#, E, G#  
→ That’s **Ab, C, D#, E, G#**

Let’s re-order:  
C, D#, E, G#, Ab

That’s **C**, then **D# = Eb**, **E**, **G#**, **Ab**

This is **not** a standard chord. It’s very chromatic.

But notice: **E and Ab** — that’s a **minor 6th interval** (E to Ab = 8 semitones) — a very expressive, cinematic sound.

In fact, **Emaj7/Ab** is a **very common voicing in modern film music** (e.g., Hans Zimmer, etc.) as a **colored, ambiguous, unresolved** chord.

It **avoids a clear key center** — this is **intentional**.

---

### Step 4: The “B/Bb” chord

**B major triad over Bb bass**:

B – D# – F# over Bb

So: **Bb, B, D#, F#**

That’s a **major second (Bb–B)**, which is **extremely dissonant** — used for tension.

This chord appears just once — likely as a **chromatic approach** or **passing chord**.

It *could* be functioning as **a deceptive voice-leading** into the next chord.

---

### Step 5: Look for patterns and repetition

The progression repeats:

1. Bbdim – Bbdim  
2. Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
3. Bbdim – Bbdim  
4. Dbm/Ab – B/Bb  
5. Bbdim – Bbdim  
6. Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
7. Bbdim – Bbdim  
8. Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

So the **Bbdim is the “home” chord** — it appears **8 times out of 14**, and starts and ends the progression.

**Gb/Bb appears 4 times** — second most common.

So the **tonal center is likely Bb** — even though the harmony is chromatic, **Bbdim is the anchor**.

Bbdim = Bb–Db–F — which can be interpreted as **the vii° chord in C minor**, or **the ii° chord in Db major**, or even **the root chord in a whole-tone or octatonic scale**.

But Bbdim is also **the root chord of the Bb diminished scale**.

---

### Step 6: Try the **Bb Locrian Mode**

Locrian mode: Bb Locrian = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab  
→ Chord built on Bb: Bb–Db–F — **Bbdim** — YES!

**Bb Locrian** is the 7th mode of **C major**, and has a **diminished triad on the tonic**.

So **if this were in Bb Locrian**, the tonic chord would be Bbdim — which matches.

But then what about **Gb/Bb**?  
Gb = #4 of Bb Locrian → that’s **very characteristic** of **Locrian** — the **#4** (Gb) is the **tritone**, the defining instability of Locrian.

In Bb Locrian:
- Scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab
- Chord on I: Bbdim (Bb–Db–F)
- Chord on IV: Ebmaj7
- Chord on V: F7
- Chord on #IV: **Gb major** — YES! That’s the **#4 chord** — very common in modern use of Locrian.

Indeed, **Gb major = #IV chord** in Bb Locrian.

And **Dbm = bVI** in Bb Locrian → Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab → yes, bVI.

Then **B/Bb** — B is **#7** of Bb Locrian → **that’s the leading tone** — but normally leading tone is A natural in Bb major scale, but here in Locrian it’s **Ab** — so B is **not in the scale**.

B = accidental.

Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab** — E is not in Bb Locrian.

So **Bb Locrian gives us:**  
- **Bbdim** → tonic  
- **Gb/Bb (Gb major)** → #IV — very common  
- **Dbm/Ab** → bVI — also common

But **B/Bb** and **Emaj7/Ab** are **outside Bb Locrian**.

So perhaps this is **Bb Locrian with chromatic embellishments** — or **Modal Mixture from Bb minor**?

---

### Step 7: Consider **Bb minor** with chromaticism

Bb minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

That’s **natural minor** — same as **Bb Locrian**? No.

Wait:  
- **Bb minor (natural)** → Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab → **same notes as Bb Locrian!**

Bb minor natural = 6th mode of Db major → same as **Bb Locrian**.

So **Bb natural minor = Bb Locrian**.

That’s correct.

So **everything fits** in **Bb Aeolian?** Wait — no.

**Bb Aeolian (natural minor)** = Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab → YES, **same as Locrian?**

Wait — here's the confusion.

**Mode names**:

| Root | Mode | Notes | Tonic chord |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| Bb | **Bb Aeolian** (natural minor) | Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab | **Bb minor** — NOT diminished |
| Bb | **Bb Locrian** | Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab | **Bb diminished** (if we build triad on 7th of C major) |

Wait — **this is key!**

The **Bb natural minor scale** (Aeolian) has a **minor tonic triad**: Bb–Db–F → that’s **Bb minor** → **not diminished**.

But **Bbdim** is **Bb–Db–Fb**, not **F**!

Ah! This is the **critical point**.

- **Bb minor chord**: Bb–Db–F  
- **Bb diminished chord**: Bb–Db–**Fb**

So **Bb dim ≠ Bb min**

That means: **the harmonic minor scale** or **melodic minor**, or **some altered scale**, is involved.

We must ask: **What scale contains Bb–Db–Fb**?

Bb–Db–Fb = **Bb dim**

This is the **7th degree** of the **C harmonic minor scale**.

C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab **B**  
→ 7th scale degree: **B** → chord: B–D–F → **B dim**

But we’re seeing **Bb dim**.

So what scale has **Bb dim** as the tonic?

Perhaps **Bb half-diminished scale** → **Bb Locrian #2**? Or perhaps **the whole-half diminished scale**.

Try the **Bb half-whole diminished scale**:

Bb Half-Whole Dim:  
Bb – C – Db – Eb – E – Gb – G – A – (Bb)

Chords:  
- Bb dim: Bb–Db–Fb  
- C m7b5: C–Eb–Gb  
- Db aug: Db–F—A  
- Eb m7: Eb–Gb–Bb–Db  
- E dim: E–G–Bb  
- Gb maj7: Gb–Bb–Db–F

This gets us **Gb maj7** = Gb–Bb–Db–F → which is **Gb major**!

And **Bb dim** — yes.

So if we assume **Bb half-whole diminished scale** (octatonic), then:

- **Bbdim** = tonic (mode 1)  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major = **mode 6** (Gb–Bb–Db) — yes, fits  
- **Dbm/Ab** → Db minor triad: Db–Fb–Ab — is Db in the scale?  
   Bb half-whole: Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A  
   → Yes, Db is in there  
   → Fb = E → yes, Fb = E in the scale  
   → Ab? **Ab is NOT in Bb half-whole diminished scale!**  
   Scale: Bb C Db Eb **E** Gb G A → Ab is **not there**

So **Ab is chromatic** — not in scale.

Ab appears in **Dbm/Ab** — so Ab is the bass, but Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab → Ab = minor 6th of Bb? Not in the scale.

Now, **B/Bb** — B is **not in Bb half-whole dim** scale.

B is **#7** of Bb, but scale has **A**, not **B**.

And **Emaj7/Ab** — E is in scale, G# = A? No — **G# is not in scale** — scale has **Gb (A)** → so **G# is foreign**.

BUT: **G# = Ab** enharmonically? Only if you consider **Ab = G#** — **yes**, enharmonically!

Ah! Here’s the breakthrough.

We assumed **Fb = E**, **Ab = G#**, etc.

In the **Bb half-whole diminished scale**:

- Notes: **Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A**

But **E** and **Gb** are **enharmonic** to **Fb** and **F#** — wait.

Actually:  
- **Fb = E**  
- **Ab = G#**

So if we rewrite the scale using **spelled pitches** (with sharps instead of flats where needed for chords), the scale becomes:

**Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A**

But for **Dbm/Ab = Db–Fb–Ab** → then **Fb = E**, **Ab = G#**

So if we **reinterpret Dbm/Ab** as **Dbsus2?** No — Db–Fb–Ab is clearly Db minor.

If we treat **Ab = G#**, then this chord is **Db–E–G#** → which is **Db augmented?** Db–E–G# = Db–E–G# — E is #3, G# = #5 → **Db+** — augmented!

But the chord is written as **Dbm/Ab**, so we assume it’s **Db minor** with **Ab** bass — so it’s **Db–Fb–Ab**, **not** Db augmented.

So to make **Db–Fb–Ab** fit in scale, we need **Ab** in the scale — but **Bb half-whole diminished** only has **A**, not **Ab**.

So perhaps it’s **Bb whole-half diminished scale**?

Bb Whole-Half Dim:  
**Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb**? No — that’s not correct.

Standard **whole-half diminished** on Bb:

Bb (whole) – C (half) – Db (whole) – Eb (half) – E (whole) – Gb (half) – G (whole) – A (half)

Same as **half-whole**!

So no — the scale is **half-whole** or **whole-half** — on Bb it's the **same set of notes**, just starting point changes.

So it’s the **octatonic scale**: Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A → **8 notes**.

**Ab is not in it** — so **Dbm/Ab = Db–Fb–Ab** has **Ab**, which is **outside**.

Therefore, the **Ab** is a chromatic passing tone or modal mixture.

---

### Final Synthesis

Let’s step back.

- **Bbdim** appears 8 times → **strong tonal center**
- **Gb/Bb** appears 4 times → **#IV chord** — very characteristic of **Locrian mode**
- **Dbm/Ab** = bVI chord in Bb minor → common in minor keys
- **B/Bb** = chromatic passing chord — B is #7 (but in Bb, #7 is A#), so this is **raised 7th** → B is **not A#**, B is **natural 7th of G major** — very out-of-key
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th over Ab — likely **borrowed** or **modal mixture** — E major = #5 of Bb? E = #5 = G# — not directly

**BUT**: Consider **Bb minor** as key — with **Ab harmonic minor** flavor?

Let’s try **Bb melodic minor ascending**:  
Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A — tonic chord **Bb minor** → but we have **Bbdim**, not Bb min.

Wait — **Bbdim** is NOT the tonic of Bb melodic minor.

Unless we are treating this as a **tonal center of Bb**, but with **diminished tonic chord** — which is **exceedingly rare** outside of **modal, jazz, or film music**.

### ✅ Most Plausible Conclusion:

This is **in Bb Locrian mode**, with **extensive chromatic embellishments** borrowed from other scales (whole-tone, harmonic minor, chromatic passing tones).

- **Bbdim** = tonic chord  
- **Gb/Bb** = #IV → core Locrian sound  
- **Dbm/Ab** = bVI → fits Bb minor/ Locrian  
- **B/Bb** = chromatic #7 substitute over tonic (unusual but expressive)  
- **Emaj7/Ab** = distant chromatic color chord — likely functions as a **passing or “color” chord** before resolving to Bbdim

The **mode is Bb Locrian**.  
The **key is Bb**, with a **diminished tonic** — meaning this is **not tonal in the classical sense** — it’s **modal**.

### 🎯 Final Answer:

> **Key: Bb**  
> **Mode: Locrian**  
> **Context**: Modal, highly chromatic, common in jazz, film score, or modern pop with ambiguous tonality. The Bbdim triad serves as the tonic, and the Gb major triad (#IV) is a defining harmonic feature of Locrian mode. The B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab chords are chromatic passing/color tones enhancing the dark, unresolved quality.

---

### Bonus: Why Locrian?

- It is the **only mode** with a **diminished tonic triad**.
- The **#4 (Gb)** chord (Gb major) is the hallmark of **modern Locrian usage** (e.g., in metal, jazz, or film music as a "dark" sound).
- The progression **does not resolve to a minor tonic** (Bb minor), meaning it’s not Aeolian — the diminished triad **forces** Locrian identification.

✅ **Confirmed: Key = Bb, Mode = Locrian**
