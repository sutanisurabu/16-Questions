### Reasoning

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the key and mode of this chord progression: Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim. Hmm, this looks complicated with all the diminished chords and slash chords. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that diminished chords are usually built on the seventh degree of the major scale or as part of a diminished seventh. But Bbdim is a B flat diminished chord. Let me write out the notes in Bbdim. A diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Bb, Db, Fb (which is E). Wait, but sometimes diminished chords are written with a half-diminished symbol (ø), but here it's just "dim", so it's fully diminished. So Bbdim would be Bb, Db, Fb (E), and if it's a seventh chord, it would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb (which is G). But maybe the user just wrote "Bbdim" for the triad. Similarly, Dbm/Ab – Db minor with Ab in the bass. B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass? Wait, that seems odd. Wait, slash chords: the note before the slash is the chord, the note after is the bass note. So Gb/Bb means Gb chord with Bb in the bass. Similarly, Dbm/Ab is Db minor chord with Ab in the bass. B/Bb is B major chord with Bb in the bass? Wait, B/Bb would be a B chord with Bb as the bass note. But that would mean the chord is B major but the bass is Bb, so the notes would be B, D#, F# with Bb in the bass? That seems to create a B7 chord maybe? Wait, B major is B D# F#, so B/Bb bass would be Bb, B, D#, F#? But that's a bit unusual. Maybe it's a typo? Or maybe it's supposed to be Bb/B? No, the slash chord notation is chord/bass note. So B/Bb is a B chord in root position but with the bass being Bb. So the bass note is Bb, and the chord is B major. So the notes would be Bb (bass), then B, D#, F# above. That's a bit strange. But maybe it's a specific inversion where the bass is Bb, but the chord is B major. So that would be a B major triad with Bb in the bass, which would make it B/Bb = B major with bass note Bb. Hmm, okay.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab is E major 7th chord with Ab in the bass. Let's parse all these.

Let me list out each chord:

1. Bbdim
2. Bbdim
3. Gb/Bb
4. Gb/Bb
5. Bbdim
6. Bbdim
7. Dbm/Ab
8. B/Bb
9. Bbdim
10. Bbdim
11. Gb/Bb
12. Gb/Bb
13. Bbdim
14. Bbdim
15. Emaj7/Ab
16. Bbdim

So let's start analyzing. Let's see what key this might be in.

First, Bbdim is Bb diminished. The notes of Bbdim triad are Bb, Db, Fb (E). But if it's a diminished seventh chord, it would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb (G). But maybe the user is using just the triad.

Gb/Bb: So the chord is Gb major (or maybe Gb minor? But usually if it's just the root, it's major unless specified. But in slash chords, the chord symbol before the slash is the chord quality, so Gb/Bb means Gb major chord with Bb bass. So the Gb chord would have notes Gb, Bb, Db. Then the bass is Bb, so the chord is Gb with Bb in the bass. So the notes would be Bb (bass), Gb, Bb, Db? Wait, but Gb is the root, so the Gb chord is Gb, Bb, Db. So with Bb in the bass, it's still the same notes: Bb as bass, then Gb, Bb, Db above. So it's a Gb triad in first inversion? Wait, Gb first inversion would be Bb as the bass note. Yes, because the root is Gb, so first inversion would have Bb as bass, second inversion Db. So Gb/Bb is Gb chord in first inversion.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. So the Db minor triad is Db, Fb (E), Ab. So with Ab in the bass, that would be Ab as the bass note, so Db minor chord in second inversion: Ab, Db, Fb (E).

B/Bb: B major chord with Bb bass. So chord notes of B major: B, D#, F#. Then bass is Bb. So Bb, B, D#, F#. So that's B major in some inversion with Bb bass. But B major triad's notes don't include Bb. So this would create a dissonant chord perhaps. But maybe it's a Gb chord with a different name? Wait, if you have Bb in the bass, and B, D#, F#, then it's Bb, B, D#, F# – which could be thought of as a B Major 7th with a flat 9 or something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's written wrong? Maybe Bb/B? Which would be Bb major with B in the bass. But the user wrote B/Bb.

Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th chord with Ab bass. E major 7th is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab in bass. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#? That seems odd. The notes might be Ab, E, G#, B, D#, which would be a bit messy, but maybe Ab is the bass note, and the chord above is E major 7th.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe looking at all the chord names, let's see possible key centers.

Looking at all the chords: Bbdim, Gb, Dbm, B, Emaj7. Let's see.

Bbdim is a common chord in Bb minor? Wait, but diminished chords often function as vii° in a major key or the vii° in a minor key. Let's check.

Alternatively, let's consider the chords present. Let's list the chord roots:

Bb (dim), Gb, Db, B, E. Wait, B major, E major 7th. Also Db minor.

Wait, Dbm is Db minor. So Dbm. Let's see.

Looking at chord roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E. Wait, but the keys here...

Wait, Bb dim is usually part of the Bb harmonic minor or natural minor? But let's see.

Another approach: Let's think about the chord names as written. Let's take the slash chords and see what's happening.

Gb/Bb: Gb major with Bb bass. So as mentioned, Gb major triad is Gb-Bb-Db. Bass note Bb, so inversion.

Dbm/Ab: Db minor triad (Db-Fb-Ab), bass Ab. So Ab-Db-Fb (E).

B/Bb: B major triad (B-D#-F#) with Bb bass. So the bass note is Bb, which is not part of B major, so this might be a non-diatonic chord, or perhaps it's an E7 chord or something else? Wait, maybe a different interpretation.

Wait, if the chord is B/Bb, maybe it's actually a Bb something chord. But usually slash chords are chord/bass, so B/Bb is chord B with bass Bb. But B major and Bb bass would have notes Bb in the bass then B, D#, F# above. That seems conflicting. Maybe there's a typo? Like Bb/B, which would be Bb major with B in the bass. But that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the "B" in B/Bb is a typo and should be Bb/B. But not sure.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th chord (E, G#, B, D#) with Ab bass. So Ab as bass. So that would create notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Which is a bit dissonant. Maybe the chord is functioning as a different chord? Alternatively, maybe it's Ab major? No, it's written as Emaj7/Ab.

Alternatively, perhaps the slash chords are indicating the bass note of the chord, so in any case, we have to see what notes the chord contains.

Alternatively, maybe some of these chords are actually part of a larger key. Let's try to see if chords like Gb, Db, Bb might point to a key.

Wait, Gb is the same as F#, Db same as C#, but maybe in a flat key. Let's see.

Bb major key has Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A. But Bbdim is the vii° chord in C minor, or the vii° in Bb major? Wait, in Bb major, the seventh degree is A, so A diminished chord. So no. Wait, in major keys, the vii° chord is on the leading tone. So in Bb major, the leading tone is A, so A dim. So Bbdim would not be a natural chord in Bb major. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Eb major? In Eb major, the chords are Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim. D diminished? So Ddim would be Di, but Bbdim would be... Let's check. Eb major: chord on Bb would be Bb major. So no. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's check Bbdim as a diminished chord. Diminished chords often function as passing chords or part of a diminished seventh chord progression.

Alternatively, let's consider the possibility of the key being Db major. Let's check Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. In Db major, the vii° chord would be Cdim, so not Bbdim. Bbdim is a chord on Bb, so in Db major, the chords: Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Ab, Bbm, Cdim. So Bb would be the sixth degree, Bbm. So Bbdim isn't in Db major.

Hmm. Maybe the key is Bb minor? Let's check Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. The chords would be Bbm, Cdim, Dbsus2, Ebm, Fm, Gbaug, Ab. Wait, natural minor: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, vii°? Wait, maybe different. Let's get precise.

Bb natural minor (Aeolian):

Notes: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

Chords built on each degree:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db (major?)

Wait, no. Wait, in natural minor, the chords are:

i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, vii°.

So for Bb minor:

Bbm (i), Cdim (ii°), Db (III), Ebm (iv), Fm (v), Gb (VI?), Ab (vii°). Wait, no. Wait, chords built on each note:

Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb

So triads:

Bb - Db - F = Bbm

C - Eb - Gb = Cdim

Db - F - Ab = Db major

Eb - Gb - Bb = Ebm

F - Ab - C = Fm

Gb - Bb - Db = Gb major

Ab - C - Eb = Ab major

Wait, but in Bb minor natural, the chords would be:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

vii°: Ab minor?

Wait, actually, the seventh chord would be Ab, C, Eb. Which is Ab major? No, Ab, C, Eb is Ab major? Wait, Ab (root), C (major third), Eb (perfect fifth). So yes, Ab major. But in minor key, the vii° chord should be diminished. Wait, no: the seventh degree of Bb minor is Ab. So chord on Ab would be Ab, C, Eb. Which is Ab major. But for natural minor, the vii° chord would be a diminished chord. Wait, no. Wait, let's see:

Wait, natural minor is the same as the relative major's Aeolian mode. So Bb minor is relative to Db major. Let's check Db major chords.

Db major: notes Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords:

I: Db

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

Ah, right. So Bb minor is the relative minor of Db major. So chords in Db major:

I: Db major

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

So in that case, the natural minor of Bb would have chords as per Db major.

But in any case, looking at the chord progression given: Bbdim, which is not the same as Cdim. Bbdim would be a diminished chord on Bb. In Db major scale, there is a Cdim chord, but BBDIM would be Bb, Db, Fb (E). Let's see: Bb, Db, Fb – which would be a diminished triad. But in Db major scale, is there a Bbdim? Db scale has notes Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So the Bb note is the sixth degree. So chord built on Bb in Db major would be Bb, D, F? Wait, no: Db major scale notes:

1. Db

2. Eb

3. F

4. Gb

5. Ab

6. Bb

7. C

So chord on Bb (6th degree): notes Bb, Db, F. Which is Bb minor? Bb, Db, F – yes, Bbm. So not diminished. So Bbdim isn't in Db major.

Hmm, getting stuck. Maybe think of this as possible key with flat 2 or something. Alternatively, maybe the key is Gb major, but that's unlikely. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's think about the chord B/Bb. If B major with Bb bass. Let's think of the function. If we have B and Bb together, that creates a minor second interval. So that chord B/Bb would have B and Bb, which is very dissonant. Maybe it's actually a Bb major chord with a B in the bass? But that's written as Bb/B. But user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be Bb/B.

Alternatively, maybe in the context of the song, B/Bb is meant to be Bb major in second inversion? Not sure. Let's see. Let's assume for a moment that B/Bb is actually Bb/B, which would be Bb major chord with B in bass. But that's not standard. Usually, slash chords denote the bass note. But perhaps there's confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe all these chords are in a key that has a Bb, Db, F, etc.

Wait, another approach: let's look at all the unique chord roots and the notes in the chords.

Let's list each chord's notes:

1. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb (E)

Assuming it's a triad, diminished.

2. Bbdim: same

3. Gb/Bb: chord is Gb major (Gb, Bb, Db), bass Bb. So notes: Bb (bass), Gb, Bb, Db

4. Gb/Bb: same

5. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb

6. Bbdim: same

7. Dbm/Ab: Db minor (Db, Fb, Ab), bass Ab. So Ab, Db, Fb

8. B/Bb: B major chord (B, D#, F#), bass Bb. So Bb, B, D#, F#

9. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb

10. Bbdim: same

11. Gb/Bb: same as 3 and 4

12. Gb/Bb: same

13. Bbdim: same

14. Bbdim: same

15. Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 (E, G#, B, D#), bass Ab. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#

16. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb

So now, looking at all these notes. Let's list all unique notes:

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E (since Fb is E)

From Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db

Dbm/Ab: Db, Eb (Fb), Ab

B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D#, Ab

Wait, let's collect all the notes present:

Bb, Db, E (Fb), Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#, and F#? Wait:

From B/Bb: B, D#, F#, and Bb bass.

From Emaj7: E, G#, B, D#

So notes present:

Bb, Db, E, Gb, Db, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#, Ab. Wait:

Let's list all unique pitches:

Bb, Db, E (which is same as Fb), Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#.

So:

Bb, B, Db, D#, E (Fb), F#, Gb, G#, Ab.

Hmm. This is a lot of chromatic notes. But maybe this is a key with several accidentals.

Wait, but this seems too chromatic for a standard key. Unless it's a modal mixture or something.

Alternatively, maybe the chords are functioning in a specific key despite the chromaticism.

Alternatively, think of Gb/Bb. If Gb is the same as F#, but usually in flat keys.

Wait, another idea: sometimes in jazz or some contexts, a Bbdim chord is part of the leading tone diminished chord in the key of C. Let's see. For example, in C major, the vii° is Bdim, which is B, D, F. But here it's Bbdim. If someone is in a key that's using Bb as the leading tone.

Wait, if we consider the key of C minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. The vii° chord would be Bdim, which is B, D, F. But we have Bbdim. Hmm.

Wait, in Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. Then Bbdim would be Bb, Db, Fb. But in Db major, the chord on Bb is Bb minor (Bb, Db, F), but here it's diminished (Bb, Db, Fb). So Fb instead of F natural? In Db major, F is natural, so Fb would be E natural. So maybe not.

Alternatively, if the key is C# minor. But this is getting complicated.

Another approach: look at the chord B/Bb. If it's a B major chord with Bb bass, that chord would have B and Bb together, which is a minor second. That's very dissonant. Maybe it's a typo for Bb/B, which would be Bb major in first inversion (Bb/D/F in bass? No: Bb/B would be Bb major chord with B in the bass. So notes B, Bb, D, F. Which is a bit messy but possible. B and Bb together again.

Alternatively, maybe the slash chords are indicating the bass note, but the chord quality is different. Like Dbm/Ab – Db minor with Ab in bass. But Dbm chord is Db, Fb, Ab. So Ab in bass is just second inversion: Ab, Db, Fb.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7 chord, Ab bass. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#. So the notes here would be Ab, B, D#, E, G#. So that's a chord that includes Ab, B (which is Cb?), no. Wait, Ab to B is a minor third, but Ab to B is enharmonically G#. Wait, no. Ab to B: Ab, A, Bb, B – so actually Ab to B is a major third. Wait, Ab, Bb, B. So Ab to B is three half steps? No: Ab to A is one, A to Bb is two, Bb to B is three? Wait, no. Wait, Ab to A is one semitone, A to Bb is another, but actually Ab, A, Bb, B. So intervals: Ab to B is three semitones (Ab->A: 1, A->Bb: 2, Bb->B: 3), so minor third. Hmm, maybe. Not sure.

Wait, let's think of the chord Emaj7/Ab. E major 7th is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab in bass. So the bass note is Ab, then above it: E, G#, B, D#. So the notes present are Ab, E, G#, B, D#. What key is that? Not obvious.

Alternatively, maybe all these chords are related to the key of C minor? Let's see. C minor has chords like Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb. Not sure.

Wait, another idea. The presence of Bbdim and Gb might indicate the key of F minor? Wait, F minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. Not sure.

Alternatively, think of the chord Gb/Bb. If the chord is Gb major, with Bb in the bass. So in the key of Db major, Gb is the IV chord. Db major – V is Ab, IV is Gb. So Gb chord. So if there's a lot of Gb chords with Bb bass (first inversion), then maybe in Db major. Let's check Db major.

Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords as per:

I: Db

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

So chords present in Db major: Gb is the IV chord. So Gb triad is Gb, Bb, Db. Which matches Gb/Bb chord (as first inversion). Dbm would be the iii chord? Wait no. Db major iii is Fm. Hmm. Wait, Db major scale notes: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

So chord on Db: Db major.

Chord on Eb: Eb minor.

Chord on F: F minor.

Chord on Gb: Gb major (IV).

Chord on Ab: Ab major (V).

Chord on Bb: Bb minor (vi).

Chord on C: C diminished (vii°).

So if we have Dbm chord, that would be Db minor. But in Db major, the i chord is Db major. So Db minor would be outside the key. Unless it's a modal interchange.

But our chord progression has Dbm/Ab. So Db minor chord with Ab bass. In Db major, Db minor isn't a chord. So perhaps the key isn't Db major.

Alternatively, if we're in Bb minor. Let's check.

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

vii°: Abdim? Wait, no. Chord on Ab: Ab, C, Eb. Which is Ab major. But in natural minor, the VII chord is major. Wait, in minor keys, the VII chord is usually major. Yes.

Wait:

Natural minor scale:

Tonic: Bbm

Supertonic: Cdim

Mediant: Db

Subdominant: Ebm

Dominant: Fm

Submediant: Gb

Subtonic: Ab

Wait, Ab is major. So Bb natural minor chords: Bbm, Cdim, Db major, Ebm, Fm, Gb major, Ab major.

So in this case, if we have Dbm chord listed. But in Bb minor, the mediant chord is Db major, not minor. So Dbm would be outside the scale. Similarly, the chord Bbdim – in Bb minor scale, the ii° chord is Cdim. So there's no Bbdim chord. Hmm.

Another idea: maybe it's Gb major? Let's check Gb major:

Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Wait, notes: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F.

Chords:

I: Gb

ii: Abm

iii: Bbm

IV: Cb (B)

V: Db

vi: Ebm

vii°: Fdim

So chords here: Gb major, Abm etc. So Db is the V chord. If our progression has Db chord... Well, we have Dbm/Ab, which is Db minor. But in Gb major, Db is a major chord (V), so Dbm would not be part of that key.

Hmm. Maybe the key is C minor? C minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

vii°: Bbdim!

Ah! Wait, in C minor, the vii° chord is Bb diminished. Yes. Because the leading tone in C minor is Bb (natural minor), but harmonic minor would raise the 7th to B natural. Wait, in natural minor, seventh degree is Bb, so the vii° chord would be Bb, Db, Fb (E). Which is Bbdim. Yes! So in C natural minor, the vii° chord is Bb diminished.

C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chord built on Bb: Bb (root), Db (minor third), Fb (diminished fifth, which is E natural). So yes, Bbdim chord.

So the vii° in C minor natural is Bbdim.

In harmonic minor, the vii° would be different because the 7th is raised. But in natural minor, it's Bbdim.

So if the key is C minor, let's see.

Now, let's see the other chords in the progression.

In C natural minor, chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

vii°: Bbdim

So if the key is C minor, Bbdim is present. Now looking at the other chords in the progression:

Gb/Bb – Gb major chord. In C minor, what is Gb? The scale of C minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Gb would be the note Gb, which is not in C minor. Unless we're considering something else. Wait, Gb is enharmonic to F#. Not sure.

Wait, in C minor natural, the chords would be built on the scale. But Gb isn't in the scale. So maybe this is a different key.

Wait, but another thought: in C minor harmonic minor, the 7th degree is raised to B natural, but that would make the chord on B to be Bdim or Bmaj7? Not sure. But maybe this progression is in C minor, and using chords from harmonic minor or melodic minor.

But let's see: Gb chord. In C harmonic minor, the notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So Gb isn't there. Hmm.

Wait, Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord. In C minor, Db is not part of the scale. The scale has C, D, Eb, etc. So Db is not a note in C minor. So Db minor chord would be Db – Fb – Ab. Which contains Db, which is not in C minor scale. So that is a chromatic chord.

Hmm. So maybe this chord progression isn't in a simple key. Alternatively, considering all the chords, perhaps the center is Gb.

Wait, the presence of Dbm and Gb. If we have Db minor and Gb major. Let's think. If Db minor is i, then Gb major would be... in Db minor key? Let's check Db minor.

Db natural minor: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb (A), Cb (B).

Wait, Db minor natural:

Notes: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb (which is A), Cb (B).

Chords:

i: Dbm

ii°: Ebdim

III: F

iv: Gbm

v: Abm

VI: Bbb (A) major?

vii°: Cbdim

Wait, this seems messy. Alternatively, maybe Db harmonic minor? Not sure. This might not be the right path.

Another idea: Let's look at the chord progression and try to find a tonic chord.

Looking at the progression, there are many Bbdim chords, which might suggest that Bb is the tonic, but Bb major or minor? If it's Bb minor, then as before.

Alternatively, when there's a Bbdim chord repeated often, maybe it's the vii° in a major key. For example, in C major, vii° is Bdim; in F major, vii° is E dim. So to have Bb dim as vii°, it would need to be the tonic half step below Bb, so B major? But in B major, vii° would be A# dim. Not matching. Alternatively, in C major, no. Wait, no, in the key of A major, the vii° chord is G# dim. So not.

Wait, for a diminished chord to be vii°, it needs to be half step below the tonic. So if the tonic is C, vii° is Bdim. So if we have Bbdim, which is a diminished chord on Bb, then if it's vii°, the tonic would be B natural. So in B major, the vii° chord is A#dim. Not Bbdim. Because B major has A# as the leading tone. So Bbdim would be the same as A#dim, but usually spelled as A#dim. So maybe this is B major, but the chord is written as Bbdim, which would be enharmonic to A#dim. But usually, people avoid double flats and use sharps. So possible. If the key is B major, but then other chords don't quite fit.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

So Bbdim would be equivalent to A#dim. But usually spelled as A#dim. So if someone is using Bbdim, maybe they're not in B major. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Eb major. Let's check. Eb major: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

Chords:

I: Eb

ii: Fm

iii: Gm

IV: Ab

V: Bb

vi: Cm

vii°: Ddim

So vii° here is Ddim. Not Bbdim. Bb is the V chord.

Hmm.

Wait, here's another thought: sometimes when you see a lot of diminished chords with slash chords, it might be a case of an augmented sixth chord or something, but that might be too advanced.

Alternatively, let's look for common roots or something. The chord progression has a lot of Bbdim, some Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Emaj7/Ab.

Wait, B/Bb – if B is chord, Bb is bass. That could be a Bb7 chord? Because Bb7 is Bb, D, F, Ab. But B chord is B, D#, F#. So B/Bb would be Bb, B, D#, F#, which includes B and Bb together. Bb7 includes Ab, which isn't in B/Bb.

Alternatively, maybe the chord is written incorrectly and meant to be Bb/B or something else.

Alternatively, Emaj7/Ab – Ab bass. Emaj7 has notes E, G#, B, D#. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Could this be an Ab augmented chord or something? Ab, B, D#, E. Let's see: Ab to E is a minor sixth. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: let's see if any of these chords function in a particular key.

For example, Gb/Bb. Gb major with Bb bass. So as Gb major first inversion. So Gb is the root. If we are in the key of Bb minor, Gb would be the VI chord (natural minor has Gb major as the VI chord). Wait, C minor has VI as Ab major. Wait, let's go back to C natural minor.

C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

vii°: Bbdim

Ah, yes. So VI is Ab major. So if the key is C minor, Ab major is the VI chord. Now, if we see Dbm/Ab. Db minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm chord is Db, Fb, Ab. So with Ab bass, it's Ab, Db, Fb. But Fb is E natural. So Dbm is Db, Eb, Ab? No, Db minor is Db, Fb, Ab. Fb is E natural. So Db minor chord: Db, E, Ab. Then Ab bass: Ab, Db, E. So what key?

But if we're in C minor, Db minor chord would not be diatonic. The scale has D as natural, so Db would be a chromatic note.

Wait, but wait: in C harmonic minor, the scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So Db is not present. Still not.

Wait, maybe this is related to Eb minor? Not sure.

Another idea: Let's see the chords Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab. If Gb is IV of Db major, Dbm is i of Db minor. Maybe modulating between Db major and minor? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the chord names in terms of common tones. For example, Bbdim shares some notes with Gb major. Bbdim is Bb, Db, Fb; Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So they share Bb and Db. So maybe moving between chords that share tones.

But this might not help. Maybe looking at chord roots progression.

Let's see the chord roots (ignoring slashes for now):

Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, Db, B, Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, E, Bb.

So the roots: Bb (many times), Gb, Db, B, E.

Looking at those roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E. Hmm. The circle of fifths? Bb is a fifth from F, but this progression seems to descend chromatically?

Bb -> Gb -> Db -> B? Wait, Bb to Gb is descending minor third? Bb to Gb is three half steps down? Wait, Bb down to Gb is Bb, B, A, Ab, G, Gb – so seven half steps down? No. Bb to Gb: Bb to A is one, A to Ab is two, Ab to G is three... No. Bb to Gb is actually six half steps: Bb -> A (1), A -> Ab (2), Ab -> G (3), G -> Gb (4), but wait, actually Bb to Gb: Bb, A, Ab, G, Gb? No, better to count in semitones.

From Bb to Gb: Bb = A#, but better to list:

Bb to A: 1 semitone

A to Ab: 2

Ab to G: 3

G to Gb: 4 semitones away? Wait, no. Wait, the distance from Bb to Gb is Bb -> B -> Cb? No. Wait, Bb to A is one down, A to Ab is another. So Bb down to Gb is seven semitones (Bb to A:1, A to Ab:2, Ab to G:3, G to F#:4? No, this is messy.

Actually, the interval from Bb to Gb: Bb, A, Ab, G, F#, F, E, Eb, D#, D, C#, C, B#, but maybe better:

Bb is Bb. Gb is six semitones below Bb? Or let's calculate:

From Bb moving downward: Bb to A (1), A to Ab (2), Ab to G (3), G to Gb (4). Wait, yes: Bb to Gb is 4 semitones down. No: Bb to A is one semitone down, A to Ab is another (total 2), Ab to G is 3rd, G to Gb is fourth. But actually, Bb down to Gb is four semitones. Wait, no: the interval between Bb and Gb is a diminished fifth or something? Let's count semitones from Bb to Gb:

Bb -> A (1), A -> Ab (2), Ab -> G (3), G -> Gb (4). So yes, four semitones down.

But maybe not important. Alternatively, the roots in the chord progression are Bb, Gb, Db, B, E.

That's Bb, Gb, Db. So descending by minor third each time? Bb to Gb is minor third down (Bb to Ab is minor second, then to G is major second? Wait, Bb to Gb: Bb, A, Ab, G, Gb – no, better to think in pitch classes.

Bb (11), Gb (7), Db (2), B (11? Wait, no. Pitch classes:

C=0, C#=1, D=2, etc. up to B=11.

So Bb = 10.

Gb = 6.

Db = 1.

B = 11.

E = 4.

So sequence: 10, 10, 6, 6, 10, 10, 1, 11, 10, 10, 6, 6, 10, 10, 4, 10.

Not sure. But Bb, Gb, Db form a pattern descending by diminished thirds? Bb to Gb is three semitones? No:

Bb to A: 1 semitone down

A to Ab: 2

Ab to G: 3

G to Gb: 4 semitones from Bb to Gb? No, Bb to Gb: let's count up.

Bb -> A: 1 down

A -> Ab: 2 down

Ab -> G: 3 down

G -> Gb: 4 down? No, actually from Bb to Gb is Bb -> A (step down), A -> G (another), G -> F# (third), F# -> F (fourth?), no. Let's count chromatically:

The number of semitones between Bb and Gb:

Bb is 10.

Gb is 6.

So 10 to 6 is a difference of -4 semitones (or +8).

So interval of 4 semitones down, which is a minor third.

Wait, 10 to 6: 10-6=4 semitones difference. So minor third up from Gb to Bb? Yes.

But in terms of roots descending: Bb to Gb is a minor third down.

Gb to Db: Gb is 6, Db is 1. 6-1=5 semitones down? Or Db is 1, Gb is 6: 6-1=5, so a perfect fourth up? But if descending from Db to Gb, it would be five semitones down.

This might not be helpful.

Another idea: The presence of Dbm/Ab. Dbm chord with Ab bass. Db minor triad is Db, Fb, Ab. So bass Ab. So it's Db minor in second inversion. Now, if I think of Ab as the bass, maybe the key center is Ab. Let's check.

If key is Ab major: notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So chords in Ab major:

I: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gdim

Now, Db is IV chord (Db major). So Dbm (Db minor) would not be in the scale. Similarly, Bbdim chord would be in Ab major? Seventh degree is Gdim. Not Bbdim.

But looking at chord progression: Gb/Bb. Gb in Ab major is V7? No, V is Eb. Gb is the flat VI chord. Because Ab major has Db as IV, so Gb would be a chromatic chord. But maybe if it's in Ab minor.

Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Wait, Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Chords:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: Cb

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb

vii°: Gbdim

Wait, in Ab minor:

i: Abm

ii°: Bb dim

III: Cb major?

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (which is E natural)

vii°: Gbdim

So, if the key were Ab minor, then we would have Dbm as the iv chord. Yes! Because Db minor chord is iv in Ab minor.

And Bbdim would be the ii° chord.

Wait, in Ab minor, scale degrees:

1. Ab

2. Bb

3. Cb

4. Db

5. Eb

6. Fb

7. Gb

So chords:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: Cb major (which is B major? But spelled Cb)

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb major (E)

vii°: Gbdim

Yes. So if this is in Ab minor, then:

- Bbdim is ii° chord.

- Dbm is iv chord.

- Gb chord would be... Gb is the VII degree. In our chord progression, we have Gb/Bb. If the key is Ab minor, then Gb is the VII chord (vii° as well? Wait, scale degree 7 is Gb, so chord on Gb would be Gb, Bb, Db. Which is Gb major? Because Ab minor scale has Gb as the leading tone. Wait, in natural minor, the vii° chord is diminished. Wait:

Chord on VII degree in Ab minor:

Gb (root), Bb (major third), Db (perfect fifth). So Gb major chord.

But in natural minor, the VII chord is major. Yes. The diminished chord is on the second degree.

So in Ab natural minor:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: Cb

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (which is E natural, because Fb = E)

vii: Gb major (not diminished)

Wait, yes. Seventh degree is Gb, chord is Gb-Bb-Db, which is Gb major.

So in this key, we have:

Bbdim (ii°), Dbm (iv), Gb (vii), etc.

Looking at the chord progression:

Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

So in Ab minor:

- The ii° is Bbdim. Check.

- The iv chord is Dbm. Yes.

- The vii chord is Gb major. Yes.

So Gb/Bb would be Gb major chord with Bb in bass. Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So Bb in bass makes it first inversion. So that works.

Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab. So with Ab bass, second inversion: Ab, Db, Fb.

But in Ab minor key, the iv chord is Dbm. So this chord makes sense as the iv chord with Ab bass (second inversion).

Now, what about the other chords like B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab?

B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. In Ab minor, what is the chord B? In Ab minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Does B exist in this scale? No. B would be Cb (since in Ab minor, the note B is spelled as Cb because scale degrees:

1. Ab

2. Bb

3. Cb

4. Db

5. Eb

6. Fb

7. Gb

So B is not present. The chord B/Bb would be a chromatic chord here. Alternatively, if it's a Bb something, but written as B/Bb.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab. In Ab minor, E is not in the scale. So these two chords seem chromatic. However, maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, but if key is Ab minor, then Fb is E natural (since Fb = E). So chord VI is Fb major, which is E major. Ah! In Ab minor natural minor, the major chord on VI is Fb major, which is E maj. So E major chord. That's interesting.

So Emaj7 – if it's Emaj7, then that's the VI chord in Ab minor. Yes! Because VI chord in Ab minor is Fb major, which is same as E major. So Emaj is the VI major chord.

Similarly, Emaj7 would be Emaj7 – which is a major seventh chord on the VI degree. So that would make sense.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab is iv chord (Db minor) with Ab bass.

Now, looking at B/Bb: B in the chord, Bb bass. If our key is Ab minor, then B would be... Enharmonically, B is Cb. But the chord B major? Wait, in Ab minor, the note B is spelled as Cb. Wait, no: scale degree 3 is Cb. So Cb is the same as B natural. Yes! Cb is an enharmonic equivalent to B. So if someone writes a B major chord, that's equivalent to Cb major chord. But in the key of Ab minor, the III chord is Cb major. Because iii in Ab minor would be Cb major.

Yes! In natural minor scale:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: Cb major

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (E) major

vii: Gb major

So the chord on III degree is Cb major, which is same as B major.

So B major chord here is actually the III chord in Ab minor. So B/Bb would be B major chord with Bb in bass. But B is Cb, so Cb major chord. Notes of Cb major: Cb, Eb, Gb.

Wait, no. Cb major: Cb, Eb, Gb.

But B major is B, D#, F#. Which is different.

Wait, confusion here. If the scale is Ab minor (natural):

Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

So scale degree III is Cb.

So the iii chord is Cb major: Cb, Eb, Gb.

But Cb is enharmonic to B. So Cb major is enharmonic to B major? No:

Cb major = Cb - Eb - Gb

B major = B - D# - F#

They are enharmonic equivalent? Not exactly. Cb is B, Eb is D#, Gb is F#. So yes! Cb major = B major. Because Cb = B, Eb = D#, Gb = F#. So yes, they are the same notes. But usually, we write it as B major, not Cb major.

But in the key of Ab minor, the iii chord is spelled as Cb major. However, in practice, it would be referred to as B major.

So if someone in Ab minor has a iii chord, they'd call it Cb major but it's actually B major. Which makes sense.

So in this case, B/Bb: B major chord with Bb bass.

But B major is the iii chord of Ab minor.

Now, B/Bb bass note. So the chord is B major triad (B, D#, F#), bass note Bb.

So the notes would be Bb, B, D#, F#.

What function does this serve in Ab minor?

Maybe it's functioning as some borrowed chord or a chromatic passing chord.

Alternatively, in Ab minor, the VII chord is Gb major. And if we have a B major chord, which is iii.

But how about the bass note Bb? If the bass is Bb, which is the second scale degree of Ab minor.

So perhaps this chord B/Bb is a first inversion of B major, but the bass is Bb. Wait, no: chord is B major with Bb bass, so not the standard inversion. It's a bit odd.

But let's see:

If we have B major chord with Bb in bass, that would create a minor second between Bb and B. Which is quite dissonant. But maybe in a jazz context, it's used for tension.

However, considering the key of Ab minor fits several chords in the progression:

- Bbdim is ii° chord.

- Dbm is iv chord.

- Gb is VII chord (Gb major).

- Emaj7 would be VI chord (Fb major = E major).

Yes! So Ab minor has vi chord as Fb major (E major), so Emaj7 would be a VI chord with a major seventh? Or maybe just Emaj7 as the VI chord.

Wait, in Ab minor, the VI chord is Fb major. If we have Emaj7, which is E, G#, B, D#. But Fb major chord is Fb, Ab, Cb. Which is the same as E, G#, B. So yes, Fb = E, Ab = Ab, Cb = B. So Emaj7 would be E major with added seventh: D# would be the same as Eb, but wait, no. E major 7th chord is E, G#, B, D#. But the VI chord of Ab minor is E major triad. Adding a major 7th would be D#, but in Ab minor scale, the note D# isn't present. However, in harmonic minor or melodic minor, there might be.

Wait, maybe this progression is in Ab minor natural minor, and the Emaj7/Ab is actually the VI chord (E major) with Ab as bass. E major triad: E, G#, B. With Ab bass: Ab, E, G#, B. Which is a bit of a stretch. So Ab as bass, then E major triad. Which could function as a VI chord in Ab minor, with the bass note Ab. Wait, but Ab is the tonic note. If it's Emaj7/Ab, the bass is Ab, which is tonic. So maybe it's a tonic chord with some extension.

Wait, in Ab minor, tonic chord is Abm. But if we have Emaj7 with Ab bass, that doesn't seem to fit the tonic. Alternatively, if it's E major with Ab bass, notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. This seems unrelated. But perhaps there's another way.

Wait, but if the key is Gb major, let's see again. Gb major has chords as before. But earlier calculations didn't fit. Maybe not.

Another approach: Ab minor has tonic Ab. What's the function of the Emaj7? If it's VI, then yes. So Ab minor, VI is E major. So Emaj7 would be a VI chord. In jazz, VI chords often have major sevenths. So Emaj7 is VI.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. Db is iv chord in Ab minor. With bass Ab, so it's a second inversion iv chord.

Gb/Bb: Gb major chord (vii), with Bb bass – first inversion.

Bbdim: ii° chord.

Now the B/Bb chord: B major with Bb bass. If B major is the iii chord in Ab minor, as we established. Then bass is Bb, which is the second scale degree. So perhaps it's a chromatic mediante or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to lead to the IV or something.

But let's recap. If we take the key as Ab minor:

- Bbdim (ii°)

- Gb/Bb (vii chord, first inversion)

- Dbm/Ab (iv chord second inversion)

- Emaj7/Ab (VI chord with Ab bass? Not sure)

- B/Bb: iii chord with Bb bass

This seems plausible. Now, what about Emaj7/Ab: if Ab is the bass note, and the chord is Emaj7. So the notes are Ab, E, G#, B, D#. In Ab minor, Ab is tonic. The notes E, G# would be the same as Fb and Ab? Not really. Wait, Emaj7 in root position is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, the notes are Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Is there a scale that includes these notes?

Ab minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. So Ab, Bb, B (Cb), Db, Eb, E (Fb), Gb. Wait, Fb is E natural.

So in the scale, we have Eb, Fb (E), Gb. So E is present as Fb.

So in the chord Emaj7, the E is natural. So Ab minor scale has E (as Fb). So yes. And G#? G# is Ab. Because G# = Ab. Wait, no. In Ab minor, Ab is tonic. G# is the same as Ab. So G# would be Ab. So Emaj7 has G# (which is Ab), B, E, D#.

If we are in Ab minor, D# would be Eb. Because D# = Eb. Yes.

But in the chord Emaj7/Ab: Ab (bass), E, G# (Ab), B, D# (Eb). So the notes would be Ab, E, B, Eb. Wait:

- Ab (bass)

- E

- G# is same as Ab

- B is same as Cb (scale degree 3)

- D# is Eb (scale degree 5)

So essentially, this chord is Ab bass, with notes B, E, Eb.

Which is interesting. Ab, E, Eb, B. That seems like a mess. Maybe the Emaj7/Ab is actually a chord that functions as a dominant or something else.

But perhaps the entire chord progression is in Ab minor, and the Emaj7 and B/Bb chords are chromatic passing chords or borrowed from somewhere.

But assuming key of Ab minor, then:

- Bbdim: ii°

- Gb/Bb: VII chord (first inversion)

- Dbm/Ab: iv chord (second inversion)

- B/Bb: iii chord (B major), but bass Bb (ii note)

- Emaj7/Ab: VI chord (E major), bass Ab (tonic)

But maybe.

But let's check the tonic. If the key is Ab minor, then the tonic chord would be Abm. But it's not present in the progression? Looking at the chords given: no Abm present. However, sometimes a progression might not have the tonic chord, but usually it's implied by the cadence.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Eb minor. Let's see.

But let's think again. If we suppose Ab minor is the key, then the chords fit reasonably well.

Another check: the chord Ab is not present, but if there's a Dbm chord with Ab bass, and Emaj7 with Ab bass, that could make Ab the tonic in some way.

Alternatively, when the bass is Ab in Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab – so Ab bass in multiple places. So Ab is the bass note commonly, which could indicate Ab is tonic.

Yes. Because in Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass, so root Db but bass Ab – but the bass note Ab is frequent. Similarly, Emaj7/Ab has Ab as bass. So the bass note being Ab often suggests Ab might be the tonic.

But if the tonic is Ab minor, then Abm is the tonic chord. However, we don't see Abm in the progression. But maybe it's implied or part of the missing chords.

Alternatively, the progression uses Ab as a pedal tone or something. But in the given sequence, the Emaj7/Ab and Dbm/Ab, so Ab is bass a lot, which could mean Ab is tonic.

Let's see possible cadences. If there's a iv chord (Dbm) moving to VII (Gb), then to I. But we don't have Abm.

Alternatively, in Ab minor, a common cadence would be iv to V to i or something. But with the chords we have: Dbm (iv), Gb (vii), then maybe to Ab. But our progression doesn't have Ab.

But given the chords present, Ab as a bass note repeatedly (in Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab), that makes me think the key center is Ab. So key of Ab minor.

Let's check the mode. If key is Ab minor, that's Aeolian mode on Ab, or just Ab natural minor.

But what about Emaj7 – as VI major in Ab minor. Yes, VI chord in natural minor is major. So VI major is common in minor keys.

Similarly, the iii chord (B major) in Ab minor would be Cb major. Which is fine.

So to recap: the key would be Ab minor (Aeolian mode), with some chromatic chords.

But wait, another thing to consider: when chords are written with slashes, sometimes it's to indicate a specific voicing or bass note. But if the bass note Ab is repeated (in Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab), then it's likely the tonal center.

Also, looking at the B/Bb chord. If we have B major chord with Bb bass, in Ab minor, the B major chord is the iii chord. But the bass being Bb – Bb is the note of the second scale degree. So maybe it's a chord that uses the ii note as bass to create a specific movement.

Another thing: in Ab minor, the chord B/Bb might function as a type of V/V or something. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Gb major. Wait, but earlier checks didn't support. Let's try again.

Gb major: chords I Gb, ii Abm, iii Bbm, IV Cb (B), V Db, vi Ebm, vii° Fdim.

But if the progression includes Emaj7 – E major. Ebm in Gb major. Not sure. Doesn't fit well.

Back to Ab minor.

Yes, seems plausible. Let's outline the chords in Ab minor:

- Bbdim: ii°

- Gb: VII

- Dbm: iv

- Emaj7: VI (but spelled as E)

- B major: iii

So yes. Ab minor has VI chord as E major, which might be written as Emaj7 sometimes.

Now, about the B/Bb chord: as iii chord with bass on Bb, which is ii note. So perhaps it's functioning as a passing chord.

Another idea: In Ab minor, the chord progression could have Ab as tonic, even though it's not explicitly played. The presence of Ab in the bass of Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab might serve as a pedal tone.

Also, the chord Emaj7/Ab – E major with Ab bass. Ab is the tonic, so E major triad over Ab bass. The notes are Ab, E, G#, B. Which is Ab (1), E (b6), G# (which is Ab), and B (b3? Wait, Ab to E is a minor sixth, Ab to G# is a diminished seventh? Not sure.

But maybe in context of the key of Ab minor, this chord functions as a VI chord with tonic in bass. So VI chord (E major) with tonal center Ab.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab is iv chord with tonic bass.

This seems plausible.

So the key is Ab minor (Aeolian mode), because it's minor.

But sometimes people refer to the key as Ab minor or Ab Aeolian. Same thing.

But to confirm, let's check another angle. Diminished chords often function in minor keys. The ii° chord in Ab minor is Bbdim.

Now, how about the chord called Emaj7/Ab. If we take Ab as bass, E major triad: E, G#, B, and then D# for the sevenths. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#. In Ab minor scale, the notes present are Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb.

So Ab is tonic, Fb is E, so E is in the scale (as Fb). G# would be Ab (since G# = Ab), and D# is Eb. So the note D# is actually Eb in the scale. So this chord has notes: Ab (tonic), E (Fb), G# (Ab), B (Cb), D# (Eb). So essentially Ab, Bb (as Cb is B), Eb, Fb (E), and Ab again. Not sure. Maybe it's just a way to get those notes.

Alternatively, maybe the Emaj7 is supposed to be Fb major 7th. But usually, it's written as E7.

Hmm. But assuming that, it could be VI7 chord.

Another check: let's see if there's a dominant chord. In minor keys, V is often major chord. In Ab minor, V chord would be Eb major. But we don't see Eb anywhere except in scale. Unless a chord is missed.

But our progression doesn't have Eb. However, the Emaj7 chords could be related.

Wait, but if the key is Ab minor, then a common cadence would be iv - VII - i or something, but with Emaj7 as VI, maybe.

Alternatively, if we consider the key as Eb minor. Let's see. Not sure.

Another approach: look at all the chord roots and see what key they fit into.

Bbdim, Gb, Dbm, Emaj7 chord, B.

If we take "B" as a chord root, but spelled as B, which could be Cb, etc. But if the key is Ab minor, all these chords fit reasonably.

Another idea: Let's see the intervals. If we have a progression that includes vii° (Bbdim), VII (Gb), iv (Dbm), III (B), VI (Emaj), which all fit Ab minor.

Yes. So Ab minor would contain:

- Ab tonic

- Bb (as ii)

- Cb (iii)

- Db (iv)

- Eb (v)

- Fb (VI)

- Gb (vii)

So yes. And our chords are Bbdim (ii°), Gb (VII), Dbm (iv), B (III), Emaj7 (VI). So all fit.

Additionally, the slash chords: Gb/Bb (VII in first inversion), Dbm/Ab (iv with tonic bass), Emaj7/Ab (VI with tonic bass). Yes! So that makes sense. So Ab is the tonic bass for several of these chords.

So the progression seems to have Ab as tonic, with a lot of chords centered around that. Therefore, the tonic is Ab, minor key.

Thus, the key is Ab minor, which is also called Ab Aeolian.

But wait, "key" usually refers to the scale. So if it's minor, then Ab minor.

But to confirm, the mode would be Aeolian if it's natural minor. However, if there's a raised seventh (as in harmonic minor), it might be different, but given the chords present, it's natural minor.

Now, what about the chord B/Bb. In Ab minor, B major is the iii chord. So when they have B major with Bb bass. But Bb is the supertonic note. Perhaps it's used as part of a chromatic bass line.

But overall, this seems to fit.

So likely the key is Ab minor.

Wait, but Ab minor is spelled Bb minor? No. Ab minor has key signature of 7 flats, but usually written as G# minor. But usually, Ab minor is used over G# minor because flats are easier. But that's a matter of spelling.

But yes, Ab minor key is the same as G# minor, but depending on context.

But the key would be Ab minor.

Alternatively, maybe the key is C minor or something else. But I think Ab minor fits better.

Wait, another check: in the progression, we have Gb/Bb. In Ab minor, Gb is the VII chord. And Gb chord is Gb major. With Bb in bass, which makes Bb the bass note of Gb major chord. Yes, Gb major first inversion.

Yes.

Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm is iv chord, Ab is tonic. So yes.

Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 (which is the VI chord, since VI in Ab minor is Fb major, spelled as E major), with Ab bass. Correct.

B/Bb: B major chord (iii) with Bb bass. Yes, Bb is ii scale degree.

So yes, all of this fits Ab minor.

Therefore, the key is Ab minor, and the mode is Aeolian.

But sometimes a minor key's mode is just called "minor" but specifically Aeolian.

So conclusion: Key of Ab minor (Aeolian mode).

But just to be sure, is there another possibility?

Another check: Emaj7 – which contains D#. In Ab minor scale, Db is the iv note. If there is a D# (which would be Eb), it's in the scale as natural Eb. But not sure.

Wait, E major chord: E, G#, B. In Ab minor, E is Fb, G# is Ab, B is Cb. So E major chord is Fb major chord. Which is valid. So yes, VI chord.

Yes. So Ab minor seems to be the right fit.

Thus, the final answer would be Ab minor (Aeolian mode).

But just to check for other options. Could it be in a different key?

For example, maybe G# minor. But G# minor would have similar chords but with sharps. Since Ab minor and G# minor are enharmonic equivalents. Depending on the instrumentation or context, but usually we prefer flats for minor keys with multiple flats.

But the key could be notated as G# minor, but more likely Ab minor.

Given that the chord names use flats (Bb dim, Db minor, etc.), it's more natural to use Ab minor.

Yes. So the key is Ab minor, Aeolian mode.

Another way: If the song centers around Ab minor, and the chords we've listed all fit into that scale.

Yes. So that seems solid.

Therefore, the answer should be that the key is Ab minor, and the mode is Aeolian.

But sometimes just "key of Ab minor" implies Aeolian mode. But to be precise, the mode is Aeolian.

Alternatively, if it's using the harmonic minor, the seventh degree would be raised. But in this case, the VII chord is Gb major (not G# major like in harmonic minor). In Ab harmonic minor, the VII chord would be G major, but no. Let's check.

Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G.

Wait, no. Harmonic minor raises the seventh by a semitone.

Natural minor of Ab: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

Harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G

So seventh degree raised to G natural.

So VII chord would be G major (G, Bb, D).

But in our progression, we have Gb major chord as VII. So it's natural minor, not harmonic.

Therefore, Aeolian mode.

So conclusion: key of Ab minor, Aeolian mode.

The chord progression provided contains several elements that strongly indicate the **key of Ab minor (Aeolian mode)**. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Key Identification: Ab Minor**
1. **Chord Relationships in Ab Minor:**
   - **Bbdim**: This is the **ii° (supertonic diminished)** chord in Ab minor.
   - **Gb/Bb**: Gb major is the **vii (leading tone)** chord in Ab minor. The slash notation (Gb/Bb) indicates a first inversion of Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db with Bb in the bass).
   - **Dbm/Ab**: Db minor is the **iv (subdominant)** chord in Ab minor. The bass note Ab (tonic) confirms the tonal center.
   - **Emaj7/Ab**: The Emaj7 chord corresponds to the **VI (submediant)** chord in Ab minor. In Ab minor, the VI chord is **Fb major (spelled as E major due to enharmonic equivalence)**, and the slash notation (Emaj7/Ab) places the tonic (Ab) in the bass.
   - **B/Bb**: B major is the **iii (mediant)** chord in Ab minor. When spelled as **Cb major (enharmonic to B major)**, this fits perfectly as the iii chord. The bass note Bb (supertonic degree) supports this interpretation.

2. **Tonal Center (Ab):**
   - Multiple chords have **Ab as the bass note** (Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab), which is a strong indicator of the tonic. This is a common technique to emphasize the tonal center of the key.
   - The presence of **Ab minor** as a tonal anchor is reinforced by the consistent use of the **Ab minor scale tones** (Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb), even if the tonic chord itself (Abm) isn't explicitly played.

3. **Chord Functionality:**
   - The progression features **ii°–vii–iv–VI–iii**, which are all diatonic to **Ab minor**. This structure is characteristic of standard minor-key harmony.
   - The use of **natural minor (Aeolian)** is confirmed by the inclusion of **Gb** (not G natural) as the leading tone chord. In harmonic minor variants, the VII chord would be G major (raised 7th), but here Gb is used, aligning with natural minor.

### **Mode Analysis: Aeolian (Natural Minor)**
- The **Aeolian mode** is the natural minor scale (1–2–♭3–4–5–♭6–♭7). The progression aligns perfectly with this structure:
  - **Ab minor scale**: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.
  - All chords in the progression (Bbdim, Gb, Dbm, Emaj7, B) are derived from this scale without any raised 7th (which would occur in harmonic minor). Thus, the mode is **not harmonic minor** but **natural minor (Aeolian)**.

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **C minor**: While C minor has Bbdim as its vii° chord, the absence of Cm and the presence of chords like Dbm and Emaj7 (which do not align with C minor) make this less likely.
- **Gb major**: Gb major does not support the Emaj7 or Dbm chords as diatonic elements.
- **A minor or B minor**: The flat-heavy notation (Bb, Db, Eb) points to a flat-based minor key, not sharp-based keys like A or B minor.
- **G# minor**: While enharmonically equivalent to Ab minor, the use of flat spellings (Bbdim, Dbm, etc.) strongly favors **Ab minor** as the standard notation.

---

### **Final Answer**
- **Key**: **Ab minor**
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**

This progression uses standard minor-key harmony with a clear tonal center on **Ab**, and all chords align diatonically with the **Ab minor scale (Aeolian mode)**.
