Let’s break this down step by step.

## **1. Identify the chords**

- **Bbdim** = B♭ diminished triad (B♭, D♭, F♭=E)  
  In context, this is likely a **B♭°7** chord (B♭, D♭, F♭, G♭) — fully diminished 7th.

- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major with B♭ in bass → notes: B♭, G♭, D♭.  
  This is enharmonically same as **F♯/A♯** but spelled with flats.

- **Dbm/Ab** = D♭ minor with A♭ in bass → notes: A♭, D♭, F♭(E).  
  D♭ minor = D♭, F♭, A♭.

- **B/Bb** = B major with B♭ in bass → notes: B♭, B, D♯, F♯? Wait, B major triad is B, D♯, F♯. So B/B♭ = B♭, B, D♯, F♯ — a very dissonant polychord.

- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th (E, G♯, B, D♯) with A♭ in bass → notes: A♭, E, G♯, B, D♯.  
  A♭ against E major 7 creates strong dissonance.

## **2. Look for functional relationships**

B♭°7 = vii°7 in C minor (or could be common-tone diminished for B♭, G♭, etc.).  
But G♭/B♭ is G♭ major with B♭ bass — that’s just first inversion G♭ major.  
B♭°7 and G♭ major share notes:  
B♭°7 = B♭, D♭, F♭(E), G♭  
G♭ major = G♭, B♭, D♭  
So B♭°7 contains G♭ major triad plus F♭ (which is E).  
So B♭°7 could be working as G♭7(b9) without root (G♭7 = G♭ B♭ D♭ F♭; b9 = A𝄫 = G♭? Wait no, b9 is A𝄫=G? Let’s check: G♭7 chord = G♭ B♭ D♭ F♭; add b9 = A𝄫 (G natural). That’s not here. Actually B♭ is the b9 of A♭7, not G♭7. Let’s hold that thought.)

Better: B♭°7 is also D♭°7, E°7, G°7 — it’s symmetric.  
So B♭°7 = D♭°7 = E°7 = G°7.  

If B♭°7 → G♭/B♭, that’s like common-tone: B♭°7 shares B♭ and D♭ with G♭ major.

## **3. Check the progression**

Bbdim → Gb/Bb (×2) → Bbdim → Dbm/Ab → B/Bb → Bbdim → Gb/Bb (×2) → Bbdim → Emaj7/Ab → Bbdim.

So structure:  
B♭° - G♭/B♭ - G♭/B♭ - B♭° - D♭m/Ab - B/B♭ - B♭° - G♭/B♭ - G♭/B♭ - B♭° - E maj7/Ab - B♭°.

---

## **4. Try to find a tonal center**

The B♭° is a recurring motif.  
B♭° could be vii°7 of C minor, but we never see C minor.  
B♭° could be a common-tone diminished of B♭ major, but B♭ major not seen.  
B♭° could be functioning as G♭7(b9) without root (G♭), so tonic might be C♭ major (B major?? enharmonic).  

Let’s test: If G♭7 → C♭ major, yes. G♭/B♭ is just G♭ major (IV of D♭ major? or bII of F major? Neapolitan).  

But then E maj7/Ab — E major is unrelated to C♭ major. Enharmonically E major = F♭ major, which is same as C♭’s IV? No, C♭ major’s IV is F♭ major (=E major). Yes! So E maj7/Ab in C♭ major = IV maj7 with b6 in bass (A♭ is b6 of C♭ major). That fits:  
C♭ major: C♭ D♭ E♭ F♭ G♭ A♭ B♭.  
F♭ major 7 = F♭ A♭ C♭ E♭ — but here we have E maj7 = E G♯ B D♯, enharmonic to F♭ A♭ C♭ E♭ exactly. Yes! So E maj7 = F♭ maj7.  

So E maj7/Ab = F♭maj7/Ab = IV maj7 with A♭ bass (A♭ is in C♭ major scale).

## **5. So key is C♭ major**

C♭ major = B major enharmonically, but spelled with flats here because of G♭, D♭m, B♭°7, etc.  

Mode: major (Ionian).  

---

## **6. Check the B/B♭ chord**

B major = C♭ major? No, B major is enharmonic to C♭ major, so B/B♭ is a kind of tonic chord with a foreign bass B♭ (which is in C♭ major scale actually — B♭ is the 7th degree of C♭ major). So B/B♭ = I maj with ♭7 in bass.  

---

## **7. Conclusion**

**Key:** C♭ major (enharmonic to B major, but flat spelling fits the chords given).  
**Mode:** Major (Ionian).

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Cb\ major}
\]
