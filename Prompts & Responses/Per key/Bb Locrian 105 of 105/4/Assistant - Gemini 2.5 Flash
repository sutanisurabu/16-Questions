This question asks to determine the key and mode based on the chord progression: **Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**

## Analysis of the Chord Progression

The progression heavily features the **Bb diminished chord (Bbdim)** and chords built over a **Bb bass**.

1.  **Bbdim (vii°/Bb):** $\text{Bb-Db-Fb}$ (or $\text{Bb-Db-E}$) - This is a diminished triad.
2.  **Gb/Bb (V/Bb):** $\text{Bb-Db-Gb}$ - This is a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. This chord is often felt as a **Gb/Bb** passing chord. Given the key revolves around Bb, this might function as the $\text{V}$ chord if Fb ($\text{E}$) is interpreted enharmonically as $\text{E}$.
3.  **Dbm/Ab:** $\text{Ab-Db-Fb}$ - Db minor chord with Ab in the bass.
4.  **B/Bb:** $\text{Bb-D\#-F\#-B}$ - B major chord with Bb in the bass. This is quite unusual.
5.  **Emaj7/Ab:** $\text{Ab-E-G\#-B}$ - E major 7th chord with Ab in the bass.

### Focusing on the Tonal Center

The most important observation is the dominant and constant presence of **Bbdim** and the fact that nearly every chord has **Bb** or an adjacent note ($\text{Ab}$) in the bass, suggesting **Bb** is the tonic or center.

| Chord | Notes | Typical Function (if Bb is tonic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bbdim | Bb Db Fb(E) | vii°/i (Diminished Tonic) or vii° (Leading Tone) |
| Gb/Bb | Bb Db Gb | *Chromatic* (V of Db?) |
| Dbm/Ab | Ab Db Fb(E) | *Chromatic* |
| B/Bb | Bb D# F# B | *Chromatic* |
| Emaj7/Ab | Ab E G# B | *Chromatic* |

The use of **Bbdim** as the recurring central chord is the defining feature. In standard functional harmony:
*   A diminished chord is typically a **Leading Tone chord (vii°)**, pulling strongly to the tonic ($\text{i}$).
*   If a piece resolves to **Bb minor ($\text{B}\flat \text{m}$)**, then **$\text{Bbdim}$** functions as the tonic chord $\text{i}^{\circ}$ in certain non-functional or experimental contexts, or more commonly a heavily altered **$\text{Bb}$** major or minor chord.

## Determining Key and Mode

The extreme chromaticism (Db, Fb/E, Gb, D#, F#, Ab, E, G#) complicates the identification of a simple diatonic key. However, the *tonal center* is unequivocally **Bb**.

### The Phrygian/Locrian Connection

The notes contained within the most central chord, **Bbdim** ($\text{Bb, Db, Fb}$), are consistent with the beginning of the:

1.  **Bb Locrian Mode:** ($\text{Bb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bb}$) - Locrian is the mode built on the $\text{vii}$ degree of a major scale (e.g., $\text{Bb}$ Locrian is $\text{vii}$ of $\text{Cb}$ Major).
2.  **Bb Phrygian Mode:** ($\text{Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb}$) - Phrygian is the mode built on the $\text{iii}$ degree of a major scale ($\text{Bb}$ Phrygian is $\text{iii}$ of $\text{Gb}$ Major).

Both modes contain a $\text{b2, b3,}$ and $\text{b5}$:
*   **Locrian:** ($\text{Cb, Db, Fb}$) (b2, b3, b5)
*   **Phrygian:** ($\text{Cb, Db, F}$) (b2, b3, P5)

Since the harmony emphasizes **Bb, Db, and Fb (E)**, the mode strongly features the flat 5th, which is characteristic of **Locrian**. The other chords (Gb, Dbm, Emaj7) are highly chromatic, often obscuring the melodic scale, but the *tonic triad* is diminished.

### Conclusion on Mode

The constant recurrence of the diminished tonic triad ($\text{Bbdim}$), combined with the overall dark, unstable chromatic sound, overwhelmingly indicates **Locrian**. Locrian is the only diatonic mode where the tonic chord is naturally diminished (i°).

## Final Determination

**Tonal Center:** **Bb** (established by the constant presence of Bbdim/Bb bass)

**Mode:** **Locrian** (established by the use of the diminished triad ($\text{i}^{\circ}$) as the primary tonic sonority)

**Key and Mode:** **Bb Locrian**
