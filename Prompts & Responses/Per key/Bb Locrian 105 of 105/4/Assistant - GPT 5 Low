### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord structure**

I’m looking into minor key descending bass line patterns, and it seems like Ab natural minor is a strong candidate. The mode I'm considering is Aeolian, not harmonic minor, since there's no leading tone with G natural. Instead, I see Fb, and repeated Bbdim chords are diatonic ii° in natural minor. Checking my chords: Bbdim is ii° in Ab natural minor, and Gb/Bb represents a first inversion of Gb.**Reviewing chord functions**

I’m analyzing some chords and starting with Dbm/Ab, which is a iv 6/4 chord—a possible cadential 6/4. Then, I see B/Bb (Cb/Bb) that represents III over the supertonic in the bass, but it gets tricky. Cb has Bb in the bass, making it a third inversion. Though, it's a bit like a passing bass note rather than strictly diatonic. I also respell Emaj7/Ab to Fbmaj7/Ab, confirming everything is diatonic to Ab natural minor.**Examining chord sequences**

I'm counting through a sequence of chords like Bbdim and Gb/Bb, and I feel strongly that it’s rooted in Ab Aeolian. But could it fit in Gb major? Testing the Gb major scale reveals that Bbdim uses Fb (E natural), which isn't part of Gb major—there’s an F natural there. Since Bbdim includes Fb, it seems it's not diatonic to Gb major. Then I consider Ab Dorian, but it raises the sixth chord to F natural, while I have Fb occurrences in Bbdim.**Determining the key and mode**

I’ve ruled out Dorian for this piece and considered Ab Phrygian, but it would require a Bbb, which isn’t present. Looking at Ab harmonic minor would suggest using G natural as the leading tone, yet I see Gb in the Gb/Bb chords. This leads me to confirm that it’s in Ab minor with an Aeolian mode. Although there’s an interesting focus on Bbdim, I notice no explicit Abm chord. 

To summarize, the key is Ab minor (enharmonically G# minor), with an Aeolian mode rather than harmonic.**Confirming the key and chords**

I realize the chords spellings indicate Dbm, not C#m, so I’ll stick to Ab minor as the key. Therefore, the key is Ab natural minor with an Aeolian mode. Justifying this, all chords fit Ab Aeolian: Bbdim is ii°, Gb is VII, Dbm is iv, and Emaj7 can be seen as Fbmaj7 (VImaj7). Since no raised leading tone is present, I can mention that Emaj7/Ab is enharmonic to Fbmaj7/Ab. My final answer summarizes the key center as Ab with an Aeolian mode and notes for mapping.

Key: A-flat minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Why:
- Bbdim = ii° in Ab minor (Bb–Db–Fb)
- Gb/Bb = VII6
- Dbm/Ab = iv6/4
- B/Bb is enharmonic to Cb/Bb (III over 2)
- Emaj7/Ab is enharmonic to Fbmaj7/Ab (VImaj7 over 1)
No raised leading tone (G♮) appears, so it’s natural minor rather than harmonic/melodic.
