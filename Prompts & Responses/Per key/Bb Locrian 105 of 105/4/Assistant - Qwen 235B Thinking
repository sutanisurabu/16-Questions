**Assistant - Qwen 235B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chord symbols: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim" and asked me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to unpack what these chord symbols mean. Bbdim is B-flat diminished, which is Bb-Db-E. Gb/Bb means G-flat major with Bb in the bass, so the notes are Bb-Db-Gb. Dbm/Ab is D-flat minor with A-flat in the bass - Ab-Cb-Db but since Cb is B, it's Ab-B-Db. B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass? Wait, that seems odd - B natural over Bb bass would create a dissonant clash. Maybe it's a typo? Could it be A/Bb? That would make more sense as an A major chord over Bb bass. I should check standard jazz/harmonic practices. In many jazz contexts, B/Bb isn't standard notation - it's likely meant to be Bdim/Bb or something else. 

Looking at Emaj7/Ab - that's E major seventh with A-flat in the bass. Ab is G#, so E major is E-G#-B, plus D# for maj7, but G# is Ab so it's written as Ab. So notes: Ab-E-G#-B? That seems messy. Actually Emaj7 is E-G#-B-D#, so with Ab bass it would be Ab-E-G#-B-D#? But Ab and G# are enharmonic, so it's a bit confusing notationally. 

I notice a pattern - most chords have Bb or Ab in the bass. The sequence repeats "Bbdim Bbdim" several times, with variations around Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, that odd B/Bb, and Emaj7/Ab. 

Let me list all bass notes: 
- Bbdim: common tone Bb? 
- Gb/Bb: bass Bb
- Dbm/Ab: bass Ab
- B/Bb: would be bass Bb (if it's B/Bb) but the chord is problematic
- Emaj7/Ab: bass Ab

So primary bass movement: Bb - Bb - Ab - ? - Bb - Ab. 

The dominant recurring chord is Bbdim. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or leading tones. Bb diminished contains Bb-Db-E, which is enharmonically the same as A#-C#-E but in flat keys it's written as Bb-Db-E. 

Important: in tonal harmony, a diminished chord built on the second scale degree (ii°) often points to the dominant. But here it's centered around Bb. 

Let me consider possible keys where Bbdim makes sense. 

If Bbdim is the leading tone chord, it would lead to Bb. But diminished chords are usually half-diminished or fully diminished in minor keys. 

Bbdim is root Bb, so for it to be the leading tone chord, the tonic would be Ab. Because in Ab major, the leading tone chord is G#dim (which is enharmonic to Abdim? Wait no). 

In Ab major: 
- Tonic: Ab 
- Leading tone is G, so G diminished seventh (G-Bb-Db-Fb) but Fb is E. 

But here it's Bbdim, which is Bb-Db-Fb? No, diminished triad is minor third + minor third, so Bb-Dbb-Fb? Standard notation: Bb diminished is Bb-Db-E (since Dbb is C, but we spell it as Db for the diminished third). Actually correct spelling: Bb diminished triad is Bb-Db-Fb (Fb=E natural). So notes Bb-Db-E. 

In Ab major key, the vii° chord is G#dim7: G#-B-D-F. Enharmonically that's Ab-B-Db-E? G# is Ab, B is Cb? Messy. 

Better to think in terms of functional harmony. The chord Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) has E which is a major third above C, so it could be dominant function for Ab? Let's see: 

If we're in Ab major, the dominant is Eb7. Bbdim could be used as a chromatic passing chord. But Bbdim to what? 

Notice that Gb/Bb is Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db) over Bb bass, so essentially Bb7 without the third? Gb is the tritone substitution for C, but in Ab context... 

Tritone substitution: in Ab major, dominant is Eb7. Tritone sub of Eb7 is A7, but here we have Gb/Bb which is related to Db? Gb is the b5 of C, but let's calculate. 

Standard tritone substitution: for dominants, replace G7 with Db7 because they share the same tritone (F#-C for G7, which becomes F-Db for Db7? Wait: G7 has B and F (tritone), Db7 has F and Cb (tritone), so yes, same interval. 

But here we have Gb/Bb - Gb major chord over Bb bass. Notes: Bb-Db-Gb. So it's like a Bb7#11 or something? Because Bb7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab, but here we have Db and Gb (which is F#), so Bb-Db-F# which is Bb7#11 (since #11 is E# which is F, but Gb is F# so it's #11). 

In jazz, Gb/Bb is often used as a tritone substitution for C7, but over Bb bass? Bb would be the tonic here? 

Another thought: the bass movement suggests a cycle. Let's list the roots implied: 

- Bbdim: root Bb 
- Gb/Bb: chord root Gb 
- Dbm/Ab: chord root Db (with Ab bass) 
- B/Bb: chord root B? But over Bb bass - problematic 
- Emaj7/Ab: chord root E over Ab bass 

This looks like a chromatic descending bass line under static harmony. 

Count the bass notes: 
Positions: 
1-2: Bb (from Bbdim and Gb/Bb) 
3-4: Ab? Wait no: 
First "Bbdim Bbdim" - bass likely Bb each 
Then "Gb/Bb" - bass Bb 
Another "Gb/Bb" - bass Bb 
Then "Bbdim Bbdim" - bass Bb 
Then "Dbm/Ab" - bass Ab 
Then "B/Bb" - bass Bb 
Then "Bbdim Bbdim" - bass Bb 
Then "Gb/Bb Gb/Bb" - bass Bb 
Then "Bbdim Bbdim" - bass Bb 
Then "Emaj7/Ab" - bass Ab 
Then "Bbdim" - bass probably Bb 

So bass notes are mostly Bb, with exceptions at "Dbm/Ab" (Ab bass) and "Emaj7/Ab" (Ab bass), and that weird "B/Bb" which would be Bb bass if taken literally. 

The only deviations are to Ab bass. So it's like a pedal point on Bb with two moments of Ab bass. 

But Ab is the minor seventh of Bb, so it could be implying a Bb minor context? Because in Bb minor, the subtonic is Ab. 

Let's test Bb minor. 

Bb natural minor scale: Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb 

Chords: 
- i: Bbm 
- ii°: Cdim 
- III: Db maj 
- iv: Ebm 
- v: Fm 
- VI: Gb maj 
- VII: Ab maj 

But here we have Bbdim, which isn't the tonic in natural minor - tonic is minor, not diminished. 

However, in harmonic minor, the leading tone is raised, so Bb harmonic minor: Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-Gb-A-Bb 

Then: 
- i: Bbm 
- ii°: Cdim 
- III+: Db aug? Usually not used 
- iv: Ebm 
- V: F major (with A natural) 
- VI: Gb maj 
- vii°: Adim 

Bbdim isn't directly in the scale. Bbdim would be Bb-Db-E, but in harmonic minor the seventh degree is A, not Ab. 

Bbdim contains E natural, which is the major third of C, so it suggests a dominant function. 

Notice that Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) is enharmonic to Adim (A-C-Eb), but spelled differently. In jazz, diminished chords are often used as dominant substitutes. 

Specifically, Bb diminished triad (Bb-Db-E) can function as the vii° of Ab major. Because in Ab major, vii° is G#° = G#-B-D, which is enharmonic to Ab-B-Db, but Bbdim is Bb-Db-E - not the same. 

G#° is G#-B-D, which is same notes as B° (B-D-F) but in different inversion? No. 

Standard: the diminished chord a half step above the tonic is the leading tone chord. So for Ab major, leading tone is G#, so G#°7. 

G#°7 = G#-B-D-F 
Enharmonically: Ab-B-Db-E (since G#=Ab, B=B, D=C#, F=E#? Messy). 

But Bbdim is Bb-Db-E - which is three notes: 
- Bb is enharmonic to A# 
- Db is C# 
- E is E 

So A#-C#-E, which is A# diminished. A# dim is the leading tone chord for B major, but that seems unrelated. 

Perhaps it's functioning as a secondary dominant. 

Let's look at the entire sequence. The pattern repeats "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb" twice, with interruptions. 

Gb/Bb is Gb major over Bb, so the notes are Bb (bass), Db (3rd of Gb), Gb (root). So intervals: Bb to Db is minor 3rd, Db to Gb is perfect 4th, so it's like a Bb7sus4(b9) or something? Bb7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab. Gb is the b5 (since F# = Gb), so Bb7b5. Yes! Gb/Bb is essentially Bb7b5, because Bb7b5 would be Bb-Db-Fb-Ab, and Fb is E, but Gb is F#, so actually it's Bb7#11? Let's calculate: 

In Bb7, the #11 is E (since 11th is Eb, #11 is E). But Gb is F#, which is enharmonic to E#? No, F# is 6th tone. 

Standard: for Bb7, the #11 is E natural. But here the chord is Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db) over Bb bass, so combined notes: Bb (bass), Bb (from Gb/Bb? No - Gb major is Gb-Bb-Db, so over Bb bass: Bb, Gb, Bb, Db. So pitches: Bb, Db, Gb (since Gb is repeated). 

So three distinct pitches: Bb, Db, Gb. 

Intervals from Bb: 
- Bb to Db: minor 3rd 
- Bb to Gb: diminished 5th (since Gb is F#, but in bass it's Bb, so Bb to F# is augmented 4th, same as diminished 5th) 

So the sonority is Bb + minor 3rd + diminished 5th = Bb7b5 (Bb dominant 7 flat 5). Yes! Because Bb7b5 is Bb-Db-Fb-Ab, but Fb is E, so notes Bb-Db-E-Ab. However, in this chord "Gb/Bb", we only have three notes: Bb, Db, Gb (where Gb = F#). But F# is not E; E is natural. So there's a discrepancy. 

Gb is G-flat, which is F-sharp. So the chord is Bb, Db, F#. 

But in Bb7b5, we want Bb, Db, Fb (E), Ab. Here we have F# instead of E. So it's actually Bb7#11, because #11 is E# which is F, but F# is the #11? Let's see: 

In Bb, the 11th is Eb, so #11 is E natural. But F# is the major 3rd above Db, or enharmonically the augmented 4th from Bb. 

Bb to F# is augmented 4th, which is the #11 in Bb7. Yes! Standard Bb7#11 is Bb-Db-F-Ab-E (where E is #11). But in "Gb/Bb", we have Bb-Db-F#. F# is Gb, which is the same as E#? No, E# is F, so F# is different. 

Actually, F# is the #11, but in practice, #11 is often spelled as the sharp of the 11th: 11th of Bb is Eb, so #11 is E natural. But E natural and F# are enharmonically the same only in equal temperament, but notationally, F# is a different pitch class. 

In chord symbols, Gb/Bb is sometimes used to indicate a tritone substitution or a #11 sound. But technically, for Bb7, #11 is E, not F#. However, since F# = Gb and in equal temperament it's the same pitch, musicians often use it interchangeably. 

So functionally, Gb/Bb is acting as a Bb7#11 chord. 

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: D-flat minor over A-flat bass. Notes: Ab (bass), Db (root of Dbm), Fb (Eb, third of Dbm). So pitches: Ab, Db, Fb (Eb). 

Intervals from Ab: 
- Ab to Db: perfect 4th 
- Ab to Eb: perfect 5th 

So it's Ab7sus4? Ab7 is Ab-C-Eb-Gb. Here we have Ab-Db-Eb. Db is the 11th, Eb is the 5th. So Ab7sus4 (Ab-Db-Eb-Gb) but without the minor 7th (Gb). So it's incomplete, but suggests Ab7sus4. 

B/Bb: this is problematic. B major over Bb bass? Notes: Bb (bass), B (root), D# (F, but D# is enharmonic to Eb). So pitches: Bb, B, D#. 

This creates a minor second (Bb-B) and augmented second (B-D# = B-Eb? D# is Eb, so B to Eb is diminished 4th). Very dissonant. In context, it's likely a typo. Given the pattern, it might be meant to be "Bdim/Bb" - B diminished over Bb bass. Bdim is B-D-F, so over Bb: Bb, B, D, F. But B and Bb still clash. 

Other possibility: "A/Bb" - A major over Bb bass. A major is A-C#-E, over Bb: Bb, A, C#, E. This is a Bb7b9 chord, because Bb7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab, but here we have A (which is bb7? Wait: 
- Bb to A is minor 7th down, so in root position it would be Ab as minor 7th, but here we have A natural which is G##, so enharmonically it's the minor 7th if we think of Ab, but for Bb, the minor 7th is Ab. 

Bb7b9: Bb-Db-F-Ab-B (where B is the b9). B natural is the b9 for Bb7. Yes! So "A/Bb" would be Bb7b9, but here it's written as "B/Bb", which might be a typo for "Bdim/Bb" or "A/Bb". Given the E earlier in Emaj7/Ab, and the context, it could be "Ab/Bb" but that doesn't make sense. 

Looking back at the user input: "Dbm/Ab B/Bb" — probably "B/Bb" is meant to be "Ab/Bb" but that's redundant. Or "Bdim/Bb". 

In many jazz standards, you see sequences like this in minor keys with chromatic passing chords. 

Now, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th over Ab bass. E major is E-G#-B-D#, so over Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. 

Notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. 

Enharmonically, Ab = G#, so it's G# with G#-B-D#-F##? Messy. Better to think: Ab and G# are same pitch, so the bass is G#, and chord is E-G#-B-D# which is E major 7th. So it's G#°7 or something? E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#, so with G# bass, it's G#-E-G#-B-D# — which is the same as G# half-diminished? G# half-diminished is G#-B-D#-F#, but here we have E and B, so it's actually E7#9: E-G#-B-D# with Ab (G#) in bass, and D# is the #9? E7#9 is E-G#-B-D-G, but #9 is G. Here we have D# which is the major 7th, not the minor 7th. 

Actually, Emaj7/Ab is enharmonically C#m6/Ab or something, but let's calculate the actual pitches: 

- Ab (bass) = G# 
- E (chord root) 
- G# (third of E major) — but G# is same as Ab, so the bass and third are the same note? 
- B (fifth) 
- D# (maj7) = Eb 

So pitches: Ab (bass), E, G# (same as Ab), B, D# (Eb). So distinct pitches: Ab, E, B, Eb. 

Intervals: 
- Ab to E: augmented 5th (since perfect 5th is Eb, augmented is E) 
- Ab to B: major 3rd up? Ab to B is minor 3rd? Ab-A-B, so Ab to B is major third (since Ab to Cb is minor third, to B is major third enharmonically). Ab to B is three semitones: Ab-A-Bb-B? Ab to A is minor second, to Bb minor third, to B major third. Yes, Ab to B is major third. 
- Ab to Eb: perfect 5th 

So the chord is Ab-E-B-Eb — which is Ab7: Ab-C-Eb-Gb. But here we have Ab-E-B-Eb. E is not C, B is not Gb. 

Ab to E is augmented 5th (Ab-E), Eb is the minor 7th (Ab-Eb). But B is the #11? This is confusing. 

Notice that E and Ab form a tritone. In fact, E-Ab is a diminished 5th/augmented 4th. 

So the chord is essentially a tritone with extensions. But with B and Eb added, it's complex. 

In jazz, Emaj7/Ab is often interpreted as an Ab7b9#9 or something, because the notes: 
- Ab (bass) 
- E = the #11 (but #11 is D, not E) 
Standard Ab7b9: Ab-C-Eb-Gb-Bbb (A), so Ab-C-Eb-Gb-A. 
Here we have Ab, E, G#, B, D# — but G# is Ab, so effectively Ab, E, B, Eb. 
E is the #11 (since 11th is Db, #11 is D, but E is not D). 
Perhaps it's functioning as a dominant for D or something. 

Let's step back. The most frequent chord is "Bbdim", which appears 10 times in the sequence. In jazz progression, a repeated diminished chord often indicates a "diminished passing chord" between two tonics, but here it's static. 

Another idea: the entire progression might be in Ab major, with Bbdim acting as a ii° chord. In Ab major, ii° is Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb). Yes! Bb diminished triad: Bb-Db-Fb (Fb=E). In Ab major, the notes are Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G, but for chords: 
- i: Ab 
- ii°: Bb dim (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- III: Cm 
- IV: Db 
- V: Eb 
- vi: Fm 
- vii°: G° 

Yes! Bbdim is exactly the ii° chord in Ab major. 

But in the progression, we have Gb/Bb. In Ab major, Gb doesn't appear. Gb is the bVII, which is not diatonic. However, in jazz and blues, bVII is common. 

Gb major is the bVI of Ab? Ab bVI is Fb, which is E, not Gb. 

Gb is the IV of Db, but not related. 

Tritone substitution: for dominant chords. In Ab major, V is Eb7. Tritone sub is A7. But Gb is not directly related. 

Another thought: the "Gb/Bb" might be meant to be part of a ii-V-I in a different key. 

Let's consider the possibility that the progression is centered on Ab, and Bbdim is ii°, leading to I Ab. But in the sequence, Bbdim is followed by... well, it's mostly Bbdim repeating, with Gb/Bb which could be IV in Db, but not consistent. 

Look at Dbm/Ab: Db minor over Ab bass. In Ab major, Db is the IV chord, but minor? IV is usually major in major keys, but in minor keys it can be minor. 

Perhaps the key is Gb minor. Let's try Gb minor. 

Gb natural minor: Gb-Ab-Bbb(Cb)-Db-Eb-Fb(G)-Abb(B) - wait, standard: Gb minor scale: Gb-Ab-Bbb(Cb)-Db-Eb-Fb(G)-Ab. So notes Gb, Ab, Bbb (A), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Ab. 

Chords: 
- i: Gbm 
- ii°: Ab° 
- III: Bbb (A) maj — but usually written as Ab dim? 

Not matching. 

Harmonic minor: Gb, Ab, Bbb, Db, Eb, Fb, G (natural leading tone). 

Still, Bbdim doesn't fit. Bb is not in the scale. 

Bb is enharmonic to A#, which is not in Gb minor. 

Another approach: the Bbdim chord has notes Bb, Db, E. E is the major third above C, so it suggests a dominant function for Ab (since C is the third of Ab). 

Specifically, Bb-Db-E is the same as the upper structure of Ab minor-major 7 or something. 

Abm(maj7) is Ab-Cb-Eb-G. Not matching. 

Notice that Bb-Db-E spells the notes of a G7b9 chord: G-B-D-F-Ab, but with Ab missing, and it's Bb-Db-E. G7b9 has notes G-B-D-F-Ab, so the upper structure is B-D-F-Ab, which is B half-diminished. But here we have Bb-Db-E — different. 

Bb-Db-E is actually the same as E-G#-Bb, which is E diminished. E° is E-G-Bb. Oh! Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) is enharmonically equivalent to E° (E-G-Bb), since Bb = A#, but in equal temperament, the pitches are the same: Bb, Db, E. 

E° = E-G-Bb, which is the same as G-Bb-Db, or Bb-Db-E. Yes! So Bbdim is identical to E°, G°, and C° in terms of pitch collection, but spelled differently. 

In this case, Bbdim = E° (enharmonically). 

E° is the vii° chord in F major. In F major, vii° is E°: E-G-Bb. 

Also, E° can function as a dominant substitute for C7, since it contains the tritone G-Bb (F#), which is the same as in C7 (B-F). 

So perhaps we're in F major. 

Check: in F major, diatonic chords: 
- I: F 
- ii: Gm 
- iii: Am 
- IV: Bb 
- V: C 
- vi: Dm 
- vii°: E° 

Yes! E° is the leading tone chord, and it's spelled as E-G-Bb. But here it's written as Bbdim, which is Bb-Db-E — wait, Db is not in F major. Major scale has Db? F major is F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E. So no Db; D is natural. 

E° in F major is E-G-Bb, which uses G natural, not Gb. But Bbdim as written is Bb-Db-E — Db is C#, which is not in F major. 

Problem: Bbdim implies Db (which is C#), but in F major, the leading tone chord is E-G-Bb (with G natural). 

So Bbdim with Db would be E-G#-Bb? But G# is not in F major. 

Unless it's E°7: E-G-Bb-Db, which is the fully diminished seventh chord. 

E°7 = E-G-Bb-Db 

Enharmonically, this is also G°7 = G-Bb-Db-Eb? No: 
E°7: E, G, Bb, Db 
G°7: G, Bb, Db, E 
B°7: B, D, F, Ab 
D°7: D, F, Ab, Cb 

So E°7 = E-G-Bb-Db, and Db is C#. 

Now, in the chord symbol, it's written as "Bbdim" — but in standard notation, "dim" usually means diminished triad, not seventh. However, in jazz contexts, "dim" often implies diminished seventh chord. 

This is crucial. In many jazz charts, "Cdim" means C diminished seventh, not triad. So "Bbdim" likely means Bb diminished seventh chord. 

Bbdim7 would be Bb-Db-F-Ab — but diminished seventh chord is root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th, diminished 7th. So for Bb: 
- Bb to Db: minor 3rd 
- Db to Fb (E): diminished 5th (since F is natural in major, but here it's diminished, so Fb) 
- Fb to Abb (G): diminished 7th 

So Bbdim7 = Bb, Db, Fb (E), Abb (G) 

But Abb is G, and Fb is E. So pitches: Bb, Db, E, G. 

Enharmonically, this is the same as E°7: E, G, Bb, Db. 

Yes! Bbdim7 = E°7 = G°7 = C°7, etc. 

In standard jazz practice, a diminished seventh chord is symmetrical and can be spelled from any root. But it's often notated based on context. 

Given that, "Bbdim" here likely means Bb diminished seventh chord, which is Bb-Db-E-G (with E and G being enharmonic equivalents of Fb and Abb). 

Now, in functional harmony, this chord often acts as a passing chord or as a secondary leading tone chord. 

Common function: in the key of Ab, the vii°7 chord is G#°7 = G#-B-D-F, which is enharmonically Ab-B-Db-E (since G#=Ab, B=B, D=C#, F=E). But our chord is Bb-Db-E-G — which is different. 

G#°7 would be Ab-B-Db-E (enharmonically), but B-Db is minor third, Db-E is major second? Not diminished intervals. 

G#°7 spelled properly: G#, B, D, F. 
- G# to B: minor 3rd 
- B to D: minor 3rd 
- D to F: minor 3rd 

Yes. 

Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G — 
- Bb to Db: minor 3rd 
- Db to E: major second? Db to E is augmented 2nd (since Db-D-E, so three semitones, which is minor 3rd enharmonically? Db to E is: Db-D-D#-E, so three semitones, minor third. 

Db to E: Db to D is semitone, D to D# is second semitone, D# to E is third? No: Db to D is minor second, D to E is major second, so Db to E is minor third (three semitones: Db-D, D-D#, D#-E — but D# is Eb, so Db to Eb is minor second? Let's count: 

Pitches: Db, D, Eb, E, F, etc. 
From Db to E: 
- Db to D: +1 semitone 
- D to Eb: +1 (total +2) 
- Eb to E: +1 (total +3) 

Yes, three semitones, which is minor third. So Db to E is minor third (enharmonically, since E is the same as Fb, but numerically). 

Then E to G: E-F-F#-G, three semitones, minor third. 
G to Bb: G-Ab-A-Bb, three semitones, minor third. 

So yes, it's a fully diminished seventh chord. 

Now, such a chord can resolve to a major or minor chord a half step above any of its roots. 

For example, Bbdim7 (Bb-Db-E-G) can resolve to: 
- Ab major (since Bb is a half step above Ab) 
- Cb major (B, but usually written as B) 
- E major 
- G major 

In the progression, we have Gb/Bb. Gb/Bb — as we discussed, likely a Bb7#11 or something. But let's see the resolution. 

After "Bbdim Bbdim", we have "Gb/Bb". If the diminished chord resolves to Gb, but Gb is a major third away, not a half step. 

Standard resolution: diminished chord resolves up a half step. So Bbdim7 should resolve to Ab, but here it's going to Gb/Bb which has Gb in the chord. 

Gb is a whole step below Ab. 

Perhaps it's a different function. 

Another common usage: diminished chords as common tone diminished chords. For example, if we're on Ab, and we have a diminished chord with Ab in it, but here the bass is moving. 

In this sequence, the bass is mostly Bb, and Bbdim7 has Bb, so it's a common tone. 

Bbdim7 over Bb bass would be: Bb (bass), Bb, Db, E, G — so the chord is Bb-Db-E-G, with common tone Bb. 

This is often used to create tension before resolving. 

Now, looking at "Gb/Bb": if we take it as Gb major over Bb bass — Bb-Db-Gb. 

Bbdim7 is Bb-Db-E-G. 

So from Bbdim7 to Gb/Bb: 
- E moves to Db? (E down to Db) 
- G moves to Gb? (G down to F#) 
- Bb and Db stay. 

So E->Db (minor third down), G->Gb (minor second down), which is a common resolution for diminished chords — the outer voices move in contrary motion to form a major triad. 

Specifically, from Bbdim7 (Bb-Db-E-G) to Gb (Gb-Bb-Db), the E resolves down to Db, G resolves down to Gb? But G to Gb is down minor second, which is typical. 

And Db stays as Db, Bb stays as Bb. 

Yes! So it's resolving to Gb major, but Gb is a minor third down, not up a half step. 

But in this case, it's a common tone resolution where the diminished chord shares two notes with the target chord. 

Bbdim7 shares Db and Bb with Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db). 

The other two notes (E and G) resolve: 
- E resolves to Db (by minor third down, which is like a leading tone resolution) 
- G resolves to Gb (by minor second down) 

This is a standard resolution for a common tone diminished chord to a major chord a minor third away. 

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor over Ab bass. Notes: Ab, Db, Fb (Eb). 

Bbdim7 is Bb-Db-E-G. 

Not directly adjacent. 

But after Gb/Bb, we go back to Bbdim Bbdim, so it's oscillating. 

Then we have "Dbm/Ab" — which is Ab-Db-Eb. 

Bbdim7 has Bb-Db-E-G. 

From previous: after Bbdim Bbdim (which might be implying the same chord), to Dbm/Ab: 
- Bb might resolve to Ab (down minor second) 
- Db stays 
- E might resolve to Eb (down minor second) 
- G might resolve to Db? Not clear. 

Yes: Bb->Ab (down minor second), E->Eb (down minor second), Db stays, G->? In Dbm/Ab, we have Ab, Db, Eb, so G could resolve to Ab or Db, but it's common for the G (which is the diminished 7th) to resolve down to F, but here F isn't present. 

In Dbm/Ab, the notes are Ab (bass), Db, Eb. So pitches Ab, Db, Eb. 

Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G. 

So Bb->Ab, E->Eb, Db stays, G->? Eb or Db. G to Eb is minor third down — possible. 

This suggests a resolution to Ab minor, since Dbm/Ab implies Ab7sus4 or Ab minor. 

Ab minor chord is Ab-Cb-Eb. But here it's Dbm/Ab — Db minor is Db-Fb-Ab, so over Ab bass: Ab-Db-Fb (Eb). This is a first inversion Db minor, but Db minor is not diatonic to Ab minor. 

In Ab minor, the iv chord is Db minor. Yes! In Ab natural minor, iv is Dbm. 

And i is Abm. 

So Dbm is the iv chord in Ab minor. 

Similarly, Gb/Bb: Gb major. In Ab minor, what is Gb? Ab minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. So Gb is the VII degree. 

In minor keys, the VII chord is major. 

So in Ab minor: 
- i: Abm 
- ii°: Bbdim 
- III: Cbmaj (often Bmaj) 
- iv: Dbm 
- v: Ebm (or V if harmonic) 
- VI: Gbmaj 
- VII: Abmaj? No, VII is Gb. 

Ab natural minor: 
1. Ab 
2. Bb 
3. Cb 
4. Db 
5. Eb 
6. Fb (E) 
7. Gb 

So: 
- i: Abm (Ab-Cb-Eb) 
- ii°: Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb) — Fb is E, but in notation it's Fb 
- III: Cb (B) maj — usually written as B 
- iv: Dbm (Db-Fb-Ab) 
- v: Ebm (Eb-Gb-Bb) 
- VI: Gb (Gb-Bb-Db) 
- VII: Ab? No, 7th degree is Gb, so chord on Gb: Gb-Bb-Db = Gbmaj 

Yes, and Gbmaj is the VI chord, not VII. 

In minor keys: 
- i 
- ii° 
- III 
- iv 
- v 
- VI 
- VII 

So for Ab minor: 
- i: Abm 
- ii°: Bbdim 
- III: Bmaj 
- iv: Dbm 
- v: Ebm 
- VI: Gbmaj 
- VII: Abmaj? The seventh degree is Gb, so the chord on Gb is Gb-Bb-Db = Gbmaj, which would be the VI chord if measured from tonic. Tonic is Ab, so: 
- Degree 1: Ab 
- 2: Bb 
- 3: Cb 
- 4: Db 
- 5: Eb 
- 6: Fb (E) 
- 7: Gb 

So the chords: 
- i: Ab- (Ab-Cb-Eb) 
- ii°: Bb° (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- III: Cb (B) maj 
- iv: Dbm (Db-Fb-Ab) 
- v: Ebm (Eb-Gb-Bb) 
- VI: Fbm (Ebm) — but Fb is enharmonic to E, so Ebm 
- vii°: G° (Gb-Bb-Db? G° is G-Bb-Db, but Gb is F#, so not exactly) 

In natural minor, the chords are: 
- i: minor 
- ii°: diminished 
- III: major 
- iv: minor 
- v: minor 
- VI: major 
- VII: major? No, in natural minor, VII is major only if the 7th is natural minor. 

Standard natural minor diatonic chords: 
i - ii° - III - iv - v - VI - VII 

With: 
- III major 
- VI major 
- VII major 

For A minor: 
- i: Am 
- ii°: B° 
- III: C 
- iv: Dm 
- v: Em 
- VI: F 
- VII: G 

Yes, VII is major. 

So for Ab minor: 
- ii°: Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- iv: Dbm 
- VI: Gbmaj (Gb-Bb-Db) 

And VII: Abmaj? The seventh degree is Gb, so chord on Gb is Gb-Bb-Db = Gbmaj, which is the VI chord. 

The VII chord would be on the seventh scale degree, which is Gb, so it is Gbmaj, and it's the VI chord? No: 

Scale degrees: 
1. Ab 
2. Bb 
3. Cb 
4. Db 
5. Eb 
6. Fb (E) 
7. Gb 

So: 
- Chord on 1: i = Abm 
- Chord on 2: ii° = Bbdim 
- Chord on 3: III = Cbmaj 
- Chord on 4: iv = Dbm 
- Chord on 5: v = Ebm 
- Chord on 6: VI = Fbmaj (which is E maj) 
- Chord on 7: VII = Gbmaj 

Yes! So VII is Gbmaj. 

In the progression, we have "Gb/Bb" which is Gb major over Bb bass — consistent with Gbmaj (the VII chord). 

And "Dbm/Ab" is Db minor over Ab bass — which is Dbm, the iv chord. 

Now, what about "B/Bb"? If it's a typo, it might be "Bbm/Bb" or "Ab/Bb", but in context, after Dbm/Ab, it's "B/Bb", then back to Bbdim. 

Perhaps "B/Bb" is meant to be "Ab/Bb" or "G/Bb", but let's see. 

After "Dbm/Ab" (which is iv in Ab minor), the next chord is "B/Bb". If we are in Ab minor, the v chord is Ebm. But "B/Bb" doesn't suggest that. 

Given the pattern, and the fact that it's followed by "Bbdim", which is ii°, it might be a dominant chord. 

In minor keys, the v chord is often minor, but the V chord (harmonic) is major. 

In Ab harmonic minor, the V chord is Eb major (because the leading tone is G natural instead of Gb). 

But "B/Bb" — B major over Bb bass? If it's E/Bb or something. 

Perhaps "B/Bb" is a misnotation for "E/Bb" — E major over Bb bass. E major is E-G#-B. Over Bb: Bb, E, G#, B. 

Which is Bb7b9: Bb-Db-F-Ab-B. B natural is the b9. 

And Bb7b9 is a common dominant chord for Ab minor (since Bb7 is V7 of Ab). 

Yes! In Ab minor, the dominant V7 is Eb7, but here it's Bb7 — which is not V. V is Eb. 

Bb7 would be the bII7, a common minor chord, but that doesn't make sense. 

For Ab minor, II chord is Bbdim, not Bb7. 

bII7 is uncommon. 

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant. 

But given the context, "B/Bb" likely means "Bb7" but written as a slash chord. In some notations, "B" might be a typo for "7" or something, but it's probably "Bdim" as mentioned earlier. 

Assuming "B/Bb" is an error for "Bdim/Bb" — B diminished over Bb bass. Bdim is B-D-F. Over Bb: Bb, B, D, F. 

This is Bb7b9 (Bb-Db-F-Ab-Cb), but here we have B natural instead of Db. Bb to B is minor 9th, so Bb7b9 would have B natural as b9. 

Yes! Bb7b9 consists of Bb, Db, F, Ab, and B (natural, the b9). 

In "Bdim/Bb", if Bdim is B-D-F, and over Bb bass: pitches Bb, B, D, F. 

Bb7b9 is Bb-Db-F-Ab-B. Here we have D instead of Db? D is C#, which is not Db. 

Bdim is B-D-F, so D natural. But Bb7b9 requires Db (third of the chord). 

So not exact, but in jazz, Bdim/Bb might be used to imply Bb7b9, since Bdim is part of the altered scale. 

Specifically, the Bb altered scale (for Bb7) is Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab — which has Db, Eb, etc. But Bdim (B-D-F) isn't directly in it. 

Note that the notes B-D-F are the same as D-F-B, which is Dm, but not helpful. 

Enharmonically, B-D-F = D-F-B = F-B-D, which is F7, but not related. 

Perhaps it's a typo for "Ab/Bb" — Ab major over Bb bass, which would be Ab-C-Eb over Bb, so Bb-Ab-C-Eb — which is Bb7sus4(b9) or something. 

But in the sequence, it appears between Dbm/Ab and Bbdim. 

Dbm/Ab is Ab-Db-Eb (bass Ab), then "B/Bb" (bass Bb), then Bbdim (bass Bb). 

So from Ab bass to Bb bass — a whole step up. 

If Dbm/Ab is iv in Ab minor, then moving to a chord with Bb bass could be ii° or V/v or something. 

Suppose "B/Bb" should be "E/Bb" — E major over Bb bass. As above, this would be Bb7b9 (Bb dominant 7 flat 9), which is a standard dominant chord for Ab minor. 

Because V7 of Ab is Eb7, but Bb7 is not V; V is fifth degree, which is Eb. 

Unless it's a cadence to Db or something. 

Bb7 would be V7 of Eb, but we're in Ab minor. 

Perhaps the key is not Ab minor. 

Last chord: "Emaj7/Ab". Emaj7 over Ab bass. As we analyzed, notes Ab, E, G#, B, D# — enharmonically Ab, E, Ab, B, Eb. So Ab, E, B, Eb. 

This looks like Ab7: Ab-C-Eb-Gb. But here we have E and B instead of C and Gb. 

E is the #11, B is the 13th? Ab7#11 is Ab-C-Eb-Gb-D, but here D# is Eb, not D. 

Actually, Ab, E, B, Eb — 
- Ab to Eb: perfect 5th 
- Ab to B: major 3rd (as Ab-C is minor third? Ab to B: Ab-A-Bb-B, so major third) 
- Ab to E: augmented 5th 

So it's Ab7#9: Ab-C-Eb-Gb-B (where B is the #9). Yes! Because #9 is B natural for Ab (since 9th is Bb, #9 is B). 

And in this chord, we also have E natural, which is the #11. 

But the symbol is Emaj7/Ab, which gives us the #9 and #11, so it's a highly altered Ab7 chord, functioning as the dominant. 

In Ab minor, the dominant V7 should be Eb7, but here we have Ab7, which is tonic. 

Unless it's a different key. 

If Emaj7/Ab is functioning as Ab7alt, then it's dominant for Db minor or major. 

Ab7 is V7 of Db. 

So in Db major or Db minor, Ab7 is the dominant V7. 

Let's try Db major. 

In Db major: 
- I: Db 
- ii: Ebm 
- iii: Fm 
- IV: Gb 
- V: Ab 
- vi: Bbm 
- vii°: C° 

Bbdim is vi, which is minor, not diminished. 

In Db minor (natural): 
- i: Dbm 
- ii°: Eb dim 
- III: Fbmaj 
- iv: Gbm 
- v: Abm 
- VI: Bbbmaj (A) 
- VII: Cbmaj (B) 

Bbdim is not diatonic. 

In Db harmonic minor, the chords are: 
- i: Dbm 
- ii°: Eb dim 
- III+: Fb aug 
- iv: Gbm 
- V: Ab 
- VI: Bbb 
- vii°: C° or C#° 

Still, Bbdim doesn't fit. 

Bbdim would be the ii° chord in Ab major, as we said earlier. 

Back to Ab major: 
- ii°: Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb) 

And "Gb/Bb" is Gb major, which is the bVII in Ab major (since VII in major is G, not Gb; bVII is Gb). 

So in Ab major, we have ii° and bVII, which is a common blues or mixolydian thing. 

But then "Dbm/Ab" — Db minor over Ab bass. Db minor is not diatonic to Ab major; IV is Db major. 

So Dbm suggests minor iv, which is characteristic of natural minor or dorian. 

So perhaps the mode is Dorian. 

Dorian mode on Ab: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb 

So: 
- i: Abm 
- ii: Bbm 
- III: Cbmaj 
- IV: Dbm 
- v: Ebm 
- VI: Gbmaj 
- VII: Abmaj 

Bbdim is not there; it should be Bbm. 

Unless the ii chord is made dominant, but it's written as dim. 

In Dorian, the ii chord is minor, not diminished. 

But in some contexts, it could be altered. 

Another idea: the Bbdim is functioning as a secondary dominant. For example, it could be the vii° of Ab, but as we said, vii° of Ab is G#°. 

Perhaps it's the common tone diminished for the tonic. 

Let's look at the most frequent bass note: Bb. The progression spends most time on Bb with variations. 

The exceptions are when it goes to Ab bass for "Dbm/Ab" and "Emaj7/Ab". 

"Dbm/Ab" has Ab bass, and "Emaj7/Ab" has Ab bass, and they are both over Ab. 

So perhaps the tonic is Ab, and the Bbdim is a passing chord to Gb, but then it returns. 

The structure: 
- Long stretches of Bbdim and Gb/Bb (which is Bb7#11)
- Then to Dbm/Ab (iv)
- Then to "B/Bb" (which we'll assume is Bb7b9)
- Back to Bbdim

" Emaj7/Ab" at the end with Bbdim.

"Emaj7/Ab" is Ab7alt, as we said, which is V7 of Db.

But in the sequence, it's "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb ..." and ends with "Emaj7/Ab Bbdim" — so after Emaj7/Ab, it goes to Bbdim, not to Db.

So it doesn't resolve.

This suggests that Ab is not the tonic; perhaps the tonic is Db.

Let's try Db major.

Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db

Chords:
- I: Db
- ii: Ebm
- iii: Fm
- IV: Gb
- V: Ab
- vi: Bbm
- vii°: C°

Bbdim is vi, which is minor, not diminished. But "Bbdim" is written, so it might be Bbm, but it's labeled dim, which is unusual.

In jazz, "dim" might be a mistake for "m" or something.

Perhaps "Bbdim" is meant to be Bbm7b5, which is half-diminished, often notated as "BØ" or "Bm7b5", but sometimes "Bbdim" is misused.

In Db major, the ii chord is Ebm7, and vi is Bbm7.

Bbm7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab.

Bbdim7 would be Bb-Db-E-G, which is different.

Bbm7b5 is Bb-Db-Fb-Ab = Bb-Db-Eb-Ab, which is not diminished.

So not matching.

Another possibility: the key is Gb major with a modal interchange.

Gb major: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb

Chords:
- I: Gb
- ii: Abm
- iii: Bbm
- IV: Cb (B)
- V: Db
- vi: Ebm
- vii°: F°

Bbdim is iii, which should be Bbm, not dim.

Same issue.

Perhaps the "dim" is misnotated, and it's actually the minor chord.

But the user wrote "dim", so we should respect that.

Let's look at the last part: "Emaj7/Ab Bbdim"

If Emaj7/Ab is Ab7alt, and Bbdim is the ii° of Ab, then it could be: Ab7alt (V7 of Db) resolving to Db, but it goes to Bbdim, which is not Db.

Unless it's a deceptive resolution, but Bbdim is ii° of Ab, which is not related.

Standard: Ab7 (V7 of Db) resolves to Db.

But here it goes to Bbdim, which has no Db in it; Bbdim7 is Bb-Db-E-G, so it has Db, which is the root of Db major.

Yes! Bbdim7 contains Db (as the minor third).

So Ab7 to Bbdim7 to Db: 
- Ab7: Ab-C-Eb-Gb
- Bbdim7: Bb-Db-E-G
- Db: Db-F-Ab

Common notes: 
- Eb (from Ab7) to E (in Bbdim7) is enharmonic, but not the same pitch class.
- Gb (from Ab7) to G (in Bbdim7) is minor second.

Resolution:
- C (3rd of Ab7) resolves to Db (in Bbdim7)
- Eb (5th) resolves to E (in Bbdim7)
- Gb (7th) resolves to G (in Bbdim7)
- Ab (root) may stay as Bb or move.

Then Bbdim7 resolves to Db:
- Bb resolves to Ab or Db
- Db stays
- E resolves to Eb (in Db, but Db major has F, not Eb; Db major is Db-F-Ab)
- G resolves to F (3rd of Db)

Yes: E->Eb? But Db major has F natural, not Eb. 

Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G
Db major: Db, F, Ab

So:
- Bb -> Ab (down minor second)
- E -> F (up minor second)
- G -> F? But F is already there, or G->Ab

Standard resolution: 
- The 7th of the dominant (Gb for Ab7) resolves down to F for Db.
- But here it's going through Bbdim7.

In jazz, there's a common ii°-V-i progression in minor, but here it's Ab7 to Bbdim7 to Db.

Bbdim7 can be seen as the ii° of Ab, but for Db, it's different.

For Db major, the ii chord is Ebm7, not Bbdim.

Harmonic minor of Db: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C, Db

So the dominant V is Ab7 (Ab-C-Eb-Gb), and the ii° is Eb dim (Eb-Gb-Bbb-Db).

Bbdim is not involved.

Perhaps the key is Ab minor, and the progression is using both natural and harmonic minor.

In Ab natural minor, we have:
- ii°: Bbdim
- iv: Dbm
- VII: Gbmaj

And the progression makes sense: 
- Bbdim (ii°) 
- Gb/Bb (VII in first inversion? But Gb/Bb is Gb major with Bb bass, which is third inversion if we consider Gb as root, but usually written as Gb/Bb for bass movement)

The sequence: 
"Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb" — this could be oscillating between ii° and VII.

Then "Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab" — from ii° to iv.

Then "B/Bb" — which might be the V chord. In Ab minor, the V chord in harmonic minor is Eb major.

Eb major over Bb bass? "B/Bb" doesn't suggest Eb.

Unless "B/Bb" is "Eb/Bb" — Eb major over Bb bass. Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, over Bb: Bb, Eb, G, Bb. So it's Bb7sus4.

Yes! And in Ab minor, Eb is V, so V in second inversion or something.

Then "Bbdim Bbdim" — back to ii°.

Then repeats.

Then "Emaj7/Ab" — which as we said, is Ab7alt, but if we're in Ab minor, Ab is i, so Ab7alt would be the tonic minor with altered dom, but usually not.

"Emaj7/Ab" = Ab7#9, which is a dominant chord, but for what? If it's the dominant of Db, but we're in Ab.

Perhaps it's the tritone substitution for the dominant.

In Ab minor, the dominant is Eb7. Tritone sub of Eb7 is A7.

A7 is A-C#-E-G. 

"Emaj7/Ab" has Ab, E, G#, B, D# — which is Ab, E, Ab, B, Eb. So Ab, B, E, Eb.

A7 would be A-C#-E-G.

Not the same.

Enharmonically, A7: A, C#, E, G
Emaj7/Ab: Ab, B, E, Eb

Completely different.

But Eb in there — Eb is the minor 7th of Ab, so it's part of the scale.

Perhaps "Emaj7/Ab" is meant to be the tonic chord, but Emaj7 is not Ab minor.

Another idea: the "Emaj7/Ab" is actually C#m6/Ab or something, but let's spell it out.

Chord: E major 7th = E, G#, B, D#
Bass: Ab = G#

So pitches: G# (bass), E, G#, B, D# 
-> E, G#, B, D#, G# 
So distinct pitches: E, G#, B, D#

G# is repeated.

So it's an E major 7th chord with G# in bass, which is G# half-diminished 7th? G# half-dim is G#-B-D#-F#, but here we have E, which is not F#.

E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#.

So notes: G# (bass), E, B, D#.

Intervals:
- G# to E: minor 6th (G#-A-B-C-D-E, so minor 6th)
- G# to B: minor 3rd (G#-A-B)
- G# to D#: augmented 4th (G#-A-B-C-D) but D# is enharmonic to Eb, so G# to Eb is diminished 5th)

So it's an augmented 6th chord or something.

Specifically, G#-E-B-D# = G#-B-D#-E

G# to B is minor 3rd, B to D# is major 3rd, D# to E is minor 2nd, not characteristic.

This chord is enharmonically equivalent to a French augmented 6th chord or something.

Italian sixth: G#-B-E, but here we have D# as well.

Perhaps it's functioning as a dominant for D minor.

D minor: D-F-A

Ab7 is V of Db, but D is not Db.

D is enharmonic to C#, but not the same.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is D minor.

D minor scale: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C

Chords:
- i: Dm
- ii°: Edim
- III: F
- iv: Gm
- v: Am
- VI: Bb
- VII: C

Bbdim is not diatonic; for D minor, ii° is Edim.

Bbdim would be the VI degree, but major.

Not matching.

The chord Bbdim7 = Bb-Db-E-G

In D minor, what could it be? 
- If we consider it as the bVII dim, but bVII in minor is major (C for D minor).

This is not working.

Let's try to see the overall tonality.

The bass line: mostly Bb, with two occurrences of Ab.

The chords on Bb: Bbdim, Gb/Bb (which is Gb with Bb bass), B/Bb (assumed Bb7b9), so all imply Bb as the tonic or dominant.

The chords on Ab: Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, so Ab as tonic or dominant.

The final chord is Bbdim after Emaj7/Ab.

Perhaps the tonic is Bb minor.

Let's check Bb minor.

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb

Chords:
- i: Bbm
- ii°: C°
- III: Db
- iv: Ebm
- v: Fm
- VI: Gb
- VII: Ab

Bbdim is i? But i is minor, not diminished.

Bbdim would not be diatonic.

In Bb harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb

Chords:
- i: Bbm(maj7)? Usually minor
- ii°: C°
- III+: Db aug
- iv: Ebm
- V: F major
- VI: Gb
- vii°: Adim

Bbdim is not there.

Bbdim could be the vii° if we consider a different root, but for Bb, vii° is Adim.

So not matching.

Unless the "Bbdim" is misinterpreted.

Perhaps "Bbdim" is the chord symbol, but it's actually the tonic chord in half-diminished or something.

Another idea: the progression is in Ab major, and the Bbdim is the ii° chord, which is common.

Then "Gb/Bb" is the bVII chord (Gb major), which is borrowed from the parallel minor (Ab minor).

In Ab major, bVII is Gb major.

Then "Dbm/Ab" is the iv chord from minor (Db minor), again from parallel minor.

"B/Bb" might be the V7 of something, but in Ab major, V7 is Eb7.

If "B/Bb" is "E/Bb" for Eb7, then it makes sense.

E/Bb would be Eb7: Eb-G-Bb-Db over Bb bass — so Bb, Eb, G, Bb, Db. Which is Bb with extensions, but usually written as Bb7/Eb or something, but in jazz, it's common to write slash chords for bass notes.

So "E/Bb" means Eb major over Bb bass, which is Bb7sus.

Yes! Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, so over Bb bass, it's Bb-Eb-G-Bb, which is Bb11 or Bb7sus.

And in Ab major, Eb7 is the dominant V7.

Then "Emaj7/Ab" — E major 7th over Ab bass. E major is E-G#-B-D#, over Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

As before, this is Ab7#9 if we take the notes as Ab, B, D#, E, but D# is Eb, so Ab, B, Eb, E.

E and Eb clash.

Notes: Ab, E, G#(Ab), B, D#(Eb) 
So Ab, E, B, Eb

As Ab7#9: Ab-C-Eb-Gb-B, but here we have E instead of C.

So it's Ab7#9 with #11 (E natural), so Ab7#9#11.

Which is a dominant chord for Db.

But in the sequence, after that, it goes to Bbdim, not to Db.

Unless the final Bbdim is meant to be the resolve, but it doesn't.

Perhaps the progression is not ending, or it's a loop.

Given the prevalence of Bb in the bass, and the harmonic minor clues, let's assume the key is Ab minor.

The progression:
- Bbdim: ii° 
- Gb/Bb: VII in third inversion (since Gb/Bb has Bb as fifth)
- Dbm/Ab: iv in first inversion (Dbm/Ab means Ab in bass, so first inversion of Dbm)
- "B/Bb" : likely Eb/Bb for V (Eb major) in second inversion
- Emaj7/Ab: this is trickier. In Ab minor, the tonic is Abm, but Emaj7/Ab is not diatonic. However, Emaj7 = E-G#-B-D#, and G# is Ab, so it's Ab, E, B, Eb as before.

In Ab minor, the natural 7th is Gb, but here we have G# (Ab), which is the natural minor 7th? No, in minor, 7th is whole tone.

Perhaps it's the major V chord or something.

Another possibility: "Emaj7/Ab" is an Abm6 chord misnotated.

Abm6 = Ab-Cb-Eb-F
But E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#, which is not related.

Unless enharmonic: E = Eb, but not.

Let's calculate the notes of Emaj7/Ab:
- Bass: Ab
- Chord: E, G#, B, D# 
- So pitches: Ab, E, Ab, B, Eb (since G# = Ab, D# = Eb)
- Distinct: Ab, B, E, Eb

Ab, B, Eb, E.

Eb and E are a minor second apart — very dissonant.

In practice, this is often interpreted as Cb7#9 or something, but let's see intervals from Ab:
- Ab to B: major 3rd
- Ab to Eb: perfect 5th
- Ab to E: augmented 5th

So it's Ab dominant 7 #9: Ab (root), C (3rd), Eb (5th), Gb (7th), B ( #9)

Here we have B ( #9), and E ( #11) instead of C and Gb.

So it has the #9 and #11, but not the 3rd or 7th.

In jazz, this is common; the chord is implied, and the 3rd/7th may be omitted in the symbol.

So "Emaj7/Ab" is likely a slash chord indicating an Ab7#9#11 sound, with E providing the #11 and #9.

Functionally, it's V7 of Db.

But since it doesn't resolve to Db, and goes to Bbdim, perhaps the intended resolution is to Db, but it's cut off, or in the context, Bbdim is leading to Db.

Bbdim7 to Db: Bbdim7 has Db in it, so it can resolve to Db.

Yes: Bbdim7 (root Bb) resolves to Db (a minor third up).

And for Ab7 to its tonic Db, the standard is Ab7 to Db.

So the sequence "Ab7alt Bbdim" could be Ab7 -> Bbdim7 -> Db, but the Db is not written.

However, in the user's sequence, it ends with "Emaj7/Ab Bbdim", so perhaps the next chord would be Db, but it's not here.

Given that, the key might be Db major.

Let's confirm with the beginning.

In Db major:
- I: Db
- ii: Ebm
- iii: Fm
- IV: Gb
- V: Ab
- vi: Bbm
- vii°: C°

" Bbdim" — if it's Bbdim, this is not vi minor, but if it's Bbm, it would be vi.

Perhaps "dim" is a mistake for "m".

In many transcriptions, "dim" might be used incorrectly for half-diminished or minor.

But the user wrote "dim", so we should assume it's diminished.

Another possibility: the mode is harmonic minor of Db.

Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C, Db

Chords:
- i: Dbm
- ii°: Eb dim
- III+: F aug
- iv: Gbm
- V: Ab
- VI: Bbb
- vii°: C dim

Bbdim is not here. Bb is not in the scale.

Scale degrees: 1.Db, 2.Eb, 3.F, 4.Gb, 5.Ab, 6.Bbb (A), 7.C

So Bb would be between A and C, not a scale degree.

Closest is Bbb (A) for degree 6.

So not matching.

Let's try A# minor, but that's impractical.

Perhaps it's C# minor.

C# minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#

ii°: D#° = D#, F#, A

But our chord is Bbdim, which is Bb-Db-E.

Bb is not in C# minor.

This is not working.

Let's list all the chord roots as seen in the slash notation:

- Bbdim: root Bb
- Gb/Bb: root Gb
- Dbm/Ab: root Db (with Ab bass)
- B/Bb: root B (bass Bb)
- Emaj7/Ab: root E (bass Ab)

So root movement: Bb - Gb - Db - B - E

Gb to Db is perfect 4th down, Db to B is minor 3rd up? Db to B is augmented 2nd (Db-D-Eb-E-F#-G-Ab-A-B? Better: Db to B is: Db-D-Eb-E-F-G-Ab-A-B, so major 6th up, or minor 3rd down enharmonically.

Actually, the root sequence in context: 

The progression has sections where it's two Bbdim, two Gb/Bb, two Bbdim, then Dbm/Ab (one), then B/Bb (one), then two Bbdim, two Gb/Bb, two Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab (one), then Bbdim.

So the distinct chords are:
- Bbdim
- Gb/Bb
- Dbm/Ab
- B/Bb (assumed)
- Emaj7/Ab

Roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E

Notice that Bb, Gb, Db are all minor thirds apart: Bb to Gb is minor third? Bb-A-Ab-Gb, so minor third down.

Gb to Db is perfect 4th, not minor third.

Bb to Gb: Bb-G#-G-Gb? Bb to A is minor second, to Ab minor third. Gb is F#, so Bb to F# is augmented fourth, not minor third.

But in the circle of fifths, Bb, Gb, Db are the flat keys: Db major has 5 flats, Gb has 6, Cb has 7.

Bb is the dominant of Eb, etc.

The roots Bb, Gb, Db, B, E — let's see their pitch classes:

Bb = A#
Gb = F#
Db = C#
B = B
E = E

So: A#, F#, C#, B, E

This looks random.

Bb = 10, Gb = 6, Db = 1, B = 11, E = 4 (in MIDI pitch)

No clear pattern.

Perhaps the bass movement is key.

Bass notes: mostly Bb, with some Ab.

From the slash chords:
- Bbdim: likely Bb bass (since it's not specified otherwise, but "dim" chords may have root in bass)
- Gb/Bb: explicitly Bb bass
- Dbm/Ab: Ab bass
- B/Bb: Bb bass
- Emaj7/Ab: Ab bass

So bass line: 
Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Gb/Bb), Bb (Gb/Bb), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Bbdim), Ab (Dbm/Ab), Bb (B/Bb), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Gb/Bb), Bb (Gb/Bb), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Bbdim), Ab (Emaj7/Ab), Bb (Bbdim)

So mostly Bb, with Ab at position 7 and 15.

The only changes in bass are to Ab, and it returns to Bb.

So the tonic is likely Bb, but what mode?

If it's Bb major, we have Bbdim which is not diatonic.

If it's Bb minor, same issue.

Unless it's a mode where the ii chord is diminished.

The only major or minor mode where ii is diminished is the natural minor.

In natural minor, ii is diminished.

So for the key to have a diminished ii chord, it must be minor.

So if ii° is Bbdim, then:
ii° = Bb dim
So the tonic is the note where Bb is the second degree.

In natural minor, 2nd degree is the supertonic.

So if supertonic is Bb, then the tonic is Ab (since in minor, 1 to 2 is whole step: Ab to Bb).

Yes! 
- Tonic: Ab
- Supertonic: Bb

So key: Ab minor.

Now, verify the other chords:
- Gb/Bb: Gb major. In Ab minor, Gb is the 7th degree, so VII major.
- Dbm/Ab: Db minor. In Ab minor, Db is the 4th degree, so iv minor.
- "B/Bb": if this is Eb/Bb, then Eb is the 5th degree, so V major or v minor. In natural minor, v is minor, but in harmonic minor, V is major. Given the context, it's likely V major (Eb major) as a harmonic minor inflection.
- Emaj7/Ab: this is problematic, but in Ab minor, the tonic is Abm. Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass and E major 7th, which includes G# (Ab), so it's enharmonically the tonic chord but with major 7th? Abm(maj7) is Ab-Cb-Eb-G, but here we have Ab, B, E, Eb — doesn't match.

However, "Emaj7/Ab" might be a misnotation for "Abmaj7" or something, but it's written as Emaj7/Ab.

Perhaps "Emaj7" is meant to indicate the #9 and #11, so it's Ab7#9#11, but in the context of the minor key, it could be the dominant chord itself.

But for Ab minor, the dominant is Eb, not Ab.

Unless it's the minor i chord with extensions, but Abm is not major 7th.

Another possibility: "Emaj7/Ab" is actually C#m7b5/Ab or something, but let's calculate.

Perhaps the "E" in "Emaj7" is a typo for "Ab" or "Eb".

Given that all other chords fit Ab minor except this one, and assuming it's a dominant chord for the key, but for minor, the dominant is V.

In the sequence, before the last Bbdim, we have "Emaj7/Ab", which is over Ab bass, so if Ab is the tonic, this should be the tonic chord, but it's not minor.

Unless it's the major VI chord or something.

In Ab minor, VI is Fbmaj (E major), so E major is the bVI chord, which is borrowed from parallel major.

bVI is common in minor keys for the Andalusian cadence or something.

For example: i - bVII - bVI - V

In Ab minor: Abm - Gbm - Fbm (E) - Ebm or Eb.

Here, "Emaj7/Ab" has Ab bass, so it's E major in first inversion? E major is E-G#-B, so over Ab: Ab, E, G#, B.

Which is the bVI chord (E major) in first inversion.

And in minor keys, bVI is common.

So "Emaj7/Ab" might be misnotated; it should be "E/Ab" for E major over Ab bass, but it's written as Emaj7/Ab because it's extended.

E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#, so with D# added, but in context, it might be simplified.

So in Ab minor:
- bVI: E major (or E major 7th)

And the progression ends with bVI before going to ii°.

The sequence has "Emaj7/Ab Bbdim" — bVI to ii°.

In minor keys, going from bVI to ii° is common, as in the Andalusian cadence: i - bVII - bVI - V, but here it's different.

A common progression might be bVI - ii° - V - i, but here it's bVI to ii°.

And ii° is Bbdim.

So it fits.

Now, check the problematic "B/Bb".

Between "Dbm/Ab" (iv) and "Bbdim" (ii°), we have "B/Bb".

In Ab minor, after iv, we might have bVI or V.

" B/Bb" with bass Bb, if the chord is B, it could be E/Bb for V.

Eb major over Bb bass.

As discussed, Eb major is E-G#-Bb, over Bb: Bb, Eb, G, Bb.

Which is Bb7sus4 — a common dominant sound.

So "B/Bb" is likely a typo for "E/Bb" (Eb major over Bb bass).

Similarly, in some notations, "B" might be misread for "E" if handwritten.

So assuming that, the progression in Ab minor:

- Bbdim: ii° 
- Gb/Bb: VII (in 3rd inversion)
- Dbm/Ab: iv (in 1st inversion)
- Eb/Bb: V (in 1st inversion? Eb/Bb would be second inversion if Eb is root, but Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, so over Bb bass: Bb, Eb, G — which is second inversion of Eb)

In chord symbols, Eb/Bb means Eb major with Bb in bass, so for Eb major, the bass is the fifth, so it's second inversion.

Yes.

- Emaj7/Ab: bVI (E major) in first inversion, with added 7th

And all chords are diatonic or common borrowings in Ab minor:
- ii°: diatonic (natural or harmonic minor)
- VII: diatonic (natural minor)
- iv: diatonic
- V: diatonic in harmonic minor
- bVI: borrowed from parallel major (Phrygian dominant or common minor progression)

The mode is natural minor for ii°, VII, iv; harmonic minor for V; and parallel major for bVI.

Overall, the tonic is Ab minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian) with inflections for harmonic minor (on V) and major (on bVI).

But the primary mode is natural minor, as ii° and VII are natural minor characteristics.

To confirm, let's see the scale:

Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

Notes used:
- Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb (E) — all in scale
- Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db — all in scale (VII chord)
- Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb, Ab — all in scale (iv chord)
- Eb/Bb: Eb, G, Bb — but G is not in natural minor; natural minor has Fb (E), not G. In natural minor, the leading tone is Gb, not G. So for V major, we need G natural, which is from harmonic minor.
- Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D# — E is Fb (in natural minor), but here it's E natural; G# is Ab; B is enharmonic to Cb in minor scales, but in Ab minor, B is not used; D# is Eb, which is in the scale.

So:
- E natural: not in natural minor (which has E natural? Ab natural minor has Eb as 5th? No:

Ab natural minor scale:
1. Ab
2. Bb
3. Cb (B)
4. Db
5. Eb
6. Fb (E)
7. Gb

So the 6th degree is Fb, which is E natural.

In notation:
- 6th scale degree: F flat, which is E natural.

So E natural is diatonic to Ab natural minor.

Then Emaj7: E major is E, G#, B, D# — but in Ab minor, the notes should be E (Fb), G (Ab), B (Cb), D (Eb).

G# is not G; G# is Ab, which is tonic.

G# = Ab, which is scale degree 1.

B natural = Cb enharmonically? In Ab minor, Cb is scale degree 3, but B natural is not Cb; Cb is B, so B natural is scale degree 3.

D# = Eb, scale degree 5.

So E major is: E, Ab, B, Eb.

Which is:
- E = 6th degree (Fb)
- Ab = 1st degree
- B = 3rd degree (Cb)
- Eb = 5th degree

So the chord is a triad on the 6th degree with added maj7 (Ab), but E major is not diatonic; in natural minor, the 6th degree triad is Fb major (E major), yes!

In Ab natural minor, the chord on the 6th degree (Fb) is Fb major: Fb-Ab-Cb.

Enharmonically, Fb = E, Cb = B, so E major: E-Ab-B? Ab is G#, so E-G#-B.

Yes! Fb major is E major enharmonically.

And in natural minor, it's a major chord on the flattened VI degree (since VI is flattened relative to harmonic minor).

In minor keys, the chord on 6th degree is major in natural minor.

So in Ab minor, bVI is E major.

And Emaj7 is E major 7th: E-G#-B-D#.

D# = Eb, which is the 5th degree of Ab minor.

So D# is Eb, which is diatonic.

Therefore, E major 7th is E-Ab-B-Eb.

Which has all notes diatonic to Ab natural minor scale.

Perfect!

So all chords fit within Ab natural minor:
- Bbdim: ii° = Bb-Db-Fb (Fb=E)
- Gb/Bb: VII = Gb-Bb-Db
- Dbm/Ab: iv = Db-Fb-Ab (in first inversion, Ab bass)
- "B/Bb": should be Eb/Bb for V = Eb-G-Bb (in second inversion, Bb bass) — and G is the leading tone from harmonic minor, but in natural minor it would be Gb. However, in practice, natural minor often uses the harmonic version for V.
- Emaj7/Ab: bVI in first inversion: E-Ab-B-Eb with Ab bass.

Additionally, the "B/Bb" is likely a typo for "E/Bb", as B and E can be confused in handwriting.

Given that, the key is Ab minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian), with a frequent use of harmonic minor inflection on the V chord (Eb major instead of Eb minor).

But since the V chord appears only once, and the ii° is present, natural minor is the base mode.

The progression: 
- ii° (Bbdim) 
- VII (Gb/Bb)
- (repeats)
- iv (Dbm/Ab)
- V (Eb/Bb) — with harmonic minor inflection
- ii° (Bbdim)
- bVI (Emaj7/Ab)

In Ab minor.

So the key is Ab minor.

To specify the mode: natural minor (Aeolian), with occasional harmonic minor alterations.


Based on the chord progression you provided—**Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**—I've analyzed the harmonic structure, common tonal functions, and contextual clues to determine the **key and mode**. Here's a step-by-step breakdown, followed by the conclusion:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Chord Symbols**
- **Bbdim**: This is a **B-flat diminished triad** (Bb-Db-E). In jazz/pop contexts, "dim" often implies a **fully diminished 7th chord** (Bb-Db-E-G), which is common. This chord is **enharmonically identical to E°7, G°7, or C°7** (all share the same pitch collection in equal temperament). Functionally, it often acts as a **common-tone diminished chord** or **secondary leading-tone chord**.
- **Gb/Bb**: G-flat major over Bb bass (Bb-Db-Gb). This functions as **VII in Ab minor** (see below), or as a **Bb7#11 extension** (Bb dominant 7th with #11).
- **Dbm/Ab**: D-flat minor over Ab bass (Ab-Db-Eb). This is **iv in Ab minor** (first inversion of Db minor).
- **B/Bb**: This is problematic. B major over Bb bass (Bb-B-D#) creates severe dissonance (minor 2nd between Bb and B). It's almost certainly a **typo for E/Bb** (Eb major over Bb bass, i.e., Bb-Ab-Eb-G), which functions as **V in Ab minor** (second inversion of Eb major). This is a common mistake in hand-written charts—**B** and **E** can be confused visually (e.g., if "E" was misread as "B").
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7th over Ab bass (Ab-E-G#-B-D#). Enharmonically, this is **Ab-B-Eb-Ab** (since G# = Ab and D# = Eb). It functions as **♭VI (major 7th) in first inversion** for Ab minor (bVI chord borrowed from parallel major).

---

### **Step 2: Key Signature and Diatonic Fit**
The progression centers around **Ab minor (Aeolian mode)** as the primary key. Here's why:

#### **Why Ab Minor?**
- **Bbdim is ii°**: In Ab natural minor (scale: **Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb**), the ii chord is Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb, where Fb = E). This is **diatonic to natural minor** and appears frequently (10x).
- **Gb/Bb is VII**: Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db) is the diatonic **VII chord** in Ab natural minor (7th scale degree chord).
- **Dbm/Ab is iv**: Db minor (Db-Fb-Ab) is the diatonic **iv chord** in Ab minor (4th scale degree minor chord), notated here in first inversion (Ab bass).
- **E/Bb (corrected from "B/Bb") is V**: Eb major (Eb-G-Bb) is the **harmonic minor inflection** of the V chord (in natural minor, v is minor; here G natural = leading tone to Ab). This is common in minor keys for cadential strength.
- **Emaj7/Ab is ♭VI**: E major 7th = E-G#-B-D# (enharmonic to **Fb-Ab-Bb-Eb**), which is **♭VI in Ab minor**. In natural minor, the chord on the 6th scale degree (Fb) is major, making this diatonic. The maj7 extension (Eb) is also diatonic (5th scale degree).

#### **Scale Validation (Ab Natural Minor)**
- Scale: **Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb** (enharmonically: **Ab-Bb-B-Db-Eb-E-Gb**)
- All chord tones fit this scale:
  - Bbdim (Bb-Db-E): E = Fb (6th degree)
  - Gb/Bb (Gb-Bb-Db): Gb = 7th, Bb = 2nd, Db = 4th
  - Dbm/Ab (Ab-Db-Eb): Ab = 1st, Db = 4th, Eb = 5th
  - E/Bb (Bb-Eb-G): G = leading tone (harmonic minor inflection; replaces Gb)
  - Emaj7/Ab (Ab-E-B-Eb): E = Fb (6th), B = Cb (3rd), Eb = 5th

> 💡 **Note on "B/Bb"**: The typo is critical. If it were truly "B/Bb," the chord would be dissonant and non-functional. **Correcting to E/Bb (Eb major)** makes it a perfect V chord in Ab minor, resolving strongly to i. This is a standard harmonic minor trope (e.g., in jazz/salsa minor progressions).

---

### **Step 3: Mode Determination**
- The progression **primarily uses Ab natural minor (Aeolian mode)**, as evidenced by:
  - Diatonic use of **ii° (Bbdim)**, **iv (Dbm)**, **VII (Gb)**, and **♭VI (Emaj7)**.
  - Natural minor's characteristic minor iv and major VII/♭VI chords (common in blues, folk, and rock).
- **Harmonic minor inflection** is present once: **V (Eb major)** replaces v (Eb minor) for cadential drive—this is typical in minor-key music but doesn't override the base mode.
- **No Dorian or Phrygian traits**: The iv is minor (not major for Dorian), and there's no major iv chord (which would indicate harmonic minor as the base mode).

**Conclusion: The mode is Natural Minor (Aeolian).**

---

### **Functional Analysis of the Progression**
Here's how the chords work in **Ab minor**:
```
Bbdim   Bbdim   Gb/Bb   Gb/Bb | Bbdim   Bbdim   Dbm/Ab  E/Bb | Bbdim   Bbdim   Gb/Bb   Gb/Bb | Bbdim   Bbdim   Emaj7/Ab Bbdim  
  ii°      ii°      VII      VII  |  ii°      ii°      iv      V   |  ii°      ii°      VII      VII  |  ii°      ii°      ♭VI      ii°  
```
- **Common-tone passing**: Bbdim (with Bb bass) acts as a chromatic passing chord between VII (Gb) and iv (Dbm), using shared tones (Bb, Db).
- **Harmonic minor cadence**: The **iv → V (Dbm → Eb)** implies a move toward i (Abm), though it cuts short. This is a strong minor-key cadence.
- **♭VI → ii°**: The **Emaj7/Ab → Bbdim** ending suggests an unresolved phrase, common in jazz/folk for modal ambiguity (♭VI is typical in minor, and ii° leads back to tonic).

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **Ab major?**  
  Bbdim is ii° in Ab major, but **Gb/Bb (VII)** and **Dbm/Ab (iv)** are non-diatonic (iv should be major in major keys). Dbm implies minor iv—a natural minor feature.
  
- **Gb minor or Db minor?**  
  Bbdim isn't diatonic to these keys (e.g., in Gb minor, ii° would be Ab°, not Bb°). Chord functions don't align.

- **Dorian mode?**  
  Dorian has a major iv chord (e.g., Db major in Ab Dorian), but here we have **Dbm/Ab** (minor iv).

- **Harmonic minor as base mode?**  
  Possible (V is major), but the frequent use of VII (Gb/Bb) and ♭VI (Emaj7/Ab) point to **natural minor as the foundation**. Harmonic minor would replace VII with vii° and omit ♭VI.

---

### **Final Answer**
- **Key: Ab minor**  
- **Mode: Natural Minor (Aeolian)**  

The progression is a **minor-key vamp with jazz/blues influences**, emphasizing:
- Natural minor diatonicism (ii°, iv, VII, ♭VI),
- A single harmonic minor inflection (V),
- Common-tone diminished chords (Bbdim) for chromatic movement.

This is typical of styles like jazz minor blues, flamenco (Andalusian cadence), or modal folk music. The typo in "B/Bb" (corrected to **E/Bb**) was the only obstacle—once fixed, all chords fit Ab natural minor perfectly. If you have audio or context confirming the bass movement, I can refine this further! 🎹
