Looking at this progression:

**Bbdim - Gb/Bb - Bbdim - Dbm/Ab - B/Bb - Bbdim - Gb/Bb - Bbdim - Emaj7/Ab - Bbdim**

Let me analyze this systematically:

## Primary Analysis

**Key: Gb Major (E♭ minor relative)**

**Mode: Gb Major with heavy emphasis on diminished harmony**

The progression is clearly centered around **B♭dim** (vii°7 of Gb Major), making Gb the tonic key.

## Key Evidence:

1. **B♭dim** = vii°7 of Gb Major (B♭-Db-Fb-Abb)
2. **Gb/Bb** = I6/3 in Gb Major (with pedal B♭)
3. **Dbm/Ab** = v6/4 in Gb Major (Ab-Cb-Db-F)
4. **Emaj7/Ab** = IV7/2 in Gb Major (Ab-Bb-Eb-Gb)
5. **B/B♭** = creates chromatic tension, likely functioning as vii°7/iii

## Harmonic Function Analysis:

- **B♭dim** acts as the dominant substitute (vii°7)
- **Gb/Bb** provides tonic stability with pedal point
- **Dbm/Ab** suggests subdominant area
- **Emaj7/Ab** is a IV7 with bass suspension
- **B/B♭** creates chromatic passing motion

## Conclusion:

This is **Gb Major** with a highly chromatic, jazz-influenced approach that uses **B♭dim** (vii°7) as the primary harmonic anchor rather than traditional V-I progressions. The mode is simply **Gb Major/Ionian**, but the harmonic language is sophisticated with extensive use of:
- Diminished chords as primary harmony
- Pedal points (Bb in bass)
- Slash chords creating contrapuntal motion
- Chromatic voice leading

The overall effect creates a floating, unresolved quality typical of modern jazz reharmonization.
