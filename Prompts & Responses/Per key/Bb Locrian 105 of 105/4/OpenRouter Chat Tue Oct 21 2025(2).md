### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord symbols**

I need to analyze a sequence of chord symbols: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim." It's likely a jazz or pop chord vamp with slash chords. 

Bbdim refers to a B-flat diminished triad, and I might assume it’s a triad rather than a seventh. The Gb/Bb chord indicates a first inversion Gb major triad, with Bb as the bass note. I think I'm on the right track here!**Exploring key possibilities**

I'm considering a few key possibilities. The Db major key could include a Gb major IV chord, or I might think of it as the key of Gb major with a first inversion I chord.

Now, for the Dbm/Ab chord, this D-flat minor over Ab could be tricky, as Db minor is enharmonic to C# minor. In keys with flats, Db minor becomes less common. The chord tones give me Ab, Db, and Fb (or E). This is close to an Ab7sus4b9 but might function as a iv minor in Ab.

Lastly, for B/Bb, I see a B major chord over Bb. This gives Bb as the bass with chord tones B, D#, and F#. It has a bit of a tritone feel to it!**Examining chord complexities**

Starting with Bb in the bass is interesting because D# is enharmonically E. So I have the notes Bb, B, D#, and F#. It’s definitely complex!

Then for the Emaj7/Ab chord, I'm thinking of it as an Emaj7 over an Ab bass. This gives me Ab, E, G#, B, and D#. Essentially, it combines an Ab major triad with an E major triad, possibly leading to an Ab13(#11) without a third. 

Analyzing Ab's dominant scale brings up relationships with G# and Ab, which feels a bit confusing since they’re enharmonically the same, though G# seems to complicate the chord.**Analyzing Emaj7 and chord relationships**

The Emaj7 chord includes G#, which is enharmonically Ab. This creates a bit of duplication with the bass note. If I look at the chord tones relative to Ab, the root is G# (Ab), and I might consider the major seventh too. 

It's interesting to rewrite Emaj7 as E, G#, B, D#. From Ab up to E is a major sixth. Since Ab to E is six semitones apart, that feels messy to analyze. 

Focusing on polychord color, I notice the toggling between Bbdim and Gb/Bb suggests a key center of Gb major or its relative minor, Eb minor. Interestingly, Bbdim functions as the leading-tone diminished triad related to C, so maybe Bbdim resolves nicely in function! But where does Bbdim typically fit? I'm still trying to connect those dots!**Clarifying chord progression**

I realize that Emaj7 is enharmonically the same as Fbmaj7. In the progression, I see it toggling between vii° - V6 - vii° - ii6 4 - I6 and culminating on IVmaj7/5 before returning to vii°. It feels unresolved as it doesn't land on the tonic, which is typical for an intro vamp.

So, for a succinct answer, I could say the key is Cb major (enharmonically B major), using both names. All chords are diatonic to Cb major: Bbdim (vii°), Gb/Bb (V6), Dbm/Ab (ii6 4), B/Bb (I6), Emaj7/Ab (IVmaj7/5). The bass moves Bb to Ab as a 7-6 neighbor over a pedal. The consistent presence of Bbdim suggests the key center is Cb/B. If someone prefers sharps, they can think of it as B major for the related chords. Let's finalize this!

Key: Cb major (enharmonic to B major)
Mode: Ionian (major)

Why: Every chord is diatonic to Cb major:
- Bbdim = vii°
- Gb/Bb = V6
- Dbm/Ab = ii6/4
- B/Bb (i.e., Cb/Bb) = I6
- Emaj7/Ab (i.e., Fbmaj7/Ab) = IVmaj7/5

Enharmonic in B major (if you prefer sharps):
A#dim – F#/A# – C#m/G# – B/A# – Emaj7/G#.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chords and tonal center**

I need to figure out the key and mode from a sequence of slash and diminished chords. The sequence includes Bbdim, Gb/Bb, and Dbm/Ab. I want to find the tonal center. 

Starting with Bbdim, its notes are Bb, Db, and Fb (which is E natural enharmonically). This diminished triad is significant in identifying the leading tone. 

Then, for Gb/Bb, it's a first inversion Gb major triad over Bb. I’m considering how these chords relate to the overall harmony.**Examining chord relationships**

I’m analyzing Gbmaj/Bb and Dbm/Ab. The Dbm/Ab chord puts a Db minor triad (Db, Fb, Ab) over an Ab bass. I initially got confused with the Ab minor triad. 

Ab, Db, and Fb create a different sound than just Ab minor; it’s more of a sus4 b6 situation. But to simplify, it's still Dbm/Ab. I’m considering if we’re in the key of Gb major. The Gb major scale contains Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F, which might fit here.**Analyzing chord function in Gb major**

I'm examining the chords in the key of Gb major. Starting with the triads, I see:

- I: Gb
- ii: Abm
- iii: Bbm
- IV: Cb
- V: Db
- vi: Ebm
- vii°: Fdim

Bbdim corresponds to the iii chord, Bbm, not diminished. I realize that Bbdim can serve as the vii° to Cb. However, I mistakenly thought the leading tone to Cb is Bb; it's actually Bbb. 

Shifting to Ab minor reveals its structure, where Bbdim serves as ii°. It gives me a clearer picture!**Exploring chord relationships and minors**

Okay, Bbdim plays the role of ii° in Ab minor. I realize Gb major is the relative major of Eb minor, while Cb major is the relative major of Ab minor. 

Now, for the chords: 

- Gb/Bb is a first inversion Gb major over Bb, fitting as a VII in the Ab minor scale.
  
- Then, Dbm/Ab serves as a iv chord over Ab bass, and yes, it's in second inversion.

- Lastly, B/Bb presents a B major triad over Bb bass, which feels off since Bb is essentially A#. This definitely raises some questions!**Clarifying chord relationships and tonal centers**

Okay, I'm unpacking the chord progressions. B/Bb suggests a B major triad over Bb, which feels unusual. It might be more accurate to think of it as Cb/Bb, making it a Cb major triad over Bb. This could represent a leading-tone chord in Ab minor.

As for Emaj7, I realize it can be respelled as Fbmaj7, fitting as the VI chord in Ab minor. 

I'm seeing I have a sequence that fits well within the Ab natural minor key, with some enharmonic spellings to clarify. The tonal center is Ab, operating in the Aeolian mode.**Understanding Cb major and B major chords**

I’m analyzing the Cb major scale, which has seven flats: Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, and Bb. The seventh degree is Bb, and it serves as a leading tone to Cb. In this context, Bbdim is both vii° in Cb major and ii° in Ab minor. 

When looking at the chord progression, it fits well within Cb major, with chords like Bbdim, Gb/Bb, and Dbm/Ab all appearing consistently. Interestingly, these chords can also be enharmonically interpreted in B major, which also makes sense due to the corresponding chord relationships. It seems the underlying key is primarily major based on the presence of IVmaj7 and Imaj7 chords.**Determining key and mode**

In Ab natural minor, the ii chord is Bbdim, and the expected V chord would be Eb minor, but here we have Gb/Bb (VII6). This could still allow for an Aeolian context. In both Ab Aeolian and Cb major, major seventh chords are fit well.

When reviewing the bass progression alternating between Bb and Ab, it suggests a pedal tone. With repeated Bbdim, there's a leading tendency toward Cb, but the tonic is never explicitly stated. Based on the strong dominant prolongation local to major, I’d conclude the key is Cb major (Ionian mode) or enharmonically B major.

Key: C♭ major (Ionian). Enharmonic: B major.

Rationale (diatonic functions in C♭ major):
- B♭dim = vii°
- G♭/B♭ = V6
- D♭m/A♭ = ii6/4
- B/B♭ ≈ C♭/B♭ = Imaj7/7
- Emaj7/A♭ ≈ F♭maj7/A♭ = IVmaj7/3

So the mode is Ionian (major), centered on C♭ (enharmonically B).

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord structure**

I’m looking into minor key descending bass line patterns, and it seems like Ab natural minor is a strong candidate. The mode I'm considering is Aeolian, not harmonic minor, since there's no leading tone with G natural. Instead, I see Fb, and repeated Bbdim chords are diatonic ii° in natural minor. Checking my chords: Bbdim is ii° in Ab natural minor, and Gb/Bb represents a first inversion of Gb.**Reviewing chord functions**

I’m analyzing some chords and starting with Dbm/Ab, which is a iv 6/4 chord—a possible cadential 6/4. Then, I see B/Bb (Cb/Bb) that represents III over the supertonic in the bass, but it gets tricky. Cb has Bb in the bass, making it a third inversion. Though, it's a bit like a passing bass note rather than strictly diatonic. I also respell Emaj7/Ab to Fbmaj7/Ab, confirming everything is diatonic to Ab natural minor.**Examining chord sequences**

I'm counting through a sequence of chords like Bbdim and Gb/Bb, and I feel strongly that it’s rooted in Ab Aeolian. But could it fit in Gb major? Testing the Gb major scale reveals that Bbdim uses Fb (E natural), which isn't part of Gb major—there’s an F natural there. Since Bbdim includes Fb, it seems it's not diatonic to Gb major. Then I consider Ab Dorian, but it raises the sixth chord to F natural, while I have Fb occurrences in Bbdim.**Determining the key and mode**

I’ve ruled out Dorian for this piece and considered Ab Phrygian, but it would require a Bbb, which isn’t present. Looking at Ab harmonic minor would suggest using G natural as the leading tone, yet I see Gb in the Gb/Bb chords. This leads me to confirm that it’s in Ab minor with an Aeolian mode. Although there’s an interesting focus on Bbdim, I notice no explicit Abm chord. 

To summarize, the key is Ab minor (enharmonically G# minor), with an Aeolian mode rather than harmonic.**Confirming the key and chords**

I realize the chords spellings indicate Dbm, not C#m, so I’ll stick to Ab minor as the key. Therefore, the key is Ab natural minor with an Aeolian mode. Justifying this, all chords fit Ab Aeolian: Bbdim is ii°, Gb is VII, Dbm is iv, and Emaj7 can be seen as Fbmaj7 (VImaj7). Since no raised leading tone is present, I can mention that Emaj7/Ab is enharmonic to Fbmaj7/Ab. My final answer summarizes the key center as Ab with an Aeolian mode and notes for mapping.

Key: A-flat minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Why:
- Bbdim = ii° in Ab minor (Bb–Db–Fb)
- Gb/Bb = VII6
- Dbm/Ab = iv6/4
- B/Bb is enharmonic to Cb/Bb (III over 2)
- Emaj7/Ab is enharmonic to Fbmaj7/Ab (VImaj7 over 1)
No raised leading tone (G♮) appears, so it’s natural minor rather than harmonic/melodic.

**Key: A♭ minor**

**Mode: Minor (primarily Aeolian with harmonic minor elements)**

### Explanation
This chord progression is chromatic and non-diatonic at times but centers around A♭ minor as the most fitting tonal center. Here's the reasoning:

- **Overall Structure and Tonic Implication**:
  - The bass is predominantly A♭ (from slash chords like D♭m/A♭ and Emaj7/A♭) and B♭ (from non-slash and most slash chords), creating a pedal-like foundation. A♭ feels like the tonic (i), with B♭ acting as bII (a common Neapolitan or modal mixture inflection in minor keys).
  - The progression repeats in a vamp-like pattern, emphasizing tension and release toward A♭-rooted harmony. The insertions at D♭m/A♭ and Emaj7/A♭ reinforce A♭ as home, while Emaj7/A♭ (notes: A♭, B, E♭, E) functions like an altered i6 chord (with ♭6/♮6 tension).

- **Chord Analysis in A♭ Minor Context** (Aeolian Scale: A♭ B♭ B D♭ E♭ E G♭)**:
  - **B♭dim**: B♭ D♭ E (enharmonic: B♭ D♭ F♭). Fits as a bII° (diminished on bII, common for tension in minor keys). All notes (B♭, D♭, E=♭6/F♭) are diatonic to Aeolian.
  - **G♭/B♭**: G♭ major (G♭ B♭ D♭) over B♭ bass. G♭maj is bVII (diatonic in Aeolian), functioning as a modal mixture chord (subdominant pull). Notes (G♭, B♭, D♭) are fully Aeolian.
  - **D♭m/A♭**: D♭ minor (D♭ E A♭) over A♭ bass. This is iv in inversion (notes: A♭ D♭ E). Diatonic to Aeolian (D♭=IV, E=♭6); acts as a subdominant resolution to i.
  - **B/B♭**: B major (B E♭ G) over B♭ bass. Requires the ♮7 (G natural) from **harmonic minor** (A♭ B♭ B D♭ E♭ E G). Functions like a ♭II or altered V/vi (Neapolitan inflection with leading-tone G resolving tension). Notes (B, E♭, G) fit harmonic minor; the B♭ bass adds color.
  - **Emaj7/A♭**: E major7 (E G♯ B D♯ = E A♭ B E♭) over A♭ bass. Diatonic to Aeolian/harmonic minor (E=♭6, A♭=i root, B=b3, E♭=5). Acts as an i(add ♭6/♮6, maj7) or altered tonic extension, with chromatic tension from E/E♭.

- **Mode Details**:
  - **Primary: Aeolian (Natural Minor)** – Most chords (B♭dim, G♭/B♭, D♭m/A♭) fit strictly without alteration. The ♭6 (E) and ♭7 (G♭) are key fingerprints.
  - **Harmonic Elements**: The B/B♭ chord introduces the raised 7th (G natural) for leading-tone function, borrowing from harmonic minor. No full V chord (E♭maj) appears, but this mixture is common in jazz/pop progressions for color without shifting mode.
  - Not Dorian (lacks ♮6/F natural) or Phrygian (no ♭2 emphasis). Mixolydian was considered (for G♭maj as bVII) but doesn't account for the minor tonic feel or E/E♭ ♭6.

This progression has a moody, jazzy/bossa-nova vibe (possibly evoking standards like those in the Real Book), with the repetition building suspense around A♭ minor. If this is from a specific song or transcription, more context could refine it further!

### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Progression**

\n\n

I'm now carefully examining the user's provided chord progression. My primary goal is to decipher its structure, identifying the key shifts and any unusual harmonic movements. I will thoroughly deconstruct it note by note and chord by chord. I will be looking out for any unexpected turns of phrase, too.


**Unpacking the Chords**

\n\n

I've detailed the individual chords. Next, I'll assess the relationships between the chords to determine the key and any potential modulations. The B/Bb chord remains a puzzle. I'll need to explore how it functions within the sequence and consider its potential as a pivot chord or a borrowed chord.


**Refining the Theory**

\n\n

My current thinking is focused on verifying the key, with the Bb minor hypothesis leading the charge. I'm cross-referencing the chords against the Bb minor scales (natural, harmonic, melodic) to confirm their compatibility. Now I am using the process of elimination. The B/Bb chord is problematic, as is the Emaj7/Ab.


**Testing Key Options**

\n\n

My investigation continues, and I'm currently assessing the suitability of Gb major as a potential key. I am checking the function of each chord within a Gb major framework. Also, I'm analyzing the relationships between the chords. But I can't overlook the `Bb` pedal tone and will incorporate it into my evaluation. Hypothesis B doesn't look promising, as I was hoping.


**Evaluating Alternative Options**

\n\n

My current thinking pivots to the B major key as a viable alternative, though the prevalence of the Bb pedal still demands attention. I will carefully consider the relationship of Emaj7/Ab to the Bbdim, viewing it as a passing chord. I will also examine the potential of a temporary modulation. My aim is to unveil the underlying logic.


**Reflecting on Options**

\n\n

My current thinking is focused on synthesizing the analysis. The Bb pedal establishes the tonal center, and I've identified the prevalence of minor and diminished elements. A definitive key proves elusive. I'm now exploring the idea of a minor-leaning, modal center with chromatic elements. This allows the Emaj7/Ab to function more freely.


**Re-evaluating the Framework**

\n\n

My current thinking is focused on synthesizing the analysis. The core tonal center is undeniably Bb, with a strong minor and diminished character. I'm exploring the function of `B/Bb` as an altered chord within this framework. Also, I'm considering a modal approach centered on Bb, allowing for chromaticism. This explains the function of `Emaj7/Ab` and resolves my previous concerns.


**Evaluating the Analysis**

\n\n

My current thinking is focused on integrating all the previous steps, including chord spellings, key assessments, and identifying potential patterns and repetition. The Bb minor key hypothesis, initially promising, now appears less likely, as is Gb major. The challenge lies in reconciling the chromatic chords with a single key.


**Revisiting Chord Relationships**

\n\n

My current thinking centers on the concept of a chromatic approach to a tonal center, with the "bizarre" chords acting as coloristic elements. I'm focusing on their function within the overall harmonic flow. The bassline of Ab-Bb leading to the final Bbdim chord is key.

**Finalizing the Tonal Center**

\n\n

My current thoughts have produced a detailed analysis. The tonal center is definitely Bb, but the inclusion of chromatic chords makes a simple key designation insufficient. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic chords as coloristic elements, building tension and then resolving to the `Bb` center. I'm now certain the `Bbdim` indicates a minor tonality.




Based on a harmonic analysis of the progression, the key and mode are:

*   **Tonal Center:** **B-flat (Bb)**
*   **Mode:** **Minor (with significant chromaticism)**

Here is a detailed breakdown of why:

### 1. The B-flat (Bb) Tonal Center

The most compelling evidence for **Bb** as the tonal center is the **bass pedal point**. The bass note is Bb for 13 out of the 16 chords in the progression. This recurring bass note acts as an anchor or "center of gravity," constantly pulling the harmony back to Bb. Even when the bass moves to Ab, it quickly returns to Bb, reinforcing its role as the primary tonic.

### 2. The Minor Mode

The harmony strongly suggests a minor mode rather than a major one.

*   **Tonic Chord as `Bbdim`:** The progression repeatedly uses `Bbdim` (Bb-Db-Fb) where a tonic chord would be. Using a diminished tonic (i°) is a common (though unstable) feature of minor keys. It immediately establishes a dark, tense, and unresolved character.
*   **Use of `Gb/Bb`:** The chord `Gb Major` (Gb-Bb-Db) is the **VI chord** in the key of Bb minor. Its presence strongly supports the minor tonality. Placing it over the Bb pedal point (`Gb/Bb`) creates a VI chord in first inversion, a very common sound in minor key progressions.
*   **Other Chords:** `Dbm/Ab` (Db-E-Ab) contains notes entirely from the Bb natural minor scale (Db, Ab, and Fb, which is enharmonically E). It functions as the `iii` chord over the `bVII` bass note.

### 3. Analysis of the Chromatic Chords

This progression is not strictly diatonic; it uses chromatic chords for color and tension.

*   **`B/Bb`:** A B major triad (B-D#-F#) over a Bb bass. This is extremely dissonant and non-functional in a traditional sense. It's best understood as a moment of intense chromatic color, where the `B` clashes directly with the `Bb` pedal.
*   **`Emaj7/Ab`:** An E major 7 chord (E-G#-B-D#) over an Ab bass. While the notes are foreign to Bb minor, its function is clear from the voice leading. The bass note **Ab** acts as a leading tone, resolving up a half-step to the tonic **Bb**. This chord, while chromatically borrowed, serves a dominant-like function by creating tension that resolves to the tonic center.

### Summary

The progression creates a **static and dark atmosphere** centered on **B-flat minor**. It establishes this center through a persistent bass pedal and the use of core minor-key chords like `Bbdim` (i°) and `Gb` (VI). The progression then introduces highly chromatic and dissonant chords (`B/Bb`, `Emaj7/Ab`) for color and tension, but these chords still function to ultimately lead back to and reinforce the **B-flat minor** tonal center.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chord symbols: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim" and asked me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to unpack what these chord symbols mean. Bbdim is B-flat diminished, which is Bb-Db-E. Gb/Bb means G-flat major with Bb in the bass, so the notes are Bb-Db-Gb. Dbm/Ab is D-flat minor with A-flat in the bass - Ab-Cb-Db but since Cb is B, it's Ab-B-Db. B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass? Wait, that seems odd - B natural over Bb bass would create a dissonant clash. Maybe it's a typo? Could it be A/Bb? That would make more sense as an A major chord over Bb bass. I should check standard jazz/harmonic practices. In many jazz contexts, B/Bb isn't standard notation - it's likely meant to be Bdim/Bb or something else. 

Looking at Emaj7/Ab - that's E major seventh with A-flat in the bass. Ab is G#, so E major is E-G#-B, plus D# for maj7, but G# is Ab so it's written as Ab. So notes: Ab-E-G#-B? That seems messy. Actually Emaj7 is E-G#-B-D#, so with Ab bass it would be Ab-E-G#-B-D#? But Ab and G# are enharmonic, so it's a bit confusing notationally. 

I notice a pattern - most chords have Bb or Ab in the bass. The sequence repeats "Bbdim Bbdim" several times, with variations around Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, that odd B/Bb, and Emaj7/Ab. 

Let me list all bass notes: 
- Bbdim: common tone Bb? 
- Gb/Bb: bass Bb
- Dbm/Ab: bass Ab
- B/Bb: would be bass Bb (if it's B/Bb) but the chord is problematic
- Emaj7/Ab: bass Ab

So primary bass movement: Bb - Bb - Ab - ? - Bb - Ab. 

The dominant recurring chord is Bbdim. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or leading tones. Bb diminished contains Bb-Db-E, which is enharmonically the same as A#-C#-E but in flat keys it's written as Bb-Db-E. 

Important: in tonal harmony, a diminished chord built on the second scale degree (ii°) often points to the dominant. But here it's centered around Bb. 

Let me consider possible keys where Bbdim makes sense. 

If Bbdim is the leading tone chord, it would lead to Bb. But diminished chords are usually half-diminished or fully diminished in minor keys. 

Bbdim is root Bb, so for it to be the leading tone chord, the tonic would be Ab. Because in Ab major, the leading tone chord is G#dim (which is enharmonic to Abdim? Wait no). 

In Ab major: 
- Tonic: Ab 
- Leading tone is G, so G diminished seventh (G-Bb-Db-Fb) but Fb is E. 

But here it's Bbdim, which is Bb-Db-Fb? No, diminished triad is minor third + minor third, so Bb-Dbb-Fb? Standard notation: Bb diminished is Bb-Db-E (since Dbb is C, but we spell it as Db for the diminished third). Actually correct spelling: Bb diminished triad is Bb-Db-Fb (Fb=E natural). So notes Bb-Db-E. 

In Ab major key, the vii° chord is G#dim7: G#-B-D-F. Enharmonically that's Ab-B-Db-E? G# is Ab, B is Cb? Messy. 

Better to think in terms of functional harmony. The chord Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) has E which is a major third above C, so it could be dominant function for Ab? Let's see: 

If we're in Ab major, the dominant is Eb7. Bbdim could be used as a chromatic passing chord. But Bbdim to what? 

Notice that Gb/Bb is Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db) over Bb bass, so essentially Bb7 without the third? Gb is the tritone substitution for C, but in Ab context... 

Tritone substitution: in Ab major, dominant is Eb7. Tritone sub of Eb7 is A7, but here we have Gb/Bb which is related to Db? Gb is the b5 of C, but let's calculate. 

Standard tritone substitution: for dominants, replace G7 with Db7 because they share the same tritone (F#-C for G7, which becomes F-Db for Db7? Wait: G7 has B and F (tritone), Db7 has F and Cb (tritone), so yes, same interval. 

But here we have Gb/Bb - Gb major chord over Bb bass. Notes: Bb-Db-Gb. So it's like a Bb7#11 or something? Because Bb7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab, but here we have Db and Gb (which is F#), so Bb-Db-F# which is Bb7#11 (since #11 is E# which is F, but Gb is F# so it's #11). 

In jazz, Gb/Bb is often used as a tritone substitution for C7, but over Bb bass? Bb would be the tonic here? 

Another thought: the bass movement suggests a cycle. Let's list the roots implied: 

- Bbdim: root Bb 
- Gb/Bb: chord root Gb 
- Dbm/Ab: chord root Db (with Ab bass) 
- B/Bb: chord root B? But over Bb bass - problematic 
- Emaj7/Ab: chord root E over Ab bass 

This looks like a chromatic descending bass line under static harmony. 

Count the bass notes: 
Positions: 
1-2: Bb (from Bbdim and Gb/Bb) 
3-4: Ab? Wait no: 
First "Bbdim Bbdim" - bass likely Bb each 
Then "Gb/Bb" - bass Bb 
Another "Gb/Bb" - bass Bb 
Then "Bbdim Bbdim" - bass Bb 
Then "Dbm/Ab" - bass Ab 
Then "B/Bb" - bass Bb 
Then "Bbdim Bbdim" - bass Bb 
Then "Gb/Bb Gb/Bb" - bass Bb 
Then "Bbdim Bbdim" - bass Bb 
Then "Emaj7/Ab" - bass Ab 
Then "Bbdim" - bass probably Bb 

So bass notes are mostly Bb, with exceptions at "Dbm/Ab" (Ab bass) and "Emaj7/Ab" (Ab bass), and that weird "B/Bb" which would be Bb bass if taken literally. 

The only deviations are to Ab bass. So it's like a pedal point on Bb with two moments of Ab bass. 

But Ab is the minor seventh of Bb, so it could be implying a Bb minor context? Because in Bb minor, the subtonic is Ab. 

Let's test Bb minor. 

Bb natural minor scale: Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb 

Chords: 
- i: Bbm 
- ii°: Cdim 
- III: Db maj 
- iv: Ebm 
- v: Fm 
- VI: Gb maj 
- VII: Ab maj 

But here we have Bbdim, which isn't the tonic in natural minor - tonic is minor, not diminished. 

However, in harmonic minor, the leading tone is raised, so Bb harmonic minor: Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-Gb-A-Bb 

Then: 
- i: Bbm 
- ii°: Cdim 
- III+: Db aug? Usually not used 
- iv: Ebm 
- V: F major (with A natural) 
- VI: Gb maj 
- vii°: Adim 

Bbdim isn't directly in the scale. Bbdim would be Bb-Db-E, but in harmonic minor the seventh degree is A, not Ab. 

Bbdim contains E natural, which is the major third of C, so it suggests a dominant function. 

Notice that Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) is enharmonic to Adim (A-C-Eb), but spelled differently. In jazz, diminished chords are often used as dominant substitutes. 

Specifically, Bb diminished triad (Bb-Db-E) can function as the vii° of Ab major. Because in Ab major, vii° is G#° = G#-B-D, which is enharmonic to Ab-B-Db, but Bbdim is Bb-Db-E - not the same. 

G#° is G#-B-D, which is same notes as B° (B-D-F) but in different inversion? No. 

Standard: the diminished chord a half step above the tonic is the leading tone chord. So for Ab major, leading tone is G#, so G#°7. 

G#°7 = G#-B-D-F 
Enharmonically: Ab-B-Db-E (since G#=Ab, B=B, D=C#, F=E#? Messy). 

But Bbdim is Bb-Db-E - which is three notes: 
- Bb is enharmonic to A# 
- Db is C# 
- E is E 

So A#-C#-E, which is A# diminished. A# dim is the leading tone chord for B major, but that seems unrelated. 

Perhaps it's functioning as a secondary dominant. 

Let's look at the entire sequence. The pattern repeats "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb" twice, with interruptions. 

Gb/Bb is Gb major over Bb, so the notes are Bb (bass), Db (3rd of Gb), Gb (root). So intervals: Bb to Db is minor 3rd, Db to Gb is perfect 4th, so it's like a Bb7sus4(b9) or something? Bb7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab. Gb is the b5 (since F# = Gb), so Bb7b5. Yes! Gb/Bb is essentially Bb7b5, because Bb7b5 would be Bb-Db-Fb-Ab, and Fb is E, but Gb is F#, so actually it's Bb7#11? Let's calculate: 

In Bb7, the #11 is E (since 11th is Eb, #11 is E). But Gb is F#, which is enharmonic to E#? No, F# is 6th tone. 

Standard: for Bb7, the #11 is E natural. But here the chord is Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db) over Bb bass, so combined notes: Bb (bass), Bb (from Gb/Bb? No - Gb major is Gb-Bb-Db, so over Bb bass: Bb, Gb, Bb, Db. So pitches: Bb, Db, Gb (since Gb is repeated). 

So three distinct pitches: Bb, Db, Gb. 

Intervals from Bb: 
- Bb to Db: minor 3rd 
- Bb to Gb: diminished 5th (since Gb is F#, but in bass it's Bb, so Bb to F# is augmented 4th, same as diminished 5th) 

So the sonority is Bb + minor 3rd + diminished 5th = Bb7b5 (Bb dominant 7 flat 5). Yes! Because Bb7b5 is Bb-Db-Fb-Ab, but Fb is E, so notes Bb-Db-E-Ab. However, in this chord "Gb/Bb", we only have three notes: Bb, Db, Gb (where Gb = F#). But F# is not E; E is natural. So there's a discrepancy. 

Gb is G-flat, which is F-sharp. So the chord is Bb, Db, F#. 

But in Bb7b5, we want Bb, Db, Fb (E), Ab. Here we have F# instead of E. So it's actually Bb7#11, because #11 is E# which is F, but F# is the #11? Let's see: 

In Bb, the 11th is Eb, so #11 is E natural. But F# is the major 3rd above Db, or enharmonically the augmented 4th from Bb. 

Bb to F# is augmented 4th, which is the #11 in Bb7. Yes! Standard Bb7#11 is Bb-Db-F-Ab-E (where E is #11). But in "Gb/Bb", we have Bb-Db-F#. F# is Gb, which is the same as E#? No, E# is F, so F# is different. 

Actually, F# is the #11, but in practice, #11 is often spelled as the sharp of the 11th: 11th of Bb is Eb, so #11 is E natural. But E natural and F# are enharmonically the same only in equal temperament, but notationally, F# is a different pitch class. 

In chord symbols, Gb/Bb is sometimes used to indicate a tritone substitution or a #11 sound. But technically, for Bb7, #11 is E, not F#. However, since F# = Gb and in equal temperament it's the same pitch, musicians often use it interchangeably. 

So functionally, Gb/Bb is acting as a Bb7#11 chord. 

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: D-flat minor over A-flat bass. Notes: Ab (bass), Db (root of Dbm), Fb (Eb, third of Dbm). So pitches: Ab, Db, Fb (Eb). 

Intervals from Ab: 
- Ab to Db: perfect 4th 
- Ab to Eb: perfect 5th 

So it's Ab7sus4? Ab7 is Ab-C-Eb-Gb. Here we have Ab-Db-Eb. Db is the 11th, Eb is the 5th. So Ab7sus4 (Ab-Db-Eb-Gb) but without the minor 7th (Gb). So it's incomplete, but suggests Ab7sus4. 

B/Bb: this is problematic. B major over Bb bass? Notes: Bb (bass), B (root), D# (F, but D# is enharmonic to Eb). So pitches: Bb, B, D#. 

This creates a minor second (Bb-B) and augmented second (B-D# = B-Eb? D# is Eb, so B to Eb is diminished 4th). Very dissonant. In context, it's likely a typo. Given the pattern, it might be meant to be "Bdim/Bb" - B diminished over Bb bass. Bdim is B-D-F, so over Bb: Bb, B, D, F. But B and Bb still clash. 

Other possibility: "A/Bb" - A major over Bb bass. A major is A-C#-E, over Bb: Bb, A, C#, E. This is a Bb7b9 chord, because Bb7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab, but here we have A (which is bb7? Wait: 
- Bb to A is minor 7th down, so in root position it would be Ab as minor 7th, but here we have A natural which is G##, so enharmonically it's the minor 7th if we think of Ab, but for Bb, the minor 7th is Ab. 

Bb7b9: Bb-Db-F-Ab-B (where B is the b9). B natural is the b9 for Bb7. Yes! So "A/Bb" would be Bb7b9, but here it's written as "B/Bb", which might be a typo for "Bdim/Bb" or "A/Bb". Given the E earlier in Emaj7/Ab, and the context, it could be "Ab/Bb" but that doesn't make sense. 

Looking back at the user input: "Dbm/Ab B/Bb" — probably "B/Bb" is meant to be "Ab/Bb" but that's redundant. Or "Bdim/Bb". 

In many jazz standards, you see sequences like this in minor keys with chromatic passing chords. 

Now, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th over Ab bass. E major is E-G#-B-D#, so over Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. 

Notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. 

Enharmonically, Ab = G#, so it's G# with G#-B-D#-F##? Messy. Better to think: Ab and G# are same pitch, so the bass is G#, and chord is E-G#-B-D# which is E major 7th. So it's G#°7 or something? E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#, so with G# bass, it's G#-E-G#-B-D# — which is the same as G# half-diminished? G# half-diminished is G#-B-D#-F#, but here we have E and B, so it's actually E7#9: E-G#-B-D# with Ab (G#) in bass, and D# is the #9? E7#9 is E-G#-B-D-G, but #9 is G. Here we have D# which is the major 7th, not the minor 7th. 

Actually, Emaj7/Ab is enharmonically C#m6/Ab or something, but let's calculate the actual pitches: 

- Ab (bass) = G# 
- E (chord root) 
- G# (third of E major) — but G# is same as Ab, so the bass and third are the same note? 
- B (fifth) 
- D# (maj7) = Eb 

So pitches: Ab (bass), E, G# (same as Ab), B, D# (Eb). So distinct pitches: Ab, E, B, Eb. 

Intervals: 
- Ab to E: augmented 5th (since perfect 5th is Eb, augmented is E) 
- Ab to B: major 3rd up? Ab to B is minor 3rd? Ab-A-B, so Ab to B is major third (since Ab to Cb is minor third, to B is major third enharmonically). Ab to B is three semitones: Ab-A-Bb-B? Ab to A is minor second, to Bb minor third, to B major third. Yes, Ab to B is major third. 
- Ab to Eb: perfect 5th 

So the chord is Ab-E-B-Eb — which is Ab7: Ab-C-Eb-Gb. But here we have Ab-E-B-Eb. E is not C, B is not Gb. 

Ab to E is augmented 5th (Ab-E), Eb is the minor 7th (Ab-Eb). But B is the #11? This is confusing. 

Notice that E and Ab form a tritone. In fact, E-Ab is a diminished 5th/augmented 4th. 

So the chord is essentially a tritone with extensions. But with B and Eb added, it's complex. 

In jazz, Emaj7/Ab is often interpreted as an Ab7b9#9 or something, because the notes: 
- Ab (bass) 
- E = the #11 (but #11 is D, not E) 
Standard Ab7b9: Ab-C-Eb-Gb-Bbb (A), so Ab-C-Eb-Gb-A. 
Here we have Ab, E, G#, B, D# — but G# is Ab, so effectively Ab, E, B, Eb. 
E is the #11 (since 11th is Db, #11 is D, but E is not D). 
Perhaps it's functioning as a dominant for D or something. 

Let's step back. The most frequent chord is "Bbdim", which appears 10 times in the sequence. In jazz progression, a repeated diminished chord often indicates a "diminished passing chord" between two tonics, but here it's static. 

Another idea: the entire progression might be in Ab major, with Bbdim acting as a ii° chord. In Ab major, ii° is Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb). Yes! Bb diminished triad: Bb-Db-Fb (Fb=E). In Ab major, the notes are Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G, but for chords: 
- i: Ab 
- ii°: Bb dim (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- III: Cm 
- IV: Db 
- V: Eb 
- vi: Fm 
- vii°: G° 

Yes! Bbdim is exactly the ii° chord in Ab major. 

But in the progression, we have Gb/Bb. In Ab major, Gb doesn't appear. Gb is the bVII, which is not diatonic. However, in jazz and blues, bVII is common. 

Gb major is the bVI of Ab? Ab bVI is Fb, which is E, not Gb. 

Gb is the IV of Db, but not related. 

Tritone substitution: for dominant chords. In Ab major, V is Eb7. Tritone sub is A7. But Gb is not directly related. 

Another thought: the "Gb/Bb" might be meant to be part of a ii-V-I in a different key. 

Let's consider the possibility that the progression is centered on Ab, and Bbdim is ii°, leading to I Ab. But in the sequence, Bbdim is followed by... well, it's mostly Bbdim repeating, with Gb/Bb which could be IV in Db, but not consistent. 

Look at Dbm/Ab: Db minor over Ab bass. In Ab major, Db is the IV chord, but minor? IV is usually major in major keys, but in minor keys it can be minor. 

Perhaps the key is Gb minor. Let's try Gb minor. 

Gb natural minor: Gb-Ab-Bbb(Cb)-Db-Eb-Fb(G)-Abb(B) - wait, standard: Gb minor scale: Gb-Ab-Bbb(Cb)-Db-Eb-Fb(G)-Ab. So notes Gb, Ab, Bbb (A), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Ab. 

Chords: 
- i: Gbm 
- ii°: Ab° 
- III: Bbb (A) maj — but usually written as Ab dim? 

Not matching. 

Harmonic minor: Gb, Ab, Bbb, Db, Eb, Fb, G (natural leading tone). 

Still, Bbdim doesn't fit. Bb is not in the scale. 

Bb is enharmonic to A#, which is not in Gb minor. 

Another approach: the Bbdim chord has notes Bb, Db, E. E is the major third above C, so it suggests a dominant function for Ab (since C is the third of Ab). 

Specifically, Bb-Db-E is the same as the upper structure of Ab minor-major 7 or something. 

Abm(maj7) is Ab-Cb-Eb-G. Not matching. 

Notice that Bb-Db-E spells the notes of a G7b9 chord: G-B-D-F-Ab, but with Ab missing, and it's Bb-Db-E. G7b9 has notes G-B-D-F-Ab, so the upper structure is B-D-F-Ab, which is B half-diminished. But here we have Bb-Db-E — different. 

Bb-Db-E is actually the same as E-G#-Bb, which is E diminished. E° is E-G-Bb. Oh! Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) is enharmonically equivalent to E° (E-G-Bb), since Bb = A#, but in equal temperament, the pitches are the same: Bb, Db, E. 

E° = E-G-Bb, which is the same as G-Bb-Db, or Bb-Db-E. Yes! So Bbdim is identical to E°, G°, and C° in terms of pitch collection, but spelled differently. 

In this case, Bbdim = E° (enharmonically). 

E° is the vii° chord in F major. In F major, vii° is E°: E-G-Bb. 

Also, E° can function as a dominant substitute for C7, since it contains the tritone G-Bb (F#), which is the same as in C7 (B-F). 

So perhaps we're in F major. 

Check: in F major, diatonic chords: 
- I: F 
- ii: Gm 
- iii: Am 
- IV: Bb 
- V: C 
- vi: Dm 
- vii°: E° 

Yes! E° is the leading tone chord, and it's spelled as E-G-Bb. But here it's written as Bbdim, which is Bb-Db-E — wait, Db is not in F major. Major scale has Db? F major is F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E. So no Db; D is natural. 

E° in F major is E-G-Bb, which uses G natural, not Gb. But Bbdim as written is Bb-Db-E — Db is C#, which is not in F major. 

Problem: Bbdim implies Db (which is C#), but in F major, the leading tone chord is E-G-Bb (with G natural). 

So Bbdim with Db would be E-G#-Bb? But G# is not in F major. 

Unless it's E°7: E-G-Bb-Db, which is the fully diminished seventh chord. 

E°7 = E-G-Bb-Db 

Enharmonically, this is also G°7 = G-Bb-Db-Eb? No: 
E°7: E, G, Bb, Db 
G°7: G, Bb, Db, E 
B°7: B, D, F, Ab 
D°7: D, F, Ab, Cb 

So E°7 = E-G-Bb-Db, and Db is C#. 

Now, in the chord symbol, it's written as "Bbdim" — but in standard notation, "dim" usually means diminished triad, not seventh. However, in jazz contexts, "dim" often implies diminished seventh chord. 

This is crucial. In many jazz charts, "Cdim" means C diminished seventh, not triad. So "Bbdim" likely means Bb diminished seventh chord. 

Bbdim7 would be Bb-Db-F-Ab — but diminished seventh chord is root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th, diminished 7th. So for Bb: 
- Bb to Db: minor 3rd 
- Db to Fb (E): diminished 5th (since F is natural in major, but here it's diminished, so Fb) 
- Fb to Abb (G): diminished 7th 

So Bbdim7 = Bb, Db, Fb (E), Abb (G) 

But Abb is G, and Fb is E. So pitches: Bb, Db, E, G. 

Enharmonically, this is the same as E°7: E, G, Bb, Db. 

Yes! Bbdim7 = E°7 = G°7 = C°7, etc. 

In standard jazz practice, a diminished seventh chord is symmetrical and can be spelled from any root. But it's often notated based on context. 

Given that, "Bbdim" here likely means Bb diminished seventh chord, which is Bb-Db-E-G (with E and G being enharmonic equivalents of Fb and Abb). 

Now, in functional harmony, this chord often acts as a passing chord or as a secondary leading tone chord. 

Common function: in the key of Ab, the vii°7 chord is G#°7 = G#-B-D-F, which is enharmonically Ab-B-Db-E (since G#=Ab, B=B, D=C#, F=E). But our chord is Bb-Db-E-G — which is different. 

G#°7 would be Ab-B-Db-E (enharmonically), but B-Db is minor third, Db-E is major second? Not diminished intervals. 

G#°7 spelled properly: G#, B, D, F. 
- G# to B: minor 3rd 
- B to D: minor 3rd 
- D to F: minor 3rd 

Yes. 

Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G — 
- Bb to Db: minor 3rd 
- Db to E: major second? Db to E is augmented 2nd (since Db-D-E, so three semitones, which is minor 3rd enharmonically? Db to E is: Db-D-D#-E, so three semitones, minor third. 

Db to E: Db to D is semitone, D to D# is second semitone, D# to E is third? No: Db to D is minor second, D to E is major second, so Db to E is minor third (three semitones: Db-D, D-D#, D#-E — but D# is Eb, so Db to Eb is minor second? Let's count: 

Pitches: Db, D, Eb, E, F, etc. 
From Db to E: 
- Db to D: +1 semitone 
- D to Eb: +1 (total +2) 
- Eb to E: +1 (total +3) 

Yes, three semitones, which is minor third. So Db to E is minor third (enharmonically, since E is the same as Fb, but numerically). 

Then E to G: E-F-F#-G, three semitones, minor third. 
G to Bb: G-Ab-A-Bb, three semitones, minor third. 

So yes, it's a fully diminished seventh chord. 

Now, such a chord can resolve to a major or minor chord a half step above any of its roots. 

For example, Bbdim7 (Bb-Db-E-G) can resolve to: 
- Ab major (since Bb is a half step above Ab) 
- Cb major (B, but usually written as B) 
- E major 
- G major 

In the progression, we have Gb/Bb. Gb/Bb — as we discussed, likely a Bb7#11 or something. But let's see the resolution. 

After "Bbdim Bbdim", we have "Gb/Bb". If the diminished chord resolves to Gb, but Gb is a major third away, not a half step. 

Standard resolution: diminished chord resolves up a half step. So Bbdim7 should resolve to Ab, but here it's going to Gb/Bb which has Gb in the chord. 

Gb is a whole step below Ab. 

Perhaps it's a different function. 

Another common usage: diminished chords as common tone diminished chords. For example, if we're on Ab, and we have a diminished chord with Ab in it, but here the bass is moving. 

In this sequence, the bass is mostly Bb, and Bbdim7 has Bb, so it's a common tone. 

Bbdim7 over Bb bass would be: Bb (bass), Bb, Db, E, G — so the chord is Bb-Db-E-G, with common tone Bb. 

This is often used to create tension before resolving. 

Now, looking at "Gb/Bb": if we take it as Gb major over Bb bass — Bb-Db-Gb. 

Bbdim7 is Bb-Db-E-G. 

So from Bbdim7 to Gb/Bb: 
- E moves to Db? (E down to Db) 
- G moves to Gb? (G down to F#) 
- Bb and Db stay. 

So E->Db (minor third down), G->Gb (minor second down), which is a common resolution for diminished chords — the outer voices move in contrary motion to form a major triad. 

Specifically, from Bbdim7 (Bb-Db-E-G) to Gb (Gb-Bb-Db), the E resolves down to Db, G resolves down to Gb? But G to Gb is down minor second, which is typical. 

And Db stays as Db, Bb stays as Bb. 

Yes! So it's resolving to Gb major, but Gb is a minor third down, not up a half step. 

But in this case, it's a common tone resolution where the diminished chord shares two notes with the target chord. 

Bbdim7 shares Db and Bb with Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db). 

The other two notes (E and G) resolve: 
- E resolves to Db (by minor third down, which is like a leading tone resolution) 
- G resolves to Gb (by minor second down) 

This is a standard resolution for a common tone diminished chord to a major chord a minor third away. 

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor over Ab bass. Notes: Ab, Db, Fb (Eb). 

Bbdim7 is Bb-Db-E-G. 

Not directly adjacent. 

But after Gb/Bb, we go back to Bbdim Bbdim, so it's oscillating. 

Then we have "Dbm/Ab" — which is Ab-Db-Eb. 

Bbdim7 has Bb-Db-E-G. 

From previous: after Bbdim Bbdim (which might be implying the same chord), to Dbm/Ab: 
- Bb might resolve to Ab (down minor second) 
- Db stays 
- E might resolve to Eb (down minor second) 
- G might resolve to Db? Not clear. 

Yes: Bb->Ab (down minor second), E->Eb (down minor second), Db stays, G->? In Dbm/Ab, we have Ab, Db, Eb, so G could resolve to Ab or Db, but it's common for the G (which is the diminished 7th) to resolve down to F, but here F isn't present. 

In Dbm/Ab, the notes are Ab (bass), Db, Eb. So pitches Ab, Db, Eb. 

Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G. 

So Bb->Ab, E->Eb, Db stays, G->? Eb or Db. G to Eb is minor third down — possible. 

This suggests a resolution to Ab minor, since Dbm/Ab implies Ab7sus4 or Ab minor. 

Ab minor chord is Ab-Cb-Eb. But here it's Dbm/Ab — Db minor is Db-Fb-Ab, so over Ab bass: Ab-Db-Fb (Eb). This is a first inversion Db minor, but Db minor is not diatonic to Ab minor. 

In Ab minor, the iv chord is Db minor. Yes! In Ab natural minor, iv is Dbm. 

And i is Abm. 

So Dbm is the iv chord in Ab minor. 

Similarly, Gb/Bb: Gb major. In Ab minor, what is Gb? Ab minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. So Gb is the VII degree. 

In minor keys, the VII chord is major. 

So in Ab minor: 
- i: Abm 
- ii°: Bbdim 
- III: Cbmaj (often Bmaj) 
- iv: Dbm 
- v: Ebm (or V if harmonic) 
- VI: Gbmaj 
- VII: Abmaj? No, VII is Gb. 

Ab natural minor: 
1. Ab 
2. Bb 
3. Cb 
4. Db 
5. Eb 
6. Fb (E) 
7. Gb 

So: 
- i: Abm (Ab-Cb-Eb) 
- ii°: Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb) — Fb is E, but in notation it's Fb 
- III: Cb (B) maj — usually written as B 
- iv: Dbm (Db-Fb-Ab) 
- v: Ebm (Eb-Gb-Bb) 
- VI: Gb (Gb-Bb-Db) 
- VII: Ab? No, 7th degree is Gb, so chord on Gb: Gb-Bb-Db = Gbmaj 

Yes, and Gbmaj is the VI chord, not VII. 

In minor keys: 
- i 
- ii° 
- III 
- iv 
- v 
- VI 
- VII 

So for Ab minor: 
- i: Abm 
- ii°: Bbdim 
- III: Bmaj 
- iv: Dbm 
- v: Ebm 
- VI: Gbmaj 
- VII: Abmaj? The seventh degree is Gb, so the chord on Gb is Gb-Bb-Db = Gbmaj, which would be the VI chord if measured from tonic. Tonic is Ab, so: 
- Degree 1: Ab 
- 2: Bb 
- 3: Cb 
- 4: Db 
- 5: Eb 
- 6: Fb (E) 
- 7: Gb 

So the chords: 
- i: Ab- (Ab-Cb-Eb) 
- ii°: Bb° (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- III: Cb (B) maj 
- iv: Dbm (Db-Fb-Ab) 
- v: Ebm (Eb-Gb-Bb) 
- VI: Fbm (Ebm) — but Fb is enharmonic to E, so Ebm 
- vii°: G° (Gb-Bb-Db? G° is G-Bb-Db, but Gb is F#, so not exactly) 

In natural minor, the chords are: 
- i: minor 
- ii°: diminished 
- III: major 
- iv: minor 
- v: minor 
- VI: major 
- VII: major? No, in natural minor, VII is major only if the 7th is natural minor. 

Standard natural minor diatonic chords: 
i - ii° - III - iv - v - VI - VII 

With: 
- III major 
- VI major 
- VII major 

For A minor: 
- i: Am 
- ii°: B° 
- III: C 
- iv: Dm 
- v: Em 
- VI: F 
- VII: G 

Yes, VII is major. 

So for Ab minor: 
- ii°: Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- iv: Dbm 
- VI: Gbmaj (Gb-Bb-Db) 

And VII: Abmaj? The seventh degree is Gb, so chord on Gb is Gb-Bb-Db = Gbmaj, which is the VI chord. 

The VII chord would be on the seventh scale degree, which is Gb, so it is Gbmaj, and it's the VI chord? No: 

Scale degrees: 
1. Ab 
2. Bb 
3. Cb 
4. Db 
5. Eb 
6. Fb (E) 
7. Gb 

So: 
- Chord on 1: i = Abm 
- Chord on 2: ii° = Bbdim 
- Chord on 3: III = Cbmaj 
- Chord on 4: iv = Dbm 
- Chord on 5: v = Ebm 
- Chord on 6: VI = Fbmaj (which is E maj) 
- Chord on 7: VII = Gbmaj 

Yes! So VII is Gbmaj. 

In the progression, we have "Gb/Bb" which is Gb major over Bb bass — consistent with Gbmaj (the VII chord). 

And "Dbm/Ab" is Db minor over Ab bass — which is Dbm, the iv chord. 

Now, what about "B/Bb"? If it's a typo, it might be "Bbm/Bb" or "Ab/Bb", but in context, after Dbm/Ab, it's "B/Bb", then back to Bbdim. 

Perhaps "B/Bb" is meant to be "Ab/Bb" or "G/Bb", but let's see. 

After "Dbm/Ab" (which is iv in Ab minor), the next chord is "B/Bb". If we are in Ab minor, the v chord is Ebm. But "B/Bb" doesn't suggest that. 

Given the pattern, and the fact that it's followed by "Bbdim", which is ii°, it might be a dominant chord. 

In minor keys, the v chord is often minor, but the V chord (harmonic) is major. 

In Ab harmonic minor, the V chord is Eb major (because the leading tone is G natural instead of Gb). 

But "B/Bb" — B major over Bb bass? If it's E/Bb or something. 

Perhaps "B/Bb" is a misnotation for "E/Bb" — E major over Bb bass. E major is E-G#-B. Over Bb: Bb, E, G#, B. 

Which is Bb7b9: Bb-Db-F-Ab-B. B natural is the b9. 

And Bb7b9 is a common dominant chord for Ab minor (since Bb7 is V7 of Ab). 

Yes! In Ab minor, the dominant V7 is Eb7, but here it's Bb7 — which is not V. V is Eb. 

Bb7 would be the bII7, a common minor chord, but that doesn't make sense. 

For Ab minor, II chord is Bbdim, not Bb7. 

bII7 is uncommon. 

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant. 

But given the context, "B/Bb" likely means "Bb7" but written as a slash chord. In some notations, "B" might be a typo for "7" or something, but it's probably "Bdim" as mentioned earlier. 

Assuming "B/Bb" is an error for "Bdim/Bb" — B diminished over Bb bass. Bdim is B-D-F. Over Bb: Bb, B, D, F. 

This is Bb7b9 (Bb-Db-F-Ab-Cb), but here we have B natural instead of Db. Bb to B is minor 9th, so Bb7b9 would have B natural as b9. 

Yes! Bb7b9 consists of Bb, Db, F, Ab, and B (natural, the b9). 

In "Bdim/Bb", if Bdim is B-D-F, and over Bb bass: pitches Bb, B, D, F. 

Bb7b9 is Bb-Db-F-Ab-B. Here we have D instead of Db? D is C#, which is not Db. 

Bdim is B-D-F, so D natural. But Bb7b9 requires Db (third of the chord). 

So not exact, but in jazz, Bdim/Bb might be used to imply Bb7b9, since Bdim is part of the altered scale. 

Specifically, the Bb altered scale (for Bb7) is Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab — which has Db, Eb, etc. But Bdim (B-D-F) isn't directly in it. 

Note that the notes B-D-F are the same as D-F-B, which is Dm, but not helpful. 

Enharmonically, B-D-F = D-F-B = F-B-D, which is F7, but not related. 

Perhaps it's a typo for "Ab/Bb" — Ab major over Bb bass, which would be Ab-C-Eb over Bb, so Bb-Ab-C-Eb — which is Bb7sus4(b9) or something. 

But in the sequence, it appears between Dbm/Ab and Bbdim. 

Dbm/Ab is Ab-Db-Eb (bass Ab), then "B/Bb" (bass Bb), then Bbdim (bass Bb). 

So from Ab bass to Bb bass — a whole step up. 

If Dbm/Ab is iv in Ab minor, then moving to a chord with Bb bass could be ii° or V/v or something. 

Suppose "B/Bb" should be "E/Bb" — E major over Bb bass. As above, this would be Bb7b9 (Bb dominant 7 flat 9), which is a standard dominant chord for Ab minor. 

Because V7 of Ab is Eb7, but Bb7 is not V; V is fifth degree, which is Eb. 

Unless it's a cadence to Db or something. 

Bb7 would be V7 of Eb, but we're in Ab minor. 

Perhaps the key is not Ab minor. 

Last chord: "Emaj7/Ab". Emaj7 over Ab bass. As we analyzed, notes Ab, E, G#, B, D# — enharmonically Ab, E, Ab, B, Eb. So Ab, E, B, Eb. 

This looks like Ab7: Ab-C-Eb-Gb. But here we have E and B instead of C and Gb. 

E is the #11, B is the 13th? Ab7#11 is Ab-C-Eb-Gb-D, but here D# is Eb, not D. 

Actually, Ab, E, B, Eb — 
- Ab to Eb: perfect 5th 
- Ab to B: major 3rd (as Ab-C is minor third? Ab to B: Ab-A-Bb-B, so major third) 
- Ab to E: augmented 5th 

So it's Ab7#9: Ab-C-Eb-Gb-B (where B is the #9). Yes! Because #9 is B natural for Ab (since 9th is Bb, #9 is B). 

And in this chord, we also have E natural, which is the #11. 

But the symbol is Emaj7/Ab, which gives us the #9 and #11, so it's a highly altered Ab7 chord, functioning as the dominant. 

In Ab minor, the dominant V7 should be Eb7, but here we have Ab7, which is tonic. 

Unless it's a different key. 

If Emaj7/Ab is functioning as Ab7alt, then it's dominant for Db minor or major. 

Ab7 is V7 of Db. 

So in Db major or Db minor, Ab7 is the dominant V7. 

Let's try Db major. 

In Db major: 
- I: Db 
- ii: Ebm 
- iii: Fm 
- IV: Gb 
- V: Ab 
- vi: Bbm 
- vii°: C° 

Bbdim is vi, which is minor, not diminished. 

In Db minor (natural): 
- i: Dbm 
- ii°: Eb dim 
- III: Fbmaj 
- iv: Gbm 
- v: Abm 
- VI: Bbbmaj (A) 
- VII: Cbmaj (B) 

Bbdim is not diatonic. 

In Db harmonic minor, the chords are: 
- i: Dbm 
- ii°: Eb dim 
- III+: Fb aug 
- iv: Gbm 
- V: Ab 
- VI: Bbb 
- vii°: C° or C#° 

Still, Bbdim doesn't fit. 

Bbdim would be the ii° chord in Ab major, as we said earlier. 

Back to Ab major: 
- ii°: Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb) 

And "Gb/Bb" is Gb major, which is the bVII in Ab major (since VII in major is G, not Gb; bVII is Gb). 

So in Ab major, we have ii° and bVII, which is a common blues or mixolydian thing. 

But then "Dbm/Ab" — Db minor over Ab bass. Db minor is not diatonic to Ab major; IV is Db major. 

So Dbm suggests minor iv, which is characteristic of natural minor or dorian. 

So perhaps the mode is Dorian. 

Dorian mode on Ab: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb 

So: 
- i: Abm 
- ii: Bbm 
- III: Cbmaj 
- IV: Dbm 
- v: Ebm 
- VI: Gbmaj 
- VII: Abmaj 

Bbdim is not there; it should be Bbm. 

Unless the ii chord is made dominant, but it's written as dim. 

In Dorian, the ii chord is minor, not diminished. 

But in some contexts, it could be altered. 

Another idea: the Bbdim is functioning as a secondary dominant. For example, it could be the vii° of Ab, but as we said, vii° of Ab is G#°. 

Perhaps it's the common tone diminished for the tonic. 

Let's look at the most frequent bass note: Bb. The progression spends most time on Bb with variations. 

The exceptions are when it goes to Ab bass for "Dbm/Ab" and "Emaj7/Ab". 

"Dbm/Ab" has Ab bass, and "Emaj7/Ab" has Ab bass, and they are both over Ab. 

So perhaps the tonic is Ab, and the Bbdim is a passing chord to Gb, but then it returns. 

The structure: 
- Long stretches of Bbdim and Gb/Bb (which is Bb7#11)
- Then to Dbm/Ab (iv)
- Then to "B/Bb" (which we'll assume is Bb7b9)
- Back to Bbdim

" Emaj7/Ab" at the end with Bbdim.

"Emaj7/Ab" is Ab7alt, as we said, which is V7 of Db.

But in the sequence, it's "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb ..." and ends with "Emaj7/Ab Bbdim" — so after Emaj7/Ab, it goes to Bbdim, not to Db.

So it doesn't resolve.

This suggests that Ab is not the tonic; perhaps the tonic is Db.

Let's try Db major.

Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db

Chords:
- I: Db
- ii: Ebm
- iii: Fm
- IV: Gb
- V: Ab
- vi: Bbm
- vii°: C°

Bbdim is vi, which is minor, not diminished. But "Bbdim" is written, so it might be Bbm, but it's labeled dim, which is unusual.

In jazz, "dim" might be a mistake for "m" or something.

Perhaps "Bbdim" is meant to be Bbm7b5, which is half-diminished, often notated as "BØ" or "Bm7b5", but sometimes "Bbdim" is misused.

In Db major, the ii chord is Ebm7, and vi is Bbm7.

Bbm7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab.

Bbdim7 would be Bb-Db-E-G, which is different.

Bbm7b5 is Bb-Db-Fb-Ab = Bb-Db-Eb-Ab, which is not diminished.

So not matching.

Another possibility: the key is Gb major with a modal interchange.

Gb major: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb

Chords:
- I: Gb
- ii: Abm
- iii: Bbm
- IV: Cb (B)
- V: Db
- vi: Ebm
- vii°: F°

Bbdim is iii, which should be Bbm, not dim.

Same issue.

Perhaps the "dim" is misnotated, and it's actually the minor chord.

But the user wrote "dim", so we should respect that.

Let's look at the last part: "Emaj7/Ab Bbdim"

If Emaj7/Ab is Ab7alt, and Bbdim is the ii° of Ab, then it could be: Ab7alt (V7 of Db) resolving to Db, but it goes to Bbdim, which is not Db.

Unless it's a deceptive resolution, but Bbdim is ii° of Ab, which is not related.

Standard: Ab7 (V7 of Db) resolves to Db.

But here it goes to Bbdim, which has no Db in it; Bbdim7 is Bb-Db-E-G, so it has Db, which is the root of Db major.

Yes! Bbdim7 contains Db (as the minor third).

So Ab7 to Bbdim7 to Db: 
- Ab7: Ab-C-Eb-Gb
- Bbdim7: Bb-Db-E-G
- Db: Db-F-Ab

Common notes: 
- Eb (from Ab7) to E (in Bbdim7) is enharmonic, but not the same pitch class.
- Gb (from Ab7) to G (in Bbdim7) is minor second.

Resolution:
- C (3rd of Ab7) resolves to Db (in Bbdim7)
- Eb (5th) resolves to E (in Bbdim7)
- Gb (7th) resolves to G (in Bbdim7)
- Ab (root) may stay as Bb or move.

Then Bbdim7 resolves to Db:
- Bb resolves to Ab or Db
- Db stays
- E resolves to Eb (in Db, but Db major has F, not Eb; Db major is Db-F-Ab)
- G resolves to F (3rd of Db)

Yes: E->Eb? But Db major has F natural, not Eb. 

Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G
Db major: Db, F, Ab

So:
- Bb -> Ab (down minor second)
- E -> F (up minor second)
- G -> F? But F is already there, or G->Ab

Standard resolution: 
- The 7th of the dominant (Gb for Ab7) resolves down to F for Db.
- But here it's going through Bbdim7.

In jazz, there's a common ii°-V-i progression in minor, but here it's Ab7 to Bbdim7 to Db.

Bbdim7 can be seen as the ii° of Ab, but for Db, it's different.

For Db major, the ii chord is Ebm7, not Bbdim.

Harmonic minor of Db: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C, Db

So the dominant V is Ab7 (Ab-C-Eb-Gb), and the ii° is Eb dim (Eb-Gb-Bbb-Db).

Bbdim is not involved.

Perhaps the key is Ab minor, and the progression is using both natural and harmonic minor.

In Ab natural minor, we have:
- ii°: Bbdim
- iv: Dbm
- VII: Gbmaj

And the progression makes sense: 
- Bbdim (ii°) 
- Gb/Bb (VII in first inversion? But Gb/Bb is Gb major with Bb bass, which is third inversion if we consider Gb as root, but usually written as Gb/Bb for bass movement)

The sequence: 
"Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb" — this could be oscillating between ii° and VII.

Then "Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab" — from ii° to iv.

Then "B/Bb" — which might be the V chord. In Ab minor, the V chord in harmonic minor is Eb major.

Eb major over Bb bass? "B/Bb" doesn't suggest Eb.

Unless "B/Bb" is "Eb/Bb" — Eb major over Bb bass. Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, over Bb: Bb, Eb, G, Bb. So it's Bb7sus4.

Yes! And in Ab minor, Eb is V, so V in second inversion or something.

Then "Bbdim Bbdim" — back to ii°.

Then repeats.

Then "Emaj7/Ab" — which as we said, is Ab7alt, but if we're in Ab minor, Ab is i, so Ab7alt would be the tonic minor with altered dom, but usually not.

"Emaj7/Ab" = Ab7#9, which is a dominant chord, but for what? If it's the dominant of Db, but we're in Ab.

Perhaps it's the tritone substitution for the dominant.

In Ab minor, the dominant is Eb7. Tritone sub of Eb7 is A7.

A7 is A-C#-E-G. 

"Emaj7/Ab" has Ab, E, G#, B, D# — which is Ab, E, Ab, B, Eb. So Ab, B, E, Eb.

A7 would be A-C#-E-G.

Not the same.

Enharmonically, A7: A, C#, E, G
Emaj7/Ab: Ab, B, E, Eb

Completely different.

But Eb in there — Eb is the minor 7th of Ab, so it's part of the scale.

Perhaps "Emaj7/Ab" is meant to be the tonic chord, but Emaj7 is not Ab minor.

Another idea: the "Emaj7/Ab" is actually C#m6/Ab or something, but let's spell it out.

Chord: E major 7th = E, G#, B, D#
Bass: Ab = G#

So pitches: G# (bass), E, G#, B, D# 
-> E, G#, B, D#, G# 
So distinct pitches: E, G#, B, D#

G# is repeated.

So it's an E major 7th chord with G# in bass, which is G# half-diminished 7th? G# half-dim is G#-B-D#-F#, but here we have E, which is not F#.

E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#.

So notes: G# (bass), E, B, D#.

Intervals:
- G# to E: minor 6th (G#-A-B-C-D-E, so minor 6th)
- G# to B: minor 3rd (G#-A-B)
- G# to D#: augmented 4th (G#-A-B-C-D) but D# is enharmonic to Eb, so G# to Eb is diminished 5th)

So it's an augmented 6th chord or something.

Specifically, G#-E-B-D# = G#-B-D#-E

G# to B is minor 3rd, B to D# is major 3rd, D# to E is minor 2nd, not characteristic.

This chord is enharmonically equivalent to a French augmented 6th chord or something.

Italian sixth: G#-B-E, but here we have D# as well.

Perhaps it's functioning as a dominant for D minor.

D minor: D-F-A

Ab7 is V of Db, but D is not Db.

D is enharmonic to C#, but not the same.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is D minor.

D minor scale: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C

Chords:
- i: Dm
- ii°: Edim
- III: F
- iv: Gm
- v: Am
- VI: Bb
- VII: C

Bbdim is not diatonic; for D minor, ii° is Edim.

Bbdim would be the VI degree, but major.

Not matching.

The chord Bbdim7 = Bb-Db-E-G

In D minor, what could it be? 
- If we consider it as the bVII dim, but bVII in minor is major (C for D minor).

This is not working.

Let's try to see the overall tonality.

The bass line: mostly Bb, with two occurrences of Ab.

The chords on Bb: Bbdim, Gb/Bb (which is Gb with Bb bass), B/Bb (assumed Bb7b9), so all imply Bb as the tonic or dominant.

The chords on Ab: Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, so Ab as tonic or dominant.

The final chord is Bbdim after Emaj7/Ab.

Perhaps the tonic is Bb minor.

Let's check Bb minor.

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb

Chords:
- i: Bbm
- ii°: C°
- III: Db
- iv: Ebm
- v: Fm
- VI: Gb
- VII: Ab

Bbdim is i? But i is minor, not diminished.

Bbdim would not be diatonic.

In Bb harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A, Bb

Chords:
- i: Bbm(maj7)? Usually minor
- ii°: C°
- III+: Db aug
- iv: Ebm
- V: F major
- VI: Gb
- vii°: Adim

Bbdim is not there.

Bbdim could be the vii° if we consider a different root, but for Bb, vii° is Adim.

So not matching.

Unless the "Bbdim" is misinterpreted.

Perhaps "Bbdim" is the chord symbol, but it's actually the tonic chord in half-diminished or something.

Another idea: the progression is in Ab major, and the Bbdim is the ii° chord, which is common.

Then "Gb/Bb" is the bVII chord (Gb major), which is borrowed from the parallel minor (Ab minor).

In Ab major, bVII is Gb major.

Then "Dbm/Ab" is the iv chord from minor (Db minor), again from parallel minor.

"B/Bb" might be the V7 of something, but in Ab major, V7 is Eb7.

If "B/Bb" is "E/Bb" for Eb7, then it makes sense.

E/Bb would be Eb7: Eb-G-Bb-Db over Bb bass — so Bb, Eb, G, Bb, Db. Which is Bb with extensions, but usually written as Bb7/Eb or something, but in jazz, it's common to write slash chords for bass notes.

So "E/Bb" means Eb major over Bb bass, which is Bb7sus.

Yes! Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, so over Bb bass, it's Bb-Eb-G-Bb, which is Bb11 or Bb7sus.

And in Ab major, Eb7 is the dominant V7.

Then "Emaj7/Ab" — E major 7th over Ab bass. E major is E-G#-B-D#, over Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

As before, this is Ab7#9 if we take the notes as Ab, B, D#, E, but D# is Eb, so Ab, B, Eb, E.

E and Eb clash.

Notes: Ab, E, G#(Ab), B, D#(Eb) 
So Ab, E, B, Eb

As Ab7#9: Ab-C-Eb-Gb-B, but here we have E instead of C.

So it's Ab7#9 with #11 (E natural), so Ab7#9#11.

Which is a dominant chord for Db.

But in the sequence, after that, it goes to Bbdim, not to Db.

Unless the final Bbdim is meant to be the resolve, but it doesn't.

Perhaps the progression is not ending, or it's a loop.

Given the prevalence of Bb in the bass, and the harmonic minor clues, let's assume the key is Ab minor.

The progression:
- Bbdim: ii° 
- Gb/Bb: VII in third inversion (since Gb/Bb has Bb as fifth)
- Dbm/Ab: iv in first inversion (Dbm/Ab means Ab in bass, so first inversion of Dbm)
- "B/Bb" : likely Eb/Bb for V (Eb major) in second inversion
- Emaj7/Ab: this is trickier. In Ab minor, the tonic is Abm, but Emaj7/Ab is not diatonic. However, Emaj7 = E-G#-B-D#, and G# is Ab, so it's Ab, E, B, Eb as before.

In Ab minor, the natural 7th is Gb, but here we have G# (Ab), which is the natural minor 7th? No, in minor, 7th is whole tone.

Perhaps it's the major V chord or something.

Another possibility: "Emaj7/Ab" is an Abm6 chord misnotated.

Abm6 = Ab-Cb-Eb-F
But E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#, which is not related.

Unless enharmonic: E = Eb, but not.

Let's calculate the notes of Emaj7/Ab:
- Bass: Ab
- Chord: E, G#, B, D# 
- So pitches: Ab, E, Ab, B, Eb (since G# = Ab, D# = Eb)
- Distinct: Ab, B, E, Eb

Ab, B, Eb, E.

Eb and E are a minor second apart — very dissonant.

In practice, this is often interpreted as Cb7#9 or something, but let's see intervals from Ab:
- Ab to B: major 3rd
- Ab to Eb: perfect 5th
- Ab to E: augmented 5th

So it's Ab dominant 7 #9: Ab (root), C (3rd), Eb (5th), Gb (7th), B ( #9)

Here we have B ( #9), and E ( #11) instead of C and Gb.

So it has the #9 and #11, but not the 3rd or 7th.

In jazz, this is common; the chord is implied, and the 3rd/7th may be omitted in the symbol.

So "Emaj7/Ab" is likely a slash chord indicating an Ab7#9#11 sound, with E providing the #11 and #9.

Functionally, it's V7 of Db.

But since it doesn't resolve to Db, and goes to Bbdim, perhaps the intended resolution is to Db, but it's cut off, or in the context, Bbdim is leading to Db.

Bbdim7 to Db: Bbdim7 has Db in it, so it can resolve to Db.

Yes: Bbdim7 (root Bb) resolves to Db (a minor third up).

And for Ab7 to its tonic Db, the standard is Ab7 to Db.

So the sequence "Ab7alt Bbdim" could be Ab7 -> Bbdim7 -> Db, but the Db is not written.

However, in the user's sequence, it ends with "Emaj7/Ab Bbdim", so perhaps the next chord would be Db, but it's not here.

Given that, the key might be Db major.

Let's confirm with the beginning.

In Db major:
- I: Db
- ii: Ebm
- iii: Fm
- IV: Gb
- V: Ab
- vi: Bbm
- vii°: C°

" Bbdim" — if it's Bbdim, this is not vi minor, but if it's Bbm, it would be vi.

Perhaps "dim" is a mistake for "m".

In many transcriptions, "dim" might be used incorrectly for half-diminished or minor.

But the user wrote "dim", so we should assume it's diminished.

Another possibility: the mode is harmonic minor of Db.

Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C, Db

Chords:
- i: Dbm
- ii°: Eb dim
- III+: F aug
- iv: Gbm
- V: Ab
- VI: Bbb
- vii°: C dim

Bbdim is not here. Bb is not in the scale.

Scale degrees: 1.Db, 2.Eb, 3.F, 4.Gb, 5.Ab, 6.Bbb (A), 7.C

So Bb would be between A and C, not a scale degree.

Closest is Bbb (A) for degree 6.

So not matching.

Let's try A# minor, but that's impractical.

Perhaps it's C# minor.

C# minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#

ii°: D#° = D#, F#, A

But our chord is Bbdim, which is Bb-Db-E.

Bb is not in C# minor.

This is not working.

Let's list all the chord roots as seen in the slash notation:

- Bbdim: root Bb
- Gb/Bb: root Gb
- Dbm/Ab: root Db (with Ab bass)
- B/Bb: root B (bass Bb)
- Emaj7/Ab: root E (bass Ab)

So root movement: Bb - Gb - Db - B - E

Gb to Db is perfect 4th down, Db to B is minor 3rd up? Db to B is augmented 2nd (Db-D-Eb-E-F#-G-Ab-A-B? Better: Db to B is: Db-D-Eb-E-F-G-Ab-A-B, so major 6th up, or minor 3rd down enharmonically.

Actually, the root sequence in context: 

The progression has sections where it's two Bbdim, two Gb/Bb, two Bbdim, then Dbm/Ab (one), then B/Bb (one), then two Bbdim, two Gb/Bb, two Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab (one), then Bbdim.

So the distinct chords are:
- Bbdim
- Gb/Bb
- Dbm/Ab
- B/Bb (assumed)
- Emaj7/Ab

Roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E

Notice that Bb, Gb, Db are all minor thirds apart: Bb to Gb is minor third? Bb-A-Ab-Gb, so minor third down.

Gb to Db is perfect 4th, not minor third.

Bb to Gb: Bb-G#-G-Gb? Bb to A is minor second, to Ab minor third. Gb is F#, so Bb to F# is augmented fourth, not minor third.

But in the circle of fifths, Bb, Gb, Db are the flat keys: Db major has 5 flats, Gb has 6, Cb has 7.

Bb is the dominant of Eb, etc.

The roots Bb, Gb, Db, B, E — let's see their pitch classes:

Bb = A#
Gb = F#
Db = C#
B = B
E = E

So: A#, F#, C#, B, E

This looks random.

Bb = 10, Gb = 6, Db = 1, B = 11, E = 4 (in MIDI pitch)

No clear pattern.

Perhaps the bass movement is key.

Bass notes: mostly Bb, with some Ab.

From the slash chords:
- Bbdim: likely Bb bass (since it's not specified otherwise, but "dim" chords may have root in bass)
- Gb/Bb: explicitly Bb bass
- Dbm/Ab: Ab bass
- B/Bb: Bb bass
- Emaj7/Ab: Ab bass

So bass line: 
Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Gb/Bb), Bb (Gb/Bb), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Bbdim), Ab (Dbm/Ab), Bb (B/Bb), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Gb/Bb), Bb (Gb/Bb), Bb (Bbdim), Bb (Bbdim), Ab (Emaj7/Ab), Bb (Bbdim)

So mostly Bb, with Ab at position 7 and 15.

The only changes in bass are to Ab, and it returns to Bb.

So the tonic is likely Bb, but what mode?

If it's Bb major, we have Bbdim which is not diatonic.

If it's Bb minor, same issue.

Unless it's a mode where the ii chord is diminished.

The only major or minor mode where ii is diminished is the natural minor.

In natural minor, ii is diminished.

So for the key to have a diminished ii chord, it must be minor.

So if ii° is Bbdim, then:
ii° = Bb dim
So the tonic is the note where Bb is the second degree.

In natural minor, 2nd degree is the supertonic.

So if supertonic is Bb, then the tonic is Ab (since in minor, 1 to 2 is whole step: Ab to Bb).

Yes! 
- Tonic: Ab
- Supertonic: Bb

So key: Ab minor.

Now, verify the other chords:
- Gb/Bb: Gb major. In Ab minor, Gb is the 7th degree, so VII major.
- Dbm/Ab: Db minor. In Ab minor, Db is the 4th degree, so iv minor.
- "B/Bb": if this is Eb/Bb, then Eb is the 5th degree, so V major or v minor. In natural minor, v is minor, but in harmonic minor, V is major. Given the context, it's likely V major (Eb major) as a harmonic minor inflection.
- Emaj7/Ab: this is problematic, but in Ab minor, the tonic is Abm. Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass and E major 7th, which includes G# (Ab), so it's enharmonically the tonic chord but with major 7th? Abm(maj7) is Ab-Cb-Eb-G, but here we have Ab, B, E, Eb — doesn't match.

However, "Emaj7/Ab" might be a misnotation for "Abmaj7" or something, but it's written as Emaj7/Ab.

Perhaps "Emaj7" is meant to indicate the #9 and #11, so it's Ab7#9#11, but in the context of the minor key, it could be the dominant chord itself.

But for Ab minor, the dominant is Eb, not Ab.

Unless it's the minor i chord with extensions, but Abm is not major 7th.

Another possibility: "Emaj7/Ab" is actually C#m7b5/Ab or something, but let's calculate.

Perhaps the "E" in "Emaj7" is a typo for "Ab" or "Eb".

Given that all other chords fit Ab minor except this one, and assuming it's a dominant chord for the key, but for minor, the dominant is V.

In the sequence, before the last Bbdim, we have "Emaj7/Ab", which is over Ab bass, so if Ab is the tonic, this should be the tonic chord, but it's not minor.

Unless it's the major VI chord or something.

In Ab minor, VI is Fbmaj (E major), so E major is the bVI chord, which is borrowed from parallel major.

bVI is common in minor keys for the Andalusian cadence or something.

For example: i - bVII - bVI - V

In Ab minor: Abm - Gbm - Fbm (E) - Ebm or Eb.

Here, "Emaj7/Ab" has Ab bass, so it's E major in first inversion? E major is E-G#-B, so over Ab: Ab, E, G#, B.

Which is the bVI chord (E major) in first inversion.

And in minor keys, bVI is common.

So "Emaj7/Ab" might be misnotated; it should be "E/Ab" for E major over Ab bass, but it's written as Emaj7/Ab because it's extended.

E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#, so with D# added, but in context, it might be simplified.

So in Ab minor:
- bVI: E major (or E major 7th)

And the progression ends with bVI before going to ii°.

The sequence has "Emaj7/Ab Bbdim" — bVI to ii°.

In minor keys, going from bVI to ii° is common, as in the Andalusian cadence: i - bVII - bVI - V, but here it's different.

A common progression might be bVI - ii° - V - i, but here it's bVI to ii°.

And ii° is Bbdim.

So it fits.

Now, check the problematic "B/Bb".

Between "Dbm/Ab" (iv) and "Bbdim" (ii°), we have "B/Bb".

In Ab minor, after iv, we might have bVI or V.

" B/Bb" with bass Bb, if the chord is B, it could be E/Bb for V.

Eb major over Bb bass.

As discussed, Eb major is E-G#-Bb, over Bb: Bb, Eb, G, Bb.

Which is Bb7sus4 — a common dominant sound.

So "B/Bb" is likely a typo for "E/Bb" (Eb major over Bb bass).

Similarly, in some notations, "B" might be misread for "E" if handwritten.

So assuming that, the progression in Ab minor:

- Bbdim: ii° 
- Gb/Bb: VII (in 3rd inversion)
- Dbm/Ab: iv (in 1st inversion)
- Eb/Bb: V (in 1st inversion? Eb/Bb would be second inversion if Eb is root, but Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, so over Bb bass: Bb, Eb, G — which is second inversion of Eb)

In chord symbols, Eb/Bb means Eb major with Bb in bass, so for Eb major, the bass is the fifth, so it's second inversion.

Yes.

- Emaj7/Ab: bVI (E major) in first inversion, with added 7th

And all chords are diatonic or common borrowings in Ab minor:
- ii°: diatonic (natural or harmonic minor)
- VII: diatonic (natural minor)
- iv: diatonic
- V: diatonic in harmonic minor
- bVI: borrowed from parallel major (Phrygian dominant or common minor progression)

The mode is natural minor for ii°, VII, iv; harmonic minor for V; and parallel major for bVI.

Overall, the tonic is Ab minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian) with inflections for harmonic minor (on V) and major (on bVI).

But the primary mode is natural minor, as ii° and VII are natural minor characteristics.

To confirm, let's see the scale:

Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

Notes used:
- Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb (E) — all in scale
- Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db — all in scale (VII chord)
- Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb, Ab — all in scale (iv chord)
- Eb/Bb: Eb, G, Bb — but G is not in natural minor; natural minor has Fb (E), not G. In natural minor, the leading tone is Gb, not G. So for V major, we need G natural, which is from harmonic minor.
- Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D# — E is Fb (in natural minor), but here it's E natural; G# is Ab; B is enharmonic to Cb in minor scales, but in Ab minor, B is not used; D# is Eb, which is in the scale.

So:
- E natural: not in natural minor (which has E natural? Ab natural minor has Eb as 5th? No:

Ab natural minor scale:
1. Ab
2. Bb
3. Cb (B)
4. Db
5. Eb
6. Fb (E)
7. Gb

So the 6th degree is Fb, which is E natural.

In notation:
- 6th scale degree: F flat, which is E natural.

So E natural is diatonic to Ab natural minor.

Then Emaj7: E major is E, G#, B, D# — but in Ab minor, the notes should be E (Fb), G (Ab), B (Cb), D (Eb).

G# is not G; G# is Ab, which is tonic.

G# = Ab, which is scale degree 1.

B natural = Cb enharmonically? In Ab minor, Cb is scale degree 3, but B natural is not Cb; Cb is B, so B natural is scale degree 3.

D# = Eb, scale degree 5.

So E major is: E, Ab, B, Eb.

Which is:
- E = 6th degree (Fb)
- Ab = 1st degree
- B = 3rd degree (Cb)
- Eb = 5th degree

So the chord is a triad on the 6th degree with added maj7 (Ab), but E major is not diatonic; in natural minor, the 6th degree triad is Fb major (E major), yes!

In Ab natural minor, the chord on the 6th degree (Fb) is Fb major: Fb-Ab-Cb.

Enharmonically, Fb = E, Cb = B, so E major: E-Ab-B? Ab is G#, so E-G#-B.

Yes! Fb major is E major enharmonically.

And in natural minor, it's a major chord on the flattened VI degree (since VI is flattened relative to harmonic minor).

In minor keys, the chord on 6th degree is major in natural minor.

So in Ab minor, bVI is E major.

And Emaj7 is E major 7th: E-G#-B-D#.

D# = Eb, which is the 5th degree of Ab minor.

So D# is Eb, which is diatonic.

Therefore, E major 7th is E-Ab-B-Eb.

Which has all notes diatonic to Ab natural minor scale.

Perfect!

So all chords fit within Ab natural minor:
- Bbdim: ii° = Bb-Db-Fb (Fb=E)
- Gb/Bb: VII = Gb-Bb-Db
- Dbm/Ab: iv = Db-Fb-Ab (in first inversion, Ab bass)
- "B/Bb": should be Eb/Bb for V = Eb-G-Bb (in second inversion, Bb bass) — and G is the leading tone from harmonic minor, but in natural minor it would be Gb. However, in practice, natural minor often uses the harmonic version for V.
- Emaj7/Ab: bVI in first inversion: E-Ab-B-Eb with Ab bass.

Additionally, the "B/Bb" is likely a typo for "E/Bb", as B and E can be confused in handwriting.

Given that, the key is Ab minor, and the mode is natural minor (Aeolian), with a frequent use of harmonic minor inflection on the V chord (Eb major instead of Eb minor).

But since the V chord appears only once, and the ii° is present, natural minor is the base mode.

The progression: 
- ii° (Bbdim) 
- VII (Gb/Bb)
- (repeats)
- iv (Dbm/Ab)
- V (Eb/Bb) — with harmonic minor inflection
- ii° (Bbdim)
- bVI (Emaj7/Ab)

In Ab minor.

So the key is Ab minor.

To specify the mode: natural minor (Aeolian), with occasional harmonic minor alterations.


Based on the chord progression you provided—**Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**—I've analyzed the harmonic structure, common tonal functions, and contextual clues to determine the **key and mode**. Here's a step-by-step breakdown, followed by the conclusion:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Chord Symbols**
- **Bbdim**: This is a **B-flat diminished triad** (Bb-Db-E). In jazz/pop contexts, "dim" often implies a **fully diminished 7th chord** (Bb-Db-E-G), which is common. This chord is **enharmonically identical to E°7, G°7, or C°7** (all share the same pitch collection in equal temperament). Functionally, it often acts as a **common-tone diminished chord** or **secondary leading-tone chord**.
- **Gb/Bb**: G-flat major over Bb bass (Bb-Db-Gb). This functions as **VII in Ab minor** (see below), or as a **Bb7#11 extension** (Bb dominant 7th with #11).
- **Dbm/Ab**: D-flat minor over Ab bass (Ab-Db-Eb). This is **iv in Ab minor** (first inversion of Db minor).
- **B/Bb**: This is problematic. B major over Bb bass (Bb-B-D#) creates severe dissonance (minor 2nd between Bb and B). It's almost certainly a **typo for E/Bb** (Eb major over Bb bass, i.e., Bb-Ab-Eb-G), which functions as **V in Ab minor** (second inversion of Eb major). This is a common mistake in hand-written charts—**B** and **E** can be confused visually (e.g., if "E" was misread as "B").
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7th over Ab bass (Ab-E-G#-B-D#). Enharmonically, this is **Ab-B-Eb-Ab** (since G# = Ab and D# = Eb). It functions as **♭VI (major 7th) in first inversion** for Ab minor (bVI chord borrowed from parallel major).

---

### **Step 2: Key Signature and Diatonic Fit**
The progression centers around **Ab minor (Aeolian mode)** as the primary key. Here's why:

#### **Why Ab Minor?**
- **Bbdim is ii°**: In Ab natural minor (scale: **Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb**), the ii chord is Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb, where Fb = E). This is **diatonic to natural minor** and appears frequently (10x).
- **Gb/Bb is VII**: Gb major (Gb-Bb-Db) is the diatonic **VII chord** in Ab natural minor (7th scale degree chord).
- **Dbm/Ab is iv**: Db minor (Db-Fb-Ab) is the diatonic **iv chord** in Ab minor (4th scale degree minor chord), notated here in first inversion (Ab bass).
- **E/Bb (corrected from "B/Bb") is V**: Eb major (Eb-G-Bb) is the **harmonic minor inflection** of the V chord (in natural minor, v is minor; here G natural = leading tone to Ab). This is common in minor keys for cadential strength.
- **Emaj7/Ab is ♭VI**: E major 7th = E-G#-B-D# (enharmonic to **Fb-Ab-Bb-Eb**), which is **♭VI in Ab minor**. In natural minor, the chord on the 6th scale degree (Fb) is major, making this diatonic. The maj7 extension (Eb) is also diatonic (5th scale degree).

#### **Scale Validation (Ab Natural Minor)**
- Scale: **Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb** (enharmonically: **Ab-Bb-B-Db-Eb-E-Gb**)
- All chord tones fit this scale:
  - Bbdim (Bb-Db-E): E = Fb (6th degree)
  - Gb/Bb (Gb-Bb-Db): Gb = 7th, Bb = 2nd, Db = 4th
  - Dbm/Ab (Ab-Db-Eb): Ab = 1st, Db = 4th, Eb = 5th
  - E/Bb (Bb-Eb-G): G = leading tone (harmonic minor inflection; replaces Gb)
  - Emaj7/Ab (Ab-E-B-Eb): E = Fb (6th), B = Cb (3rd), Eb = 5th

> 💡 **Note on "B/Bb"**: The typo is critical. If it were truly "B/Bb," the chord would be dissonant and non-functional. **Correcting to E/Bb (Eb major)** makes it a perfect V chord in Ab minor, resolving strongly to i. This is a standard harmonic minor trope (e.g., in jazz/salsa minor progressions).

---

### **Step 3: Mode Determination**
- The progression **primarily uses Ab natural minor (Aeolian mode)**, as evidenced by:
  - Diatonic use of **ii° (Bbdim)**, **iv (Dbm)**, **VII (Gb)**, and **♭VI (Emaj7)**.
  - Natural minor's characteristic minor iv and major VII/♭VI chords (common in blues, folk, and rock).
- **Harmonic minor inflection** is present once: **V (Eb major)** replaces v (Eb minor) for cadential drive—this is typical in minor-key music but doesn't override the base mode.
- **No Dorian or Phrygian traits**: The iv is minor (not major for Dorian), and there's no major iv chord (which would indicate harmonic minor as the base mode).

**Conclusion: The mode is Natural Minor (Aeolian).**

---

### **Functional Analysis of the Progression**
Here's how the chords work in **Ab minor**:
```
Bbdim   Bbdim   Gb/Bb   Gb/Bb | Bbdim   Bbdim   Dbm/Ab  E/Bb | Bbdim   Bbdim   Gb/Bb   Gb/Bb | Bbdim   Bbdim   Emaj7/Ab Bbdim  
  ii°      ii°      VII      VII  |  ii°      ii°      iv      V   |  ii°      ii°      VII      VII  |  ii°      ii°      ♭VI      ii°  
```
- **Common-tone passing**: Bbdim (with Bb bass) acts as a chromatic passing chord between VII (Gb) and iv (Dbm), using shared tones (Bb, Db).
- **Harmonic minor cadence**: The **iv → V (Dbm → Eb)** implies a move toward i (Abm), though it cuts short. This is a strong minor-key cadence.
- **♭VI → ii°**: The **Emaj7/Ab → Bbdim** ending suggests an unresolved phrase, common in jazz/folk for modal ambiguity (♭VI is typical in minor, and ii° leads back to tonic).

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **Ab major?**  
  Bbdim is ii° in Ab major, but **Gb/Bb (VII)** and **Dbm/Ab (iv)** are non-diatonic (iv should be major in major keys). Dbm implies minor iv—a natural minor feature.
  
- **Gb minor or Db minor?**  
  Bbdim isn't diatonic to these keys (e.g., in Gb minor, ii° would be Ab°, not Bb°). Chord functions don't align.

- **Dorian mode?**  
  Dorian has a major iv chord (e.g., Db major in Ab Dorian), but here we have **Dbm/Ab** (minor iv).

- **Harmonic minor as base mode?**  
  Possible (V is major), but the frequent use of VII (Gb/Bb) and ♭VI (Emaj7/Ab) point to **natural minor as the foundation**. Harmonic minor would replace VII with vii° and omit ♭VI.

---

### **Final Answer**
- **Key: Ab minor**  
- **Mode: Natural Minor (Aeolian)**  

The progression is a **minor-key vamp with jazz/blues influences**, emphasizing:
- Natural minor diatonicism (ii°, iv, VII, ♭VI),
- A single harmonic minor inflection (V),
- Common-tone diminished chords (Bbdim) for chromatic movement.

This is typical of styles like jazz minor blues, flamenco (Andalusian cadence), or modal folk music. The typo in "B/Bb" (corrected to **E/Bb**) was the only obstacle—once fixed, all chords fit Ab natural minor perfectly. If you have audio or context confirming the bass movement, I can refine this further! 🎹

**Assistant - Qwen 235B**

Let's analyze the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
> Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Dbm/Ab | B/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Emaj7/Ab | Bbdim

---

### Step 1: List the Chords More Clearly

- **Bbdim** — Bb° (Bb–Db–Fb)
- **Gb/Bb** — Gb major with Bb in the bass (i.e., first inversion of Gb major)
- **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor with Ab in the bass (first inversion of Dbm)
- **B/Bb** — B major triad with Bb in bass? That creates a clash — let's check this.
- **Emaj7/Ab** — E major 7 chord with Ab in the bass

Wait — several issues here.

Let’s examine the problematic chords:

---

### 1. **B/Bb** — B major over Bb bass?

- B major = B–D#–F#
- Bb = A# — enharmonic, but Bb ≠ B
- So B/Bb is B–D#–F# over Bb — a tritone between Bb and B, very dissonant.

This is highly unusual. Possibly a typo?

But **B/Bb** might actually mean **B°/Bb**, or **Bdim/Bb**, since Bbdim appears frequently. Or maybe it's supposed to be **B°/Bb**, a common passing chord.

Alternatively, perhaps **B/Bb** means **Bdim/Bb**, which is the same as **Bdim** in first inversion.

- Bdim = B–D–F
- Bdim/Bb? Bb under B–D–F? That would require Bb as the bass.
- But Bdim does not contain Bb.

Wait: Bdim is B–D–F  
Bbdim is Bb–Db–Fb (enharmonic to A)

So they’re different chords.

But Bdim/Bb would be **B–D–F over Bb bass**, which creates a minor 9th interval (Bb–B) — very dissonant.

Alternatively, **maybe it's a typo** and meant to be **Bdim/Bb** but meant **Ab7** or **Bdim**?

Hold that. Let's look at **Emaj7/Ab**.

---

### 2. **Emaj7/Ab** — E–G#–B–D# over Ab bass?

- Ab to E is an augmented 5th — extremely harsh.
- That’s Ab–E—a tritone. In jazz, this might be a #11 or something, but rare.

But wait — perhaps this is **enharmonic reinterpretation**.

Let’s consider:

- **Emaj7/Ab** — maybe this is meant to be **Eb7#11/Ab**? Unlikely.
Alternately, perhaps it's a misspelling and meant to be **Em7/Ab** or **Ab/C**?

But let’s look at the overall harmonic movement.

---

### Step 2: Look for a Tonal Center

We see **Bbdim** repeatedly — often used as a **passing chord** or **common tone diminished chord**.

Also, **Gb/Bb** appears multiple times — Gb major with Bb in bass. So the **third** of Gb is Bb, so this is **first inversion Gb major**.

So **Gb major** is important.

Also, **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor with Ab in bass → third of Dbm is Ab, so again **first inversion** of Dbm.

So we have:
- Gb major (in inversion)
- Db minor (in inversion)
- Bbdim (repeated)
- ?B/Bb?
- Emaj7/Ab?

Hmm.

Let’s look at roots used:

- Bb (from Bbdim, Gb/Bb, B/Bb, Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab)
- Gb (from Gb/Bb)
- Db (from Dbm)
- B? (from B/Bb — questionable)
- Ab (from Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab)
- E? (from Emaj7 — very odd)

But note: **B** and **E** are not in the same key as Bb, Gb, Db.

Unless we consider **enharmonic equivalents**.

Let’s reframe everything in **enharmonic keys**.

---

Try enharmonic equivalents:

- **Gb major** = **F# major** (6 sharps)
- **Bb** = A#
- But that may not help.

Alternatively, consider **Bbdim** — a **common tone diminished chord** — often used to embellish a tonic or dominant.

Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb (Fb = E)

So notes: Bb, Db, E

Wait — Bb, Db, E.

E is enharmonic to Fb, but spelled as E, so this chord has a **major third interval** between Db and E? No — Db to E is augmented 2nd — in equal temperament, it's a minor third? No:

- Db to E = interval of an **augmented 2nd** (in notation), which is 3 semitones — same as minor third.

But in a **diminished chord**, all intervals are minor thirds.

Bbdim should be: Bb–Db–Fb (Fb = E)

So: Bb – Db – E (Fb)

So spelled as: Bb, Db, E — but E is actually Fb — so it's a **diminished triad**.

So notes: Bb, Db, E (Fb)

So pitch set: Bb, Db, E

But E is enharmonic to Fb.

So pitches: **Bb, Db, E**

Now, Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

Ah! So **Bbdim** shares **Bb and Db** with **Gb major**.

In fact, **Bbdim** is a **common-tone diminished chord** based on the **third** of Gb major.

Common-tone diminished chords often serve to embellish a major chord using a dim7 above the root.

So: Gb = Gb, Bb, Db

Bbdim = Bb, Db, Fb — common tones: Bb, Db — so **common-tone diminished chord emphasizing Gb major**.

So **Bbdim → Gb** is a **common tone movement** — likely **Bbdim is decorating Gb**.

Similarly, we see **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor chord in first inversion.

Notes: Ab, Db, Fb

So Dbm = Db, Fb, Ab

Also has Db and Ab.

Now, Bbdim has Bb, Db, Fb (E) — so common tones: Db, Fb with Dbm.

So Bbdim also shares notes with Dbm.

So Bbdim could be **decorating either Gb or Dbm**.

Now, later we have **Emaj7/Ab**

Emaj7 = E, G#, B, D#

With **Ab** in bass.

Ab = G#

Wait — Ab = G# enharmonically.

So **Ab in bass = G#**, which is the **third of E major**.

So if **Ab = G#**, then **Emaj7/Ab** is actually **Emaj7/G#**, which is second inversion of **Emaj7** — which is a **very normal voicing**.

So likely, **"Emaj7/Ab" is meant to be Emaj7/G#"**, not Ab.

Similarly, **"B/Bb"** — B major over Bb bass?

But B and Bb are a half step apart.

But **B/Bb** — if Bb is actually **A#**, and **B** is the chord, then perhaps **B/A#** — which is **B major over A#**, i.e., **Bmaj7/A#** or just **B major in close position**?

But still odd.

But wait — **Bdim** is B–D–F — notes a m3 apart.

If we consider **Bdim/Bb**, but Bb = A# — then B–D–F over A# — that’s A#–B = minor 2nd, very dissonant.

But here's a better idea: perhaps the chord **"B/Bb"** is a typo, and it's meant to be **Bdim/Ab** or **Bdim/Cb**?

Wait — look at the progression:

> ... Dbm/Ab | B/Bb ...

After **Dbm/Ab** (Ab–Db–Fb) comes **B/Bb**

But **B** and **Dbm** don't go together.

Wait — what if **"B/Bb"** is meant to be **"Bdim"** — and "B/Bb" is a typo?

Or **"Ab7"**?

Alternatively — here's a theory.

Let’s look at the entire sequence in **pitches**:

Let’s assume all are real and interpret enharmonically.

List all chord pitches:

1. **Bbdim** = Bb, Db, Fb (E)
2. **Gb/Bb** = Bb, Gb, Bb, Db → notes: Gb, Bb, Db
3. **Dbm/Ab** = Ab, Db, Fb
4. **B/Bb** = Bb, B, D#, F#
   - Very dissonant — Bb and B clash, D# vs Db, F# vs Fb
   - Not likely intended.

   Unless **"B/Bb"** is **"B°/Bb"** = Bdim with Bb bass — Bdim = B, D, F — over Bb

   So pitches: Bb, B, D, F — still Bb–B clash.

5. **Emaj7/Ab** = Ab, E, G#, B, D#
   - Ab and E = tritone
   - G# = Ab, so Ab–Ab = same pitch (if G# = Ab)
   - So if G# = Ab, then the chord has Ab (G#) in bass, and G# in chord — OK.
   - But E and Ab are tritone — fine in a dominant chord.

Wait — **E, G#, B, D#** over **Ab (G#)** is the same as:
- Bass: G#
- Chord: E, G#, B, D#

So it's **Emaj7/G#**, which is **second inversion Emaj7** — fine.

So **Emaj7/Ab** is just **Emaj7/G#** — not an issue.

Now, what about **"B/Bb"**?

Maybe it's **Bdim**, and the "/Bb" is a typo or mislabel.

Alternatively, consider that **"B/Bb"** could be **Cbb**, but no.

Another idea: in jazz, **B/Bb** sometimes means **B7/Bb**, which is **B7 in third inversion**.

B7 = B–D#–F#–A

B7/Bb? Bb is not in B7 — B7 has A, not Bb.

Unless it’s **B7/A**, but A ≠ Bb.

But **A = G#**, **Bb = A#**

So no.

But **B7** has A natural — so **B7/A** would be third inversion.

But labeled **B/Bb**, only if A was misread as Bb — which is a common **notation error** in some fake books.

So **perhaps "B/Bb" is meant to be "B7/A"** → B7 in third inversion.

That makes sense.

So: **B7/A** — chord: B–D#–F#–A, bass: A

Now, **what key has B7?**

B7 is the **V7 of Emaj**.

And we have **Emaj7** later: **Emaj7/Ab**

And **G#** is the third of Emaj.

So if **B7** leads to **Emaj7**, that’s **V7–I in E major**.

But then the rest of the chords are in **Gb, Bb, Db** — all flats.

But E major = 4 sharps.

But let’s check: are any of these chords enharmonic to E key?

- Gb major = F# major — 6 sharps
- Bb = A# — in F# major
- Bbdim = A#° — could be chord in C# minor or F# major?

Wait.

Let’s try **enharmonic reinterpretation** of the entire progression.

---

### Enharmonic Rewrite

Let’s rewrite everything in sharps.

- **Bb** = A#
- **Gb** = F#
- **Db** = C#
- **Ab** = G#
- **E** = E

So progression becomes:

> A#° | A#° | F#/A# | F#/A# | A#° | A#° | C#m/G# | B/A# | A#° | A#° | F#/A# | F#/A# | A#° | A#° | Emaj7/G# | A#°

Now:

- **F# major** — key of **C# minor** or **F# major**
- **C#m** — so C# minor chord
- **Emaj7/G#** — E major 7, G# in bass — G# is the 3rd of E
- **B/A#** — B over A#? B major chord: B, D#, F#

Now, **B7** would be **B, D#, F#, A**

But here it’s labeled **B/A#** — and A# = Bb — but if B7/A# is intended, but B7 has **A natural**, not A#.

So **B7/A** = B–D#–F#–A over A — so **A** in bass.

But **A# ≠ A** — a half step apart.

So cannot be.

But what if **B/A#** is **Bdim/A#**?

Bdim = B, D, F

Over A#? Still doesn't match.

Wait — A#° = Bbdim = Bb, Db, E

E = Fb

But in sharp terms: A#, C#, E

So A#° = A#, C#, E

Now, **E** is common to both **E major** and **C# minor**.

Now, look:

- We have **F#/A#** = F# over A# → F#, A#, C# — F# major in first inversion
- C#m/G# = C#, E, G# — C# minor, first inversion
- A#° = A#, C#, E
- Emaj7/G# = E, G#, B, D#, G# (bass) — so E, G#, B, D#

Now, **B chord?** — "B/A#" — if it's just **B**, major — B, D#, F#

But in key of C# minor or E major, D# is natural.

C# natural minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B

So **D# is in the scale**.

But **F#** is also in C# minor.

Now, **B major chord** (B, D#, F#) — is this diatonic?

In C# minor, the **V chord** is **G# diminished** — not B major.

But **B major** = **III chord in G# minor**.

Wait.

In C# **harmonic** minor: raise the 7th → C# D# E F# G# A B#

So **B# dim** is vii° — not B major.

But **B major** is not in C# minor.

But B major is **V of Emaj**.

And we have **Emaj7** — so possible.

So let’s suppose: **B major** → **Emaj7**

That's **V–I** in **E major**.

E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

Now, chords:

- F# major — that’s **ii** in E major
- C# minor — that’s **vi** in E major
- A#° — A#, C#, E — notes: A#, C#, E

In E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

A# is not in E major — A# is **leading tone to B**, but E major has **B natural**, not B#.

A# is **not in E major** — E major has **A natural**.

So A#° is **not diatonic** to E major.

But **A#°** is chromatic.

However, **A#° = C#° = E° = G#°** — all the same dim7 chord.

A#° = A#, C#, E, G

But we only have **Bbdim**, which is **three-note** — not full dim7.

Still, A#° = A#, C#, E — which is **G#° missing the G natural**.

In **E major**, we can have **common-tone diminished chords**.

For example, **C#°** could be a common-tone leading to C# minor.

But here, **A#°** — A#, C#, E — common tone with **F# major**? F# has A#? F# = F#, A#, C#

Yes! F# major = F#, A#, C#

So A#° = A#, C#, E — shares **A# and C#** with F# major.

So **A#° is a common-tone diminished chord for F# major**, using the **third** as the common tone.

Common practice: **ii°/ii** or **vii°/ii** to embellish ii chord.

Similarly, **C#m/G#** — C#, E, G#

A#° also has **C# and E** — so common tone with C# minor.

So A#° can decorate **C#m** too.

Then **B/A#** — if it's **B major over A# bass**, then:

- B major = B, D#, F#
- A# bass = A#

B to A# = minor 2nd — harsh

But in **E major**, **B major chord** is the **V chord** — dominant.

But why put A# under it?

Unless it's a **passing bass line**.

Let’s look at the bass line:

From the progression:

- Bbdim → bass: Bb
- Gb/Bb → bass: Bb
- Bbdim → Bb
- Gb/Bb → Bb
- Bbdim → Bb
- Dbm/Ab → Ab
- B/Bb → Bb
- Bbdim → Bb
- Gb/Bb → Bb
- Dbm/Ab → Ab
- Emaj7/Ab → Ab
- Bbdim → Bb

Wait — bass line:

- Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Ab, Bb

So mostly **Bb**, then **Ab**, then **Bb**, and finally **Ab** to **Bb**

But **Ab to Bb** is a major 2nd.

But **Ab** is also the **third of Emaj7** — so **Emaj7/Ab** means Ab in bass.

So bass: Ab → then Bbdim → Bb

So **Ab–Bb** — rising major 2nd.

But the chord before Ab is **B/Bb** with **Bb** in bass — so Bb → Ab? That would be descending.

Let’s lay it out:

Before **Dbm/Ab**: Bbdim (Bb)
Then **Dbm/Ab**: Ab
Then **B/Bb**: Bb
Then Bbdim: Bb
...
Then **Emaj7/Ab**: Ab
Then Bbdim: Bb

So bass line snippet:

...Bb (Bbdim) → Ab (Dbm/Ab) → Bb (B/Bb) → Bb (Bbdim)...

So Ab–Bb — a major 2nd.

Then later: Bb → Bb → Bb → Ab (Emaj7) → Bb

So **Ab–Bb** movement.

Now, in **E major**, **Bb** is **C flat**, not used.

But if we consider **enharmonic to A#**, then in **B major** or **E major**, A# is Bb — still foreign.

But here's a better idea: **this progression is in Gb major**, and the last chord is not Emaj7 but something else.

Wait — **Emaj7/Ab** — Ab is the **ninth** of Gb major? Gb major: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

So Ab is the **2nd/9th**.

So if we have Gb major, and a chord with **E** — that’s not in Gb.

E = Fb — so Fb.

But **Emaj7** = E, G#, B, D#

E = Fb, G# = Ab, B = Cb, D# = Eb

So **Enharmonically: Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb**

That's **Gb7** without the root!

Gb7 = Gb, Bb, Db, Fb

But we have Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb

Not the same.

Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb = **Fb minor 7 (Fbm7)**?

Fbm = Fb, Abb, Cb

No.

Alternatively, **Ab7** = Ab, C, Eb, Gb

We have: Ab, Cb (B), Eb, Fb — so **Ab, Cb, Eb, Fb** — that’s **Ab7(b9)** — Ab–Cb–Eb–Gb–Bbb, but here we have Fb instead of Gb.

Fb = E, Gb = F#.

No.

Wait — Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb

Intervals from Fb:
- Fb–Ab = major 3rd
- Fb–Cb = perfect 5th
- Fb–Eb = major 7th

So **Fbmaj7**?

Fbmaj7 = Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb — yes!

And Fbmaj7 = **enharmonic to Emaj7**

Yes!

So **Emaj7/Ab** = Fbmaj7/Ab — Fb major with Ab in bass.

Fbmaj7 = Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb

Bass: Ab — so **first inversion** of Fbmaj7.

Now, Fb = Gb? No.

But in practical terms, **Fb = E**, so keyboard pitch same as E.

But in harmony, if the key is **Gb major**, then:

- Gb major: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F
- Fb = E — but in Gb, the leading tone is F natural.
- Fb = E is enharmonic to the **6th degree down a half step** — not diatonic.

But **Fbmaj7** is **bVIIImaj7** in Gb? Gb has F naturals.

No.

But here's the key insight:

We have:

- **Bbdim** — Bb–Db–Fb — Fb = E
- **Gb/Bb** — Gb major
- **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor
- **Fbmaj7/Ab** — Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb

All these chords have **Ab, Bb, Db, Fb** = **Eb**

List the notes used:

- Bb, Db, Fb, Ab, Gb, Cb, Eb

So: Bb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Cb

That’s: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab

That’s the **Bb major scale**! But with **no A natural** — all flats.

Bb major: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A

But we have Cb, Db, instead of C, D; Fb instead of F; Gb instead of G; Ab instead of A.

So this is actually the **Gb major scale**:

Gb major = Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

Compare:

- Bb = Bb
- Db = Db
- Fb = E = not in Gb major — Gb major has F natural
- Fb = E is **not in Gb major**

Gb major has F natural.

But we have Fb = E natural.

So it's **not Gb major**.

Unless it's **G# major**, but unlikely.

Another idea: perhaps the key is **C# minor**.

C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#

B# = C

But we have Bb = A#

A# is not in C# minor.

This is difficult.

### Revelation: Common-tone diminished progression

The chord Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb) appears over and over, often alternating with Gb/Bb.

Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db
Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb

So common tones: Bb, Db

So Bbdim is a **common-tone diminished chord for Gb major**, specifically the **third-based ct° chord**.

Similarly, when it goes to Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb, Ab

Bbdim has Db, Fb — so common with Dbm.

And Fb = E, but in context, it's acting as a passing note.

Then we have Emaj7/Ab — which is Fbmaj7/Ab

Fb = E, so it's a chromatic major chord.

But in **Gb major**, the bVI chord is Eb major, not E major.

So this is chromatic.

But consider that **Emaj7/Ab = Fbmaj7/Ab**, and Fb is the **b3 of Dbm chord? No.

Perhaps the progression is in **Bb minor**.

Bb minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Abb

Common chords:
- Bbdim? No, i° in Bb minor is not stable.
- Gb = VI
- Dbm = ii or iv? Db = third scale degree.

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Abb

So:
- Gb = VI
- Dbm = iii
- Bbdim = degree i° — possible

But Bb dim is not a tonic chord.

And Emaj7 not in scale.

But if Bb harmonic minor: raise the 7th to A natural.

Bb, C, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, A

Then A is major.

But we have E major, not A.

Another possibility: **The key is Gb major, and "Emaj7" is a chromatic passing chord**.

But the most likely explanation is that this is a **jazz progression** centered on **Dbm and Gb**, with **common-tone diminished chords**, and the final Emaj7 is a **tonic chord in E major**, but that doesn't fit.

Given the prominence of Gb and Bb, and the bass line alternating Bb and Ab, and the final move to Emaj7/Ab, it's possible this is a **modal interchange** or **chromatic passing**.

But after careful analysis, the most coherent interpretation is:

### Final Analysis:

The chord progression is in **Bb minor**, and uses:

- Bbdim as a common-tone chord to Gb and Dbm
- Gb = VI
- Dbm = #iv (not diatonic) — so not likely.

Wait — if **Bb minor**, Db = minor third, so Dbm = biii

In Bb minor:
- i: Bbmin
- biii: Dbm
- VI: Gb

Yes! Gb is VI in Bb minor.

In Bb minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb, Abb (G)

So:
- **Gb** = VI — major
- **Dbm** = biii — minor
- **Bbdim** — not diatonic, but could be a chromatic passing chord
- **Bbdim** could be interpreted as the **vii° of Cb**, not helpful.

But Bbdim has Bb, Db, Fb — Fb = E, which is the 5th of Bb minor.

In Bb minor, the 5th is Fb (E) — yes.

But the chord is Bbdim, not Bbm.

So not tonic.

But the bass is often Bb, and chords are around Bb.

Yet the final chord is Emaj7, which is foreign.

Unless the **"Emaj7/Ab"** is not a chord in E, but a **spelling for Ab7#11 or something**.

Ab7 with G# = #11.

Ab7 = Ab, C, Eb, Gb
G# = #11 if you spell it as such.

But here the chord is "Emaj7" — E, G#, B, D# — so not Ab7.

I think the only way this makes sense is if the final chord is a **tonic chord in E major**, and the rest is a chromatic approach.

Given the B7 chord (from B/Bb likely being B7) resolving to Emaj7, it's likely that the key is **E major**, and the earlier chords are chromatic or passing.

**B/Bb** is probably B7/A, bass mistake.

So progression: common-tone diminished in F#/C#, then B7, then Emaj7.

So the mode is **E major (Ionian)**.

### Conclusion:

**Key: E major**  
**Mode: Ionian**

The progression uses common-tone diminished chords to decorate F#m or F# major (ii), then moves to B7 (V), resolving to Emaj7 (I).

The "Gb" is F#, "Bbdim" is A#°, "Dbm" is C#m, "Ab" is G#.

So it's a **progression in E major** with chromatic embellishments.

**Final Answer: Key is E major, mode is Ionian.**

**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the key and mode of this chord progression: Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim. Hmm, this looks complicated with all the diminished chords and slash chords. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that diminished chords are usually built on the seventh degree of the major scale or as part of a diminished seventh. But Bbdim is a B flat diminished chord. Let me write out the notes in Bbdim. A diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Bb, Db, Fb (which is E). Wait, but sometimes diminished chords are written with a half-diminished symbol (ø), but here it's just "dim", so it's fully diminished. So Bbdim would be Bb, Db, Fb (E), and if it's a seventh chord, it would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb (which is G). But maybe the user just wrote "Bbdim" for the triad. Similarly, Dbm/Ab – Db minor with Ab in the bass. B/Bb is B major with Bb in the bass? Wait, that seems odd. Wait, slash chords: the note before the slash is the chord, the note after is the bass note. So Gb/Bb means Gb chord with Bb in the bass. Similarly, Dbm/Ab is Db minor chord with Ab in the bass. B/Bb is B major chord with Bb in the bass? Wait, B/Bb would be a B chord with Bb as the bass note. But that would mean the chord is B major but the bass is Bb, so the notes would be B, D#, F# with Bb in the bass? That seems to create a B7 chord maybe? Wait, B major is B D# F#, so B/Bb bass would be Bb, B, D#, F#? But that's a bit unusual. Maybe it's a typo? Or maybe it's supposed to be Bb/B? No, the slash chord notation is chord/bass note. So B/Bb is a B chord in root position but with the bass being Bb. So the bass note is Bb, and the chord is B major. So the notes would be Bb (bass), then B, D#, F# above. That's a bit strange. But maybe it's a specific inversion where the bass is Bb, but the chord is B major. So that would be a B major triad with Bb in the bass, which would make it B/Bb = B major with bass note Bb. Hmm, okay.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab is E major 7th chord with Ab in the bass. Let's parse all these.

Let me list out each chord:

1. Bbdim
2. Bbdim
3. Gb/Bb
4. Gb/Bb
5. Bbdim
6. Bbdim
7. Dbm/Ab
8. B/Bb
9. Bbdim
10. Bbdim
11. Gb/Bb
12. Gb/Bb
13. Bbdim
14. Bbdim
15. Emaj7/Ab
16. Bbdim

So let's start analyzing. Let's see what key this might be in.

First, Bbdim is Bb diminished. The notes of Bbdim triad are Bb, Db, Fb (E). But if it's a diminished seventh chord, it would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb (G). But maybe the user is using just the triad.

Gb/Bb: So the chord is Gb major (or maybe Gb minor? But usually if it's just the root, it's major unless specified. But in slash chords, the chord symbol before the slash is the chord quality, so Gb/Bb means Gb major chord with Bb bass. So the Gb chord would have notes Gb, Bb, Db. Then the bass is Bb, so the chord is Gb with Bb in the bass. So the notes would be Bb (bass), Gb, Bb, Db? Wait, but Gb is the root, so the Gb chord is Gb, Bb, Db. So with Bb in the bass, it's still the same notes: Bb as bass, then Gb, Bb, Db above. So it's a Gb triad in first inversion? Wait, Gb first inversion would be Bb as the bass note. Yes, because the root is Gb, so first inversion would have Bb as bass, second inversion Db. So Gb/Bb is Gb chord in first inversion.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. So the Db minor triad is Db, Fb (E), Ab. So with Ab in the bass, that would be Ab as the bass note, so Db minor chord in second inversion: Ab, Db, Fb (E).

B/Bb: B major chord with Bb bass. So chord notes of B major: B, D#, F#. Then bass is Bb. So Bb, B, D#, F#. So that's B major in some inversion with Bb bass. But B major triad's notes don't include Bb. So this would create a dissonant chord perhaps. But maybe it's a Gb chord with a different name? Wait, if you have Bb in the bass, and B, D#, F#, then it's Bb, B, D#, F# – which could be thought of as a B Major 7th with a flat 9 or something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's written wrong? Maybe Bb/B? Which would be Bb major with B in the bass. But the user wrote B/Bb.

Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th chord with Ab bass. E major 7th is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab in bass. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#? That seems odd. The notes might be Ab, E, G#, B, D#, which would be a bit messy, but maybe Ab is the bass note, and the chord above is E major 7th.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe looking at all the chord names, let's see possible key centers.

Looking at all the chords: Bbdim, Gb, Dbm, B, Emaj7. Let's see.

Bbdim is a common chord in Bb minor? Wait, but diminished chords often function as vii° in a major key or the vii° in a minor key. Let's check.

Alternatively, let's consider the chords present. Let's list the chord roots:

Bb (dim), Gb, Db, B, E. Wait, B major, E major 7th. Also Db minor.

Wait, Dbm is Db minor. So Dbm. Let's see.

Looking at chord roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E. Wait, but the keys here...

Wait, Bb dim is usually part of the Bb harmonic minor or natural minor? But let's see.

Another approach: Let's think about the chord names as written. Let's take the slash chords and see what's happening.

Gb/Bb: Gb major with Bb bass. So as mentioned, Gb major triad is Gb-Bb-Db. Bass note Bb, so inversion.

Dbm/Ab: Db minor triad (Db-Fb-Ab), bass Ab. So Ab-Db-Fb (E).

B/Bb: B major triad (B-D#-F#) with Bb bass. So the bass note is Bb, which is not part of B major, so this might be a non-diatonic chord, or perhaps it's an E7 chord or something else? Wait, maybe a different interpretation.

Wait, if the chord is B/Bb, maybe it's actually a Bb something chord. But usually slash chords are chord/bass, so B/Bb is chord B with bass Bb. But B major and Bb bass would have notes Bb in the bass then B, D#, F# above. That seems conflicting. Maybe there's a typo? Like Bb/B, which would be Bb major with B in the bass. But that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the "B" in B/Bb is a typo and should be Bb/B. But not sure.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th chord (E, G#, B, D#) with Ab bass. So Ab as bass. So that would create notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Which is a bit dissonant. Maybe the chord is functioning as a different chord? Alternatively, maybe it's Ab major? No, it's written as Emaj7/Ab.

Alternatively, perhaps the slash chords are indicating the bass note of the chord, so in any case, we have to see what notes the chord contains.

Alternatively, maybe some of these chords are actually part of a larger key. Let's try to see if chords like Gb, Db, Bb might point to a key.

Wait, Gb is the same as F#, Db same as C#, but maybe in a flat key. Let's see.

Bb major key has Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A. But Bbdim is the vii° chord in C minor, or the vii° in Bb major? Wait, in Bb major, the seventh degree is A, so A diminished chord. So no. Wait, in major keys, the vii° chord is on the leading tone. So in Bb major, the leading tone is A, so A dim. So Bbdim would not be a natural chord in Bb major. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Eb major? In Eb major, the chords are Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim. D diminished? So Ddim would be Di, but Bbdim would be... Let's check. Eb major: chord on Bb would be Bb major. So no. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's check Bbdim as a diminished chord. Diminished chords often function as passing chords or part of a diminished seventh chord progression.

Alternatively, let's consider the possibility of the key being Db major. Let's check Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. In Db major, the vii° chord would be Cdim, so not Bbdim. Bbdim is a chord on Bb, so in Db major, the chords: Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Ab, Bbm, Cdim. So Bb would be the sixth degree, Bbm. So Bbdim isn't in Db major.

Hmm. Maybe the key is Bb minor? Let's check Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. The chords would be Bbm, Cdim, Dbsus2, Ebm, Fm, Gbaug, Ab. Wait, natural minor: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, vii°? Wait, maybe different. Let's get precise.

Bb natural minor (Aeolian):

Notes: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

Chords built on each degree:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db (major?)

Wait, no. Wait, in natural minor, the chords are:

i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, vii°.

So for Bb minor:

Bbm (i), Cdim (ii°), Db (III), Ebm (iv), Fm (v), Gb (VI?), Ab (vii°). Wait, no. Wait, chords built on each note:

Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb

So triads:

Bb - Db - F = Bbm

C - Eb - Gb = Cdim

Db - F - Ab = Db major

Eb - Gb - Bb = Ebm

F - Ab - C = Fm

Gb - Bb - Db = Gb major

Ab - C - Eb = Ab major

Wait, but in Bb minor natural, the chords would be:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

vii°: Ab minor?

Wait, actually, the seventh chord would be Ab, C, Eb. Which is Ab major? No, Ab, C, Eb is Ab major? Wait, Ab (root), C (major third), Eb (perfect fifth). So yes, Ab major. But in minor key, the vii° chord should be diminished. Wait, no: the seventh degree of Bb minor is Ab. So chord on Ab would be Ab, C, Eb. Which is Ab major. But for natural minor, the vii° chord would be a diminished chord. Wait, no. Wait, let's see:

Wait, natural minor is the same as the relative major's Aeolian mode. So Bb minor is relative to Db major. Let's check Db major chords.

Db major: notes Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords:

I: Db

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

Ah, right. So Bb minor is the relative minor of Db major. So chords in Db major:

I: Db major

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

So in that case, the natural minor of Bb would have chords as per Db major.

But in any case, looking at the chord progression given: Bbdim, which is not the same as Cdim. Bbdim would be a diminished chord on Bb. In Db major scale, there is a Cdim chord, but BBDIM would be Bb, Db, Fb (E). Let's see: Bb, Db, Fb – which would be a diminished triad. But in Db major scale, is there a Bbdim? Db scale has notes Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So the Bb note is the sixth degree. So chord built on Bb in Db major would be Bb, D, F? Wait, no: Db major scale notes:

1. Db

2. Eb

3. F

4. Gb

5. Ab

6. Bb

7. C

So chord on Bb (6th degree): notes Bb, Db, F. Which is Bb minor? Bb, Db, F – yes, Bbm. So not diminished. So Bbdim isn't in Db major.

Hmm, getting stuck. Maybe think of this as possible key with flat 2 or something. Alternatively, maybe the key is Gb major, but that's unlikely. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's think about the chord B/Bb. If B major with Bb bass. Let's think of the function. If we have B and Bb together, that creates a minor second interval. So that chord B/Bb would have B and Bb, which is very dissonant. Maybe it's actually a Bb major chord with a B in the bass? But that's written as Bb/B. But user wrote B/Bb. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be Bb/B.

Alternatively, maybe in the context of the song, B/Bb is meant to be Bb major in second inversion? Not sure. Let's see. Let's assume for a moment that B/Bb is actually Bb/B, which would be Bb major chord with B in bass. But that's not standard. Usually, slash chords denote the bass note. But perhaps there's confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe all these chords are in a key that has a Bb, Db, F, etc.

Wait, another approach: let's look at all the unique chord roots and the notes in the chords.

Let's list each chord's notes:

1. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb (E)

Assuming it's a triad, diminished.

2. Bbdim: same

3. Gb/Bb: chord is Gb major (Gb, Bb, Db), bass Bb. So notes: Bb (bass), Gb, Bb, Db

4. Gb/Bb: same

5. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb

6. Bbdim: same

7. Dbm/Ab: Db minor (Db, Fb, Ab), bass Ab. So Ab, Db, Fb

8. B/Bb: B major chord (B, D#, F#), bass Bb. So Bb, B, D#, F#

9. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb

10. Bbdim: same

11. Gb/Bb: same as 3 and 4

12. Gb/Bb: same

13. Bbdim: same

14. Bbdim: same

15. Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 (E, G#, B, D#), bass Ab. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#

16. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb

So now, looking at all these notes. Let's list all unique notes:

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E (since Fb is E)

From Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db

Dbm/Ab: Db, Eb (Fb), Ab

B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D#, Ab

Wait, let's collect all the notes present:

Bb, Db, E (Fb), Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#, and F#? Wait:

From B/Bb: B, D#, F#, and Bb bass.

From Emaj7: E, G#, B, D#

So notes present:

Bb, Db, E, Gb, Db, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#, Ab. Wait:

Let's list all unique pitches:

Bb, Db, E (which is same as Fb), Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#.

So:

Bb, B, Db, D#, E (Fb), F#, Gb, G#, Ab.

Hmm. This is a lot of chromatic notes. But maybe this is a key with several accidentals.

Wait, but this seems too chromatic for a standard key. Unless it's a modal mixture or something.

Alternatively, maybe the chords are functioning in a specific key despite the chromaticism.

Alternatively, think of Gb/Bb. If Gb is the same as F#, but usually in flat keys.

Wait, another idea: sometimes in jazz or some contexts, a Bbdim chord is part of the leading tone diminished chord in the key of C. Let's see. For example, in C major, the vii° is Bdim, which is B, D, F. But here it's Bbdim. If someone is in a key that's using Bb as the leading tone.

Wait, if we consider the key of C minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. The vii° chord would be Bdim, which is B, D, F. But we have Bbdim. Hmm.

Wait, in Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. Then Bbdim would be Bb, Db, Fb. But in Db major, the chord on Bb is Bb minor (Bb, Db, F), but here it's diminished (Bb, Db, Fb). So Fb instead of F natural? In Db major, F is natural, so Fb would be E natural. So maybe not.

Alternatively, if the key is C# minor. But this is getting complicated.

Another approach: look at the chord B/Bb. If it's a B major chord with Bb bass, that chord would have B and Bb together, which is a minor second. That's very dissonant. Maybe it's a typo for Bb/B, which would be Bb major in first inversion (Bb/D/F in bass? No: Bb/B would be Bb major chord with B in the bass. So notes B, Bb, D, F. Which is a bit messy but possible. B and Bb together again.

Alternatively, maybe the slash chords are indicating the bass note, but the chord quality is different. Like Dbm/Ab – Db minor with Ab in bass. But Dbm chord is Db, Fb, Ab. So Ab in bass is just second inversion: Ab, Db, Fb.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7 chord, Ab bass. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#. So the notes here would be Ab, B, D#, E, G#. So that's a chord that includes Ab, B (which is Cb?), no. Wait, Ab to B is a minor third, but Ab to B is enharmonically G#. Wait, no. Ab to B: Ab, A, Bb, B – so actually Ab to B is a major third. Wait, Ab, Bb, B. So Ab to B is three half steps? No: Ab to A is one, A to Bb is two, Bb to B is three? Wait, no. Wait, Ab to A is one semitone, A to Bb is another, but actually Ab, A, Bb, B. So intervals: Ab to B is three semitones (Ab->A: 1, A->Bb: 2, Bb->B: 3), so minor third. Hmm, maybe. Not sure.

Wait, let's think of the chord Emaj7/Ab. E major 7th is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab in bass. So the bass note is Ab, then above it: E, G#, B, D#. So the notes present are Ab, E, G#, B, D#. What key is that? Not obvious.

Alternatively, maybe all these chords are related to the key of C minor? Let's see. C minor has chords like Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb. Not sure.

Wait, another idea. The presence of Bbdim and Gb might indicate the key of F minor? Wait, F minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. Not sure.

Alternatively, think of the chord Gb/Bb. If the chord is Gb major, with Bb in the bass. So in the key of Db major, Gb is the IV chord. Db major – V is Ab, IV is Gb. So Gb chord. So if there's a lot of Gb chords with Bb bass (first inversion), then maybe in Db major. Let's check Db major.

Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords as per:

I: Db

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

So chords present in Db major: Gb is the IV chord. So Gb triad is Gb, Bb, Db. Which matches Gb/Bb chord (as first inversion). Dbm would be the iii chord? Wait no. Db major iii is Fm. Hmm. Wait, Db major scale notes: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

So chord on Db: Db major.

Chord on Eb: Eb minor.

Chord on F: F minor.

Chord on Gb: Gb major (IV).

Chord on Ab: Ab major (V).

Chord on Bb: Bb minor (vi).

Chord on C: C diminished (vii°).

So if we have Dbm chord, that would be Db minor. But in Db major, the i chord is Db major. So Db minor would be outside the key. Unless it's a modal interchange.

But our chord progression has Dbm/Ab. So Db minor chord with Ab bass. In Db major, Db minor isn't a chord. So perhaps the key isn't Db major.

Alternatively, if we're in Bb minor. Let's check.

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

vii°: Abdim? Wait, no. Chord on Ab: Ab, C, Eb. Which is Ab major. But in natural minor, the VII chord is major. Wait, in minor keys, the VII chord is usually major. Yes.

Wait:

Natural minor scale:

Tonic: Bbm

Supertonic: Cdim

Mediant: Db

Subdominant: Ebm

Dominant: Fm

Submediant: Gb

Subtonic: Ab

Wait, Ab is major. So Bb natural minor chords: Bbm, Cdim, Db major, Ebm, Fm, Gb major, Ab major.

So in this case, if we have Dbm chord listed. But in Bb minor, the mediant chord is Db major, not minor. So Dbm would be outside the scale. Similarly, the chord Bbdim – in Bb minor scale, the ii° chord is Cdim. So there's no Bbdim chord. Hmm.

Another idea: maybe it's Gb major? Let's check Gb major:

Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Wait, notes: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F.

Chords:

I: Gb

ii: Abm

iii: Bbm

IV: Cb (B)

V: Db

vi: Ebm

vii°: Fdim

So chords here: Gb major, Abm etc. So Db is the V chord. If our progression has Db chord... Well, we have Dbm/Ab, which is Db minor. But in Gb major, Db is a major chord (V), so Dbm would not be part of that key.

Hmm. Maybe the key is C minor? C minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

vii°: Bbdim!

Ah! Wait, in C minor, the vii° chord is Bb diminished. Yes. Because the leading tone in C minor is Bb (natural minor), but harmonic minor would raise the 7th to B natural. Wait, in natural minor, seventh degree is Bb, so the vii° chord would be Bb, Db, Fb (E). Which is Bbdim. Yes! So in C natural minor, the vii° chord is Bb diminished.

C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chord built on Bb: Bb (root), Db (minor third), Fb (diminished fifth, which is E natural). So yes, Bbdim chord.

So the vii° in C minor natural is Bbdim.

In harmonic minor, the vii° would be different because the 7th is raised. But in natural minor, it's Bbdim.

So if the key is C minor, let's see.

Now, let's see the other chords in the progression.

In C natural minor, chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

vii°: Bbdim

So if the key is C minor, Bbdim is present. Now looking at the other chords in the progression:

Gb/Bb – Gb major chord. In C minor, what is Gb? The scale of C minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Gb would be the note Gb, which is not in C minor. Unless we're considering something else. Wait, Gb is enharmonic to F#. Not sure.

Wait, in C minor natural, the chords would be built on the scale. But Gb isn't in the scale. So maybe this is a different key.

Wait, but another thought: in C minor harmonic minor, the 7th degree is raised to B natural, but that would make the chord on B to be Bdim or Bmaj7? Not sure. But maybe this progression is in C minor, and using chords from harmonic minor or melodic minor.

But let's see: Gb chord. In C harmonic minor, the notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So Gb isn't there. Hmm.

Wait, Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord. In C minor, Db is not part of the scale. The scale has C, D, Eb, etc. So Db is not a note in C minor. So Db minor chord would be Db – Fb – Ab. Which contains Db, which is not in C minor scale. So that is a chromatic chord.

Hmm. So maybe this chord progression isn't in a simple key. Alternatively, considering all the chords, perhaps the center is Gb.

Wait, the presence of Dbm and Gb. If we have Db minor and Gb major. Let's think. If Db minor is i, then Gb major would be... in Db minor key? Let's check Db minor.

Db natural minor: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb (A), Cb (B).

Wait, Db minor natural:

Notes: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb (which is A), Cb (B).

Chords:

i: Dbm

ii°: Ebdim

III: F

iv: Gbm

v: Abm

VI: Bbb (A) major?

vii°: Cbdim

Wait, this seems messy. Alternatively, maybe Db harmonic minor? Not sure. This might not be the right path.

Another idea: Let's look at the chord progression and try to find a tonic chord.

Looking at the progression, there are many Bbdim chords, which might suggest that Bb is the tonic, but Bb major or minor? If it's Bb minor, then as before.

Alternatively, when there's a Bbdim chord repeated often, maybe it's the vii° in a major key. For example, in C major, vii° is Bdim; in F major, vii° is E dim. So to have Bb dim as vii°, it would need to be the tonic half step below Bb, so B major? But in B major, vii° would be A# dim. Not matching. Alternatively, in C major, no. Wait, no, in the key of A major, the vii° chord is G# dim. So not.

Wait, for a diminished chord to be vii°, it needs to be half step below the tonic. So if the tonic is C, vii° is Bdim. So if we have Bbdim, which is a diminished chord on Bb, then if it's vii°, the tonic would be B natural. So in B major, the vii° chord is A#dim. Not Bbdim. Because B major has A# as the leading tone. So Bbdim would be the same as A#dim, but usually spelled as A#dim. So maybe this is B major, but the chord is written as Bbdim, which would be enharmonic to A#dim. But usually, people avoid double flats and use sharps. So possible. If the key is B major, but then other chords don't quite fit.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

So Bbdim would be equivalent to A#dim. But usually spelled as A#dim. So if someone is using Bbdim, maybe they're not in B major. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Eb major. Let's check. Eb major: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

Chords:

I: Eb

ii: Fm

iii: Gm

IV: Ab

V: Bb

vi: Cm

vii°: Ddim

So vii° here is Ddim. Not Bbdim. Bb is the V chord.

Hmm.

Wait, here's another thought: sometimes when you see a lot of diminished chords with slash chords, it might be a case of an augmented sixth chord or something, but that might be too advanced.

Alternatively, let's look for common roots or something. The chord progression has a lot of Bbdim, some Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Emaj7/Ab.

Wait, B/Bb – if B is chord, Bb is bass. That could be a Bb7 chord? Because Bb7 is Bb, D, F, Ab. But B chord is B, D#, F#. So B/Bb would be Bb, B, D#, F#, which includes B and Bb together. Bb7 includes Ab, which isn't in B/Bb.

Alternatively, maybe the chord is written incorrectly and meant to be Bb/B or something else.

Alternatively, Emaj7/Ab – Ab bass. Emaj7 has notes E, G#, B, D#. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Could this be an Ab augmented chord or something? Ab, B, D#, E. Let's see: Ab to E is a minor sixth. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: let's see if any of these chords function in a particular key.

For example, Gb/Bb. Gb major with Bb bass. So as Gb major first inversion. So Gb is the root. If we are in the key of Bb minor, Gb would be the VI chord (natural minor has Gb major as the VI chord). Wait, C minor has VI as Ab major. Wait, let's go back to C natural minor.

C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

vii°: Bbdim

Ah, yes. So VI is Ab major. So if the key is C minor, Ab major is the VI chord. Now, if we see Dbm/Ab. Db minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm chord is Db, Fb, Ab. So with Ab bass, it's Ab, Db, Fb. But Fb is E natural. So Dbm is Db, Eb, Ab? No, Db minor is Db, Fb, Ab. Fb is E natural. So Db minor chord: Db, E, Ab. Then Ab bass: Ab, Db, E. So what key?

But if we're in C minor, Db minor chord would not be diatonic. The scale has D as natural, so Db would be a chromatic note.

Wait, but wait: in C harmonic minor, the scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So Db is not present. Still not.

Wait, maybe this is related to Eb minor? Not sure.

Another idea: Let's see the chords Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab. If Gb is IV of Db major, Dbm is i of Db minor. Maybe modulating between Db major and minor? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the chord names in terms of common tones. For example, Bbdim shares some notes with Gb major. Bbdim is Bb, Db, Fb; Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So they share Bb and Db. So maybe moving between chords that share tones.

But this might not help. Maybe looking at chord roots progression.

Let's see the chord roots (ignoring slashes for now):

Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, Db, B, Bb, Bb, Gb, Gb, Bb, Bb, E, Bb.

So the roots: Bb (many times), Gb, Db, B, E.

Looking at those roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E. Hmm. The circle of fifths? Bb is a fifth from F, but this progression seems to descend chromatically?

Bb -> Gb -> Db -> B? Wait, Bb to Gb is descending minor third? Bb to Gb is three half steps down? Wait, Bb down to Gb is Bb, B, A, Ab, G, Gb – so seven half steps down? No. Bb to Gb: Bb to A is one, A to Ab is two, Ab to G is three... No. Bb to Gb is actually six half steps: Bb -> A (1), A -> Ab (2), Ab -> G (3), G -> Gb (4), but wait, actually Bb to Gb: Bb, A, Ab, G, Gb? No, better to count in semitones.

From Bb to Gb: Bb = A#, but better to list:

Bb to A: 1 semitone

A to Ab: 2

Ab to G: 3

G to Gb: 4 semitones away? Wait, no. Wait, the distance from Bb to Gb is Bb -> B -> Cb? No. Wait, Bb to A is one down, A to Ab is another. So Bb down to Gb is seven semitones (Bb to A:1, A to Ab:2, Ab to G:3, G to F#:4? No, this is messy.

Actually, the interval from Bb to Gb: Bb, A, Ab, G, F#, F, E, Eb, D#, D, C#, C, B#, but maybe better:

Bb is Bb. Gb is six semitones below Bb? Or let's calculate:

From Bb moving downward: Bb to A (1), A to Ab (2), Ab to G (3), G to Gb (4). Wait, yes: Bb to Gb is 4 semitones down. No: Bb to A is one semitone down, A to Ab is another (total 2), Ab to G is 3rd, G to Gb is fourth. But actually, Bb down to Gb is four semitones. Wait, no: the interval between Bb and Gb is a diminished fifth or something? Let's count semitones from Bb to Gb:

Bb -> A (1), A -> Ab (2), Ab -> G (3), G -> Gb (4). So yes, four semitones down.

But maybe not important. Alternatively, the roots in the chord progression are Bb, Gb, Db, B, E.

That's Bb, Gb, Db. So descending by minor third each time? Bb to Gb is minor third down (Bb to Ab is minor second, then to G is major second? Wait, Bb to Gb: Bb, A, Ab, G, Gb – no, better to think in pitch classes.

Bb (11), Gb (7), Db (2), B (11? Wait, no. Pitch classes:

C=0, C#=1, D=2, etc. up to B=11.

So Bb = 10.

Gb = 6.

Db = 1.

B = 11.

E = 4.

So sequence: 10, 10, 6, 6, 10, 10, 1, 11, 10, 10, 6, 6, 10, 10, 4, 10.

Not sure. But Bb, Gb, Db form a pattern descending by diminished thirds? Bb to Gb is three semitones? No:

Bb to A: 1 semitone down

A to Ab: 2

Ab to G: 3

G to Gb: 4 semitones from Bb to Gb? No, Bb to Gb: let's count up.

Bb -> A: 1 down

A -> Ab: 2 down

Ab -> G: 3 down

G -> Gb: 4 down? No, actually from Bb to Gb is Bb -> A (step down), A -> G (another), G -> F# (third), F# -> F (fourth?), no. Let's count chromatically:

The number of semitones between Bb and Gb:

Bb is 10.

Gb is 6.

So 10 to 6 is a difference of -4 semitones (or +8).

So interval of 4 semitones down, which is a minor third.

Wait, 10 to 6: 10-6=4 semitones difference. So minor third up from Gb to Bb? Yes.

But in terms of roots descending: Bb to Gb is a minor third down.

Gb to Db: Gb is 6, Db is 1. 6-1=5 semitones down? Or Db is 1, Gb is 6: 6-1=5, so a perfect fourth up? But if descending from Db to Gb, it would be five semitones down.

This might not be helpful.

Another idea: The presence of Dbm/Ab. Dbm chord with Ab bass. Db minor triad is Db, Fb, Ab. So bass Ab. So it's Db minor in second inversion. Now, if I think of Ab as the bass, maybe the key center is Ab. Let's check.

If key is Ab major: notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So chords in Ab major:

I: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gdim

Now, Db is IV chord (Db major). So Dbm (Db minor) would not be in the scale. Similarly, Bbdim chord would be in Ab major? Seventh degree is Gdim. Not Bbdim.

But looking at chord progression: Gb/Bb. Gb in Ab major is V7? No, V is Eb. Gb is the flat VI chord. Because Ab major has Db as IV, so Gb would be a chromatic chord. But maybe if it's in Ab minor.

Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Wait, Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Chords:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: Cb

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb

vii°: Gbdim

Wait, in Ab minor:

i: Abm

ii°: Bb dim

III: Cb major?

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (which is E natural)

vii°: Gbdim

So, if the key were Ab minor, then we would have Dbm as the iv chord. Yes! Because Db minor chord is iv in Ab minor.

And Bbdim would be the ii° chord.

Wait, in Ab minor, scale degrees:

1. Ab

2. Bb

3. Cb

4. Db

5. Eb

6. Fb

7. Gb

So chords:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: Cb major (which is B major? But spelled Cb)

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb major (E)

vii°: Gbdim

Yes. So if this is in Ab minor, then:

- Bbdim is ii° chord.

- Dbm is iv chord.

- Gb chord would be... Gb is the VII degree. In our chord progression, we have Gb/Bb. If the key is Ab minor, then Gb is the VII chord (vii° as well? Wait, scale degree 7 is Gb, so chord on Gb would be Gb, Bb, Db. Which is Gb major? Because Ab minor scale has Gb as the leading tone. Wait, in natural minor, the vii° chord is diminished. Wait:

Chord on VII degree in Ab minor:

Gb (root), Bb (major third), Db (perfect fifth). So Gb major chord.

But in natural minor, the VII chord is major. Yes. The diminished chord is on the second degree.

So in Ab natural minor:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: Cb

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (which is E natural, because Fb = E)

vii: Gb major (not diminished)

Wait, yes. Seventh degree is Gb, chord is Gb-Bb-Db, which is Gb major.

So in this key, we have:

Bbdim (ii°), Dbm (iv), Gb (vii), etc.

Looking at the chord progression:

Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

So in Ab minor:

- The ii° is Bbdim. Check.

- The iv chord is Dbm. Yes.

- The vii chord is Gb major. Yes.

So Gb/Bb would be Gb major chord with Bb in bass. Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So Bb in bass makes it first inversion. So that works.

Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab. So with Ab bass, second inversion: Ab, Db, Fb.

But in Ab minor key, the iv chord is Dbm. So this chord makes sense as the iv chord with Ab bass (second inversion).

Now, what about the other chords like B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab?

B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. In Ab minor, what is the chord B? In Ab minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Does B exist in this scale? No. B would be Cb (since in Ab minor, the note B is spelled as Cb because scale degrees:

1. Ab

2. Bb

3. Cb

4. Db

5. Eb

6. Fb

7. Gb

So B is not present. The chord B/Bb would be a chromatic chord here. Alternatively, if it's a Bb something, but written as B/Bb.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab. In Ab minor, E is not in the scale. So these two chords seem chromatic. However, maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, but if key is Ab minor, then Fb is E natural (since Fb = E). So chord VI is Fb major, which is E major. Ah! In Ab minor natural minor, the major chord on VI is Fb major, which is E maj. So E major chord. That's interesting.

So Emaj7 – if it's Emaj7, then that's the VI chord in Ab minor. Yes! Because VI chord in Ab minor is Fb major, which is same as E major. So Emaj is the VI major chord.

Similarly, Emaj7 would be Emaj7 – which is a major seventh chord on the VI degree. So that would make sense.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab is iv chord (Db minor) with Ab bass.

Now, looking at B/Bb: B in the chord, Bb bass. If our key is Ab minor, then B would be... Enharmonically, B is Cb. But the chord B major? Wait, in Ab minor, the note B is spelled as Cb. Wait, no: scale degree 3 is Cb. So Cb is the same as B natural. Yes! Cb is an enharmonic equivalent to B. So if someone writes a B major chord, that's equivalent to Cb major chord. But in the key of Ab minor, the III chord is Cb major. Because iii in Ab minor would be Cb major.

Yes! In natural minor scale:

i: Abm

ii°: Bbdim

III: Cb major

iv: Dbm

v: Ebm

VI: Fb (E) major

vii: Gb major

So the chord on III degree is Cb major, which is same as B major.

So B major chord here is actually the III chord in Ab minor. So B/Bb would be B major chord with Bb in bass. But B is Cb, so Cb major chord. Notes of Cb major: Cb, Eb, Gb.

Wait, no. Cb major: Cb, Eb, Gb.

But B major is B, D#, F#. Which is different.

Wait, confusion here. If the scale is Ab minor (natural):

Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

So scale degree III is Cb.

So the iii chord is Cb major: Cb, Eb, Gb.

But Cb is enharmonic to B. So Cb major is enharmonic to B major? No:

Cb major = Cb - Eb - Gb

B major = B - D# - F#

They are enharmonic equivalent? Not exactly. Cb is B, Eb is D#, Gb is F#. So yes! Cb major = B major. Because Cb = B, Eb = D#, Gb = F#. So yes, they are the same notes. But usually, we write it as B major, not Cb major.

But in the key of Ab minor, the iii chord is spelled as Cb major. However, in practice, it would be referred to as B major.

So if someone in Ab minor has a iii chord, they'd call it Cb major but it's actually B major. Which makes sense.

So in this case, B/Bb: B major chord with Bb bass.

But B major is the iii chord of Ab minor.

Now, B/Bb bass note. So the chord is B major triad (B, D#, F#), bass note Bb.

So the notes would be Bb, B, D#, F#.

What function does this serve in Ab minor?

Maybe it's functioning as some borrowed chord or a chromatic passing chord.

Alternatively, in Ab minor, the VII chord is Gb major. And if we have a B major chord, which is iii.

But how about the bass note Bb? If the bass is Bb, which is the second scale degree of Ab minor.

So perhaps this chord B/Bb is a first inversion of B major, but the bass is Bb. Wait, no: chord is B major with Bb bass, so not the standard inversion. It's a bit odd.

But let's see:

If we have B major chord with Bb in bass, that would create a minor second between Bb and B. Which is quite dissonant. But maybe in a jazz context, it's used for tension.

However, considering the key of Ab minor fits several chords in the progression:

- Bbdim is ii° chord.

- Dbm is iv chord.

- Gb is VII chord (Gb major).

- Emaj7 would be VI chord (Fb major = E major).

Yes! So Ab minor has vi chord as Fb major (E major), so Emaj7 would be a VI chord with a major seventh? Or maybe just Emaj7 as the VI chord.

Wait, in Ab minor, the VI chord is Fb major. If we have Emaj7, which is E, G#, B, D#. But Fb major chord is Fb, Ab, Cb. Which is the same as E, G#, B. So yes, Fb = E, Ab = Ab, Cb = B. So Emaj7 would be E major with added seventh: D# would be the same as Eb, but wait, no. E major 7th chord is E, G#, B, D#. But the VI chord of Ab minor is E major triad. Adding a major 7th would be D#, but in Ab minor scale, the note D# isn't present. However, in harmonic minor or melodic minor, there might be.

Wait, maybe this progression is in Ab minor natural minor, and the Emaj7/Ab is actually the VI chord (E major) with Ab as bass. E major triad: E, G#, B. With Ab bass: Ab, E, G#, B. Which is a bit of a stretch. So Ab as bass, then E major triad. Which could function as a VI chord in Ab minor, with the bass note Ab. Wait, but Ab is the tonic note. If it's Emaj7/Ab, the bass is Ab, which is tonic. So maybe it's a tonic chord with some extension.

Wait, in Ab minor, tonic chord is Abm. But if we have Emaj7 with Ab bass, that doesn't seem to fit the tonic. Alternatively, if it's E major with Ab bass, notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. This seems unrelated. But perhaps there's another way.

Wait, but if the key is Gb major, let's see again. Gb major has chords as before. But earlier calculations didn't fit. Maybe not.

Another approach: Ab minor has tonic Ab. What's the function of the Emaj7? If it's VI, then yes. So Ab minor, VI is E major. So Emaj7 would be a VI chord. In jazz, VI chords often have major sevenths. So Emaj7 is VI.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. Db is iv chord in Ab minor. With bass Ab, so it's a second inversion iv chord.

Gb/Bb: Gb major chord (vii), with Bb bass – first inversion.

Bbdim: ii° chord.

Now the B/Bb chord: B major with Bb bass. If B major is the iii chord in Ab minor, as we established. Then bass is Bb, which is the second scale degree. So perhaps it's a chromatic mediante or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to lead to the IV or something.

But let's recap. If we take the key as Ab minor:

- Bbdim (ii°)

- Gb/Bb (vii chord, first inversion)

- Dbm/Ab (iv chord second inversion)

- Emaj7/Ab (VI chord with Ab bass? Not sure)

- B/Bb: iii chord with Bb bass

This seems plausible. Now, what about Emaj7/Ab: if Ab is the bass note, and the chord is Emaj7. So the notes are Ab, E, G#, B, D#. In Ab minor, Ab is tonic. The notes E, G# would be the same as Fb and Ab? Not really. Wait, Emaj7 in root position is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, the notes are Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Is there a scale that includes these notes?

Ab minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. So Ab, Bb, B (Cb), Db, Eb, E (Fb), Gb. Wait, Fb is E natural.

So in the scale, we have Eb, Fb (E), Gb. So E is present as Fb.

So in the chord Emaj7, the E is natural. So Ab minor scale has E (as Fb). So yes. And G#? G# is Ab. Because G# = Ab. Wait, no. In Ab minor, Ab is tonic. G# is the same as Ab. So G# would be Ab. So Emaj7 has G# (which is Ab), B, E, D#.

If we are in Ab minor, D# would be Eb. Because D# = Eb. Yes.

But in the chord Emaj7/Ab: Ab (bass), E, G# (Ab), B, D# (Eb). So the notes would be Ab, E, B, Eb. Wait:

- Ab (bass)

- E

- G# is same as Ab

- B is same as Cb (scale degree 3)

- D# is Eb (scale degree 5)

So essentially, this chord is Ab bass, with notes B, E, Eb.

Which is interesting. Ab, E, Eb, B. That seems like a mess. Maybe the Emaj7/Ab is actually a chord that functions as a dominant or something else.

But perhaps the entire chord progression is in Ab minor, and the Emaj7 and B/Bb chords are chromatic passing chords or borrowed from somewhere.

But assuming key of Ab minor, then:

- Bbdim: ii°

- Gb/Bb: VII chord (first inversion)

- Dbm/Ab: iv chord (second inversion)

- B/Bb: iii chord (B major), but bass Bb (ii note)

- Emaj7/Ab: VI chord (E major), bass Ab (tonic)

But maybe.

But let's check the tonic. If the key is Ab minor, then the tonic chord would be Abm. But it's not present in the progression? Looking at the chords given: no Abm present. However, sometimes a progression might not have the tonic chord, but usually it's implied by the cadence.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Eb minor. Let's see.

But let's think again. If we suppose Ab minor is the key, then the chords fit reasonably well.

Another check: the chord Ab is not present, but if there's a Dbm chord with Ab bass, and Emaj7 with Ab bass, that could make Ab the tonic in some way.

Alternatively, when the bass is Ab in Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab – so Ab bass in multiple places. So Ab is the bass note commonly, which could indicate Ab is tonic.

Yes. Because in Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass, so root Db but bass Ab – but the bass note Ab is frequent. Similarly, Emaj7/Ab has Ab as bass. So the bass note being Ab often suggests Ab might be the tonic.

But if the tonic is Ab minor, then Abm is the tonic chord. However, we don't see Abm in the progression. But maybe it's implied or part of the missing chords.

Alternatively, the progression uses Ab as a pedal tone or something. But in the given sequence, the Emaj7/Ab and Dbm/Ab, so Ab is bass a lot, which could mean Ab is tonic.

Let's see possible cadences. If there's a iv chord (Dbm) moving to VII (Gb), then to I. But we don't have Abm.

Alternatively, in Ab minor, a common cadence would be iv to V to i or something. But with the chords we have: Dbm (iv), Gb (vii), then maybe to Ab. But our progression doesn't have Ab.

But given the chords present, Ab as a bass note repeatedly (in Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab), that makes me think the key center is Ab. So key of Ab minor.

Let's check the mode. If key is Ab minor, that's Aeolian mode on Ab, or just Ab natural minor.

But what about Emaj7 – as VI major in Ab minor. Yes, VI chord in natural minor is major. So VI major is common in minor keys.

Similarly, the iii chord (B major) in Ab minor would be Cb major. Which is fine.

So to recap: the key would be Ab minor (Aeolian mode), with some chromatic chords.

But wait, another thing to consider: when chords are written with slashes, sometimes it's to indicate a specific voicing or bass note. But if the bass note Ab is repeated (in Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab), then it's likely the tonal center.

Also, looking at the B/Bb chord. If we have B major chord with Bb bass, in Ab minor, the B major chord is the iii chord. But the bass being Bb – Bb is the note of the second scale degree. So maybe it's a chord that uses the ii note as bass to create a specific movement.

Another thing: in Ab minor, the chord B/Bb might function as a type of V/V or something. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Gb major. Wait, but earlier checks didn't support. Let's try again.

Gb major: chords I Gb, ii Abm, iii Bbm, IV Cb (B), V Db, vi Ebm, vii° Fdim.

But if the progression includes Emaj7 – E major. Ebm in Gb major. Not sure. Doesn't fit well.

Back to Ab minor.

Yes, seems plausible. Let's outline the chords in Ab minor:

- Bbdim: ii°

- Gb: VII

- Dbm: iv

- Emaj7: VI (but spelled as E)

- B major: iii

So yes. Ab minor has VI chord as E major, which might be written as Emaj7 sometimes.

Now, about the B/Bb chord: as iii chord with bass on Bb, which is ii note. So perhaps it's functioning as a passing chord.

Another idea: In Ab minor, the chord progression could have Ab as tonic, even though it's not explicitly played. The presence of Ab in the bass of Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab might serve as a pedal tone.

Also, the chord Emaj7/Ab – E major with Ab bass. Ab is the tonic, so E major triad over Ab bass. The notes are Ab, E, G#, B. Which is Ab (1), E (b6), G# (which is Ab), and B (b3? Wait, Ab to E is a minor sixth, Ab to G# is a diminished seventh? Not sure.

But maybe in context of the key of Ab minor, this chord functions as a VI chord with tonic in bass. So VI chord (E major) with tonal center Ab.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab is iv chord with tonic bass.

This seems plausible.

So the key is Ab minor (Aeolian mode), because it's minor.

But sometimes people refer to the key as Ab minor or Ab Aeolian. Same thing.

But to confirm, let's check another angle. Diminished chords often function in minor keys. The ii° chord in Ab minor is Bbdim.

Now, how about the chord called Emaj7/Ab. If we take Ab as bass, E major triad: E, G#, B, and then D# for the sevenths. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#. In Ab minor scale, the notes present are Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb.

So Ab is tonic, Fb is E, so E is in the scale (as Fb). G# would be Ab (since G# = Ab), and D# is Eb. So the note D# is actually Eb in the scale. So this chord has notes: Ab (tonic), E (Fb), G# (Ab), B (Cb), D# (Eb). So essentially Ab, Bb (as Cb is B), Eb, Fb (E), and Ab again. Not sure. Maybe it's just a way to get those notes.

Alternatively, maybe the Emaj7 is supposed to be Fb major 7th. But usually, it's written as E7.

Hmm. But assuming that, it could be VI7 chord.

Another check: let's see if there's a dominant chord. In minor keys, V is often major chord. In Ab minor, V chord would be Eb major. But we don't see Eb anywhere except in scale. Unless a chord is missed.

But our progression doesn't have Eb. However, the Emaj7 chords could be related.

Wait, but if the key is Ab minor, then a common cadence would be iv - VII - i or something, but with Emaj7 as VI, maybe.

Alternatively, if we consider the key as Eb minor. Let's see. Not sure.

Another approach: look at all the chord roots and see what key they fit into.

Bbdim, Gb, Dbm, Emaj7 chord, B.

If we take "B" as a chord root, but spelled as B, which could be Cb, etc. But if the key is Ab minor, all these chords fit reasonably.

Another idea: Let's see the intervals. If we have a progression that includes vii° (Bbdim), VII (Gb), iv (Dbm), III (B), VI (Emaj), which all fit Ab minor.

Yes. So Ab minor would contain:

- Ab tonic

- Bb (as ii)

- Cb (iii)

- Db (iv)

- Eb (v)

- Fb (VI)

- Gb (vii)

So yes. And our chords are Bbdim (ii°), Gb (VII), Dbm (iv), B (III), Emaj7 (VI). So all fit.

Additionally, the slash chords: Gb/Bb (VII in first inversion), Dbm/Ab (iv with tonic bass), Emaj7/Ab (VI with tonic bass). Yes! So that makes sense. So Ab is the tonic bass for several of these chords.

So the progression seems to have Ab as tonic, with a lot of chords centered around that. Therefore, the tonic is Ab, minor key.

Thus, the key is Ab minor, which is also called Ab Aeolian.

But wait, "key" usually refers to the scale. So if it's minor, then Ab minor.

But to confirm, the mode would be Aeolian if it's natural minor. However, if there's a raised seventh (as in harmonic minor), it might be different, but given the chords present, it's natural minor.

Now, what about the chord B/Bb. In Ab minor, B major is the iii chord. So when they have B major with Bb bass. But Bb is the supertonic note. Perhaps it's used as part of a chromatic bass line.

But overall, this seems to fit.

So likely the key is Ab minor.

Wait, but Ab minor is spelled Bb minor? No. Ab minor has key signature of 7 flats, but usually written as G# minor. But usually, Ab minor is used over G# minor because flats are easier. But that's a matter of spelling.

But yes, Ab minor key is the same as G# minor, but depending on context.

But the key would be Ab minor.

Alternatively, maybe the key is C minor or something else. But I think Ab minor fits better.

Wait, another check: in the progression, we have Gb/Bb. In Ab minor, Gb is the VII chord. And Gb chord is Gb major. With Bb in bass, which makes Bb the bass note of Gb major chord. Yes, Gb major first inversion.

Yes.

Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm is iv chord, Ab is tonic. So yes.

Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 (which is the VI chord, since VI in Ab minor is Fb major, spelled as E major), with Ab bass. Correct.

B/Bb: B major chord (iii) with Bb bass. Yes, Bb is ii scale degree.

So yes, all of this fits Ab minor.

Therefore, the key is Ab minor, and the mode is Aeolian.

But sometimes a minor key's mode is just called "minor" but specifically Aeolian.

So conclusion: Key of Ab minor (Aeolian mode).

But just to be sure, is there another possibility?

Another check: Emaj7 – which contains D#. In Ab minor scale, Db is the iv note. If there is a D# (which would be Eb), it's in the scale as natural Eb. But not sure.

Wait, E major chord: E, G#, B. In Ab minor, E is Fb, G# is Ab, B is Cb. So E major chord is Fb major chord. Which is valid. So yes, VI chord.

Yes. So Ab minor seems to be the right fit.

Thus, the final answer would be Ab minor (Aeolian mode).

But just to check for other options. Could it be in a different key?

For example, maybe G# minor. But G# minor would have similar chords but with sharps. Since Ab minor and G# minor are enharmonic equivalents. Depending on the instrumentation or context, but usually we prefer flats for minor keys with multiple flats.

But the key could be notated as G# minor, but more likely Ab minor.

Given that the chord names use flats (Bb dim, Db minor, etc.), it's more natural to use Ab minor.

Yes. So the key is Ab minor, Aeolian mode.

Another way: If the song centers around Ab minor, and the chords we've listed all fit into that scale.

Yes. So that seems solid.

Therefore, the answer should be that the key is Ab minor, and the mode is Aeolian.

But sometimes just "key of Ab minor" implies Aeolian mode. But to be precise, the mode is Aeolian.

Alternatively, if it's using the harmonic minor, the seventh degree would be raised. But in this case, the VII chord is Gb major (not G# major like in harmonic minor). In Ab harmonic minor, the VII chord would be G major, but no. Let's check.

Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G.

Wait, no. Harmonic minor raises the seventh by a semitone.

Natural minor of Ab: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

Harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G

So seventh degree raised to G natural.

So VII chord would be G major (G, Bb, D).

But in our progression, we have Gb major chord as VII. So it's natural minor, not harmonic.

Therefore, Aeolian mode.

So conclusion: key of Ab minor, Aeolian mode.

The chord progression provided contains several elements that strongly indicate the **key of Ab minor (Aeolian mode)**. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Key Identification: Ab Minor**
1. **Chord Relationships in Ab Minor:**
   - **Bbdim**: This is the **ii° (supertonic diminished)** chord in Ab minor.
   - **Gb/Bb**: Gb major is the **vii (leading tone)** chord in Ab minor. The slash notation (Gb/Bb) indicates a first inversion of Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db with Bb in the bass).
   - **Dbm/Ab**: Db minor is the **iv (subdominant)** chord in Ab minor. The bass note Ab (tonic) confirms the tonal center.
   - **Emaj7/Ab**: The Emaj7 chord corresponds to the **VI (submediant)** chord in Ab minor. In Ab minor, the VI chord is **Fb major (spelled as E major due to enharmonic equivalence)**, and the slash notation (Emaj7/Ab) places the tonic (Ab) in the bass.
   - **B/Bb**: B major is the **iii (mediant)** chord in Ab minor. When spelled as **Cb major (enharmonic to B major)**, this fits perfectly as the iii chord. The bass note Bb (supertonic degree) supports this interpretation.

2. **Tonal Center (Ab):**
   - Multiple chords have **Ab as the bass note** (Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab), which is a strong indicator of the tonic. This is a common technique to emphasize the tonal center of the key.
   - The presence of **Ab minor** as a tonal anchor is reinforced by the consistent use of the **Ab minor scale tones** (Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb), even if the tonic chord itself (Abm) isn't explicitly played.

3. **Chord Functionality:**
   - The progression features **ii°–vii–iv–VI–iii**, which are all diatonic to **Ab minor**. This structure is characteristic of standard minor-key harmony.
   - The use of **natural minor (Aeolian)** is confirmed by the inclusion of **Gb** (not G natural) as the leading tone chord. In harmonic minor variants, the VII chord would be G major (raised 7th), but here Gb is used, aligning with natural minor.

---

### **Mode Analysis: Aeolian (Natural Minor)**
- The **Aeolian mode** is the natural minor scale (1–2–♭3–4–5–♭6–♭7). The progression aligns perfectly with this structure:
  - **Ab minor scale**: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.
  - All chords in the progression (Bbdim, Gb, Dbm, Emaj7, B) are derived from this scale without any raised 7th (which would occur in harmonic minor). Thus, the mode is **not harmonic minor** but **natural minor (Aeolian)**.

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **C minor**: While C minor has Bbdim as its vii° chord, the absence of Cm and the presence of chords like Dbm and Emaj7 (which do not align with C minor) make this less likely.
- **Gb major**: Gb major does not support the Emaj7 or Dbm chords as diatonic elements.
- **A minor or B minor**: The flat-heavy notation (Bb, Db, Eb) points to a flat-based minor key, not sharp-based keys like A or B minor.
- **G# minor**: While enharmonically equivalent to Ab minor, the use of flat spellings (Bbdim, Dbm, etc.) strongly favors **Ab minor** as the standard notation.

---

### **Final Answer**
- **Key**: **Ab minor**
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**

This progression uses standard minor-key harmony with a clear tonal center on **Ab**, and all chords align diatonically with the **Ab minor scale (Aeolian mode)**.

**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B**

This chord progression:

**Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim**

...is rich in chromaticism, diminished harmony, and slash chords — suggesting it’s **not in a traditional major/minor key** but likely in a **modal or chromatic context**, possibly from **jazz, film score, or modern pop/rock theory**.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Chords

Let’s write out the chords in root-position for easier analysis:

| Chord | Notes | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Bbdim | Bb, Db, F | Diminished triad on bII |
| Gb/Bb | Bb, Gb, Db | **Gb major triad with Bb in bass** → inverted Gb major |
| Dbm/Ab | Ab, Db, Fb (E) | **Db minor triad with Ab bass** → inverted Dbmin |
| B/Bb | B, F#, D# | **B major triad with Bb in bass** — very dissonant! |
| Emaj7/Ab | Ab, E, G#, B#, D# | **E major 7 with Ab bass** → highly unexpected |

Note: The chord **B/Bb** is a **major triad (B-D#-F#) over Bb bass** — this is an **augmented second interval (Bb to B)**, creating strong tension.

---

### Step 2: Look for Key Centers

Let’s look at **most common tonal anchors**.

#### The **Bbdim** chords repeat often — this is a strong hint. Bb diminished = Bb, Db, F.

This is the **ii° chord in C minor** — but we never see C minor tonal center clearly.

But wait — **Gb major** appears twice as **Gb/Bb** (i.e., Gb major in first inversion).

Gb major = Gb, Bb, Db — which is the **same notes as Bbdim**!  
**Bbdim = Bb, Db, F** → **not the same as Gb major = Gb, Bb, Db**

Wait! Look:

- **Bbdim**: Bb – Db – F  
- **Gb major**: Gb – Bb – Db → So both contain **Bb and Db**

The only difference is **F (in Bbdim)** vs **Gb (in Gb)**.

So:  
- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–F  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb–Bb–Db → this is **Gb major in 1st inversion**

So we’ve got **Bbdim** and **Gb major** alternating — both share two notes (Bb and Db) — they’re a **tritone apart** (Bb to Gb = tritone). That’s classic **diminished/whole-tone** space.

In jazz harmony, **Bb dim** and **Gb maj** are **enharmonically related** and often treated as substitutions because they share the same **tritone interval**:

- Bbdim: Bb–Db–F → tritone: **Bb–F**  
- Gb maj: Gb–Bb–Db → tritone: **Gb–Db**

But **Bb–F** is the same as **F–B**, and **Gb–Db** = **Db–Gb**, which are enharmonically **same tritone**!

Actually:  
**Bb–F** = tritone  
**Gb–Db** = same as F#–C# → **NOT same as Bb–F**

Wait — **Bb to F = 6 semitones**  
**Gb to Db = Gb–G–Ab–A–Bb–B–C–Db → 8 semitones**

Oops! So not the same tritone.

Let’s correct:  
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–F → tritone = **Bb–F** (6 semitones)  
- Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db → tritone = **Gb–Db** (6 semitones? Gb→Db: Gb–G–Ab–A–Bb–B–C–Db → 8 semitones? Let's count properly):

From **Gb to Db**:
- Gb → G = 1
- G → Ab = 2
- Ab → A = 3
- A → Bb = 4
- Bb → B = 5
- B → C = 6
- C → Db = 7 → **That’s 7 semitones?**

Wait! No — **Gb to Db** is **5 steps up** in the circle of fifths.

Actually, **Gb to Db is a perfect fifth down** → **Db is a perfect fifth below Gb**.

So **Gb to Db is 7 semitones (perfect fifth)** — **not a tritone!**

Let’s find the tritone in Gb major:  
Gb–Bb–Db → the tritone is **Gb to Db?** No — Gb to Db is P5.  
The tritone in a major triad is **between the root and the fifth?** No — in a major triad the intervals are M3 and P5.

The **tritone** is between **the 3rd and the 7th** — but this is a triad, no 7th.

So perhaps **Bbdim and Gb major** form a **chromatic mediant relationship**?

### Step 3: Look for the strongest tonal center

The chord **Emaj7/Ab** is extremely telling.

Let’s write it out: **Emaj7 with Ab in bass**

So notes:  
E (root), G# (3rd), B# (7th = C), D# (9th?) → but maj7 = E, G#, B#, D#  
Then bass = **Ab**

So chord = **Ab–E–G#–B#–D#**

But B# = C, so: **Ab, E, G#, C, D#**

That’s a **five-note sonority**: Ab, C, D#, E, G#  
→ That’s **Ab, C, D#, E, G#**

Let’s re-order:  
C, D#, E, G#, Ab

That’s **C**, then **D# = Eb**, **E**, **G#**, **Ab**

This is **not** a standard chord. It’s very chromatic.

But notice: **E and Ab** — that’s a **minor 6th interval** (E to Ab = 8 semitones) — a very expressive, cinematic sound.

In fact, **Emaj7/Ab** is a **very common voicing in modern film music** (e.g., Hans Zimmer, etc.) as a **colored, ambiguous, unresolved** chord.

It **avoids a clear key center** — this is **intentional**.

---

### Step 4: The “B/Bb” chord

**B major triad over Bb bass**:

B – D# – F# over Bb

So: **Bb, B, D#, F#**

That’s a **major second (Bb–B)**, which is **extremely dissonant** — used for tension.

This chord appears just once — likely as a **chromatic approach** or **passing chord**.

It *could* be functioning as **a deceptive voice-leading** into the next chord.

---

### Step 5: Look for patterns and repetition

The progression repeats:

1. Bbdim – Bbdim  
2. Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
3. Bbdim – Bbdim  
4. Dbm/Ab – B/Bb  
5. Bbdim – Bbdim  
6. Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
7. Bbdim – Bbdim  
8. Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

So the **Bbdim is the “home” chord** — it appears **8 times out of 14**, and starts and ends the progression.

**Gb/Bb appears 4 times** — second most common.

So the **tonal center is likely Bb** — even though the harmony is chromatic, **Bbdim is the anchor**.

Bbdim = Bb–Db–F — which can be interpreted as **the vii° chord in C minor**, or **the ii° chord in Db major**, or even **the root chord in a whole-tone or octatonic scale**.

But Bbdim is also **the root chord of the Bb diminished scale**.

---

### Step 6: Try the **Bb Locrian Mode**

Locrian mode: Bb Locrian = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab  
→ Chord built on Bb: Bb–Db–F — **Bbdim** — YES!

**Bb Locrian** is the 7th mode of **C major**, and has a **diminished triad on the tonic**.

So **if this were in Bb Locrian**, the tonic chord would be Bbdim — which matches.

But then what about **Gb/Bb**?  
Gb = #4 of Bb Locrian → that’s **very characteristic** of **Locrian** — the **#4** (Gb) is the **tritone**, the defining instability of Locrian.

In Bb Locrian:
- Scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab
- Chord on I: Bbdim (Bb–Db–F)
- Chord on IV: Ebmaj7
- Chord on V: F7
- Chord on #IV: **Gb major** — YES! That’s the **#4 chord** — very common in modern use of Locrian.

Indeed, **Gb major = #IV chord** in Bb Locrian.

And **Dbm = bVI** in Bb Locrian → Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab → yes, bVI.

Then **B/Bb** — B is **#7** of Bb Locrian → **that’s the leading tone** — but normally leading tone is A natural in Bb major scale, but here in Locrian it’s **Ab** — so B is **not in the scale**.

B = accidental.

Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab** — E is not in Bb Locrian.

So **Bb Locrian gives us:**  
- **Bbdim** → tonic  
- **Gb/Bb (Gb major)** → #IV — very common  
- **Dbm/Ab** → bVI — also common

But **B/Bb** and **Emaj7/Ab** are **outside Bb Locrian**.

So perhaps this is **Bb Locrian with chromatic embellishments** — or **Modal Mixture from Bb minor**?

---

### Step 7: Consider **Bb minor** with chromaticism

Bb minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

That’s **natural minor** — same as **Bb Locrian**? No.

Wait:  
- **Bb minor (natural)** → Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab → **same notes as Bb Locrian!**

Bb minor natural = 6th mode of Db major → same as **Bb Locrian**.

So **Bb natural minor = Bb Locrian**.

That’s correct.

So **everything fits** in **Bb Aeolian?** Wait — no.

**Bb Aeolian (natural minor)** = Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab → YES, **same as Locrian?**

Wait — here's the confusion.

**Mode names**:

| Root | Mode | Notes | Tonic chord |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| Bb | **Bb Aeolian** (natural minor) | Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab | **Bb minor** — NOT diminished |
| Bb | **Bb Locrian** | Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab | **Bb diminished** (if we build triad on 7th of C major) |

Wait — **this is key!**

The **Bb natural minor scale** (Aeolian) has a **minor tonic triad**: Bb–Db–F → that’s **Bb minor** → **not diminished**.

But **Bbdim** is **Bb–Db–Fb**, not **F**!

Ah! This is the **critical point**.

- **Bb minor chord**: Bb–Db–F  
- **Bb diminished chord**: Bb–Db–**Fb**

So **Bb dim ≠ Bb min**

That means: **the harmonic minor scale** or **melodic minor**, or **some altered scale**, is involved.

We must ask: **What scale contains Bb–Db–Fb**?

Bb–Db–Fb = **Bb dim**

This is the **7th degree** of the **C harmonic minor scale**.

C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab **B**  
→ 7th scale degree: **B** → chord: B–D–F → **B dim**

But we’re seeing **Bb dim**.

So what scale has **Bb dim** as the tonic?

Perhaps **Bb half-diminished scale** → **Bb Locrian #2**? Or perhaps **the whole-half diminished scale**.

Try the **Bb half-whole diminished scale**:

Bb Half-Whole Dim:  
Bb – C – Db – Eb – E – Gb – G – A – (Bb)

Chords:  
- Bb dim: Bb–Db–Fb  
- C m7b5: C–Eb–Gb  
- Db aug: Db–F—A  
- Eb m7: Eb–Gb–Bb–Db  
- E dim: E–G–Bb  
- Gb maj7: Gb–Bb–Db–F

This gets us **Gb maj7** = Gb–Bb–Db–F → which is **Gb major**!

And **Bb dim** — yes.

So if we assume **Bb half-whole diminished scale** (octatonic), then:

- **Bbdim** = tonic (mode 1)  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major = **mode 6** (Gb–Bb–Db) — yes, fits  
- **Dbm/Ab** → Db minor triad: Db–Fb–Ab — is Db in the scale?  
   Bb half-whole: Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A  
   → Yes, Db is in there  
   → Fb = E → yes, Fb = E in the scale  
   → Ab? **Ab is NOT in Bb half-whole diminished scale!**  
   Scale: Bb C Db Eb **E** Gb G A → Ab is **not there**

So **Ab is chromatic** — not in scale.

Ab appears in **Dbm/Ab** — so Ab is the bass, but Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab → Ab = minor 6th of Bb? Not in the scale.

Now, **B/Bb** — B is **not in Bb half-whole dim** scale.

B is **#7** of Bb, but scale has **A**, not **B**.

And **Emaj7/Ab** — E is in scale, G# = A? No — **G# is not in scale** — scale has **Gb (A)** → so **G# is foreign**.

BUT: **G# = Ab** enharmonically? Only if you consider **Ab = G#** — **yes**, enharmonically!

Ah! Here’s the breakthrough.

We assumed **Fb = E**, **Ab = G#**, etc.

In the **Bb half-whole diminished scale**:

- Notes: **Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A**

But **E** and **Gb** are **enharmonic** to **Fb** and **F#** — wait.

Actually:  
- **Fb = E**  
- **Ab = G#**

So if we rewrite the scale using **spelled pitches** (with sharps instead of flats where needed for chords), the scale becomes:

**Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A**

But for **Dbm/Ab = Db–Fb–Ab** → then **Fb = E**, **Ab = G#**

So if we **reinterpret Dbm/Ab** as **Dbsus2?** No — Db–Fb–Ab is clearly Db minor.

If we treat **Ab = G#**, then this chord is **Db–E–G#** → which is **Db augmented?** Db–E–G# = Db–E–G# — E is #3, G# = #5 → **Db+** — augmented!

But the chord is written as **Dbm/Ab**, so we assume it’s **Db minor** with **Ab** bass — so it’s **Db–Fb–Ab**, **not** Db augmented.

So to make **Db–Fb–Ab** fit in scale, we need **Ab** in the scale — but **Bb half-whole diminished** only has **A**, not **Ab**.

So perhaps it’s **Bb whole-half diminished scale**?

Bb Whole-Half Dim:  
**Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb**? No — that’s not correct.

Standard **whole-half diminished** on Bb:

Bb (whole) – C (half) – Db (whole) – Eb (half) – E (whole) – Gb (half) – G (whole) – A (half)

Same as **half-whole**!

So no — the scale is **half-whole** or **whole-half** — on Bb it's the **same set of notes**, just starting point changes.

So it’s the **octatonic scale**: Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A → **8 notes**.

**Ab is not in it** — so **Dbm/Ab = Db–Fb–Ab** has **Ab**, which is **outside**.

Therefore, the **Ab** is a chromatic passing tone or modal mixture.

---

### Final Synthesis

Let’s step back.

- **Bbdim** appears 8 times → **strong tonal center**
- **Gb/Bb** appears 4 times → **#IV chord** — very characteristic of **Locrian mode**
- **Dbm/Ab** = bVI chord in Bb minor → common in minor keys
- **B/Bb** = chromatic passing chord — B is #7 (but in Bb, #7 is A#), so this is **raised 7th** → B is **not A#**, B is **natural 7th of G major** — very out-of-key
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th over Ab — likely **borrowed** or **modal mixture** — E major = #5 of Bb? E = #5 = G# — not directly

**BUT**: Consider **Bb minor** as key — with **Ab harmonic minor** flavor?

Let’s try **Bb melodic minor ascending**:  
Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A — tonic chord **Bb minor** → but we have **Bbdim**, not Bb min.

Wait — **Bbdim** is NOT the tonic of Bb melodic minor.

Unless we are treating this as a **tonal center of Bb**, but with **diminished tonic chord** — which is **exceedingly rare** outside of **modal, jazz, or film music**.

### ✅ Most Plausible Conclusion:

This is **in Bb Locrian mode**, with **extensive chromatic embellishments** borrowed from other scales (whole-tone, harmonic minor, chromatic passing tones).

- **Bbdim** = tonic chord  
- **Gb/Bb** = #IV → core Locrian sound  
- **Dbm/Ab** = bVI → fits Bb minor/ Locrian  
- **B/Bb** = chromatic #7 substitute over tonic (unusual but expressive)  
- **Emaj7/Ab** = distant chromatic color chord — likely functions as a **passing or “color” chord** before resolving to Bbdim

The **mode is Bb Locrian**.  
The **key is Bb**, with a **diminished tonic** — meaning this is **not tonal in the classical sense** — it’s **modal**.

### 🎯 Final Answer:

> **Key: Bb**  
> **Mode: Locrian**  
> **Context**: Modal, highly chromatic, common in jazz, film score, or modern pop with ambiguous tonality. The Bbdim triad serves as the tonic, and the Gb major triad (#IV) is a defining harmonic feature of Locrian mode. The B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab chords are chromatic passing/color tones enhancing the dark, unresolved quality.

### Bonus: Why Locrian?

- It is the **only mode** with a **diminished tonic triad**.
- The **#4 (Gb)** chord (Gb major) is the hallmark of **modern Locrian usage** (e.g., in metal, jazz, or film music as a "dark" sound).
- The progression **does not resolve to a minor tonic** (Bb minor), meaning it’s not Aeolian — the diminished triad **forces** Locrian identification.

✅ **Confirmed: Key = Bb, Mode = Locrian**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**  
B♭dim – B♭dim – G♭/B♭ – G♭/B♭ – B♭dim – B♭dim – D♭m/A♭ – B/B♭ – B♭dim – B♭dim – G♭/B♭ – G♭/B♭ – B♭dim – B♭dim – E♭maj7/A♭ – B♭dim

---

### Step 1: Identify All Unique Chords
Let’s list the distinct chords:

- B♭dim (B♭ diminished) = B♭–D♭–E–G♭  
- G♭/B♭ = G♭ major triad (G♭–B♭–D♭) with B♭ in the bass  
- D♭m/A♭ = D♭ minor (D♭–E–A♭) over A♭ bass → essentially A♭7♭9 (A♭–C–E♭–G♭–B♭♭) or just a D♭ minor in 2nd inversion  
- B/B♭ = B major triad (B–D♯–F♯) over B♭ bass → a very chromatic, dissonant polychord  
- E♭maj7/A♭ = E♭maj7 (E♭–G–B♭–D) over A♭ bass → functions like A♭13 (A♭–C–E♭–G–B♭–D)

This is a highly chromatic sequence with many non-diatonic chords.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Bass and Tonal Center

The bass notes are mostly **B♭**, appearing in almost every chord (as root or inversion):
- B♭dim → root = B♭  
- G♭/B♭ → bass = B♭  
- D♭m/A♭ → bass = A♭ (only exception)  
- B/B♭ → bass = B♭  
- E♭maj7/A♭ → bass = A♭

So the tonal center strongly gravitates around **B♭**.

---

### Step 3: Consider B♭dim as a Pivot

B♭ diminished = B♭–D♭–E–G♭  
This is an **incomplete dominant 7♭9 chord** missing the root. For example:

- B♭dim = G7♭9 without the G  
- Also = E7♭9 without the E  
- Also = C7♭9 without the C  
- Also = A♭7♭9 without the A♭

Thus, B♭dim can **resolve to C, E♭, G♭, or A** — i.e., any of the four possible roots a diminished 7th chord can lead to.

But here it’s **repeating** and **not clearly resolving**, which suggests it may be functioning as a **tonic substitute** in a diminished or octatonic context.

---

### Step 4: Consider the Octatonic (Diminished) Scale

The **half-whole diminished scale** starting on B♭ is:

**B♭ C D♭ E E♭ G♭ G A (B♭)**

Chords in this scale include:
- B♭dim7  
- C7  
- D♭dim7  
- E7  
- E♭7  
- G♭7  
- Gdim7  
- A7

But our chords include:
- G♭ major (not G♭7)  
- D♭ minor  
- E♭maj7  
- B major (highly foreign)

The presence of **E♭maj7** and **G♭ major** (which are a major third apart) fits the **octatonic symmetry**: E♭ and G♭ are 3 semitones apart, characteristic of diminished scales.

Also, **E♭maj7/A♭** implies A♭13 (A♭7 with 13th = F, but here it’s D = major 7th of E♭), which is not standard, but E♭maj7 over A♭ gives a **Lydian dominant** flavor (A♭7♯11), though that’s speculative.

---

### Step 5: Look for Modal Implications

The repeated B♭dim suggests a **symmetrical** or **modal** context rather than functional tonality.

In jazz and modern harmony, a static diminished chord can imply the **diminished scale** (octatonic), which is **not a traditional mode** (like Dorian, Mixolydian), but a **synthetic scale**.

Alternatively, if we interpret B♭ as the tonal center and the harmony as largely static, the piece may be in:

- **B♭ diminished (octatonic) "key"** – though not a key in the traditional sense  
- Or **B♭ Phrygian**? But Phrygian would have B♭–C♭–D♭–E♭–F–G♭–A♭, and we see G natural (in B major chord) and D natural (in E♭maj7), which contradict that.

The **B major chord over B♭ bass (B/B♭)** is extremely dissonant: B = C♭, so C♭/B♭ = a minor 2nd clash. This chord introduces **C♯ (D♭ enharmonic?), D♯, F♯**, which are **not in any B♭-centric diatonic scale**.

This suggests **atonal** or **polychordal** writing, possibly from 20th-century classical or advanced jazz.

---

### Step 6: Consider E♭ Major as a Hidden Key

E♭maj7 appears once, and G♭ is the **♭III** of E♭ major.

B♭ is the **V** of E♭.

But the progression doesn’t resolve to E♭; it keeps returning to B♭dim.

So **E♭ is not the tonic**.

---

### Step 7: Final Assessment

Given:
- Persistent B♭ in bass
- Repetition of B♭dim
- Use of chords a minor third apart (B♭dim → D♭m → E♭maj7 → G♭)
- Symmetrical harmonic motion
- Highly chromatic, non-functional harmony

The most plausible interpretation is that this progression is centered around **B♭**, using the **half-whole diminished (octatonic) scale**, with B♭dim acting as a **tonic substitute**.

Thus:

> **Tonal Center**: B♭  
> **Mode/Scale**: **B♭ Half-Whole Diminished Scale** (a symmetrical octatonic scale, not a traditional church mode)

This is common in jazz (e.g., diminished passing chords, tritone substitutions) and 20th-century classical music.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key center: B♭**  
**Mode: B♭ Half-Whole Diminished (Octatonic) Scale**

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Looking at this progression:

**Bbdim - Gb/Bb - Bbdim - Dbm/Ab - B/Bb - Bbdim - Gb/Bb - Bbdim - Emaj7/Ab - Bbdim**

Let me analyze this systematically:

## Primary Analysis

**Key: Gb Major (E♭ minor relative)**

**Mode: Gb Major with heavy emphasis on diminished harmony**

The progression is clearly centered around **B♭dim** (vii°7 of Gb Major), making Gb the tonic key.

## Key Evidence:

1. **B♭dim** = vii°7 of Gb Major (B♭-Db-Fb-Abb)
2. **Gb/Bb** = I6/3 in Gb Major (with pedal B♭)
3. **Dbm/Ab** = v6/4 in Gb Major (Ab-Cb-Db-F)
4. **Emaj7/Ab** = IV7/2 in Gb Major (Ab-Bb-Eb-Gb)
5. **B/B♭** = creates chromatic tension, likely functioning as vii°7/iii

## Harmonic Function Analysis:

- **B♭dim** acts as the dominant substitute (vii°7)
- **Gb/Bb** provides tonic stability with pedal point
- **Dbm/Ab** suggests subdominant area
- **Emaj7/Ab** is a IV7 with bass suspension
- **B/B♭** creates chromatic passing motion

## Conclusion:

This is **Gb Major** with a highly chromatic, jazz-influenced approach that uses **B♭dim** (vii°7) as the primary harmonic anchor rather than traditional V-I progressions. The mode is simply **Gb Major/Ionian**, but the harmonic language is sophisticated with extensive use of:
- Diminished chords as primary harmony
- Pedal points (Bb in bass)
- Slash chords creating contrapuntal motion
- Chromatic voice leading

The overall effect creates a floating, unresolved quality typical of modern jazz reharmonization.

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze the progression:

**Chords:**
```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

---

### Step 1: Note spelling in each chord

| Chord | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Bbdim | Bb–Db–E (enharmonically E = Fb) |
| Gb/Bb | Gb–Bb–Db |
| Dbm/Ab | Db–E–Ab |
| B/Bb | B–D#–F#–Bb |
| Emaj7/Ab | E–G#–B–D#–Ab |

---

### Step 2: Observations

- The repeated **Bbdim (Bb–Db–E)** suggests function as a **chromatic leading-tone diminished chord**, very possibly relating to **Gb major** or **E major**, depending on resolution.
- **Gb/Bb (Gb major)** fits naturally with **Bbdim** if we treat **Bbdim** as a **vii°/Gb** (i.e., the leading-tone diminished chord to Gb major).
  - In Gb major:  
    - Bbdim = vii°  
    - Gb = I  
    - Dbm/Ab looks like **ii minor** in Gb minor (not diatonic but borrowed).  
- **Emaj7/Ab** introduces both **E** and **G#**, which are outside Gb major (E is ♭7, G# enharmonically Ab).

So there are modal and parallel relationships happening.

---

### Step 3: Potential tonal centers

Most recurring chords:  
- **Bbdim** (vii°)  
- **Gb/Bb** (I in Gb)  

This makes **Gb major** the best candidate for tonal center.

However, the presence of **Dbm/Ab** (which would be ii minor borrowed from Gb minor) and **Emaj7/Ab** suggests **modality** or **chromatic mixture**.

---

### Step 4: Interpret functionally in Gb major

| Chord | Function in Gb major | Comment |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| Bbdim | vii° | leading-tone chord to Gb |
| Gb/Bb | I (first inversion) | tonic |
| Dbm/Ab | ii (minor) with borrowed ♭3 | modal borrowing (Dorian or Aeolian color) |
| B/Bb | non-diatonic, could function as a passing chromatic chord between Dbm and Bbdim |
| Emaj7/Ab | ♭VIImaj7 with the 6th (Ab) in bass | borrowed from Mixolydian/Aeolian color |

---

### Step 5: Conclusion

**Key center:** Gb  
**Mode:** Primarily **Gb major** with **modal mixture** — borrowing from **Gb minor / Gb Mixolydian / Aeolian** for color.

---

✅ **Final Answer:**

> **Key:** Gb major  
> **Mode:** Major with chromatic/modal mixture (borrowed chords from minor and Mixolydian).

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are many diminished chords, it might be in a minor key or using some modal interchange. Diminished chords often function as leading tones or passing chords.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb (which is Gb major with Bb in the bass, so it's a first inversion Gb chord)

- Gb/Bb

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Dbm/Ab (Dbm with Ab in bass, so first inversion Dbm chord)

- B/Bb (B major with Bb in bass? That seems odd. B major is B-D#-F#, and Bb is A#, so this might be a polychord or something. But probably it's B major over Bb bass, which could be interpreted as a specific chord.)

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb

- Gb/Bb

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Emaj7/Ab (E major 7th with Ab in bass? E major 7th is E-G#-B-D#, and Ab is G#, so this is actually Emaj7 in first inversion? Since Ab is the same as G#, so Emaj7/G#)

- Bbdim

Now, Emaj7/Ab: since Ab is equivalent to G#, this is Emaj7 with the third in the bass, so Emaj7/G#.

Similarly, B/Bb: B major chord with Bb in bass. B major is B-D#-F#, and Bb is A#, which is not in the B major chord. This might be a slash chord meaning B chord over Bb bass, which could be interpreted as a B7b9 or something? Let's see the notes: B chord has B, D#, F#; Bb is A#. So together, B, D#, F#, A#. A# is the enharmonic of Bb, but in context, A# is the major 7th of B? But B major 7th would have A#, but B major chord is usually triad, so with A# it becomes Bmaj7? But Bmaj7 has A#, not Bb. Bb is A#, so yes, Bmaj7 has A#. But here it's written as B/Bb, which might imply B major triad over Bb note. So the chord is B-D#-F# with Bb in bass. But Bb is not in the B major scale, so this could be a different chord.

Perhaps it's a typo or it's meant to be something else. Maybe B/Bb is B major with a flat bass, but let's keep it for now.

I should look at the overall progression and find common tones or functional harmony.

Let me consider the key based on the chords. The chords are Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Emaj7/Ab.

Bbdim is a diminished chord. Diminished chords are often vii° chords in major or minor keys, or they can be common-tone diminished chords.

First, what is Bbdim? Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G? Diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Bbdim is Bb, Db, E? But E is not E, it's Fb? No, in music theory, diminished triad is Bb, Db, Fb. But Fb is E? Enharmonically, but technically it's Fb. But in chord symbols, Bbdim usually means Bb diminished triad, which is Bb, Db, Fb. But in practice, often written as Bb, Db, E? But E is not correct because from Bb to E is an augmented fourth, not diminished fifth. From Bb to Fb is diminished fifth.

I think I'm confusing myself. Standard diminished triad: root, minor third, diminished fifth. So for Bb: minor third is Db, diminished fifth is Fb (which is E natural? No, Fb is equivalent to E only in equal temperament, but in spelling, Fb is not E. E is a different note.

In chord symbols, Bbdim typically refers to a diminished seventh chord? In jazz and popular music, "dim" often means diminished seventh chord, which has four notes: root, minor third, diminished fifth, and diminished seventh. So Bbdim7 would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb? But Abb is G? That's messy.

In many contexts, "dim" alone might imply diminished seventh, but sometimes it's just the triad. Looking at the progression, I see Emaj7, which is a four-note chord, so probably the dim chords are diminished seventh chords.

Let me assume that Bbdim means Bb diminished seventh chord. So Bbdim7 would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb. But Abb is G natural, so enharmonically, Bb, Db, E, G? But E is actually Fb, and G is Abb? No, from Bb to Db is minor third, Db to Fb is minor third, Fb to Abb is minor third, so it's a symmetrical chord.

In practice, Bbdim7 is often spelled as Bb, Db, E, G? But E should be Fb, and G should be Abb? But that's impractical. So in many scores, it's written with notes like Bb, Db, E, G, meaning Bb, Db, Fb, Abb? But E is Fb? No, Fb is E only if we ignore spelling, but in terms of sound, it's the same.

To avoid confusion, I'll think in terms of pitch classes. Bbdim7 consists of the notes: Bb, Db, E, G? Let's list the intervals properly.

A diminished seventh chord has three minor thirds stacked. So from Bb: minor third to Db, minor third to Fb (E), minor third to Abb (G). So the notes are Bb, Db, Fb, Abb. But since Fb is enharmonic to E, and Abb is enharmonic to G, it's often written as Bb, Db, E, G. But in strict theory, E should be Fb and G should be Abb for Bbdim7.

However, in chord symbols, "Bbdim" likely means Bb diminished seventh chord, so I'll proceed with that.

Similarly, Gb/Bb is Gb major chord with Bb bass. Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So with Bb in bass, it's still a Gb major chord in first inversion.

Dbm/Ab is Dbm minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm is Db, E, Ab? Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab? Fb is E? Dbm is Db, E, Ab? No, Db minor is Db, Fb, Ab. So with Ab in bass, it's first inversion Dbm chord.

B/Bb is B major with Bb bass. B major is B, D#, F#. With Bb bass, the notes are Bb, B, D#, F#. This sounds like a B7 chord with b9? B7 is B, D#, F#, A, but here we have Bb which is A#? A# is the enharmonic of Bb, but in B7, the dominant seventh is A, not A#. So B, D#, F#, A# is Bmaj7? But Bmaj7 has A#, which is the major seventh. But here the chord is B major triad over Bb bass, so the bass is Bb, which is not in Bmaj7. Bmaj7 would have B in bass with A# on top, but here bass is Bb, so it's different.

Perhaps it's a B chord with a flat root or something. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be Bb/B or something else. Another thought: in some notations, B/Bb might mean B major over Bb, which could be interpreted as a B7b9 chord without the root? Let's see the notes: B, D#, F#, and Bb. If we consider Bb as the minor ninth, then it's B7b9, but B7b9 would have B, D#, F#, A, Bb. But here we have no A, so it's missing the seventh. So it's not complete.

Perhaps it's B major with an added Bb, which is conflicting.

I recall that in some progressions, chords like this might be used for voice leading. Let's look at the context.

Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7 with Ab bass. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, and Ab is G#, so it's Emaj7 with the third in bass, so Emaj7/G#.

Now, let's list all the chords with their likely notes:

- Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G? (assuming dim7)

- Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db (so notes Bb, Db, Gb)

- Dbm/Ab: Db, E, Ab? (Dbm: Db, Fb, Ab so notes Ab, Db, Fb i.e. Ab, Db, E)

- B/Bb: B, D#, F# with Bb bass, so notes Bb, B, D#, F#

- Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D# with Ab bass, and Ab=G#, so notes G#, E, B, D# which is same as Emaj7/G#

Now, let's see the key signatures. Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. Gb major has Gb, Bb, Db. Dbm has Db, Fb, Ab. B major has B, D#, F#. Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D#.

Notice that Bbdim shares notes with other chords. Bbdim has Db, which is in Gb and Dbm. Bbdim has E, which is in Dbm as Fb? Dbm has Fb which is E, so yes. Bbdim has G, which is not in Gb or Dbm directly, but Gb has Gb, which is F#, so G natural is different.

Perhaps I should think in terms of a common key.

Let me consider the possibility that the key is Gb major or something.

Gb major scale: Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F Gb? Cb is B, Eb is D? Let's list: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb. So notes: Gb, Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, F.

But Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. E is not in Gb major; Gb major has B (Cb) and F, but not E natural. E natural would be Fb? In Gb major, the sixth is Eb, so E natural is not in the scale.

Similarly, B major has D# and F#, which are not in Gb major.

Emaj7 has G# and D#, which are not in Gb major.

So probably not Gb major.

Perhaps it's in a minor key. Let's try Eb minor? But let's see the chords.

Another approach: diminished chords often resolve to chords a half step above or below. For example, Bbdim might resolve to Bb major or minor, or to A major or minor, etc.

In the progression, Bbdim is followed by Gb/Bb, which has Bb in bass, so perhaps Bbdim is acting as a leading chord to Gb.

Bbdim and Gb/Bb share Bb and Db? Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G; Gb/Bb has Bb, Db, Gb. So they share Bb and Db, and Gb is a step from G? G to Gb is half step, so voice leading: G to Gb, E to? E to Gb? Not directly.

Bbdim to Gb/Bb: notes Bb common, Db common, E to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, but could be. G to Gb? G to Gb is diminished second? Not smooth.

Perhaps Bbdim is functioning as a vii° chord relative to Gb. In Gb major, the vii° chord would be Fdim? In Gb major, the leading tone is F, so vii°7 would be F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? But Fdim7 would be F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? Ebb is D, so F, Ab, B, D? But we have Bbdim, which is not Fdim.

Bbdim in Gb major? The chord built on Bb in Gb major is Bb minor? Bb is the second scale degree, so ii chord is Bbm? But Bbdim is not diatomic.

Perhaps it's in Db minor? Db minor scale: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Bbb is A, Cb is B? Let's list: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, A, B, Db? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B.

Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. Bb is not in Db minor? Db minor has Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B. So Bb is not there; Bb would be the flat second, so it could be Phrygian mode or something.

Dbm/Ab is in Db minor, so that fits. Gb/Bb is Gb major, which is the IV chord in Db minor? In Db minor, the IV chord is Gb major, yes. So Gb major is diatomic in Db minor.

Bbdim has Bb, which is not diatomic in Db minor; it would be the neapolitan chord if Bb major, but here it's Bbdim, so not exactly.

B/Bb has B, D#, F#, Bb. B is in Db minor? Db minor has B natural? In harmonic minor, the seventh is Cb, which is B, so yes, B natural is the leading tone in Db harmonic minor. But D# is not in Db minor; Db minor has Eb, which is D#? Eb is D# enharmonically, but in scale, Eb is the second, so D# would be the raised first? Not typically.

In Db harmonic minor, the notes are Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? No, harmonic minor has raised seventh. So from natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Then raised seventh means C instead of Cb? Cb is B, so raised seventh would be C? But C is B#? Let's clarify.

Db natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Bbb is A, Cb is B. So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B.

Harmonic minor: raise the seventh, so from B to C? But B is already the seventh? In Db minor, the seventh scale degree is Cb, which is B natural. So to raise it, we would have C natural? But C natural is not raised from B; B to C is a half step, but in terms of scale degrees, the seventh should be a half step below the tonic, so from Db, the seventh should be C, so in natural minor, it is Cb, which is B, so B is a whole step below Db? Db to B is a minor third? No, Db to C is a major second, so Db to Cb is a minor second? Db to Cb is a diminished second? This is messy.

Standard Db minor: key signature has flats, so Db minor has Bb and Eb? Let's think in terms of relative major. Db minor is relative to Fb major? Fb major is E major? No, relative major of Db minor is Fb major, but Fb major is not practical.

Db minor is often written with key signature of its relative major, which is Fb major, but since Fb is E, it's easier to think in terms of E major? But E major has four sharps, so Db minor would have many flats.

To simplify, let's list the notes of Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? But Bbb is A, and C is natural? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, C? But from Db to C is a major seventh, so for harmonic minor, the seventh should be raised, so from natural minor, the seventh is Cb (B), so raised would be C? But C is not raised from B; B to C is a half step, but B is already Cb, so raising Cb to C? But Cb is B, so raising to C natural? But C natural is not in the key signature.

I think I'm confusing myself. Let's use enharmonic equivalents. Db minor is the same as C# minor. C# minor has key signature of E major, which has four sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#. So C# natural minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B. C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#. So notes: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B# which is C.

So for Db minor, enharmonic to C# minor, so Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? But Bbb is A, and C is B#? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, C? But C is not B#; B# is C, so yes.

But in terms of chords, Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab, which is Db, E, Ab. So in Db harmonic minor, the V chord is Ab major? Ab major is Ab, C, Eb? But in Db harmonic minor, the V chord should be Ab major with raised seventh? In minor keys, the V chord is often major, so Ab major is diatomic in Db harmonic minor? Ab major has Ab, C, Eb. But in Db harmonic minor, we have C natural? From above, Db harmonic minor has C natural? From C# harmonic minor, we have B# which is C, so yes, C natural is the raised seventh? In C# harmonic minor, the seventh is B# which is C, so in Db harmonic minor, the seventh is C? But Db to C is a major second, so for harmonic minor, the seventh should be a half step below tonic, so Db to C is a major second, so it should be Cb? But Cb is B, so Db to B is a minor second, so in Db harmonic minor, the seventh is B? So why did I have C? I think I have a mistake.

Standard harmonic minor: the seventh scale degree is raised from the natural minor. In natural minor, the seventh is a whole step below tonic. In harmonic minor, it is raised to a half step below tonic.

So for C# natural minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B. So seventh is B, which is a whole step below C#? C# to B is a half step? C# to B is a minor second? Let's calculate: C# to B: from C# to B is down one half step? C# to C is half step, C to B is half step, so C# to B is two half steps? No, from C# to B: on piano, C# is one key left of D, B is one key right of A#? Let's use semitones.

C# to D: 1 semitone? No, C# to D is 1 semitone? C# to D is a minor second, so 1 semitone? But from C# to D is actually a half step? In terms of pitch, C# is the same as Db, so from Db to D is a half step? I'm getting tangled.

Let's start over with a different approach.

Perhaps I should look at the chord progression and find where it resolves or what the tonic might be.

Notice that the progression ends with Emaj7/Ab and then Bbdim. Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#, which is a chord that might resolve to A major or minor? But then Bbdim follows, which doesn't seem to resolve to A.

Emaj7/G# could be a secondary dominant or something.

Let's list the roots of the chords based on the bass notes or the chord names.

From the sequence: Bbdim, Gb/Bb, so bass notes: Bb, Bb, then Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, so bass: Ab, then B/Bb, so bass: Bb, then Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, so bass: Ab, then Bbdim.

So bass notes are mostly Bb and Ab, with some Bb from B/Bb.

The chords are often Bbdim and Gb/Bb, so Gb/Bb has Bb bass, so overall, Bb is a common bass note.

But Bbdim is unstable, so perhaps the tonic is Bb? But Bbdim would then be the vii° chord? In Bb major, vii° would be A dim? A dim is A, C, Eb, Gb? But Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G? So not the same.

In Bb minor, vii°7 would be A dim7, which is A, C, Eb, Gb, so still not Bbdim.

So Bbdim is not the vii° of Bb.

Perhaps Bbdim is a common-tone diminished chord for Bb major? But we have Gb/Bb, which is not Bb major.

Another idea: perhaps the key is Eb minor or major? Let's see.

Eb major scale: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb.

Chords: Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G - Db and E are not in Eb major. Eb major has Db? No, Eb major has D natural, so Db is flat seventh? E natural is not in Eb major; Eb major has E? No, Eb major has F? Notes are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So no Db or E.

So not Eb major.

Eb minor: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb? So notes: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, B, Db? Cb is B, so yes. So Eb minor has Db and B? But Bbdim has E natural? E natural is not in Eb minor; Eb minor has Gb and B? B is Cb, so no E natural.

So not Eb minor.

Let's consider the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, Ab is G#, so it's Emaj7/G#. This chord often functions as a dominant chord in A minor or major? Emaj7 is not typically a dominant chord; E7 is dominant. Emaj7 is a major seventh chord, which is tonic-like.

But in context, it might be used as a chromatic chord.

Perhaps the key is Ab major or minor.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab.

Chords: Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G - E and G are not in Ab major; Ab major has Eb and G? G is in Ab major, but E is not; E would be Fb? So no.

Ab minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab? So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb? So Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G - E is in Ab minor? Ab minor has Fb which is E, so yes! And G? Ab minor has Gb, so G natural is not in Ab minor; it has Gb. So Bbdim has G natural, while Ab minor has Gb, so G natural is the raised sixth? But in minor keys, the sixth is often raised in melodic minor, but let's see.

In Ab melodic minor: ascending: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab? So F and G natural? So yes, in Ab melodic minor ascending, we have G natural.

So Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. In Ab melodic minor, we have Bb, Db, E? E is Fb? In Ab melodic minor, the notes are Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. So we have Db, E? No, we have Db and F? F is E? No, F is F, E is not there? Cb is B, so notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. So we have Bb, Db, G, but we have F, not E. So Bbdim has E, which is not in Ab melodic minor.

Bbdim has E, which is the same as Fb? In Ab natural minor, we have Fb, which is E, so yes! In Ab natural minor, the notes are Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab. So Fb is E, and Gb is F#? So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb? So we have Bb, Db, E, but we have Gb, not G natural. So Bbdim has G natural, while Ab natural minor has Gb.

So for Bbdim to fit, we need both E and G natural, which would be in Ab harmonic minor? Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G? So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G? Yes! So in Ab harmonic minor, we have Bb, Db, E, G? So Bbdim is exactly the notes of Ab harmonic minor? Let's see: Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G. So the notes Bb, Db, E, G are all in Ab harmonic minor. So Bbdim is actually the vii°7 chord in Ab harmonic minor! Because in Ab harmonic minor, the seventh scale degree is G, so the vii°7 chord is G, B, Db, E? But G, B, Db, E is Gdim7, which is enharmonic to Bbdim7? Let's see: Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E? No, diminished seventh chord: from G, minor third to Bb, minor third to Db, minor third to E? But E is Fb? From Db to Fb is minor third? Db to E is major second? No, from Db to Fb is diminished third? Let's calculate intervals.

G diminished seventh chord: G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, Db to E is? Db to E is augmented second, which is not minor third. So for diminished seventh chord, all intervals must be minor thirds. So from G, minor third to Bb, minor third to Db, minor third to Fb? But Fb is E, so Db to Fb is minor third? Db to Fb: from Db to D is half step, D to E is whole step, so Db to E is two half steps? Db to D is one semitone, D to E is two semitones? No, in terms of semitones, from Db to E: Db to D is 1 semitone? Db to D is actually a half step? Db is the same as C#, so from C# to D is a half step? But from Db to D is a half step? Yes, because Db is one semitone below D. So from Db to D is 1 semitone, and from D to E is 2 semitones, so from Db to E is 3 semitones, which is a minor third? Yes! Because minor third is 3 semitones. So from Db to E is 3 semitones: Db to D is 1, D to D# is 2, D# to E is 3? But D# is Eb, so from Db to E: Db to D is 1 semitone, D to E is 2 semitones, total 3 semitones? No, from Db to D is 1 semitone, but from D to E is 2 semitones? From D to E is a whole step, which is 2 semitones, so from Db to E is 1+2=3 semitones, which is a minor third. So yes, Db to E is a minor third. So Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E? But E is Fb? enharmonically, but in terms of note names, if we spell Gdim7 correctly, it should be G, Bb, Db, Fb. But Fb is E, so often written as G, Bb, Db, E. So yes, Gdim7 has notes G, Bb, Db, E.

Now, in Ab harmonic minor, the vii°7 chord is built on G, which is the leading tone. So Gdim7: G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is E, and Bb is Cb? In Ab harmonic minor, the scale has Cb and Fb? Cb is B, and Fb is E. So the notes of Gdim7 should be G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Bb is not in the scale; the scale has Cb, which is B, so the chord should be G, B, Db, Fb? But B is Cb? Let's build the chord from the scale.

Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. So from G, the seventh degree: G, Bb? But Bb is the second degree? From G, the third should be B? But B is not in the scale; the scale has Cb, which is B? Cb is B, so yes, the third of G is B? But B is Cb, so the chord built on G: G, B (Cb), Db, Fb? So notes G, B, Db, E? So G, B, Db, E. But this is not a diminished seventh chord because from G to B is a major third? G to B is 4 semitones, which is major third. But for diminished seventh, we need minor third from root. So from G to B is major third, so it should be G to Bb for minor third? But in the scale, we have Bb? No, in Ab harmonic minor, we have Bb as the second degree, but for the chord on G, we use the notes from the scale, so the notes available are G, Bb, Db, Fb? But G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, Db to Fb is minor third? Db to Fb is 3 semitones? Db to D is 1, D to E is 2, E to F is 3? But Fb is E, so Db to E is 3 semitones, yes minor third. So G, Bb, Db, Fb is indeed a diminished seventh chord? But Fb is E, and Bb is A#? So notes G, Bb, Db, E? But in terms of scale, Bb is not the third of G; the third of G should be B or Bb? In the scale, the note between G and Db is Bb? From G to Bb is minor third, so yes, Bb is the minor third of G. But in Ab harmonic minor, the note is Bb, which is the second scale degree, so for the vii chord, we use the scale degrees: 7, 2, 4, 6? So G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is the sixth scale degree? In Ab harmonic minor, scale degrees: 1 Ab, 2 Bb, 3 Cb, 4 Db, 5 Eb, 6 Fb, 7 G. So vii chord: 7, 2, 4, 6? So G, Bb, Db, Fb? So yes, G, Bb, Db, Fb. And since Fb is E, it's often written as G, Bb, Db, E. So this is Gdim7.

But notice that Gdim7 has notes G, Bb, Db, E. And Bbdim7 has notes Bb, Db, E, G? So they are the same set of notes! Gdim7 and Bbdim7 are enharmonically the same chord? Let's see: Gdim7: G, Bb, Db, E. Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G. So yes, exactly the same notes. So Bbdim7 is equivalent to Gdim7.

And in Ab harmonic minor, the vii°7 chord is Gdim7, which is the same as Bbdim7. So Bbdim is the vii°7 chord in Ab harmonic minor.

Now, let's check the other chords in Ab harmonic minor.

Gb/Bb: Gb major chord. In Ab harmonic minor, what is Gb? The sixth degree is Fb, which is E, so Gb is not in the scale? Ab harmonic minor has G natural, so Gb is flat sixth? So Gb major would be the flat VI chord? In minor keys, the flat VI chord is common, but let's see the notes of Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db. And these notes are in Ab harmonic minor? Ab harmonic minor has Bb, Db, but Gb? No, it has G natural, so Gb is not in the scale. So Gb major is not diatomic in Ab harmonic minor.

But in the progression, Gb/Bb is used, which has Bb in bass, and notes Bb, Db, Gb. So it has Gb, which is not in the scale.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Dbm is Db, E, Ab? Db, Fb, Ab? So notes Ab, Db, E? In Ab harmonic minor, we have Ab, Db, E? Yes, because Db is the fourth, E is Fb which is the sixth? So Dbm is the iv chord in Ab harmonic minor? In minor keys, the iv chord is minor, so Dbm is the iv chord. And with Ab in bass, it's in first inversion, so iv6 chord.

Now, B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. B major is B, D#, F#. With Bb bass, notes Bb, B, D#, F#. In Ab harmonic minor, we have B? No, we have Cb which is B, so yes, we have B natural? But we have B natural as Cb? But B natural is the same as Cb? In terms of pitch, yes, but in spelling, Cb is B? But in chord, B major has D# and F#. D# is not in Ab harmonic minor; Ab harmonic minor has Eb? So D# is enharmonic to Eb? But Eb is in the scale, so D# is Eb? But in chord, if we have B major, it implies B, D#, F#, which are not all in the scale. B is in the scale as Cb, but D# is not Eb because Eb is D#? Enharmonically yes, but in functional harmony, it might be different.

Finally, Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, Ab is G#, so notes G#, E, B, D#. In Ab harmonic minor, we have E? Yes, as Fb? We have B? Yes, as Cb? We have G#? G# is not in the scale; we have G natural? So G# is the leading tone of A? But we have Ab, so G# is the same as Ab? But in chord, Emaj7 has G#, which is Ab, so it's conflicting because in Ab harmonic minor, the tonic is Ab, so G# is not used; we use Ab. So Emaj7/Ab has G# which is Ab, so it's like having Ab and G# together, which is odd.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is actually functioning as a German augmented sixth chord or something.

Let's think about the B/Bb chord. B/Bb might be a way to spell an augmented sixth chord.

In Ab minor, the augmented sixth chord typically resolves to the dominant Eb. The augmented sixth chord has notes like Ab, C, Eb, F#? Or something.

Recall: in Ab minor, the German augmented sixth chord would be built on Fb? Actually, the augmented sixth interval is from Fb to D? Standard augmented sixth chords: Italian augmented sixth: Ab, C, F#? But F# is Gb? Let's use Ab as tonic.

In Ab minor, the augmented sixth chord has the lowered sixth scale degree and the raised fourth scale degree? Typically, the augmented sixth chord built on the flattened sixth scale degree. In Ab minor, the sixth scale degree is Fb, so flattened sixth would be Fbb? That doesn't make sense.

Usually, augmented sixth chords are built on the b6 scale degree. In Ab minor, the natural sixth is Fb, which is E, so b6 would be E? But E is already flat? Perhaps it's easier to think in terms of notes.

The augmented sixth chord has characteristic augmented sixth interval between b6 and #4. In Ab minor, b6 is Fb (E), and #4 is C? But C is not in key; #4 would be C#? Let's see the resolution to dominant Eb.

The augmented sixth chord typically resolves to the dominant chord. So in Ab minor, dominant is Eb major. The augmented sixth chord has notes that chromatically approach the dominant notes. For example, the Italian augmented sixth has Ab, C, F#? But F# resolves to G? But Eb has G? No, Eb has G? Eb major has Eb, G, Bb? So from F# to G is half step? F# to G is half step, yes. And from C to Bb? C to Bb is whole step? Not smooth.

Standard Italian augmented sixth in A minor: built on F, so F, A, D#? resolving to E major? I need to recall.

Perhaps for Ab minor, the German augmented sixth chord would be spelled as Eb, G, Bb, C#? But C# resolves to D? But in Ab minor, the dominant is Eb, so resolution to Eb? Eb chord has Eb, G, Bb, so from C# to Bb? Not direct.

Let's think of the notes in B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#. If we consider this in Ab minor, these notes could be part of an augmented sixth chord. The German augmented sixth chord typically has the notes: b6, 1, b3, #4? In Ab minor, b6 is Fb (E), 1 is Ab, b3 is Cb (B), #4 is C#? But we have D# and F#? Not matching.

Another thought: B/Bb might be a misinterpretation. Perhaps it's Bb/B, meaning Bb major with B bass? But that would be Bb, D, F with B bass, so notes B, Bb, D, F? Still odd.

Perhaps it's B7/Bb, but it's written as B/Bb.

Let's look at the sequence: after Dbm/Ab, we have B/Bb, then Bbdim. So from Dbm/Ab to B/Bb to Bbdim.

Dbm/Ab is iv6 in Ab minor, so it might resolve to V or something. B/Bb might be a chromatic chord.

Notice that B/Bb has B and Bb together, which is a minor ninth, so it might be a dominant chord with b9.

Perhaps B/Bb is actually an E7 chord with b9? E7b9 would be E, G#, B, D, F? But here we have B, D#, F#, Bb? D# is G#? Let's see: if we consider B/Bb as B major with Bb bass, the notes are Bb, B, D#, F#. If we reinterpret D# as Eb, then notes Bb, B, Eb, F#. If we consider F# as Gb, then Bb, B, Eb, Gb. This looks like an Eb7 chord with alterations? Eb7 would be Eb, G, Bb, Db? But here we have B natural and Gb? B natural is Cb, and Gb is F#? So Eb, G, Bb, Db vs Bb, B, Eb, Gb? So if we take Eb as root, then we have Eb, Gb? But Gb is not G, so it's Eb, Gb, Bb, B? So it's Eb7b9? Eb7b9 would be Eb, G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is E? So Eb, G, Bb, Db, E? But here we have B natural and Gb? So if Eb is root, then Gb is b10? Not standard.

Perhaps it's a diminished chord or something.

Another idea: perhaps the key is Bb minor or major, but let's see the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#, which is often used as a secondary dominant to A? But then A is not in the progression.

Let's list the chords in terms of their function in Ab minor.

From earlier, Bbdim is vii°7 in Ab harmonic minor.

Dbm/Ab is iv6 in Ab minor.

Gb/Bb is not diatomic, but Gb major is the flat VI chord in Ab minor, which is common in minor keys for a borrowed chord from the parallel major? In Ab major, the VI chord is F minor? Not Gb.

Gb major is the Neapolitan chord in F minor? Not sure.

Perhaps Gb/Bb is acting as a dominant chord? Gb major has notes Gb, Bb, Db. In Ab minor, if we consider Gb as the dominant of Cb? No.

Another thought: in the progression, Bbdim and Gb/Bb are often together, and since Bbdim is vii°7 of Ab, it should resolve to Ab major or minor. But here it resolves to Gb/Bb, which is not Ab. So perhaps Bbdim is not resolving to Ab.

Perhaps Bbdim is functioning as a common-tone diminished chord for Gb? But Gb/Bb has Bb bass, so maybe.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Db major or minor.

Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db.

Chords: Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G - E and G are not in Db major.

Db minor: as before, Db natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B? So Bbdim has Bb, which is not in Db minor? Db minor has B? So Bb is not there.

But Gb/Bb is Gb major, which is IV in Db minor? Yes, Gb major is diatomic in Db minor.

Dbm/Ab is i chord in first inversion? Dbm is the i chord in Db minor? Yes, Dbm is the tonic chord in Db minor.

B/Bb has B, D#, F#, Bb. B is in Db minor? Db minor has B? In harmonic minor, yes, because raised seventh? In Db harmonic minor, the seventh is C, so B? No, in Db harmonic minor, the seventh is C? From earlier, Db harmonic minor would have C natural? Let's see Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? So notes: Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, C? So B is not there? B is not in the scale; we have A and C, so B is between A and C? So no B natural.

So B/Bb has B natural, which is not in Db minor.

Emaj7/Ab has E, G#, B, D#? G# is Ab, so it has Ab, but also E, B, D#? D# is Eb? So notes Ab, E, B, Eb? In Db minor, we have Eb, Ab, but E and B are not diatomic.

So not Db minor.

Perhaps the key is E major or minor? But then Bbdim would be far away.

Let's list all the chords and see if there is a common note or pivot.

Notice that in the progression, Bbdim appears frequently, and it has notes Bb, Db, E, G.

Gb/Bb has Bb, Db, Gb.

So shared Bb and Db.

Dbm/Ab has Ab, Db, E? So shared Db and E.

B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#. So shared Bb with others? But B natural is new.

Emaj7/Ab has E, G#, B, D#? with Ab bass, so shared E? But G# is Ab, so shared Ab? 

Also, Emaj7/Ab has B and D#, which are in B/Bb.

So perhaps there is a connection through B and E.

Another idea: perhaps the Bbdim is not functioning as a vii° but as a passing chord or as a dominant of another key.

Bbdim7 is symmetrical, so it can be used in multiple keys.

Perhaps the key is Gb major? But we have Emaj7/Ab which doesn't fit.

Let's consider the first and last chords. The progression starts with Bbdim and ends with Bbdim, so it might be that Bbdim is the tonic? But diminished chords are not stable, so unlikely.

Perhaps the tonic is Ab, and Bbdim is the vii°7, but it doesn't resolve to Ab.

In the progression, after Bbdim, we have Gb/Bb, which might be a deception resolution.

But let's look at the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#, which is a chord that can be used in A minor or C# minor etc.

But then Bbdim follows, which doesn't resolve to A.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is functioning as a dominant of A, but then it should resolve to A, but it doesn't; it goes to Bbdim.

So maybe it's not.

Another thought: perhaps the mode is something like Phrygian or Locrian.

Let's list the scale from the chords.

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G

From Gb/Bb: Bb, Db, Gb

From Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E

From B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

From Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, B, D#? but Ab is G#, so E, G#, B, D#

So common notes: Bb, Db, E, G, Ab, B, D#, F#, Gb? 

But Gb and F# are the same, D# and Eb are the same, but in context, let's see.

Notice that E and B are common in several chords.

Perhaps the key is E minor or major.

In E major, we have E, G#, B, D# for Emaj7, so that fits. Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G? E is in E major, but Bb, Db, G are not in E major. E major has F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#? So no Bb, Db, G.

So not E major.

E minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D? So Bbdim has Bb, Db, etc., not in E minor.

So not E.

Perhaps the key is B minor? But then Emaj7 doesn't fit.

Let's consider the chord B/Bb. If we think of B/Bb as a B7 chord with b9, then it might be the dominant of E? But then it should resolve to E, but it resolves to Bbdim, which is not E.

In the progression, after B/Bb, we have Bbdim, which has E, so perhaps it does resolve to E? But Bbdim is not E major or minor; it has E but as a chord tone, so if Bbdim has E, it might be heard as an E chord with additions? But Bbdim is diminished, so not stable.

Perhaps Bbdim is acting as an incomplete dominant of E? But Bbdim has E, so it might be like an E7b9 without root? Let's see: E7b9 would be E, G#, B, D, F? But Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G? So if E is the root, then G# is not there; we have G natural and Bb and Db? So not E7.

Another idea: perhaps the B/Bb is actually a misspelling of Bbdim? But why would it be written as B/Bb?

Perhaps it's B5/Bb or something.

Let's look at the sequence: Dbm/Ab to B/Bb to Bbdim.

Dbm/Ab is Ab, Db, E? B/Bb is Bb, B, D#, F#? Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G.

So from Dbm/Ab to B/Bb: the bass moves from Ab to Bb, which is stepwise? Ab to Bb is whole step.

The chords: Dbm has Db and E, B/Bb has B and D# and F#? No common tones.

Then B/Bb to Bbdim: bass Bb to Bb, so same bass? B/Bb has Bb bass, Bbdim has Bb root? So bass Bb to Bb.

Notes: B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#; Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G. So common Bb, and then B to Db? D# to E? F# to G? So voice leading: B to Db is minor third, D# to E is half step, F# to G is half step. So somewhat smooth.

Similarly, from Bbdim to Gb/Bb: Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G; Gb/Bb has Bb, Db, Gb. So common Bb and Db, then E to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, G to Gb? G to Gb is diminished second? So not smooth, but G might move to Gb.

So overall, the voice leading might be chromatic.

Perhaps the key is not traditional, and we need to find the most frequent chord or the chord that sounds like home.

Since the progression ends with Bbdim, it might be that Bbdim is the tonic, but that seems unlikely because diminished chords are dissonant.

Perhaps the tonic is Ab, and Bbdim is the vii°7, and the progression avoids resolving to Ab, creating tension.

But let's check the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#, which in Ab context, could be seen as a chromatic mediant or something.

Emaj7/G# has notes G#, E, B, D#. In Ab minor, G# is Ab, so it's like Ab, E, B, D#? So it has Ab and E, which is like an Ab chord with major third? Ab major has Ab, C, Eb, so not E. So it's not Ab major.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is actually an altered dominant of Ab? For example, in Ab minor, the dominant is Eb, so Emaj7/Ab would be E major over Ab, which is not related.

Another thought: Emaj7/Ab might be functioning as a French augmented sixth chord in Ab minor? Let's see.

In Ab minor, the French augmented sixth chord typically has notes: Ab, C, D, F#? But we have E, G#, B, D#? So not matching.

Perhaps for Db minor? In Db minor, the French augmented sixth would have Db, F, G, B? But we have E, G#, etc.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Bb minor.

In Bb minor, the chords: Bbdim is not diatomic, but could be vii°7 of Cb? Not.

Perhaps Bb harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A? So notes: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. So Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, G? But E and G are not in Bb harmonic minor; we have Gb and A, so no E or G.

So not.

I recall that in some jazz progressions, diminished chords are used as passing chords, and the key might be determined by the overall tonality.

Perhaps from the chords, the most stable chord is Gb/Bb? But it appears in first inversion, so maybe not.

Let's list the roots: from the chord symbols, the roots are Bb, Gb, Bb, Dbm, B, Bb, Gb, Bb, Emaj7, Bb. So roots are mostly Bb, with Gb, Dbm, B, Emaj7.

So Bb is frequent, but Bbdim is unstable, so perhaps the tonic is Bb major or minor.

In Bb major, Bbdim is not diatomic, but could be borrowed from minor.

In Bb major, the diatomic diminished chord is on C#? No, on A? vii° is A dim? A dim7 is A, C, Eb, Gb? So not Bbdim.

In Bb minor, vii°7 is A dim7, same as above.

So Bbdim is not diatomic in Bb.

Perhaps Bb is the dominant of Eb? But then why Emaj7/Ab?

Let's consider that Emaj7/Ab might be a typo or something else.

Another idea: perhaps Emaj7/Ab is meant to be Ebmaj7/Ab? But Ebmaj7/Ab would be Ebmaj7 with Ab bass, but Ab is the fifth of Eb, so Ebmaj7/Ab is Ebmaj7 in second inversion? But then notes Ab, Eb, G, B, D? But written as Emaj7/Ab, so not.

Perhaps it's E7/Ab? But it says Emaj7.

Let's look at the original progression: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim"

Perhaps in context, this is from a song or something.

Perhaps the key is Ab major, and the chords are borrowed from minor.

In Ab major, the chords: Bbdim is not diatomic, but could be from Ab minor? In Ab minor, Bbdim is vii°7, as we said.

Gb/Bb is not diatomic in Ab major; in Ab major, the VI chord is F minor, so Gb major is the flat VI, which is common in minor keys but not in major.

Dbm/Ab is iv chord in Ab minor, so borrowed from minor.

B/Bb is not diatomic; could be a secondary dominant or something.

Emaj7/Ab is not diatomic.

So perhaps the key is Ab minor, and all chords are from Ab minor or chromatic alterations.

In Ab minor, the diatomic chords include: i Abm, ii° Bbm? But Bbm is diminished? In natural minor, ii chord is diminished? In Ab natural minor, chords: i Abm, ii° Bbm? Bbm is Bb, Db, Fb? So Bb, Db, E? So yes, Bbm is diminished? But Bbm is Bb minor, which is diminished? No, Bb minor triad is Bb, Db, F? But in natural minor, the ii chord is diminished because the triad on the second degree is minor? Let's see: in natural minor, the second degree triad is built on Bb, with notes Bb, Db, Fb? So Bb, Db, E? So it is a diminished triad? Yes, in natural minor, the ii chord is diminished. So Bbm is actually Bb diminished triad? But usually, we write it as Bbm? But Bbm typically means Bb minor, which would be Bb, Db, F? But in minor key, the second degree triad has minor third and diminished fifth? So it is diminished? So in Ab natural minor, the chord on Bb is Bb, Db, Fb, which is Bb diminished triad? So we should write it as Bbdim? So yes, in Ab natural minor, the ii chord is Bbdim triad? But in the progression, we have Bbdim, which might be the ii° chord in Ab natural minor? But in the progression, Bbdim is likely a seventh chord, so Bbdim7, which is not diatomic in natural minor because in natural minor, the seventh chord on ii would be Bb half-diminished? Bb half-diminished would be Bb, Db, Fb, Ab? But Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, Fb, Abb? So Abb is G? So Bbdim7 has G instead of Ab? So Bbdim7 is not the ii°7 in natural minor; it is the vii°7 in harmonic minor.

So in Ab natural minor, ii°7 is Bb half-diminished: Bb, Db, Fb, Ab.

But in the progression, we have Bbdim, which is probably Bbdim7, so it has G instead of Ab, so it is from harmonic minor.

So in Ab harmonic minor, the vii°7 is Gdim7, which is the same as Bbdim7.

So indeed, Bbdim7 is the vii°7 in Ab harmonic minor.

Now, for Gb/Bb: in Ab harmonic minor, Gb major is not diatomic, but it could be the Neapolitan chord? The Neapolitan chord is usually built on the flattened second degree, so in Ab minor, the flattened second is Bbb, which is A? So Neapolitan chord would be A major? But here we have Gb major, which is not the Neapolitan.

Gb major is the flat VI chord in Ab minor? In Ab minor, the VI chord is Fb major? Fb major is E major? So flat VI would be? From Ab, the sixth is Fb, so flat VI would be Fbb? No, flat VI means lowering the sixth scale degree, so from Fb to Fbb? That doesn't make sense.

Typically, in minor keys, the chord from the parallel major are used, so from Ab major, the VI chord is F minor, so not Gb.

So Gb major is not diatomic in Ab minor.

But in the progression, it is used frequently, so perhaps it is a borrowed chord from Ab major? In Ab major, the chord on Gb is Gb major? In Ab major, the seventh degree is G, so Gb is not in the scale.

So not.

Perhaps Gb major is the dominant of Cb major? But Cb is B, so dominant of B major? But then why in Ab minor?

Let's consider the function of Gb/Bb. Since it has Bb in bass, and Bb is the second scale degree of Ab, so it might be acting as a dominant substitute? But Gb major is not related to Ab.

Another idea: Gb/Bb might be interpreted as a Bb7 chord? Bb7 would be Bb, D, F, Ab? But Gb/Bb has Bb, Db, Gb? So not Bb7.

Perhaps it's Gb major with added bass, but still.

Notice that Gb/Bb and Bbdim share Bb and Db, so perhaps Gb/Bb is like a resolution of Bbdim? But Bbdim has E and G, which resolve to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, G to Gb is half step, so perhaps.

Then Dbm/Ab is the iv chord, which is common in minor keys.

B/Bb is puzzling. But if we consider B/Bb as an altered chord, it might be a German augmented sixth chord in Ab minor? Let's see the spelling of German augmented sixth in Ab minor.

In Ab minor, the German augmented sixth chord typically spells as Eb, G, Bb, C#? But C# resolves to D? But in Ab minor, the dominant is Eb, so it resolves to Eb? But Eb chord has Eb, G, Bb, so from C# to Bb? Not direct.

The German augmented sixth has notes: b6, 1, b3, #4? In Ab minor, b6 is Fb (E), 1 is Ab, b3 is Cb (B), #4 is C#? So notes E, Ab, B, C#? But we have B/Bb with Bb, B, D#, F#? If we reinterpret D# as Eb? But then Bb, B, Eb, F#? If we consider F# as Gb, then Bb, B, Eb, Gb? So if we take Eb as root, then it's Eb, Gb, Bb, B? So it's Eb7 with b9 and b5? Eb7 would have Eb, G, Bb, Db? So here Gb instead of G, and B instead of Db? So it's Eb7b9b5? But B is not Db; B is Cb, so from Eb to Cb is diminished sixth? Not standard.

Perhaps it's a diminished chord in disguise.

B/Bb has notes Bb, B, D#, F#. If we consider this as a whole-tone cluster or something, but let's see the voice leading to Bbdim: B to Db, D# to E, F# to G, Bb to Bb. So it's chromatic motion down except B to Db.

B to Db is down a minor third, which is not chromatic, but the other voices move by half step.

So perhaps B/Bb is a passing chord.

Now for Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7/Ab has notes Ab, E, B, D#? So Ab, E, B, D#. In Ab minor, this could be seen as an Ab chord with major third? But Ab major has C, not E? So it's Ab augmented? But has E and B and D#? So it's like an E major chord over Ab bass? So it might be a polychord.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is functioning as the dominant of A? But then it should resolve to A, but it goes to Bbdim, which has E, so maybe it resolves to E? But Bbdim is not E major.

Another thought: perhaps the key is E major, and Emaj7/Ab is actually Emaj7/G#, which is I chord in first inversion? But then why Bbdim? Bbdim would be far from E major.

Perhaps the key is C# minor? Because Emaj7 is the V chord in C# minor? In C# minor, the V chord is G# major? But Emaj7 is E major, which is not G#.

In C# minor, the V chord is G# major, so E major is the III chord? But III chord is major in minor key? In C# natural minor, III chord is E major? So Emaj7 could be the III chord in C# minor? Then Bbdim? Bbdim is enharmonic to G#dim7? In C# harmonic minor, the vii°7 is G#dim7, which is the same as Bbdim7? Because G#dim7 is G#, B, D, F? and Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? So G#dim7 and Bbdim7 are the same? Let's see: G#dim7: G#, B, D, F? But from G# to B is minor third? G# to B is 3 semitones? G# to A is 1, A to A# is 2, A# to B is 3? So yes, minor third. B to D is minor third? B to C is 4, C to C# is 5, C# to D is 6? No, from B to D: B to C is 1 semitone, C to C# is 2, C# to D is 3? So yes, 3 semitones, minor third. D to F is minor third? D to D# is 1, D# to E is 2, E to F is 3? So yes, so G#dim7 is G#, B, D, F? But F is not F#? So notes G#, B, D, F. And Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? So are they the same? G# to Bb is the same as Bb? G# is A? Let's list pitch classes: G#dim7: G#, B, D, F. Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G. So pitch classes: G#=Ab, B, D, F? and Bb, Db, E, G? So for them to be the same, we need G#=Bb? No, G# is not Bb. So they are not the same set. But if we take G#dim7 and transpose it, it might be the same as Bdim7? No.

G#dim7: G#, B, D, F. Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G. So for example, if we take G#dim7 and lower each note by half step, we get G, Bb, Db, E? which is Gdim7? So G#dim7 and Bbdim7 are different.

But in terms of sound, since diminished chords are symmetrical, any diminished seventh chord can be seen as one of three possible roots? But the pitch class set is the same for all diminished seventh chords? No, there are only three distinct diminished seventh chords because each diminished seventh chord covers four notes, and there are 12 notes, so 12/4=3 distinct sets? Let's see.

One diminished seventh chord set: C, Eb, Gb, A? another: C#, E, G, Bb? another: D, F, Ab, B? So yes, three distinct sets.

So Bbdim7 has notes Bb, Db, E, G? which is the same set as Db dim7? Db dim7: Db, E, G, Bb? Yes! So Bbdim7 is the same as Db dim7, E dim7, G dim7? So it's one of the sets.

Similarly, G#dim7 has notes G#, B, D, F? which is the same as B dim7, D dim7, F dim7? So different set.

So for Bbdim7, it is in the set that includes Bb, Db, E, G.

Now, in C# minor, the vii°7 is G#dim7, which is from the set G#, B, D, F, so not the same as Bbdim7.

So for Bbdim7 to be the vii°7, it must be in a key where the seventh degree is G? So for example, if the key is Ab minor, seventh degree is G, so vii°7 is Gdim7, which is the same as Bbdim7? Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E? So yes, same as Bbdim7? Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? So yes, same notes. So in Ab minor, vii°7 is Gdim7, which is enharmonic to Bbdim7? But Bbdim7 has Bb, which is not G? But the notes are the same: Bb, Db, E, G is the same as G, Bb, Db, E? So yes, same chord. So when we see Bbdim7, it can be functioning as vii°7 in Ab minor.

So back to Ab minor.

So for the progression in Ab minor, we have:
- Bbdim7 (vii°7)
- Gb/Bb ( flat VI chord? but not diatomic)
- Dbm/Ab (iv6)
- B/Bb (?
- Emaj7/Ab (?

So for B/Bb, if we consider it in Ab minor, what could it be? Perhaps it is a German augmented sixth chord? Let's spell the German augmented sixth in Ab minor.

The German augmented sixth chord is built on the flattened sixth degree. In Ab minor, the sixth degree is Fb (E), so flattened sixth would be? Actually, the augmented sixth chord is built on the b6 scale degree, but in minor, the natural sixth is already flat, so usually, the augmented sixth chord uses the natural sixth? I need to recall.

In minor keys, the augmented sixth chord typically uses the lowered sixth scale degree from the natural minor? Let's take A minor as example.

In A minor, the augmented sixth chord has notes: F, A, C#? This is Italian augmented sixth? But F is the b6? In A natural minor, the sixth is F, so b6 is F? But F is already there? So the Italian augmented sixth in A minor is F, A, C#? and it resolves to E major? So notes F, A, C#? So the augmented sixth is between F and C#? F to C# is augmented sixth? Yes.

So in Ab minor, the Italian augmented sixth would be on Fb? But Fb is E, so E, Ab, C? But C is not C#? So for German augmented sixth, in A minor, it is F, A, C#, D#? But D# is E? So notes F, A, C#, E? So in Ab minor, it would be E, Ab, C, F? But C is not C#? So for German, it should be E, Ab, C, F#? But F# is Gb? So notes E, Ab, C, Gb? But we have B/Bb with Bb, B, D#, F#? So if we compare, for German augmented sixth in Ab minor, we expect E, Ab, C, Gb? But B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#? So if we reinterpret B as C? B is Cb? So B is Cb? In Ab minor, Cb is the third, so for German augmented sixth, we have E, Ab, C, Gb? So notes E, Ab, C, Gb. But B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#? So if we take B as Cb, then B is Cb, and D# as Eb? But Eb is not in the chord? So not matching.

Perhaps B/Bb is the French augmented sixth? In A minor, French augmented sixth is F, A, B, D#? So notes F, A, B, D#? So in Ab minor, it would be E, Ab, Bb, D#? But D# is Eb? So E, Ab, Bb, Eb? But B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F#? So if we have E, Ab, Bb, Eb? But B/Bb has B instead of Ab? So not.

So B/Bb doesn't match any standard augmented sixth chord.

Perhaps B/Bb is a secondary dominant? For example, if it is B major, it could be the dominant of E? But then why over Bb bass?

Another idea: perhaps B/Bb is meant to be Bb7? But Bb7 would be Bb, D, F, Ab? but here we have B, D#, F#? so not.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Gb major.

In Gb major, the chords: Bbdim is not diatomic, but could be from Gb minor? etc.

I think I need to accept that for this progression, the key is Ab minor, and B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab are chromatic chords for color.

So for the purpose of this exercise, I'll go with Ab minor.

So key: Ab minor

Mode: harmonic minor? Since Bbdim7 is used, which is from harmonic minor.

So answer: key of Ab minor.

But let's confirm with the Emaj7/Ab. In Ab minor, Emaj7/Ab has notes Ab, E, B, D#? which can be seen as an E major chord over Ab, which is chromatic, but might be used as a borrowed chord from Ab major? But in Ab major, E major is not diatomic.

Perhaps it's a modulation to E major, but then back to Bbdim.

But since the progression ends with Bbdim, which is vii°7 of Ab, it suggests Ab minor.

So I think Ab minor is the key.

So for the response, I'll say key of Ab minor.

But the user asked for key and mode, so mode is minor.

So final answer: Key of Ab minor.

The chord progression features Bbdim7 chords, which function as the vii°7 chord in Ab harmonic minor. This is supported by the presence of Dbm/Ab, which is the iv6 chord in Ab minor, and the overall tonal center suggests Ab as the tonic. The use of diminished chords and minor chords aligns with the harmonic minor mode, where the raised seventh scale degree (G natural) creates the leading tone tension resolved through the vii°7 chord.

The chords Gb/Bb and B/Bb are chromatic alterations or borrowed chords that add color but do not change the fundamental key. Emaj7/Ab is a chromatic chord that may serve as a secondary dominant or borrowed chord, but it does not disrupt the established key of Ab minor.

Thus, the key is **Ab minor**, and the mode is **minor** (specifically harmonic minor due to the use of the diminished seventh chord).

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.  

---

## **1. Identify the chords**

- **Bbdim** = B♭ diminished triad (B♭, D♭, F♭=E)  
  In context, this is likely a **B♭°7** chord (B♭, D♭, F♭, G♭) — fully diminished 7th.

- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major with B♭ in bass → notes: B♭, G♭, D♭.  
  This is enharmonically same as **F♯/A♯** but spelled with flats.

- **Dbm/Ab** = D♭ minor with A♭ in bass → notes: A♭, D♭, F♭(E).  
  D♭ minor = D♭, F♭, A♭.

- **B/Bb** = B major with B♭ in bass → notes: B♭, B, D♯, F♯? Wait, B major triad is B, D♯, F♯. So B/B♭ = B♭, B, D♯, F♯ — a very dissonant polychord.

- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th (E, G♯, B, D♯) with A♭ in bass → notes: A♭, E, G♯, B, D♯.  
  A♭ against E major 7 creates strong dissonance.

---

## **2. Look for functional relationships**

B♭°7 = vii°7 in C minor (or could be common-tone diminished for B♭, G♭, etc.).  
But G♭/B♭ is G♭ major with B♭ bass — that’s just first inversion G♭ major.  
B♭°7 and G♭ major share notes:  
B♭°7 = B♭, D♭, F♭(E), G♭  
G♭ major = G♭, B♭, D♭  
So B♭°7 contains G♭ major triad plus F♭ (which is E).  
So B♭°7 could be working as G♭7(b9) without root (G♭7 = G♭ B♭ D♭ F♭; b9 = A𝄫 = G♭? Wait no, b9 is A𝄫=G? Let’s check: G♭7 chord = G♭ B♭ D♭ F♭; add b9 = A𝄫 (G natural). That’s not here. Actually B♭ is the b9 of A♭7, not G♭7. Let’s hold that thought.)

Better: B♭°7 is also D♭°7, E°7, G°7 — it’s symmetric.  
So B♭°7 = D♭°7 = E°7 = G°7.  

If B♭°7 → G♭/B♭, that’s like common-tone: B♭°7 shares B♭ and D♭ with G♭ major.  

---

## **3. Check the progression**

Bbdim → Gb/Bb (×2) → Bbdim → Dbm/Ab → B/Bb → Bbdim → Gb/Bb (×2) → Bbdim → Emaj7/Ab → Bbdim.

So structure:  
B♭° - G♭/B♭ - G♭/B♭ - B♭° - D♭m/Ab - B/B♭ - B♭° - G♭/B♭ - G♭/B♭ - B♭° - E maj7/Ab - B♭°.

---

## **4. Try to find a tonal center**

The B♭° is a recurring motif.  
B♭° could be vii°7 of C minor, but we never see C minor.  
B♭° could be a common-tone diminished of B♭ major, but B♭ major not seen.  
B♭° could be functioning as G♭7(b9) without root (G♭), so tonic might be C♭ major (B major?? enharmonic).  

Let’s test: If G♭7 → C♭ major, yes. G♭/B♭ is just G♭ major (IV of D♭ major? or bII of F major? Neapolitan).  

But then E maj7/Ab — E major is unrelated to C♭ major. Enharmonically E major = F♭ major, which is same as C♭’s IV? No, C♭ major’s IV is F♭ major (=E major). Yes! So E maj7/Ab in C♭ major = IV maj7 with b6 in bass (A♭ is b6 of C♭ major). That fits:  
C♭ major: C♭ D♭ E♭ F♭ G♭ A♭ B♭.  
F♭ major 7 = F♭ A♭ C♭ E♭ — but here we have E maj7 = E G♯ B D♯, enharmonic to F♭ A♭ C♭ E♭ exactly. Yes! So E maj7 = F♭ maj7.  

So E maj7/Ab = F♭maj7/Ab = IV maj7 with A♭ bass (A♭ is in C♭ major scale).  

---

## **5. So key is C♭ major**

C♭ major = B major enharmonically, but spelled with flats here because of G♭, D♭m, B♭°7, etc.  

Mode: major (Ionian).  

---

## **6. Check the B/B♭ chord**

B major = C♭ major? No, B major is enharmonic to C♭ major, so B/B♭ is a kind of tonic chord with a foreign bass B♭ (which is in C♭ major scale actually — B♭ is the 7th degree of C♭ major). So B/B♭ = I maj with ♭7 in bass.  

---

## **7. Conclusion**

**Key:** C♭ major (enharmonic to B major, but flat spelling fits the chords given).  
**Mode:** Major (Ionian).  

---

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Cb\ major}
\]

**Assistant - GLM 4.6 Thinking**

### Reasoning

1.  **Initial Impression & Goal:** The user has provided a chord progression. My goal is to determine the key and mode. The chords are: `Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim`. It's a repeating pattern, which is very helpful.

2.  **First Pass: Chord Analysis.** I need to understand what each chord *is*.
    *   `Bbdim`: Bb diminished triad (Bb - Db - Fb). Fb is enharmonic to E.
    *   `Gb/Bb`: This is a Gb major triad (Gb - Bb - Db) with Bb in the bass. This is an inversion. Let's analyze it as a Gb major chord first.
    *   `Dbm/Ab`: This is a D minor (with a flat 5, so D diminished) triad (Db - Fb - Abb) with Ab in the bass. Fb is E, Abb is G. So, Db - E - G. The bass note is Ab. Let's re-evaluate. The chord symbol says `Dbm/Ab`. `Dbm` is D - F - Ab. The bass is Ab. This is a first inversion D minor triad.
    *   `B/Bb`: This is a B major triad (B - D# - F#) with Bb in the bass. This is a very dissonant chord. It's a polychord or a slash chord with a non-chord tone in the bass. The bass note (Bb) is a minor second (or a flat ninth) below the root of the triad (B). This is a strong clue.
    *   `Emaj7/Ab`: This is an E major 7th chord (E - G# - B - D#) with Ab in the bass. Ab is enharmonic to G#. So, this is an `Emaj7/G#`, which is the first inversion of an Emaj7 chord. This is a very standard and functional chord.

3.  **Synthesize and Look for Patterns.** Let's list the chords again, but with my analysis:
    *   `Bbdim` (i° in Bb minor, vii° in Cb major, or leading tone chord for Cb)
    *   `Gb/Bb` (Gb major with Bb in the bass. Bb is the minor third of Gb. So it's a `Gb` chord in first inversion, `Gb/Bb`.)
    *   `Dbm/Ab` (D minor first inversion. This is the `iv` chord in A major, the `ii` chord in C major, etc. Let's see how it fits.)
    *   `B/Bb` (B major with Bb in the bass. Very tense.)
    *   `Emaj7/Ab` (E major 7th first inversion. `Emaj7/G#`)

4.  **Look for a "Home" Chord.** Is there a chord that feels like tonic? The progression is very cyclical and doesn't strongly resolve in a traditional way. The `Bbdim` and `Gb/Bb` chords keep repeating. This suggests they might be part of a modal vamp or a static harmony.

5.  **Hypothesis 1: Is it in Gb Major?**
    *   Key of Gb Major: Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F.
    *   `Bbdim`: Not diatonic. The vii° chord is F diminished. The ii chord is Ab minor. The iii chord is Bb minor. `Bbdim` is not in the key.
    *   `Gb/Bb`: This is `Gb` major, the I chord. So far, so good.
    *   `Dbm/Ab`: `Dbm` is not diatonic. The vi chord is Eb minor.
    *   `B/Bb`: B major is not diatonic.
    *   `Emaj7/Ab`: E major is not diatonic.
    *   *Conclusion:* Gb Major is highly unlikely. Too many non-diatonic chords.

6.  **Hypothesis 2: Is it in Bb Minor?**
    *   Key of Bb minor: Bb C D Eb F G Ab. (Natural minor)
    *   `Bbdim`: This is the i° chord (if we're using a diminished tonic, which is rare) or more likely, it's functioning as a common-tone diminished chord or a leading-tone chord to Cb. Let's keep an open mind.
    *   `Gb/Bb`: Gb major is not diatonic. The VI chord is Gb major, but the chord is written as `Gb/Bb`. The diatonic VI chord would be `Gb`. `Gb/Bb` is the first inversion of the Neapolitan sixth chord in Bb minor (N6). The Neapolitan chord is a major chord built on the lowered supertonic (Db in C, Cb in B). Oh, wait. The supertonic of Bb is C. The lowered supertonic is Cb. A major chord on Cb is Cb - Eb - Gb. That's not Gb major. My mistake. Let's re-examine `Gb/Bb`. In Bb minor, Gb is the lowered sixth degree (b6). A major chord on b6 is a common borrowed chord (from the parallel major). So `Gb` is a bVI chord. `Gb/Bb` is the first inversion. This is plausible.
    *   `Dbm/Ab`: `Dbm` is not diatonic. The mediant is Db major. The submediant is Gb major. So `Dbm` is a borrowed chord, maybe `iii` from the relative major (Db major? No, that's not right). Let's analyze the notes: Db - F - Ab. In Bb minor, this is the `bII` chord (Neapolitan) but minor. Or it could be seen as `iv/iv` (a secondary subdominant). The subdominant is Eb. The subdominant of Eb is Ab minor. This is getting complicated.
    *   `B/Bb`: Again, very dissonant.
    *   `Emaj7/Ab`: E major is not diatonic.
    *   *Conclusion:* Bb minor is also looking unlikely. The harmony is too chromatic and doesn't follow standard functional patterns for Bb minor.

7.  **Hypothesis 3: Let's re-examine the chords from a different perspective. What if the bass notes are the key?**
    *   The bass notes are: Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb.
    *   The pedal point is overwhelmingly **Bb**. This is a massive clue. The entire progression is built over a Bb drone.
    *   This changes everything. We're not looking for a traditional key center defined by chord roots, but a modal center defined by a tonic pitch (Bb) and a collection of chords that relate to it.

8.  **Re-analyzing the chords over a Bb pedal.**
    *   **`Bbdim`**: This is simply a tonic diminished chord. It establishes the tonal center as Bb, but with a tense, ambiguous quality.
    *   **`Gb/Bb`**: This is the crucial chord. Let's analyze the intervals against the bass note Bb.
        *   Bass: Bb
        *   Chord: Gb - Bb - Db
        *   Intervals from Bb: Gb is a diminished 6th (or enharmonically, a perfect 5th). Bb is the unison. Db is a minor third.
        *   So, the chord `Gb/Bb` over a Bb drone creates the sound of a **Bb minor triad (Bb - Db - F)**, but with the 5th (F) replaced by a **#5** (or b6), which is Gb. This is a very common sound in film scores and jazz. It's a `m(maj7)` sound without the 7th, or more simply, a minor triad with an altered 5th. Let's call it `Bbm(b6)`. This strongly points to a minor context centered on Bb.
    *   **`Dbm/Ab`**: This is tricky. Let's look at its relationship to Bb.
        *   The chord itself is Db - F - Ab.
        *   How do these notes relate to Bb? Db is the minor third. F is the perfect fifth. Ab is the minor seventh.
        *   So, `Dbm/Ab` contains the exact notes of a **Bb minor 7th chord (Bb - Db - F - Ab)**, but without the root (Bb) in the chord itself. The root is supplied by the bass pedal. This is a very strong confirmation that we are in some kind of **Bb minor** context.
    *   **`B/Bb`**: This is the "spiciest" chord.
        *   Bass: Bb
        *   Chord: B - D# - F#
        *   Intervals from Bb: B is a minor second (or b9). D# is a major third. F# is a sharp fifth (or b13).
        *   This is a highly altered dominant sound. The notes B - D# - F# are the 3rd, 5th, and 7th of a G#7b9 chord (G# - B - D# - F). But over a Bb bass, it's just a collection of tense upper extensions. It functions as a moment of extreme tension before resolving back to the `Bbdim` or `Gb/Bb`. It's a "chromatic approach" chord.
    *   **`Emaj7/Ab`**: Let's look at this one again over the Bb pedal.
        *   Bass: Bb
        *   Chord: E - G# - B - D#
        *   Intervals from Bb: E is a tritone (augmented 4th). G# is a major 6th. B is the major 7th. D# is a sharp 9th (or b3 of the relative minor).
        *   This is another very tense, "upper structure" chord. It doesn't have a clear functional name like "V/V" but it provides harmonic color and tension over the Bb pedal. The `G#` (major 6) is particularly interesting as it contrasts with the `Gb` (b6) from the `Gb/Bb` chord. This chromatic mediants (Gb and G) are a hallmark of this style.

9.  **Synthesizing the Modal Conclusion.**
    *   The tonic is clearly **Bb**.
    *   The core harmonic structure is built from the notes of the **Bb minor 7th chord**: Bb (root), Db (minor 3rd), F (perfect 5th), Ab (minor 7th). We see this explicitly in the `Dbm/Ab` chord and implicitly in the `Gb/Bb` chord (which provides Bb, Db, and the altered b6 Gb).
    *   The defining characteristic is the alternating use of the **natural 6th (G)** and the **flat 6th (Gb)**. The `Emaj7/Ab` chord contains G# (enharmonic to Ab, wait, no, G# is the major 6). Let me recheck. E - G# - B - D#. G# is the major 6th of Bb. Yes. So we have G# (major 6) in one chord and Gb (minor 6 / #5) in another. This is the defining feature.
    *   This use of both the major and minor 6th over a minor tonic is the primary characteristic of the **Dorian mode**.
    *   Let's check the Dorian mode for Bb:
        *   Bb Dorian: Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab.
        *   The chords we have (`Bbdim`, `Bbm(b6)`, `Bbm7`, etc.) all fit within this sound world. The `Bbdim` is a common tonic chord in Dorian vamps. The `Bm7` sound is the core of the mode. The `B/Bb` and `Emaj7/Ab` are just colorful, chromatic "passing" or "approach" chords that add tension over the modal vamp.
    *   The presence of the `b6` (Gb) in the `Gb/Bb` chord seems to contradict Dorian, which has a natural 6 (G). However, the `Emaj7/Ab` chord has a `G#` (which functions as a G natural in this context). The harmony is fluid and uses both. This is very common in modern Dorian-influenced music. The overall *feel* is minor, but with a "brighter" or "more hopeful" quality than pure natural minor, which is achieved by the use of that major 6th.

10. **Final Check and Formulation of the Answer.**
    *   **Key Center:** Bb.
    *   **Mode:** The evidence strongly points to **Bb Dorian**.
    *   **Reasoning:**
        1.  Overwhelming Bb pedal point establishes the tonic.
        2.  The core chords (`Gb/Bb` and `Dbm/Ab`) spell out a Bb minor 7th sound.
        3.  The `Gb/Bb` chord specifically is a `Bbm(b6)` or `Bbm(#5)` chord, a common altered tonic minor sound.
        4.  The `Emaj7/Ab` chord introduces the major 6th (G#) against the Bb minor harmony.
        5.  The juxtaposition of a minor tonic with the major 6th is the defining characteristic of the Dorian mode.
        6.  The other chords (`Bbdim`, `B/Bb`) are types of passing or approach chords that add chromatic tension and color, which is very typical in modal vamps to keep them from becoming static. The `Bbdim` is a common-tone diminished chord that reinforces the Bb tonic. The `B/Bb` is a chromatic upper-structure chord that creates maximum tension.

11. **Structure the final answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **Key: Bb Dorian**.
    *   Provide a step-by-step analysis.
    *   Explain the role of the Bb pedal point as the foundation.
    *   Break down the key chords and explain how they function over the Bb pedal:
        *   `Bbdim` as a tonic diminished chord.
        *   `Gb/Bb` as `Bbm(b6)` or `Bbm(#5)`.
        *   `Dbm/Ab` as a rootless `Bbm7`.
        *   `Emaj7/Ab` as introducing the major 6th (G#).
    *   Synthesize this information to explain *why* it's Dorian (minor 3rd, major 6th).
    *   Address the more complex chords (`B/Bb`) as chromatic color, which is common in this style.
    *   Conclude with a summary of the overall feel: a modal, minor-centric harmony with characteristic Dorian brightness and modern chromatic tension. The progression feels like it could be from a film score (like Thomas Newman) or modern jazz.


This is a fantastic and sophisticated chord progression. Based on the analysis, the key and mode are:

**Key: Bb Dorian**

### Detailed Analysis

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how we arrive at this conclusion:

#### 1. The Tonic is Established by the Bass

The most important clue is the bassline, which acts as a **pedal point**. The bass note Bb is held almost constantly throughout the entire progression. This immediately tells us that **Bb is the tonal center**, or the "home" note. We are not in a traditional major/minor key where the chords move the tonic around; we are in a modal context where a single pitch is the central anchor.

#### 2. Analyzing the Chords Over the Bb Pedal

Now, let's look at what each chord is doing in relation to that Bb bass note.

*   **`Bbdim` / `Bbdim`**: This is a **tonic diminished chord**. It's not a functional leading-tone chord; it's a static, ambiguous chord that reinforces the Bb tonal center while adding a touch of tension and darkness.

*   **`Gb/Bb` / `Gb/Bb`**: This is the most revealing chord.
    *   The chord itself is a Gb major triad (Gb - Bb - Db).
    *   When analyzed with the Bb in the bass, the intervals are:
        *   Bb (Root)
        *   Db (minor 3rd)
        *   Gb (diminished 6th, or enharmonically, a sharp 5th)
    *   This creates the sound of a **Bb minor triad with an altered 5th (Bbm(#5) or Bbm(b6))**. This sound firmly establishes a **minor** context centered on Bb.

*   **`Dbm/Ab`**: This chord cleverly spells out another core harmony.
    *   The chord itself is a D minor triad in first inversion (F - Ab - Db).
    *   The notes are Db, F, and Ab.
    *   In relation to a Bb root, these notes are:
        *   Db (minor 3rd)
        *   F (perfect 5th)
        *   Ab (minor 7th)
    *   This chord is essentially a **rootless Bb minor 7th chord (Bbm7)**. The root is provided by the bass pedal. This further solidifies the Bb minor tonality.

*   **`Emaj7/Ab`**: This chord provides the final piece of the modal puzzle.
    *   The chord is an E major 7th chord with Ab in the bass (E - G# - B - D#).
    *   Let's look at the crucial note: **G#**.
    *   In relation to the Bb tonic, G# is the **major 6th**.

#### 3. Synthesizing the Mode

We now have all the ingredients:
1.  A tonic of **Bb**.
2.  A minor 3rd (**Db**), establishing a minor quality.
3.  A minor 7th (**Ab**), reinforcing the minor 7th sound.
4.  A major 6th (**G#**), which functions as a G natural in this context.

The defining characteristic of the **Dorian mode** is that it is a minor scale with a **raised 6th degree**.

*   **Bb Natural Minor:** Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - Gb - Ab
*   **Bb Dorian:** Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - **G** - Ab

Your progression uses the notes of the Bb Dorian mode (Bb, Db, F, Ab, G) and frames them over a Bb pedal. The use of both the `b6` (Gb) in the `Gb/Bb` chord and the natural 6th (G) in the `Emaj7/Ab` chord is a very common and colorful technique in modern Dorian-based music, creating a rich, shifting harmonic texture.

#### 4. The Role of the "Outside" Chord

*   **`B/Bb`**: This is a highly dissonant and tense chord. The B major triad (B - D# - F#) clashes severely with the Bb bass note (creating a b9 interval). This chord doesn't belong to the Bb Dorian scale. Its function is purely as a **chromatic approach chord**—a moment of maximum tension that makes the return to the `Bbdim` or `Gb/Bb` feel like a release.

### Conclusion

The progression is a **Bb Dorian modal vamp**. It uses a Bb pedal point to establish the tonic and layers chords built from the notes of the Bb Dorian mode (Bbm7, Bbm(#5)) with chromatic passing chords (`B/Bb`, `Emaj7/Ab`) to create a sophisticated, cinematic, and unresolved harmonic landscape. The sound is reminiscent of film composers like Thomas Newman or modern jazz harmony.

### Reasoning

**Deciphering the Chords**

I'm currently dissecting the chord progression, note by note, to grasp its essence. The repeated use of B♭dim has caught my attention. I'm focusing on how it resolves, and the movement to and from G♭/B♭. Next, I plan to zero in on how the D♭m/A♭ and B/B♭ chords contribute to the overall structure.


**Key and Mode Exploration**

I'm now determining the key and mode. Initial analysis suggests B♭dim as a key element. The presence of G♭/B♭ and D♭m/A♭ adds complexity, potentially indicating a modal mixture or a temporary tonal shift. I'm investigating how B/B♭, a dissonant element, impacts the structure. Finally, Emaj7/A♭ will be investigated for its role in the harmony.


**Key Center Identification**

My current focus is isolating the true key center. The persistent B♭dim chord creates a harmonic puzzle. Its relationship to the other chords, especially G♭/B♭ and D♭m/A♭, is key to this. I'm exploring the implications of the B/B♭ chord, anticipating it might resolve to E♭. Then, I plan to analyze Emaj7/A♭'s role in the cycle.


**Determining Locrian Functionality**

I'm now investigating the potential of a B♭ Locrian mode. The B♭dim chord serves as the i, and I'm assessing the functionality of the other chords relative to it. The G♭/B♭ chord has the correct notes as the bVI. I'm seeing if the D♭m/A♭ chord is the ii. Further analysis will determine if this modal perspective holds. Next, I plan to analyze the chord B/B♭ for its dissonant implications in the harmony.


**Unraveling Modal Implications**

I'm now shifting my focus to the Emaj7/A♭ chord, a blatant outlier. It's clear that it disrupts the presumed Locrian framework. I am now evaluating the possibility of a different scale. The chord's presence introduces a level of chromaticism, potentially leading to a unique structure. The next task is to explore alternative tonal relationships to explain these chromatic deviations.


**Unveiling Scale Consistency**

I've determined that the progression's core key is B♭ and the mode is B♭ Diminished (Whole-Half). The B♭ diminished scale accommodates all chord tones. The Emaj7/A♭ chord is no longer an anomaly but harmonizes seamlessly within this context, solidifying the initial identification of B♭ as the tonal center.


**Confirming the Harmonic Framework**

My analysis has refined my understanding of the progression. The initial assumption of a Locrian mode proved inaccurate. I've now identified the B♭ diminished scale (Whole-Half) as the correct mode. This explains the presence of Emaj7/A♭ and allows for a comprehensive harmonic framework. I am now exploring the interplay of tensions and resolutions.




This chord progression is highly unusual and relies heavily on symmetric and non-functional harmonies, which often point away from traditional diatonic or common minor modes.

The key determination rests on identifying the central, most frequently repeated chord, which acts as the point of stasis or the "tonic" area.

### 1. Identifying the Tonal Center (Tonic)

The chord **B♭dim** (B-flat diminished) is repeated constantly throughout the progression and is the starting and ending point. This strongly establishes **B♭** as the perceived **Tonal Center**.

### 2. Analyzing the Harmonic Material

The notes of the B♭dim chord are B♭, D♭, and F♭ (enharmonically E natural).

We must find a scale that can accommodate this core diminished chord, as well as the other highly chromatic elements:

*   **B♭dim:** (B♭-D♭-F♭/E)
*   **G♭/B♭:** (B♭-D♭-G♭)
*   **D♭m/A♭:** (D♭-F♭/E-A♭)
*   **Emaj7/A♭:** (A♭-E-G♯-B-D♯/E♭)
*   **B/B♭:** (B♭-B-D♯-F♯/G♭)

If we try to fit these notes into a standard diatonic or melodic minor mode centered on B♭, the sheer quantity of non-diatonic notes (E natural, G♯, B natural, F♯) makes any such mode impossible.

### 3. Determining the Mode (Symmetry)

The fact that the music is dominated by a sustained diminished harmony, and utilizes many chords separated by tritone or minor third relationships (e.g., B♭dim and G♭ major, E major) is the hallmark of the **Symmetric Diminished Scale** (also known as the Octatonic Scale).

Let's test the notes against the **B♭ Diminished (Whole-Half) Scale:**
$$B\flat - C - D\flat - E\flat - E/F\flat - F\sharp/G\flat - G - A$$

*   **B♭dim (i°):** B♭, D♭, E/F♭. **(Perfect fit)**
*   **G♭/B♭:** G♭ (F♯), B♭, D♭. **(Perfect fit)**
*   **D♭m/A♭:** D♭, F♭ (E), A♭ (G♯). **(Perfect fit)**
*   **Emaj7/A♭:** E, G♯, B (C♭), D♯ (E♭). **(Perfect fit)**
*   **B/B♭:** B (C♭), D♯ (E♭), F♯ (G♭). **(Perfect fit)**

Since every chord, including the highly chromatic B/B♭ and Emaj7, can be derived directly from the B♭ Diminished (W/H) scale, this is the functional scale for the progression.

---

## Conclusion

*   **Key Center (Tonic):** **B♭** (established by the repetition and sustained emphasis on B♭dim).
*   **Mode:** **Diminished (Octatonic)** (specifically the Whole-Half variant, $B\flat$ W/H).

The progression is a study in **B♭ Diminished Harmony** or **B-flat Octatonicism**.

## Analysis of the Chord Progression

The progression heavily features the **Bb diminished chord (Bbdim)** and chords built over a **Bb bass**.

1.  **Bbdim (vii°/Bb):** $\text{Bb-Db-Fb}$ (or $\text{Bb-Db-E}$) - This is a diminished triad.
2.  **Gb/Bb (V/Bb):** $\text{Bb-Db-Gb}$ - This is a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. This chord is often felt as a **Gb/Bb** passing chord. Given the key revolves around Bb, this might function as the $\text{V}$ chord if Fb ($\text{E}$) is interpreted enharmonically as $\text{E}$.
3.  **Dbm/Ab:** $\text{Ab-Db-Fb}$ - Db minor chord with Ab in the bass.
4.  **B/Bb:** $\text{Bb-D\#-F\#-B}$ - B major chord with Bb in the bass. This is quite unusual.
5.  **Emaj7/Ab:** $\text{Ab-E-G\#-B}$ - E major 7th chord with Ab in the bass.

### Focusing on the Tonal Center

The most important observation is the dominant and constant presence of **Bbdim** and the fact that nearly every chord has **Bb** or an adjacent note ($\text{Ab}$) in the bass, suggesting **Bb** is the tonic or center.

| Chord | Notes | Typical Function (if Bb is tonic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bbdim | Bb Db Fb(E) | vii°/i (Diminished Tonic) or vii° (Leading Tone) |
| Gb/Bb | Bb Db Gb | *Chromatic* (V of Db?) |
| Dbm/Ab | Ab Db Fb(E) | *Chromatic* |
| B/Bb | Bb D# F# B | *Chromatic* |
| Emaj7/Ab | Ab E G# B | *Chromatic* |

The use of **Bbdim** as the recurring central chord is the defining feature. In standard functional harmony:
*   A diminished chord is typically a **Leading Tone chord (vii°)**, pulling strongly to the tonic ($\text{i}$).
*   If a piece resolves to **Bb minor ($\text{B}\flat \text{m}$)**, then **$\text{Bbdim}$** functions as the tonic chord $\text{i}^{\circ}$ in certain non-functional or experimental contexts, or more commonly a heavily altered **$\text{Bb}$** major or minor chord.

## Determining Key and Mode

The extreme chromaticism (Db, Fb/E, Gb, D#, F#, Ab, E, G#) complicates the identification of a simple diatonic key. However, the *tonal center* is unequivocally **Bb**.

### The Phrygian/Locrian Connection

The notes contained within the most central chord, **Bbdim** ($\text{Bb, Db, Fb}$), are consistent with the beginning of the:

1.  **Bb Locrian Mode:** ($\text{Bb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bb}$) - Locrian is the mode built on the $\text{vii}$ degree of a major scale (e.g., $\text{Bb}$ Locrian is $\text{vii}$ of $\text{Cb}$ Major).
2.  **Bb Phrygian Mode:** ($\text{Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb}$) - Phrygian is the mode built on the $\text{iii}$ degree of a major scale ($\text{Bb}$ Phrygian is $\text{iii}$ of $\text{Gb}$ Major).

Both modes contain a $\text{b2, b3,}$ and $\text{b5}$:
*   **Locrian:** ($\text{Cb, Db, Fb}$) (b2, b3, b5)
*   **Phrygian:** ($\text{Cb, Db, F}$) (b2, b3, P5)

Since the harmony emphasizes **Bb, Db, and Fb (E)**, the mode strongly features the flat 5th, which is characteristic of **Locrian**. The other chords (Gb, Dbm, Emaj7) are highly chromatic, often obscuring the melodic scale, but the *tonic triad* is diminished.

### Conclusion on Mode

The constant recurrence of the diminished tonic triad ($\text{Bbdim}$), combined with the overall dark, unstable chromatic sound, overwhelmingly indicates **Locrian**. Locrian is the only diatonic mode where the tonic chord is naturally diminished (i°).

## Final Determination

**Tonal Center:** **Bb** (established by the constant presence of Bbdim/Bb bass)

**Mode:** **Locrian** (established by the use of the diminished triad ($\text{i}^{\circ}$) as the primary tonic sonority)

**Key and Mode:** **Bb Locrian**
