Let's analyze the progression:

**Chords:**
```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

### Step 1: Note spelling in each chord

| Chord | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Bbdim | Bb–Db–E (enharmonically E = Fb) |
| Gb/Bb | Gb–Bb–Db |
| Dbm/Ab | Db–E–Ab |
| B/Bb | B–D#–F#–Bb |
| Emaj7/Ab | E–G#–B–D#–Ab |

---

### Step 2: Observations

- The repeated **Bbdim (Bb–Db–E)** suggests function as a **chromatic leading-tone diminished chord**, very possibly relating to **Gb major** or **E major**, depending on resolution.
- **Gb/Bb (Gb major)** fits naturally with **Bbdim** if we treat **Bbdim** as a **vii°/Gb** (i.e., the leading-tone diminished chord to Gb major).
  - In Gb major:  
    - Bbdim = vii°  
    - Gb = I  
    - Dbm/Ab looks like **ii minor** in Gb minor (not diatonic but borrowed).  
- **Emaj7/Ab** introduces both **E** and **G#**, which are outside Gb major (E is ♭7, G# enharmonically Ab).

So there are modal and parallel relationships happening.

---

### Step 3: Potential tonal centers

Most recurring chords:  
- **Bbdim** (vii°)  
- **Gb/Bb** (I in Gb)  

This makes **Gb major** the best candidate for tonal center.

However, the presence of **Dbm/Ab** (which would be ii minor borrowed from Gb minor) and **Emaj7/Ab** suggests **modality** or **chromatic mixture**.

### Step 4: Interpret functionally in Gb major

| Chord | Function in Gb major | Comment |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| Bbdim | vii° | leading-tone chord to Gb |
| Gb/Bb | I (first inversion) | tonic |
| Dbm/Ab | ii (minor) with borrowed ♭3 | modal borrowing (Dorian or Aeolian color) |
| B/Bb | non-diatonic, could function as a passing chromatic chord between Dbm and Bbdim |
| Emaj7/Ab | ♭VIImaj7 with the 6th (Ab) in bass | borrowed from Mixolydian/Aeolian color |

---

### Step 5: Conclusion

**Key center:** Gb  
**Mode:** Primarily **Gb major** with **modal mixture** — borrowing from **Gb minor / Gb Mixolydian / Aeolian** for color.

---

✅ **Final Answer:**

> **Key:** Gb major  
> **Mode:** Major with chromatic/modal mixture (borrowed chords from minor and Mixolydian).
