To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**  
B♭dim – B♭dim – G♭/B♭ – G♭/B♭ – B♭dim – B♭dim – D♭m/A♭ – B/B♭ – B♭dim – B♭dim – G♭/B♭ – G♭/B♭ – B♭dim – B♭dim – E♭maj7/A♭ – B♭dim

### Step 1: Identify All Unique Chords
Let’s list the distinct chords:

- B♭dim (B♭ diminished) = B♭–D♭–E–G♭  
- G♭/B♭ = G♭ major triad (G♭–B♭–D♭) with B♭ in the bass  
- D♭m/A♭ = D♭ minor (D♭–E–A♭) over A♭ bass → essentially A♭7♭9 (A♭–C–E♭–G♭–B♭♭) or just a D♭ minor in 2nd inversion  
- B/B♭ = B major triad (B–D♯–F♯) over B♭ bass → a very chromatic, dissonant polychord  
- E♭maj7/A♭ = E♭maj7 (E♭–G–B♭–D) over A♭ bass → functions like A♭13 (A♭–C–E♭–G–B♭–D)

This is a highly chromatic sequence with many non-diatonic chords.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Bass and Tonal Center

The bass notes are mostly **B♭**, appearing in almost every chord (as root or inversion):
- B♭dim → root = B♭  
- G♭/B♭ → bass = B♭  
- D♭m/A♭ → bass = A♭ (only exception)  
- B/B♭ → bass = B♭  
- E♭maj7/A♭ → bass = A♭

So the tonal center strongly gravitates around **B♭**.

---

### Step 3: Consider B♭dim as a Pivot

B♭ diminished = B♭–D♭–E–G♭  
This is an **incomplete dominant 7♭9 chord** missing the root. For example:

- B♭dim = G7♭9 without the G  
- Also = E7♭9 without the E  
- Also = C7♭9 without the C  
- Also = A♭7♭9 without the A♭

Thus, B♭dim can **resolve to C, E♭, G♭, or A** — i.e., any of the four possible roots a diminished 7th chord can lead to.

But here it’s **repeating** and **not clearly resolving**, which suggests it may be functioning as a **tonic substitute** in a diminished or octatonic context.

---

### Step 4: Consider the Octatonic (Diminished) Scale

The **half-whole diminished scale** starting on B♭ is:

**B♭ C D♭ E E♭ G♭ G A (B♭)**

Chords in this scale include:
- B♭dim7  
- C7  
- D♭dim7  
- E7  
- E♭7  
- G♭7  
- Gdim7  
- A7

But our chords include:
- G♭ major (not G♭7)  
- D♭ minor  
- E♭maj7  
- B major (highly foreign)

The presence of **E♭maj7** and **G♭ major** (which are a major third apart) fits the **octatonic symmetry**: E♭ and G♭ are 3 semitones apart, characteristic of diminished scales.

Also, **E♭maj7/A♭** implies A♭13 (A♭7 with 13th = F, but here it’s D = major 7th of E♭), which is not standard, but E♭maj7 over A♭ gives a **Lydian dominant** flavor (A♭7♯11), though that’s speculative.

---

### Step 5: Look for Modal Implications

The repeated B♭dim suggests a **symmetrical** or **modal** context rather than functional tonality.

In jazz and modern harmony, a static diminished chord can imply the **diminished scale** (octatonic), which is **not a traditional mode** (like Dorian, Mixolydian), but a **synthetic scale**.

Alternatively, if we interpret B♭ as the tonal center and the harmony as largely static, the piece may be in:

- **B♭ diminished (octatonic) "key"** – though not a key in the traditional sense  
- Or **B♭ Phrygian**? But Phrygian would have B♭–C♭–D♭–E♭–F–G♭–A♭, and we see G natural (in B major chord) and D natural (in E♭maj7), which contradict that.

The **B major chord over B♭ bass (B/B♭)** is extremely dissonant: B = C♭, so C♭/B♭ = a minor 2nd clash. This chord introduces **C♯ (D♭ enharmonic?), D♯, F♯**, which are **not in any B♭-centric diatonic scale**.

This suggests **atonal** or **polychordal** writing, possibly from 20th-century classical or advanced jazz.

---

### Step 6: Consider E♭ Major as a Hidden Key

E♭maj7 appears once, and G♭ is the **♭III** of E♭ major.

B♭ is the **V** of E♭.

But the progression doesn’t resolve to E♭; it keeps returning to B♭dim.

So **E♭ is not the tonic**.

---

### Step 7: Final Assessment

Given:
- Persistent B♭ in bass
- Repetition of B♭dim
- Use of chords a minor third apart (B♭dim → D♭m → E♭maj7 → G♭)
- Symmetrical harmonic motion
- Highly chromatic, non-functional harmony

The most plausible interpretation is that this progression is centered around **B♭**, using the **half-whole diminished (octatonic) scale**, with B♭dim acting as a **tonic substitute**.

Thus:

> **Tonal Center**: B♭  
> **Mode/Scale**: **B♭ Half-Whole Diminished Scale** (a symmetrical octatonic scale, not a traditional church mode)

This is common in jazz (e.g., diminished passing chords, tritone substitutions) and 20th-century classical music.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key center: B♭**  
**Mode: B♭ Half-Whole Diminished (Octatonic) Scale**
