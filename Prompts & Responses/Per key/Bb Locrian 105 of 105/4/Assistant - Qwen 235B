**Assistant - Qwen 235B**

Let's analyze the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
> Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Dbm/Ab | B/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Emaj7/Ab | Bbdim

---

### Step 1: List the Chords More Clearly

- **Bbdim** — Bb° (Bb–Db–Fb)
- **Gb/Bb** — Gb major with Bb in the bass (i.e., first inversion of Gb major)
- **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor with Ab in the bass (first inversion of Dbm)
- **B/Bb** — B major triad with Bb in bass? That creates a clash — let's check this.
- **Emaj7/Ab** — E major 7 chord with Ab in the bass

Wait — several issues here.

Let’s examine the problematic chords:

---

### 1. **B/Bb** — B major over Bb bass?

- B major = B–D#–F#
- Bb = A# — enharmonic, but Bb ≠ B
- So B/Bb is B–D#–F# over Bb — a tritone between Bb and B, very dissonant.

This is highly unusual. Possibly a typo?

But **B/Bb** might actually mean **B°/Bb**, or **Bdim/Bb**, since Bbdim appears frequently. Or maybe it's supposed to be **B°/Bb**, a common passing chord.

Alternatively, perhaps **B/Bb** means **Bdim/Bb**, which is the same as **Bdim** in first inversion.

- Bdim = B–D–F
- Bdim/Bb? Bb under B–D–F? That would require Bb as the bass.
- But Bdim does not contain Bb.

Wait: Bdim is B–D–F  
Bbdim is Bb–Db–Fb (enharmonic to A)

So they’re different chords.

But Bdim/Bb would be **B–D–F over Bb bass**, which creates a minor 9th interval (Bb–B) — very dissonant.

Alternatively, **maybe it's a typo** and meant to be **Bdim/Bb** but meant **Ab7** or **Bdim**?

Hold that. Let's look at **Emaj7/Ab**.

---

### 2. **Emaj7/Ab** — E–G#–B–D# over Ab bass?

- Ab to E is an augmented 5th — extremely harsh.
- That’s Ab–E—a tritone. In jazz, this might be a #11 or something, but rare.

But wait — perhaps this is **enharmonic reinterpretation**.

Let’s consider:

- **Emaj7/Ab** — maybe this is meant to be **Eb7#11/Ab**? Unlikely.
Alternately, perhaps it's a misspelling and meant to be **Em7/Ab** or **Ab/C**?

But let’s look at the overall harmonic movement.

---

### Step 2: Look for a Tonal Center

We see **Bbdim** repeatedly — often used as a **passing chord** or **common tone diminished chord**.

Also, **Gb/Bb** appears multiple times — Gb major with Bb in bass. So the **third** of Gb is Bb, so this is **first inversion Gb major**.

So **Gb major** is important.

Also, **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor with Ab in bass → third of Dbm is Ab, so again **first inversion** of Dbm.

So we have:
- Gb major (in inversion)
- Db minor (in inversion)
- Bbdim (repeated)
- ?B/Bb?
- Emaj7/Ab?

Hmm.

Let’s look at roots used:

- Bb (from Bbdim, Gb/Bb, B/Bb, Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab)
- Gb (from Gb/Bb)
- Db (from Dbm)
- B? (from B/Bb — questionable)
- Ab (from Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab)
- E? (from Emaj7 — very odd)

But note: **B** and **E** are not in the same key as Bb, Gb, Db.

Unless we consider **enharmonic equivalents**.

Let’s reframe everything in **enharmonic keys**.

---

Try enharmonic equivalents:

- **Gb major** = **F# major** (6 sharps)
- **Bb** = A#
- But that may not help.

Alternatively, consider **Bbdim** — a **common tone diminished chord** — often used to embellish a tonic or dominant.

Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb (Fb = E)

So notes: Bb, Db, E

Wait — Bb, Db, E.

E is enharmonic to Fb, but spelled as E, so this chord has a **major third interval** between Db and E? No — Db to E is augmented 2nd — in equal temperament, it's a minor third? No:

- Db to E = interval of an **augmented 2nd** (in notation), which is 3 semitones — same as minor third.

But in a **diminished chord**, all intervals are minor thirds.

Bbdim should be: Bb–Db–Fb (Fb = E)

So: Bb – Db – E (Fb)

So spelled as: Bb, Db, E — but E is actually Fb — so it's a **diminished triad**.

So notes: Bb, Db, E (Fb)

So pitch set: Bb, Db, E

But E is enharmonic to Fb.

So pitches: **Bb, Db, E**

Now, Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

Ah! So **Bbdim** shares **Bb and Db** with **Gb major**.

In fact, **Bbdim** is a **common-tone diminished chord** based on the **third** of Gb major.

Common-tone diminished chords often serve to embellish a major chord using a dim7 above the root.

So: Gb = Gb, Bb, Db

Bbdim = Bb, Db, Fb — common tones: Bb, Db — so **common-tone diminished chord emphasizing Gb major**.

So **Bbdim → Gb** is a **common tone movement** — likely **Bbdim is decorating Gb**.

Similarly, we see **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor chord in first inversion.

Notes: Ab, Db, Fb

So Dbm = Db, Fb, Ab

Also has Db and Ab.

Now, Bbdim has Bb, Db, Fb (E) — so common tones: Db, Fb with Dbm.

So Bbdim also shares notes with Dbm.

So Bbdim could be **decorating either Gb or Dbm**.

Now, later we have **Emaj7/Ab**

Emaj7 = E, G#, B, D#

With **Ab** in bass.

Ab = G#

Wait — Ab = G# enharmonically.

So **Ab in bass = G#**, which is the **third of E major**.

So if **Ab = G#**, then **Emaj7/Ab** is actually **Emaj7/G#**, which is second inversion of **Emaj7** — which is a **very normal voicing**.

So likely, **"Emaj7/Ab" is meant to be Emaj7/G#"**, not Ab.

Similarly, **"B/Bb"** — B major over Bb bass?

But B and Bb are a half step apart.

But **B/Bb** — if Bb is actually **A#**, and **B** is the chord, then perhaps **B/A#** — which is **B major over A#**, i.e., **Bmaj7/A#** or just **B major in close position**?

But still odd.

But wait — **Bdim** is B–D–F — notes a m3 apart.

If we consider **Bdim/Bb**, but Bb = A# — then B–D–F over A# — that’s A#–B = minor 2nd, very dissonant.

But here's a better idea: perhaps the chord **"B/Bb"** is a typo, and it's meant to be **Bdim/Ab** or **Bdim/Cb**?

Wait — look at the progression:

> ... Dbm/Ab | B/Bb ...

After **Dbm/Ab** (Ab–Db–Fb) comes **B/Bb**

But **B** and **Dbm** don't go together.

Wait — what if **"B/Bb"** is meant to be **"Bdim"** — and "B/Bb" is a typo?

Or **"Ab7"**?

Alternatively — here's a theory.

Let’s look at the entire sequence in **pitches**:

Let’s assume all are real and interpret enharmonically.

List all chord pitches:

1. **Bbdim** = Bb, Db, Fb (E)
2. **Gb/Bb** = Bb, Gb, Bb, Db → notes: Gb, Bb, Db
3. **Dbm/Ab** = Ab, Db, Fb
4. **B/Bb** = Bb, B, D#, F#
   - Very dissonant — Bb and B clash, D# vs Db, F# vs Fb
   - Not likely intended.

   Unless **"B/Bb"** is **"B°/Bb"** = Bdim with Bb bass — Bdim = B, D, F — over Bb

   So pitches: Bb, B, D, F — still Bb–B clash.

5. **Emaj7/Ab** = Ab, E, G#, B, D#
   - Ab and E = tritone
   - G# = Ab, so Ab–Ab = same pitch (if G# = Ab)
   - So if G# = Ab, then the chord has Ab (G#) in bass, and G# in chord — OK.
   - But E and Ab are tritone — fine in a dominant chord.

Wait — **E, G#, B, D#** over **Ab (G#)** is the same as:
- Bass: G#
- Chord: E, G#, B, D#

So it's **Emaj7/G#**, which is **second inversion Emaj7** — fine.

So **Emaj7/Ab** is just **Emaj7/G#** — not an issue.

Now, what about **"B/Bb"**?

Maybe it's **Bdim**, and the "/Bb" is a typo or mislabel.

Alternatively, consider that **"B/Bb"** could be **Cbb**, but no.

Another idea: in jazz, **B/Bb** sometimes means **B7/Bb**, which is **B7 in third inversion**.

B7 = B–D#–F#–A

B7/Bb? Bb is not in B7 — B7 has A, not Bb.

Unless it’s **B7/A**, but A ≠ Bb.

But **A = G#**, **Bb = A#**

So no.

But **B7** has A natural — so **B7/A** would be third inversion.

But labeled **B/Bb**, only if A was misread as Bb — which is a common **notation error** in some fake books.

So **perhaps "B/Bb" is meant to be "B7/A"** → B7 in third inversion.

That makes sense.

So: **B7/A** — chord: B–D#–F#–A, bass: A

Now, **what key has B7?**

B7 is the **V7 of Emaj**.

And we have **Emaj7** later: **Emaj7/Ab**

And **G#** is the third of Emaj.

So if **B7** leads to **Emaj7**, that’s **V7–I in E major**.

But then the rest of the chords are in **Gb, Bb, Db** — all flats.

But E major = 4 sharps.

But let’s check: are any of these chords enharmonic to E key?

- Gb major = F# major — 6 sharps
- Bb = A# — in F# major
- Bbdim = A#° — could be chord in C# minor or F# major?

Wait.

Let’s try **enharmonic reinterpretation** of the entire progression.

---

### Enharmonic Rewrite

Let’s rewrite everything in sharps.

- **Bb** = A#
- **Gb** = F#
- **Db** = C#
- **Ab** = G#
- **E** = E

So progression becomes:

> A#° | A#° | F#/A# | F#/A# | A#° | A#° | C#m/G# | B/A# | A#° | A#° | F#/A# | F#/A# | A#° | A#° | Emaj7/G# | A#°

Now:

- **F# major** — key of **C# minor** or **F# major**
- **C#m** — so C# minor chord
- **Emaj7/G#** — E major 7, G# in bass — G# is the 3rd of E
- **B/A#** — B over A#? B major chord: B, D#, F#

Now, **B7** would be **B, D#, F#, A**

But here it’s labeled **B/A#** — and A# = Bb — but if B7/A# is intended, but B7 has **A natural**, not A#.

So **B7/A** = B–D#–F#–A over A — so **A** in bass.

But **A# ≠ A** — a half step apart.

So cannot be.

But what if **B/A#** is **Bdim/A#**?

Bdim = B, D, F

Over A#? Still doesn't match.

Wait — A#° = Bbdim = Bb, Db, E

E = Fb

But in sharp terms: A#, C#, E

So A#° = A#, C#, E

Now, **E** is common to both **E major** and **C# minor**.

Now, look:

- We have **F#/A#** = F# over A# → F#, A#, C# — F# major in first inversion
- C#m/G# = C#, E, G# — C# minor, first inversion
- A#° = A#, C#, E
- Emaj7/G# = E, G#, B, D#, G# (bass) — so E, G#, B, D#

Now, **B chord?** — "B/A#" — if it's just **B**, major — B, D#, F#

But in key of C# minor or E major, D# is natural.

C# natural minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B

So **D# is in the scale**.

But **F#** is also in C# minor.

Now, **B major chord** (B, D#, F#) — is this diatonic?

In C# minor, the **V chord** is **G# diminished** — not B major.

But **B major** = **III chord in G# minor**.

Wait.

In C# **harmonic** minor: raise the 7th → C# D# E F# G# A B#

So **B# dim** is vii° — not B major.

But **B major** is not in C# minor.

But B major is **V of Emaj**.

And we have **Emaj7** — so possible.

So let’s suppose: **B major** → **Emaj7**

That's **V–I** in **E major**.

E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

Now, chords:

- F# major — that’s **ii** in E major
- C# minor — that’s **vi** in E major
- A#° — A#, C#, E — notes: A#, C#, E

In E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

A# is not in E major — A# is **leading tone to B**, but E major has **B natural**, not B#.

A# is **not in E major** — E major has **A natural**.

So A#° is **not diatonic** to E major.

But **A#°** is chromatic.

However, **A#° = C#° = E° = G#°** — all the same dim7 chord.

A#° = A#, C#, E, G

But we only have **Bbdim**, which is **three-note** — not full dim7.

Still, A#° = A#, C#, E — which is **G#° missing the G natural**.

In **E major**, we can have **common-tone diminished chords**.

For example, **C#°** could be a common-tone leading to C# minor.

But here, **A#°** — A#, C#, E — common tone with **F# major**? F# has A#? F# = F#, A#, C#

Yes! F# major = F#, A#, C#

So A#° = A#, C#, E — shares **A# and C#** with F# major.

So **A#° is a common-tone diminished chord for F# major**, using the **third** as the common tone.

Common practice: **ii°/ii** or **vii°/ii** to embellish ii chord.

Similarly, **C#m/G#** — C#, E, G#

A#° also has **C# and E** — so common tone with C# minor.

So A#° can decorate **C#m** too.

Then **B/A#** — if it's **B major over A# bass**, then:

- B major = B, D#, F#
- A# bass = A#

B to A# = minor 2nd — harsh

But in **E major**, **B major chord** is the **V chord** — dominant.

But why put A# under it?

Unless it's a **passing bass line**.

Let’s look at the bass line:

From the progression:

- Bbdim → bass: Bb
- Gb/Bb → bass: Bb
- Bbdim → Bb
- Gb/Bb → Bb
- Bbdim → Bb
- Dbm/Ab → Ab
- B/Bb → Bb
- Bbdim → Bb
- Gb/Bb → Bb
- Dbm/Ab → Ab
- Emaj7/Ab → Ab
- Bbdim → Bb

Wait — bass line:

- Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Ab, Bb

So mostly **Bb**, then **Ab**, then **Bb**, and finally **Ab** to **Bb**

But **Ab to Bb** is a major 2nd.

But **Ab** is also the **third of Emaj7** — so **Emaj7/Ab** means Ab in bass.

So bass: Ab → then Bbdim → Bb

So **Ab–Bb** — rising major 2nd.

But the chord before Ab is **B/Bb** with **Bb** in bass — so Bb → Ab? That would be descending.

Let’s lay it out:

Before **Dbm/Ab**: Bbdim (Bb)
Then **Dbm/Ab**: Ab
Then **B/Bb**: Bb
Then Bbdim: Bb
...
Then **Emaj7/Ab**: Ab
Then Bbdim: Bb

So bass line snippet:

...Bb (Bbdim) → Ab (Dbm/Ab) → Bb (B/Bb) → Bb (Bbdim)...

So Ab–Bb — a major 2nd.

Then later: Bb → Bb → Bb → Ab (Emaj7) → Bb

So **Ab–Bb** movement.

Now, in **E major**, **Bb** is **C flat**, not used.

But if we consider **enharmonic to A#**, then in **B major** or **E major**, A# is Bb — still foreign.

But here's a better idea: **this progression is in Gb major**, and the last chord is not Emaj7 but something else.

Wait — **Emaj7/Ab** — Ab is the **ninth** of Gb major? Gb major: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

So Ab is the **2nd/9th**.

So if we have Gb major, and a chord with **E** — that’s not in Gb.

E = Fb — so Fb.

But **Emaj7** = E, G#, B, D#

E = Fb, G# = Ab, B = Cb, D# = Eb

So **Enharmonically: Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb**

That's **Gb7** without the root!

Gb7 = Gb, Bb, Db, Fb

But we have Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb

Not the same.

Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb = **Fb minor 7 (Fbm7)**?

Fbm = Fb, Abb, Cb

No.

Alternatively, **Ab7** = Ab, C, Eb, Gb

We have: Ab, Cb (B), Eb, Fb — so **Ab, Cb, Eb, Fb** — that’s **Ab7(b9)** — Ab–Cb–Eb–Gb–Bbb, but here we have Fb instead of Gb.

Fb = E, Gb = F#.

No.

Wait — Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb

Intervals from Fb:
- Fb–Ab = major 3rd
- Fb–Cb = perfect 5th
- Fb–Eb = major 7th

So **Fbmaj7**?

Fbmaj7 = Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb — yes!

And Fbmaj7 = **enharmonic to Emaj7**

Yes!

So **Emaj7/Ab** = Fbmaj7/Ab — Fb major with Ab in bass.

Fbmaj7 = Fb, Ab, Cb, Eb

Bass: Ab — so **first inversion** of Fbmaj7.

Now, Fb = Gb? No.

But in practical terms, **Fb = E**, so keyboard pitch same as E.

But in harmony, if the key is **Gb major**, then:

- Gb major: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F
- Fb = E — but in Gb, the leading tone is F natural.
- Fb = E is enharmonic to the **6th degree down a half step** — not diatonic.

But **Fbmaj7** is **bVIIImaj7** in Gb? Gb has F naturals.

No.

But here's the key insight:

We have:

- **Bbdim** — Bb–Db–Fb — Fb = E
- **Gb/Bb** — Gb major
- **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor
- **Fbmaj7/Ab** — Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb

All these chords have **Ab, Bb, Db, Fb** = **Eb**

List the notes used:

- Bb, Db, Fb, Ab, Gb, Cb, Eb

So: Bb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Cb

That’s: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab

That’s the **Bb major scale**! But with **no A natural** — all flats.

Bb major: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A

But we have Cb, Db, instead of C, D; Fb instead of F; Gb instead of G; Ab instead of A.

So this is actually the **Gb major scale**:

Gb major = Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

Compare:

- Bb = Bb
- Db = Db
- Fb = E = not in Gb major — Gb major has F natural
- Fb = E is **not in Gb major**

Gb major has F natural.

But we have Fb = E natural.

So it's **not Gb major**.

Unless it's **G# major**, but unlikely.

Another idea: perhaps the key is **C# minor**.

C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#

B# = C

But we have Bb = A#

A# is not in C# minor.

This is difficult.

### Revelation: Common-tone diminished progression

The chord Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb) appears over and over, often alternating with Gb/Bb.

Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db
Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb

So common tones: Bb, Db

So Bbdim is a **common-tone diminished chord for Gb major**, specifically the **third-based ct° chord**.

Similarly, when it goes to Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb, Ab

Bbdim has Db, Fb — so common with Dbm.

And Fb = E, but in context, it's acting as a passing note.

Then we have Emaj7/Ab — which is Fbmaj7/Ab

Fb = E, so it's a chromatic major chord.

But in **Gb major**, the bVI chord is Eb major, not E major.

So this is chromatic.

But consider that **Emaj7/Ab = Fbmaj7/Ab**, and Fb is the **b3 of Dbm chord? No.

Perhaps the progression is in **Bb minor**.

Bb minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Abb

Common chords:
- Bbdim? No, i° in Bb minor is not stable.
- Gb = VI
- Dbm = ii or iv? Db = third scale degree.

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Abb

So:
- Gb = VI
- Dbm = iii
- Bbdim = degree i° — possible

But Bb dim is not a tonic chord.

And Emaj7 not in scale.

But if Bb harmonic minor: raise the 7th to A natural.

Bb, C, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, A

Then A is major.

But we have E major, not A.

Another possibility: **The key is Gb major, and "Emaj7" is a chromatic passing chord**.

But the most likely explanation is that this is a **jazz progression** centered on **Dbm and Gb**, with **common-tone diminished chords**, and the final Emaj7 is a **tonic chord in E major**, but that doesn't fit.

Given the prominence of Gb and Bb, and the bass line alternating Bb and Ab, and the final move to Emaj7/Ab, it's possible this is a **modal interchange** or **chromatic passing**.

But after careful analysis, the most coherent interpretation is:

### Final Analysis:

The chord progression is in **Bb minor**, and uses:

- Bbdim as a common-tone chord to Gb and Dbm
- Gb = VI
- Dbm = #iv (not diatonic) — so not likely.

Wait — if **Bb minor**, Db = minor third, so Dbm = biii

In Bb minor:
- i: Bbmin
- biii: Dbm
- VI: Gb

Yes! Gb is VI in Bb minor.

In Bb minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb, Abb (G)

So:
- **Gb** = VI — major
- **Dbm** = biii — minor
- **Bbdim** — not diatonic, but could be a chromatic passing chord
- **Bbdim** could be interpreted as the **vii° of Cb**, not helpful.

But Bbdim has Bb, Db, Fb — Fb = E, which is the 5th of Bb minor.

In Bb minor, the 5th is Fb (E) — yes.

But the chord is Bbdim, not Bbm.

So not tonic.

But the bass is often Bb, and chords are around Bb.

Yet the final chord is Emaj7, which is foreign.

Unless the **"Emaj7/Ab"** is not a chord in E, but a **spelling for Ab7#11 or something**.

Ab7 with G# = #11.

Ab7 = Ab, C, Eb, Gb
G# = #11 if you spell it as such.

But here the chord is "Emaj7" — E, G#, B, D# — so not Ab7.

I think the only way this makes sense is if the final chord is a **tonic chord in E major**, and the rest is a chromatic approach.

Given the B7 chord (from B/Bb likely being B7) resolving to Emaj7, it's likely that the key is **E major**, and the earlier chords are chromatic or passing.

**B/Bb** is probably B7/A, bass mistake.

So progression: common-tone diminished in F#/C#, then B7, then Emaj7.

So the mode is **E major (Ionian)**.

### Conclusion:

**Key: E major**  
**Mode: Ionian**

The progression uses common-tone diminished chords to decorate F#m or F# major (ii), then moves to B7 (V), resolving to Emaj7 (I).

The "Gb" is F#, "Bbdim" is A#°, "Dbm" is C#m, "Ab" is G#.

So it's a **progression in E major** with chromatic embellishments.

**Final Answer: Key is E major, mode is Ionian.**
