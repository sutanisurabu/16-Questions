This chord progression:

**Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim**

is **highly chromatic** and doesn’t clearly resolve to a traditional major/minor key center. But we can analyze it systematically to determine the most probable **key and mode**.

---

### Step 1: Identify underlying harmonies

Let’s rewrite each chord in root position (ignoring bass notes for now) and analyze:

| Chord             | Root Position | Notes                     |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Bbdim             | Bb dim        | Bb, Db, F                 |
| Gb/Bb             | Gb dim        | Gb, Bbb (A), Db           |
| Dbm/Ab            | Db minor      | Db, Fb (E), Ab            |
| B/Bb              | B major       | B, D#, F#                 |
| Emaj7/Ab          | E major 7     | E, G#, B, D#              |
| Bbdim (repeated)  | Bb dim        | Bb, Db, F                 |

Note:  
- `Gb/Bb` = Gb diminished triad **with Bb in the bass** → Gb–Bbb–Db → but Bb is the **bass**, not the root.  
  So this is a **Gb dim chord in 2nd inversion** (Db in bass?) — wait, let’s double-check:

Actually:  
Gb dim = Gb – Bbb (A) – Db  
So Gb/Bb means: **Bb in bass**, Gb dim triad above → Bass = Bb, upper notes = Gb, A, Db?  

Wait — that’s **not** a Gb dim triad over Bb. Let’s think of it as a **polychord or altered bass**.

Actually, **Gb/Bb** is best interpreted as a **Bb half-diminished 7th chord without the 5th?** — Let’s look at the notes:

- Gb/Bb = Bass: Bb, Chord: Gb, Bbb, Db → So the full 4-note chord is: **Bb, Gb, Bbb, Db**

That’s: **Bb – Db – Fb (E) – Gb**

Let’s spell that as a 7th chord:  
Bb (root), Db (minor 3rd), Fb (dim 5th), Ab? Wait — we have **Gb**, not Ab.

**Bb, Db, Fb, Gb** =  
- Bb → root  
- Db → m3  
- Fb → dim5 (same as E)  
- Gb → dim7

So this is **Bb half-diminished 7th** → **Bbm7♭5**

Wait — Bbm7♭5 = Bb, Db, Fb, Ab  
But here we have **Gb**, not Ab → So Gb is **double-flatted 7th (which is F)**? No:

Gb is enharmonic to **F#**, not F.

This is getting messy. Let’s reinterpret **Gb/Bb** as a **secondary chord** or **chromatic passing chord**.

Better idea: Look at **Gb/Bb** as a **Bb diminished 7th chord** where the **Gb is the 7th**.

Wait — **Bb dim7** = Bb, Db, Fb, Abb (G) — again, not matching.

Hold on — **Gb/Bb** might simply be a **Gb diminished triad with Bb as an added bass note**, which is **not a standard chord** unless we consider it **an inversion of a different chord**.

Let’s look at the **actual pitches**:

- Gb/Bb → Bass: Bb; Chord: Gb–Bbb–Db  
So the full set: **Bb, Gb, Bbb, Db**

Bbb = A (enharmonic)  
So: **Bb, Db, F (Bbb = A?), Gb** — still messy.

Let’s use **enharmonic spellings** to make sense:

### Enharmonic reinterpretations:

| Chord         | Enharmonic Equivalent | Notes (spelled clearly)     |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Bbdim         | Bb°                    | Bb, Db, F                    |
| Gb/Bb         | **Bb°7**?             | Bb, Db, F, Ab? But written as Gb — Gb = F##? No. Wait, Gb = F#? No — Gb is same as F#?  
→ Wait! Gb = F#? **No**. Gb = G-flat = F#? **Yes, enharmonically**.  
So Gb = F#  
Db = C#  
Bb = Bb (same)  

So **Gb/Bb** = F# / Bb → so chord is F# diminished triad over Bb bass = **F#–A–C** over Bb → notes: **Bb, F#, A, C**

That’s: **Bb, C, F#, A** → which is **C minor 7 with an added #4?** Not quite.

Wait — **Bb, C, F#, A**

This is **Bbadd9#11?** No. Let’s test for a **Bb half-dim7** again:

Bbm7♭5 = Bb, Db, Fb, Ab → that’s **Bb, D, F, A**? No — Fb = E, Ab = Ab  
So: Bb, D, E, Ab — **not** matching Bb, C, F#, A.

Wait — **Bb, C, F#, A**

C = major 2nd (9th)  
F# = #11  
A = major 6th

This is **Bb6/9#11**? Very jazzy, but let's check a different angle.

Another possibility: **Gb/Bb** = **Bb altered chord with #9**? Unlikely.

But here’s a **critical insight**:

Let me look at the **Gb/Bb** and **Dbm/Ab** together.

**Dbm/Ab** = Db minor triad with Ab in bass → notes: Ab, Db, Fb (E), Cbb? No — Ab bass, chord = Db, Fb, Ab → so that’s **Ab, Db, Fb**

That’s **Ab major triad with Db in 5th**? No — Ab (bass), Db (P5), Fb (b7) → wait, this is **Ab7?**

Ab, Db, Fb → **Ab dominant 7th chord**!  
Ab = root  
Db = 5th  
Fb = flat 7th → yes! So **Dbm/Ab = Ab7**

Oh! So **Dbm/Ab** is **Ab7 (dominant 7)** — the Db minor triad is just the 5th and 7th + root? Wait:

Ab7 = Ab, C, Eb, **Gb**
But Dbm triad = Db, Fb, Ab → which is: Db = 5th, Fb = flat 7th, Ab = root → so yes! **Dbm/Ab = Ab7** with 5th and 7th inverted in bass — this is a **common voicing of Ab7**.

So **Dbm/Ab = Ab7**

Similarly, **Gb/Bb** — chords with Gb: Gb, Bbb, Db → as above, Gb = F#, Bbb = A, Db = C#

So notes: **Bb, F#, A, C#**

Wait — that’s **F# half-diminished 7th**? F#–A–C#–E → but we have Bb, not E.

**Bb, F#, A, C#**

Let’s think: What chord has root Bb and these notes?

Bb, C#, F#, A →  
Bb → root  
C# → #9  
F# → #11  
A → 6

This is **Bb7#9#11** — an **altered dominant** chord!

But Bb7 = Bb, D, F, Ab  
Here we have D is **missing**, and instead: C# (b9? No — C# is #9), F# (#11), A (6) → **very altered**.

But wait — **Bb, F#, A, C#** — if we rearrange: **Bb, C#, F#, A**

This is **C# half-dim7** (C#–E–G#–B)? No.

Wait — **Bb, C#, F#, A** → this is **F#m7b5 (half-dim)** with added bass note? No.

Actually: **C#–E–G#–B** is C#m7♭5  
We have **C#, F#, A, Bb** → F# = root? F#, A, C# = F#m triad → then Bb = ♭7?  
C#–E–G#–B = C#m7♭5  
C#–E–G#–Bb = C#7? No — Bb is ♭7 relative to C#? C# to Bb is minor 7th → yes!

So **F#–A–C#–Bb** = **F#7** (dominant 7th)!

F#7 = F#, A#, C#, E — wait, we have **A**, not A# → so it’s **F#7♭9?** But it’s A natural = ♭9

F#7 = F#, A#, C#, E  
We have F#, A, C#, Bb → so: **F# (root), A (♭9), C# (3rd), Bb (♭7)**

This is **F#7♭9**

But the bass is Bb — so it's **F#7♭9/Bb**

Now, **F#7♭9/Bb** → is also **Bb7#9**!

F#7♭9 = F#, A, C#, Bb  
→ Bb = ♭7  
A = ♭9 → which is enharmonic to G# = #9? No — A is minor 9, not #9.

But in **Bb altered**, the notes are: Bb, D, F, Ab, **C# (#9)** and **F# (#11)** or G# (♭9)

Wait — **Bb7#9** = Bb, D, F, Ab, C#  
But we have **Bb, F#, A, C#** — D (3rd) is missing.

So it's **Bb7#9 without the 3rd** — very common in jazz voicings (omit 3rd to avoid dissonance with #9).

So **Gb/Bb** = **F#/Bb** = **F#7♭9** = **Bb7#9** (without 3rd) → **Bb altered dominant**

Similarly, **Bbdim** = Bb, Db, F = Bb dim → this is **Bb°7** if we had Ab, but we don’t — so it’s just a triad.

And **Emaj7/Ab** = E, G#, B, D# over Ab bass → notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#  
That’s five notes — very dense.

Ab bass + E, G#, B, D# →  
Let’s rearrange:  
Possible: **E maj7** = E, G#, B, D#  
Over Ab bass → so it’s **E major 7 over Ab** → could be **Abmaj9#11?** No.

E major 7 over Ab = **Ab, E, G#, B, D#**  
Ab = root  
E = ♭6  
G# = ♭5  
B = ♭3? Ab to B is minor 3rd → yes  
D# = ♭7

Wait: **Ab minor major 9?** Unlikely.

Actually, E major 7 over Ab bass is **Ab6/9#5?** Messy.

Wait — **E major 7 = E, G#, B, D#**

The bass is Ab — so the full chord is: **Ab, E, G#, B, D#**

Now, **Ab** to **G#** = minor 2nd — dissonant.

But enharmonically: **Ab = G#**

So **G#** (bass) + **E, G#, B, D#**

That’s **G# major 7#5?** Wait:

If bass = G#, chord = E, G#, B, D#

E to G# = M3, G# to B = m3, B to D# = M3 → **E major 7?**

Wait — G# = root, then chord = E, G#, B, D#

That’s G#–B–D#–E → E is the 9th? But G#–B = M3, B–D# = M3 → G# augmented triad → D# = #5 → then E = 6th? So chord = **G# aug maj7?** G#, B, D#, E — which is G# aug with major 7th? But E is G# to E = minor 6th, or ♭7 if you think of G# as root → G# to E is ♭7

So: **G#**, **B** (M3), **D#** (#5), **E** (♭7)

This is **G#7#5**! — **G#7 augmented**

Because: G#–B–D#–F## = G#7#5, but we have E instead of F## → E = ♭7, not F##=7

So G#7#5 = G#, B, D#, F##  
We have G#, B, D#, E → F## = G, so E = ♭7

So this is: **G#7♭7?** That’s a contradiction.

Wait — simpler: **E major 7** = E, G#, B, D#  
Over Ab bass = **Ab, E, G#, B, D#**

So **Ab** is root, the upper structure is **E major 7**

This is more likely: **Ab minor 9?** Ab, Cb, Eb, Gb, Bb — nope.

Let’s think differently.

**Emaj7/Ab = Ab + Emaj7**

The notes are: Ab, B, D#, E, G#

That’s 5 notes: Ab, B, D#, E, G#

Let’s list in order: Ab, B, D#, E, G#

Convert to a single chord name:  
Let’s try treating Ab as **root**

Ab → root  
B → #9?  
D# → #11  
E → 6?  
G# → ♭7? (Ab to G# is ♭7)

So: Ab, Cb, Eb, Gb → minor scale  
But we have: Ab, B (#9), D# (#11), E (6), G# (♭7)

This is **Ab7#9#11** with 6th? Not standard.

**Better interpretation: this is a chromatic passing chord** — and we can see the **Gb and Ab** and **Bb** suggest the key center is **Bb**.

But **B/Bb** — that’s B major over Bb bass — so **B major triad over Bb** → notes: Bb, B, D#, F#

That’s **Bb and B** — **minor 2nd** — a **pedal tone (Bb) under B major**, often used in jazz for **tritone substitution**.

B major = tritone substitution of E major — but E major is not in key.

Wait — **B major chord = tritone sub of F#7**, which is the V of Bm.

But here’s a breakthrough: **All these chords orbit around Bb**.

Let’s list the **root movement** ignoring inversions:

Chord roots:  
**Bb – Bb – Gb – Gb – Bb – Bb – Db – B – Bb – Bb – Gb – Gb – Bb – Bb – E – Bb**

So roots:  
Bb (x5), Gb (x4), Db, B, E

Now, **Bb, Gb, Db** = descending tritones?  
Bb → Gb = diminished 5th  
Gb → Db = diminished 5th  
Db → B = tritone  
B → E = P4 — not tritone  
E → Bb = tritone

So the root motion:  
Bb - Gb - Db = **descending perfect 4ths?**  
Bb to Gb = 5 steps down = perfect 5th down = **tritone** up? Wait — distance:

Bb to Gb: Bb, A, Ab, G, Gb → 4 steps down = **perfect 4th down**?  
Bb to Gb = **minor 6th up** (which is tritone) — **Gb is tritone from Bb**

Yes: **Bb to Gb = tritone**  
Gb to Db = **tritone**  
Db to B = **B is enharmonic to Cb**, Db to Cb = **minor 2nd** — no

Db to B: Db to B = 5 semitones? Db to D = 1, D to E = 2, E to F = 3, F to G = 4, G to A = 5, A to B = 6 → so 7 semitones → **perfect 5th**

Wait: Db to B = **perfect 5th**? Db to B:  
Db - Eb - F - Gb - A - B — that’s 6 steps? No

In semitones:  
Db = 10  
B = 11? In chromatic numbering (C=0):  
Db = 1  
B = 10  
So Db to B = 1 to 10 = 9 semitones = **minor 6th** — tritone is 6

Wait — **B = 10**, **Db = 1**, difference = 9 → minor 6th (9 semitones)

But here's the key: **B and F are tritone**, **E and Bb are tritone**

So:

- Bb - Gb = **tritone**  
- Gb - Db = **tritone**  
- Db - B = **minor 6th** → Db to B = Db to Cb = tritone? Cb = B — yes!  
Cb = B → **Db to Cb = tritone**

Yes! Db to Cb = tritone, and **Cb = B**

Then B to E = **perfect 4th** → but E to Bb = **tritone again**

So:  
**Bb – Gb – Db – B – E – Bb**

Which is: **tritone – tritone – tritone – tritone**

It’s a **chromatic cycle of tritones** — 4 tritones in a row.

Specifically:  
Start: Bb  
Then: Gb (tritone down)  
Then: Db (tritone down from Gb)  
Then: B (Cb) = tritone down from Db  
Then: E = tritone up from B?  
Wait: B to E = 5 semitones = perfect 4th — not tritone.

But **E to Bb** is tritone → so it's circular.

The path is:  
**Bb → Gb → Db → B (=Cb) → E → Bb**

Now: B → E = 5 semitones (P4)  
But E → Bb = 6 semitones (tritone)

So movement:  
Bb - Gb: tritone  
Gb - Db: tritone  
Db - B: tritone  
B - E: P4  
E - Bb: tritone

We’re trying to find the tonal center. The chord that appears most is **Bbdim**, and it starts and ends with it.

Also, **Emaj7/Ab** — Ab is the **subdominant** of Bb? Ab is bVI.

Bb major: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab  
So Ab is **bVI** — common in minor keys.

But we have **Bbdim** — if this is the tonic, then Bb is a **diminished tonic** — which belongs to **Bb melodic minor** or harmonic minor.

In **Bb melodic minor**:  
Ascending: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A  
So chords:  
Bb minor = Bb, Db, F — yes **Bbdim** — but Bb minor has F natural? Bb minor = Bb, Db, F — yes — that’s the **tonic minor triad**.

In **Bb melodic minor**, the tonic is **Bb minor** (not Bbdim — that would be Bb, Db, Fb = Bb diminished)

Wait — difference:

- **Bb minor** = Bb, Db, F  
- **Bb diminished** = Bb, Db, **Fb**

So the chords here are **Bbdim** = Bb, Db, Fb — **Fb = E**

That’s **not** Bb minor — it’s **Bb diminished**.

Bb diminished = **H diminished scale** or **Bb half-diminished tonic**?

In Bb **harmonic minor**, the tonic triad is **Bb minor**, **not** diminished.

So **Bbdim** as tonic suggests **Bb Locrian mode**.

Bb Locrian mode:  
Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab  
Chord on Bb: **Bb, Db, Fb** = **Bbdim**

So **Bb Locrian** has tonic Bbdim!

That’s it.

Now test: **Bb Locrian** = Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab

Go through the chords:

- Bbdim = Bb tonic → ✅  
- Gb/Bb = Gb is the ♭5 of Bb → in Locrian, Gb is the **5th degree**  
  Gb = ♭5 of Bb → chord: Gb dim → normally in Locrian, the 5th is major? Wait:

Bb Locrian scale degrees:  
1: Bb  
2: Cb  
3: Db  
4: Eb  
5: Fb  
6: Gb  
7: Ab

Chords:  
i: Bbdim  
ii°: Cb°  
iii: Dbmaj  
iv: Ebm  
v: Fbdim  
**vi**: **Gb major**  
vii: Abmaj

But in our progression, we have **Gb/Bb** — which is **Gb dim**, not Gb major.

In Bb Locrian, the VI chord is **Gb major**, but we have **Gb dim** — so that doesn’t fit.

Wait — perhaps it's **Bb Hawaian** or something else.

Alternative idea: **Bb minor** with altered tones.

Back to the **Emaj7/Ab** chord.

Ab is **bVI** in Bb major.

E major 7 over Ab — ♭6th and 3rd? Much like **E major = tritone substitution of Bb minor?**

Bb minor has root Bb, E major has root E — tritone apart → so **E major** could be **tritone sub of Bb minor**.

In jazz, we often use **tritone substitution** on dominant chords.

So perhaps this progression is **Bb minor** with **tritone substitution** and **modal mixture**.

Let’s assume the key is **Bb minor**

Bb natural minor: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

Chords:  
i: Bb minor = Bb, Db, F  
**But we have Bbdim = Bb, Db, Fb** → which is **Bb half-diminished** if Ab is included, but it’s a triad — so **Bb°**, which is **not** Bb minor.

So Bbdim = Bb, Db, **Fb** → Fb = E — which is **not** in Bb natural minor (F natural).

Fb = E — half step below F — so Bb **harmonic minor**?

Bb harmonic minor: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, **A**

Then tonic = Bb, Db, F = Bb minor, not diminished.

To get **Bb dim**, we need Fb — which is **Bb double harmonic minor** or **Bb phrygian dominant**? Not quite.

Perhaps it’s **Bb Locrian** but with altered scale.

Let’s test Bb Locrian with a raised 7th? No — Locrian has ♭7 = Ab

But we have **B/Bb** = a major chord on B — which is **♯2** in Bb Locrian — very altered.

### Conclusion: Most Likely Key and Mode

This progression is **highly chromatic**, uses many **tritone subs, altered dominants, and diminished chords**, and centers around **Bb**.

The **tonic chord is Bbdim**, and **Bbdim is the tonic chord of Bb Locrian mode**.

Even though the VI chord (Gb) is often major in Locrian, here it’s **Gb dim** — probably due to chromaticism or borrowing.

Also, **Dbm/Ab = Ab7** — which is **V7 of Db** — but Db is ♭5 of Bb — so that’s a **secondary dominant**.

**B/Bb** is a **tritone substitution** for E7 (which would be V of A), where E is tritone from B — so we’re using **B as tritone sub of E7**, implying D as a temporary key — but then **Emaj7/Ab** follows — Ab = ♭6 of Bb.

The final chord is **Emaj7/Ab → Bbdim** — E to Bb is a tritone resolution — dark resolution.

So despite all chromaticism, the **tonal center** is **Bb**, and the **mode** is **Locrian**, due to the **diminished tonic chord**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: Bb**  
> **Mode: Locrian**

**Rationale**:  
- The progression centers on **Bbdim** repeatedly as the tonic chord.  
- Bbdim is the characteristic tonic triad of the **Bb Locrian mode** (Bb–Db–Fb).  
- The other chords (Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab, B/Bb) are chromatic passing, secondary dominants, tritone substitutions, or altered tones — common in jazz and modern harmony — but they orbit and resolve back to **Bb**.  
- The tritone progression (**Bb–Gb–Db–B–E–Bb**) reinforces the instability and diminished quality typical of Locrian.

While the sound is very modern (akin to jazz fusion or film noir), **Bb Locrian** is the theoretical key and mode.
