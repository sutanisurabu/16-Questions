The provided harmony progression is:

$$ \text{Bbdim } \text{Bbdim } \text{Gb/Bb } \text{Gb/Bb } \text{Bbdim } \text{Bbdim } \text{Dbm/Ab } \text{B/Bb } \text{Bbdim } \text{Bbdim } \text{Gb/Bb } \text{Gb/Bb } \text{Bbdim } \text{Bbdim } \text{Emaj7/Ab } \text{Bbdim} $$

### 1. Identify the Primary Tonic and Chord Qualities

The progression is dominated by the **Bb diminished chord (Bbdim):**

*   **Bbdim:** $\text{Bb}$-$\text{Db}$-$\text{Fb}$ (or $\text{Bb}$-$\text{Db}$-$\text{E}$)
*   This chord appears 8 times, acting clearly as the central harmonic area.

The remaining chords are:

*   **Gb/Bb and Gb:** $\text{Bb}$ in the bass, $\text{Gb}$-$\text{Bb}$-$\text{Db}$ in the upper voices. This is an inversion of a standard **Gb Major** chord.
*   **Dbm/Ab:** $\text{Ab}$ in the bass, $\text{Db}$-$\text{Fb}$-$\text{Ab}$ (or $\text{Db}$-$\text{E}$-$\text{Ab}$). This is an inversion of a **Db diminished** chord.
*   **B/Bb:** $\text{Bb}$ in the bass, $\text{B}$-$\text{D\#}$-$\text{F\#}$ in the upper voices. This is an inversion of a standard **B Major** chord.
*   **Emaj7/Ab:** $\text{Ab}$ in the bass, $\text{E}$-$\text{G\#}$-$\text{B}$-$\text{D\#}$.

### 2. Analyze the Scale/Mode Implied

The repeated use of a diminished tonic (Bbdim) strongly suggests a symmetrical scale, most commonly the **Octatonic Scale** (Diminished Scale).

Let's look at the chromatic collection used by the main chords, prioritizing those defining the Bbdim framework:

| Chord | Notes | Contributes to Scale Collection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bbdim** (Tonic) | **Bb**, **Db**, **E (Fb)** | Bb, Db, E |
| **Gb** | **Gb**, Db, Bb | Gb |
| **Dbm/Ab** | **Db**, **E (Fb)**, **Ab** | Ab |
| **B** | **B**, D#, F# | B, D#, F# |
| **Emaj7/Ab** | **E**, **G#**, B, D# | E, G# |

The full set of primary notes used seems to be:

$$ \text{Bb}, \text{B}, \text{Db}, \text{D\# (Eb)}, \text{E (Fb)}, \text{F\#}, \text{G\# (Ab)}, \text{ (no G or F natural)} $$

If we focus on the notes from the diminished tonic ($\text{Bb}$, $\text{Db}$, $\text{E}$) and the notes from its related, fully diminished seventh chords, we expect an octatonic scale.

There are two main forms of the octatonic scale:

1.  **Half-Whole (HW):** $\text{R} - \text{H} - \text{W} - \text{H} - \text{W} - \text{H} - \text{W} - \text{H}$
2.  **Whole-Half (WH):** $\text{R} - \text{W} - \text{H} - \text{W} - \text{H} - \text{W} - \text{H} - \text{W}$

**Candidate: Bb Whole-Half Octatonic (WH)**
*   $\text{Bb}, \text{C}, \text{Db}, \text{Eb}, \text{E}, \text{F\#}, \text{G}, \text{Ab}$
*   This scale contains: Bb, Db, E (from Bbdim), Db, Ab (from Dbm/Ab), and Gb (if C is used as a passing tone).

**Candidate: Bb Half-Whole Octatonic (HW)**
*   $\text{Bb}, \text{Cb} (\text{B}), \text{Db}, \text{E} (\text{Fb}), \text{E}, \text{F\#}, \text{G}, \text{A}$
*   This scale contains: Bb, B, Db, E, F#, G# (If A is used as Ab), and Gb.

The chords Gb major and B major are the most foreign to a simple diminished structure. However, they share notes with the scale:
*   $\text{Gb}$ Major: $\text{Gb}, \text{Bb}, \text{Db}$. These fit within the Bb diminished harmony ($\text{Gb}$ is the upper neighbor to $\text{F}$).
*   $\text{B}$ Major: $\text{B}, \text{D\#}, \text{F\#}$. The notes $\text{B}$ and $\text{F\#}$ are often used in the $\text{Bb}$ Half-Whole scale. $\text{D\#}$ is equivalent to $\text{Eb}$.

### 3. Conclusion on Key and Mode

The harmonic movement is centered entirely around the **Bb diminished chord**, and the auxiliary chords (Gb, Dbm/Ab, B) can be interpreted as standard chromatic substitutions or neighbors often found in symmetrical harmony.

The presence of the diminished tonic dictates the use of a symmetrical scale. The most stylistically appropriate mode for a tonal center of **Bbdim** is the **Octatonic Scale**.

Given the prominence of both $\text{Gb}$ (which works well with the $\text{Bb}$ WH scale) and $\text{B}$ (which works well with the $\text{Bb}$ HW scale), the harmonic motion is best described as highly chromatic, but anchored to $\text{Bb}$.

The presence of $\text{Bbdim}$, $\text{Gb}$ Major, and $\text{Gb/Bb}$ suggests these chords are functioning as $I^{\circ}$, $vI$, and $vI/I$. In classical chromatic harmony, a diminished tonic often implies a key where that diminished chord is a leading-tone chord (e.g., $vii^{\circ}$ of C minor), but here it functions definitively as the tonic.

**Key:** **Bb** (Tonal Center on Bb Diminished)
**Mode:** **Octatonic Scale** (Diminished Scale), utilizing the ambiguity between the Whole-Half and Half-Whole starting patterns to accommodate the chromatic chords.

**Final Answer:**

**Key:** **Bb** (functioning as the Tonal Center)
**Mode:** **Octatonic Scale (Diminished Scale)**
