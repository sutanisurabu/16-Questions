### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I need to figure out the key and mode from the provided chord sequence. It looks like it's based around diminished chords and possibly a chromatic bass line. The first step is to break down the chords: starting with Bbdim, which has the notes Bb, Db, and Fb. I have to be careful about my terminology since E might be used instead of Fb. So, I need to clarify my understanding of this diminished triad.**Clarifying chord symbols**

I’m sorting out chord symbols and their meanings. Bbdim, or Bb°, usually represents a diminished triad, while Bbdim7 would be a fully diminished seventh chord. The set of notes for Bbdim is {Bb, Db, E/Fb}. For Gb/Bb, it's a Gb major chord with Bb as the bass note—notes here include Bb, Db, and Gb. Then there's Dbm/Ab, which is a D-flat minor chord with Ab in the bass, fitting the second inversion nicely. Lastly, B/Bb indicates a B major triad over Bb bass.**Exploring chord sequences**

Strange, but I’m analyzing the chord Emaj7/Ab, which consists of E major 7 over Ab bass. I'm trying to detect the overall key here, and I notice there's a repeated movement in the bass, often staying on Bb. The chord sequence suggests a pedal tone on Bb, with segments that consist of Bbdim and Gb/Bb. This leads me to think there might be a connection to a song, but I'm unsure if it relates to "Eleanor Rigby" or what key would include Gb major and Bbdim. I’m considering scale degrees in the key of Gb major.**Examining key possibilities**

In the key of Gb major, the scale goes Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F. Looking at diminished triads, I realize that Fdim is actually the leading-tone diminished triad, not Bbdim, which should be based on the third scale degree in Gb major. This makes me consider Bbdim could relate to the seventh degree. I then think about B major, where I spot B/Bb and wonder if it fits better in Bb minor. In Bb minor, the scale degrees are Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. It's exciting to explore these connections!**Determining the key**

In Bb natural minor, I analyze the scale with its five flats: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, and Ab. Diminished triads can appear on the second degree and the leading tone using harmonic minor. I consider Bbdim and its relation to Bb minor but find it more intriguing to fit these chords within the key of E major. Here, I identify key relationships and how A#dim serves as a leading-tone chord, enhancing the structure, implying a progression related to E major or its C# minor relative. I explore various chords and analyze their functions, concluding that E major feels like the center.**Identifying the tonal center**

I realize that our progression lacks a cadential E root position; instead, it ends on Bbdim. Analyzing this, I find the tonal center likely points toward B major, given the presence of secondary leading-tones and the pedal A#. I rewrite the chords enharmonically to clarify their roles: for example, Bbdim is A#dim, and Emaj7 can be IVmaj7 in B major. Despite potential misinterpretations of modes and functions, the chords consistently align with B major. All harmonies connect, suggesting B major is the clearer tonal center.**Clarifying the tonal structure**

The key is B major, featuring a long A# (or Bb) pedal in the bass. The chords are mainly diatonic, including A#° (vii°), F#/A# (V6), C#m/G# (ii6/4), B/A# (I over leading tone), and Emaj7/G# (IVmaj7/3), all confirming the Ionian mode. 

For clarity, I can list both the original chord names and their enharmonics: Bbdim is A#°, Gb/Bb is F#/A#, and so on. While G# minor is the relative minor, the consistency of B major makes it the simplest explanation. So the final answer is B major, Ionian mode.

B major (Ionian).

Why:
- Enharmonic spellings make the chords diatonic to B major:
  - Bbdim = A#° (vii°)
  - Gb/Bb = F#/A# (V in first inversion)
  - Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# (ii in second inversion)
  - B/Bb = B/A# (I over leading-tone pedal)
  - Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# (IVmaj7 over 3)
All functions fit cleanly in B major, pointing to Ionian mode.
