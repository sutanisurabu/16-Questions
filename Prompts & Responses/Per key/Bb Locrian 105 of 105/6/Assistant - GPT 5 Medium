### Reasoning

**Exploring chord functions**

I’m considering Bbdim, which could be vii° in Cb major or #vi°. Another possibility is it functioning as ii° in Ab minor. In the scale of Ab minor, the ii° triad is Bb diminished. Yep! It fits as iiº in Ab natural minor, which is exciting. I see that many chords use Ab as a pedal in the bass, like Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, suggesting that the tonal center being Ab makes sense with those chords. It's a bit complex, but intriguing!**Analyzing chord functions**

I'm looking at Gb/Bb over a Bb bass in the context of Ab minor. So, Bb is the 2nd scale degree, or supertonic. The Gb major chord (Gb-Bb-Db) acts as the VI chord. In Ab natural minor, the structure shows Gb as the VII chord instead. The Bbdim functions as the ii° chord. With Dbm/Ab as the iv chord in second inversion, it all seems to fit nicely within Ab minor. It’s a bit of a puzzle, but I feel like I’m sorting it out!**Examining Emaj7/Ab**

I’m exploring Emaj7 over an Ab bass. E major is enharmonically similar to Fb major, and the Emaj7 chord has the notes E-G#-B-D#. When I apply enharmonic mapping, it translates to Fb-A♭-Cb-E♭. In the context of Ab minor, I should use Fb instead of E and Gb instead of F#. So Emaj7 is equivalent to Fbmaj7. The Fb major 7 chord acts as the VI chord in Ab minor, which implies that it's diatonic. It’s getting a bit intricate, but I'm piecing it together!**Analyzing diatonic chords**

I’m thinking about the VI chord Fb-Ab-Cb, and it indeed includes the major seventh, which is Eb, making Fbmaj7 diatonic in Ab natural minor. They opt for Emaj7 instead of Fbmaj7 for practicality, and it aligns nicely over the Ab bass. Then, there's B/Bb, where B major (enharmonic to Cb major) plays over Bb bass. It looks like this sequence fits within the Ab natural minor (Aeolian) with various inversions and enharmonic spellings. The frequent presence of Bbdim suggests it’s functioning as the supertonic half-diminished chord.**Confirming the tonal center**

I'm confirming the chord pitch sets to determine the key. For example, Bbdim (Bb Db E/Fb) is diatonic in Ab minor since these notes match scale degrees 2, 4, and b6. Similarly, Gb/Bb and Dbm/Ab are diatonically valid. The B/Bb chord is enharmonically Cb major, which fits as III over Bb. Emaj7 connects back to Fbmaj7, also fitting as VImaj7. Overall, this progression aligns with Ab natural minor in Aeolian mode. While G# minor could also be considered, the spells point to Ab minor. I’ll summarize these findings clearly, including enharmonic respellings!

Key: A-flat minor
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)

Why:
- All chords fit A♭ natural minor (Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb).
- Bbdim = ii° (Bb–Db–Fb)
- Gb/Bb = VII6 (Gb–Bb–Db over Bb)
- Dbm/Ab = iv6/4 (Db–Fb–Ab over Ab)
- B/Bb = enharmonic to Cb/Bb = III over Bb
- Emaj7/Ab = enharmonic to Fbmaj7/Ab = VImaj7 over Ab

No raised leading tone appears, so it’s Aeolian rather than harmonic/melodic minor.
