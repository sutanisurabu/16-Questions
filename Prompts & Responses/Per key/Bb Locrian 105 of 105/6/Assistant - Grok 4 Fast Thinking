**Key:** Ab minor

This progression uses only diatonic notes and chords from the Ab minor (Aeolian) scale (Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb). Key examples:  
- Bbdim functions as iiÂ° (Bbdim).  
- Gb/Bb functions as VII (Gbmaj, inverted).  
- Dbm/Ab functions as iv (Dbm, inverted).  
- B/Bb functions as III (Cbmaj, inverted; B enharmonic Cb, etc.).
