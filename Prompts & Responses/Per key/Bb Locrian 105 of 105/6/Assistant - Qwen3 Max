To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

```
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb –  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim
```

Let’s analyze step by step.

---

### 1. **Understand the chords and their functions**

- **Bbdim**: B♭–D♭–E (since a diminished triad is root–♭3–♭5; B♭dim = B♭–D♭–E)
- **Gb/Bb**: G♭ major chord (G♭–B♭–D♭) with B♭ in the bass → essentially a **first inversion G♭ major**: G♭/B♭
- **Dbm/Ab**: D♭ minor (D♭–E–A♭) over A♭ bass → this is a **D♭ minor in second inversion** (since A♭ is the 5th of D♭m)
- **B/Bb**: B major chord (B–D♯–F♯) over B♭ bass — this is a **very chromatic/polychordal** sound; possibly a B/B♭ = B major over B♭ bass, which creates a strong dissonance
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7 (E–G♯–B–D♯) over A♭ bass — again, very chromatic

These last two chords (B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab) are **highly altered** and do **not** belong to any standard diatonic key.

However, notice that **most chords center around B♭, G♭, D♭, and A♭**, which are all notes in the key of **D♭ major** (or its relative B♭ minor).

Key of **D♭ major**: D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C

Relative minor: **B♭ minor** (natural minor): B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭

So **B♭dim**, **G♭ major**, **D♭ minor**, and **A♭** are all diatonic to **B♭ natural minor** (Aeolian mode).

- B♭dim = chord vii° in C♭ major, but more relevantly, it’s the **ii° chord in A♭ major**, or **vii° in C♭** — but in **B♭ minor**, B♭ is the **tonic**, so B♭dim isn’t diatonic to B♭ minor.

Wait: in **B♭ natural minor**, the triads are:
- i: B♭m
- ii°: C°
- III: D♭
- iv: E♭m
- v: Fm
- VI: G♭
- VII: A♭

So **B♭dim is NOT a diatonic chord in B♭ minor**.

But **G♭ major** is the **VI chord** in B♭ minor.

**D♭ minor** is not in B♭ natural minor either — D♭ is the **III (major)** in B♭ minor, not minor.

So Dbm is **not diatonic** to B♭ minor.

However, if we consider **B♭ harmonic minor**:
- B♭ harmonic minor: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A (natural 7th raised)

Chords:
- i: B♭m
- ii°: C°
- III+: D♭ augmented
- iv: E♭m
- V: F major (or F7)
- VI: G♭ major
- vii°: A°

Still no **B♭dim** as a tonic.

So perhaps **B♭ is not the tonic**.

---

### 2. **Look at Bbdim as a passing or dominant-function chord**

Diminished chords often **function as leading-tone chords** or **dominant substitutes**.

- **B♭dim** = B♭–D♭–E
- Enharmonically, E = F♭, so this is also **F♭dim**, but more usefully: **B♭dim = D♭dim = Edim = Gdim** (fully diminished = 4 symmetrical roots)

So **B♭dim = Edim = Gdim = D♭dim** — all same chord.

This symmetry means it can resolve to **C, E♭, G♭, or A** (each a half-step above a chord tone).

So B♭dim can resolve to **C, E♭, G♭, or A**.

In the progression, we see **Gb/Bb** next — which is **G♭ major**, and **G♭ is one of the possible resolutions** of B♭dim (since E → F♭ = E → G♭ enharmonically? Wait, not quite).

Let’s spell B♭dim: B♭–D♭–E  
- B♭ → resolves to A or B  
- D♭ → resolves to C or D  
- E → resolves to F or E♭

But **E → F** is strong. So **B♭dim → C** is classic (vii° → I in C minor/major).

But here it goes to **G♭/B♭** — G♭ major.

G♭ major = G♭–B♭–D♭

Notice: **B♭ and D♭ are in both chords**.

So the **B♭dim** shares **B♭ and D♭** with **G♭ major**, and **E** is a chromatic neighbor to D♭? Not quite.

Alternatively, maybe **G♭ is the tonic**.

Key of **G♭ major**: G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F

Chords:
- I: G♭
- ii: A♭m
- iii: B♭m
- IV: C♭
- V: D♭
- vi: E♭m
- vii°: F°

**B♭dim is not in G♭ major** — but **F° is**.

Again, B♭dim = F°? Let's check:

F° = F–A♭–C♭  
B♭dim = B♭–D♭–E

Not the same. So no.

But enharmonically, E = F♭, and C♭ = B, so not matching.

So maybe **not G♭ major**.

---

### 3. **Consider the bass line and voice leading**

Bass notes (from slash chords or root positions):

- B♭ (Bbdim)
- B♭ (Bbdim)
- B♭ (Gb/Bb)
- B♭ (Gb/Bb)
- B♭
- B♭
- A♭ (Dbm/Ab)
- B♭ (B/Bb)
- B♭
- B♭
- B♭
- B♭
- B♭
- B♭
- A♭ (Emaj7/Ab)
- B♭

So **bass is almost always B♭**, except two chords: **Dbm/Ab** and **Emaj7/Ab**, which use **A♭ in the bass**.

This strongly suggests **B♭ is the tonal center** — the pedal tone.

So even if the chords are chromatic, **B♭ is the home bass**.

Thus, likely in a **B♭ key**, but which mode?

Now consider **B♭ as tonic**, and chords are **upper structure harmonies** over a B♭ pedal.

Let’s interpret the chords as **B♭ with added notes**:

- **Gb/Bb** = B♭ in bass, G♭ major = notes G♭, B♭, D♭ → over B♭, this is **B♭(♭6, ♭3)** → essentially **B♭ minor with added ♭6** — this is characteristic of **B♭ Dorian** or **B♭ Aeolian**, but ♭6 appears in both.

- **Dbm/Ab** over B♭? Wait, bass is **Ab**, not B♭ — so not over B♭.

But **Dbm/Ab** = A♭ bass, D♭ minor chord → A♭–D♭–E

Over B♭, this would be dissonant — but it only appears briefly.

- **B/Bb** = B major (B–D♯–F♯) over B♭ → very dissonant. This is likely a **chromatic passing chord**, maybe a **tritone substitution** or **altered dominant**.

- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G♯–B–D♯ over A♭

Again, A♭ bass, so two chords shift to A♭ bass — possibly a **modal interchange** or **secondary motion**.

But the return to B♭dim after each suggests **B♭ is the center**.

---

### 4. **Look at Bbdim as B°7 without root**

Wait — B♭dim triad is part of **B°7**, **D°7**, **F°7**, **A♭°7** — all same notes.

In **B♭ minor (harmonic)**, the **vii°7** is **A°7**, which is A–C–E♭–G♭

But **B♭dim** (B♭–D♭–E) = notes of **E°7** (E–G–B♭–D♭)

So **E°7** is the **vii°7 of F minor**.

But again, our bass is B♭.

Alternatively, **B♭dim = D♭m6 without root?**

Dbm6 = D♭–E–A♭–B♭ → contains B♭dim (B♭–D♭–E)

So maybe the harmony is implying **D♭ minor**, but with B♭ pedal.

This is getting complex.

---

### 5. **Consider jazz/pop modal context**

In jazz, a repeated **diminished chord on tonic** often implies **locrian mode** or **altered scales**, but B♭ locrian would be B♭–C♭–D♭–E♭–F♭–G♭–A♭ — not matching.

But another idea: **this progression may be in B♭ Dorian ♭2** (a.k.a. **Phrygian ♯6**) or **B♭ harmonic minor** with upper structures.

But the persistent use of **G♭ major** (VI) and **D♭ minor** (but D♭ minor is not in B♭ minor) — unless it's **D♭ major**, which is III in B♭ minor.

Wait — **Dbm** is likely a **typo or misanalysis**. Could it be **Db major**?

Because **Db major / Ab** = Ab in bass, Db chord = that’s the **V/III** or just III in B♭ minor.

But you wrote **Dbm/Ab** — D♭ minor.

If it were **Db/Ab**, that would make more sense in B♭ minor.

Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab** is very odd — E major is **not related** to B♭ unless it’s **V of A**, but A is not in key.

However, **Emaj7** contains G♯, which is **leading tone to A♭** — and A♭ is the bass.

So **Emaj7/Ab** = **V7/♭II**? Since A♭ is ♭7 in B♭, so E is V of A♭? Wait: V of A♭ is E♭, not E.

E is V of A, not A♭.

Unless it's **tritone substitution**: D7 substitutes for Ab7, but E is not related.

Alternatively, **Emaj7 = F♭maj7**, which could be **♭II maj7** in E major — not helpful.

But notice: **Emaj7/Ab = Ab bass + E major = notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#**

That’s a **very dense polychord**: Ab in bass, E major on top — this is used in jazz as a **lydian augmented** or **altered dominant** sound.

But perhaps it’s better understood as **A♭7♭9♭13** or similar?

Let’s test: A♭7 = A♭–C–E♭–G♭  
But we have **E (F♭), G♯ (A♭ enharmonic?), B, D♯**

G♯ = A♭ — so that’s the root in bass.

E = F♭ = ♭13 of A♭7?  
B = C♭ = ♭9  
D♯ = E♭ = 7th

So **Emaj7/Ab = A♭7♭9♭13** (missing the 3rd C)

So it’s an **altered A♭7**, functioning as **V7/III**? Since III = D♭, V of D♭ is A♭7.

Ah! That fits.

So **A♭7 (altered)** → leads to **D♭** — and we have **Dbm/Ab** before it? Wait, order is:

... Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – ... – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

So **Dbm/Ab** then later **Emaj7/Ab**.

Maybe **Dbm/Ab** is actually **D♭ major / A♭**, and **Emaj7/Ab** is **A♭7alt** preceding a return to tonic?

But it goes back to **Bbdim**, not D♭.

So perhaps this is **not functional harmony**, but **modal interchange over B♭ pedal**, with chromatic upper structures.

---

### 6. **Most plausible interpretation**

Given:
- Bass is almost always **B♭**
- Chords are **complex, chromatic, but centered on B♭**
- **Gb major** is used frequently — that’s **♭VI in B♭ minor**
- **B♭dim** is used as a static chord — could imply **B♭ as root of diminished**, which occurs in **B♭ half-diminished** context, but not standard.

However, in **B♭ minor (Aeolian)**, the **♭VI (G♭)** and **♭VII (A♭)** are common.

We see **A♭ in bass** twice — possibly implying **♭VII**.

And **B♭dim** could be a **color chord** over B♭, using notes from **B♭ diminished scale** (i.e., **B♭ half-whole diminished scale**): B♭, B, D♭, D, E, F, G, A

That scale contains:
- B♭dim (B♭–D♭–E)
- G♭ major? G♭ = F♯ — not in half-whole diminished starting on B♭.

B♭ half-whole: B♭, B, D♭, D, E, F, G, A

G♭ = F♯ — not present.

But **whole-half diminished** starting on B♭: B♭, C, D, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, A

This contains **G♭ and A♭**!

So **B♭ whole-half diminished scale** = octatonic scale starting with whole step.

It includes:
- B♭, C, D, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, A

Chords:
- B♭dim (B♭–D–F) — but our Bbdim is B♭–D♭–E — that’s **B♭ half-whole**: B♭–D♭–E–G♭

Yes! **B♭ half-whole diminished** = B♭, C♭, D♭, D, E, F, G, A♭

Enharmonically: B♭, A, D♭, D, E, F, G, A♭

This scale contains:
- B♭, D♭, E → Bbdim
- G♭ = F♯ — not in this scale

Hmm.

Actually, **fully diminished chords imply the diminished scale**, but the presence of **G♭ major** (which has G♭, B♭, D♭) — G♭ and D♭ are in **B♭ harmonic minor**.

Let’s try **B♭ harmonic major**:
- B♭ harmonic major = B♭, C, D, E♭, F, G♭, A

This has:
- G♭ (♭6)
- A (major 7)
- D (major 3)

So **G♭ major** is diatonic (♭VI)
**D♭ major** is not — D♭ = ♭5, not in scale.

But **D♭ minor** = D♭–E–A♭ → E is not in B♭ harmonic major (has E♭)

So still not matching.

---

### 7. **Conclusion**

Given the persistent **B♭ pedal**, the use of **G♭ major (♭VI)**, **A♭ bass (♭VII)**, and chromatic altered chords, this progression is best understood as being in:

> **B♭ minor (Aeolian mode)**, with extensive chromaticism and modal interchange.

The **Bbdim** is used as a **color chord** or **passing harmony**, not as a functional diatonic chord. The **Gb/Bb** reinforces the **♭VI** chord over tonic bass (a common rock/pop technique, e.g., “B♭ – G♭/B♭” vamp). The **Dbm/Ab** and **Emaj7/Ab** are **chromatic mediant** or **tritone substitution** devices, borrowing from other keys for tension.

Thus:

- **Key**: B♭ minor  
- **Mode**: Aeolian (natural minor), with chromatic alterations

Alternatively, if the tonal center feels unresolved and unstable due to diminished chords, it might be in the **B♭ diminished scale** (half-whole), but the clear use of **G♭ major** (diatonic to B♭ minor) supports **B♭ minor** as the key.

✅ **Final answer**:  
**Key: B♭ minor  
Mode: Aeolian (natural minor), with chromatic alterations**.
