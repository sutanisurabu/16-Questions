Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

First, let's clarify the chords by interpreting them and their bass notes.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Chords

#### 1. **Bbdim (A#dim)**
- Diminished triad: Bb – Db – E (or Fb)
- Often used as a leading tone chord or passing chord
- Symmetrical (every note is a minor third apart)

#### 2. **Gb/Bb**
- Gb major triad over Bb bass
- Gb = Gb – Bb – Db
- With Bb in the bass: Bb – Db – Gb → this is actually **Bb minor 7th (Bbm7)** *without the 5th* (F is missing), but Bb – Db – Gb is Bb min7 (Bbm7)
- So **Gb/Bb ≅ Bbm7** (in first inversion: Bb as bass)

Wait — let's double check:
- Gb major chord: Gb, Bb, Db
- Bass note: Bb
→ So the chord is: **Bb, Gb, Bb, Db** → So this is **Bbm7** with Bb in the bass = **1st inversion of Bbm7**

So: **Gb/Bb ≡ Bbm7/Bb** → but Bbm7 in root position is Bb–Db–F–Ab. But Gb is same as **F#**, which is **not** in Bbm7.

Wait — **Gb vs F#**: Gb ≡ F# enharmonically, but are they the same in chord quality?

**Gb major** = Gb – Bb – Db  
Compare to **Bbm7** = Bb – Db – F – Ab

Does Gb/Bb contain only Bbm7 notes? No:
- Gb/Bb = Bb, Gb, Bb, Db → notes: Bb, Db, Gb (same as **F#**)

But Bbm7 has **F**, not **F#** (or Gb). So this is **not** Bbm7.

Wait — **F# ≠ F** — that’s a big difference!

So:
- **Gb major chord**: Gb – Bb – Db
- With bass note **Bb** → chord tones: Bb, Gb, Db
- So the actual chord is **Bb–Db–Gb** — is this a known chord?

Let’s see: Bb to Db = minor 3rd, Db to Gb = perfect 4th, so Bb–Db–Gb = minor triad with sharp 11? Or is this a known chord?

Wait — **Db up to Gb** is a **perfect 5th**, so:

- Bb – Db – Gb
- Intervals from Bb: minor 3rd (Db), and **augmented 5th** (Gb = A5 above Bb)
  - Because Bb to G is major 5th, Gb is half-step lower → Bb to Gb is diminished 5th? Wait no:
  - Bb to G = major 6th
  - Bb to Gb = augmented 5th?
    - Bb to F is P5
    - Bb to Gb is **diminished 5th (tritone)** → yes!

Bb → F is perfect 5th (7 semitones)  
Bb → Gb is 6 semitones → **diminished 5th**

So:
- Bb – Db (m3), Db – Gb (P4), but harmonic function:
- Bb, Db, Gb → **Bb diminished triad?**
But Bb dim = Bb, Db, F (not Gb)

Wait — Bb dim = Bb–Db–E (Fb) ≈ G → no.

This is confusing. Let's list pitch classes:

Assume **enharmonic equivalence**.

**Gb = F#**

So Gb major chord = **F#–A#–C#**
Bass note = Bb (which is A#)

So **Gb/Bb** = **F#–A#–C#** over **A#** bass
→ So pitches: A#, F#, A#, C#

So the chord is: **A#–C#–F#** → which is A# dim triad?
- A#–C# = minor third
- C#–F# = perfect fourth
- A#–F# = diminished fifth → 6 semitones

So A#, C#, F# → that's **A# diminished triad** (same as Bbdim)

But wait — Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb = Bb–Eb–Abb → enharmonically:
- Bb = A#
- Db = C#
- Fb = E (not F#)

So Fb = E, but here we have F# — different

So:
- Bbdim: Bb – Db – Fb → A# – C# – E
- Gb/Bb: A# – C# – F#

So they differ in the top note: E vs F#

Therefore:
- **Bbdim = A#–C#–E**
- **Gb/Bb = A#–C#–F#**

So **Gb/Bb is not Bbdim** — it contains **F#**, not **E**

So Gb/Bb = **A# dim**? No — A# dim would be A#–C#–E → again, E, not F#

**Wait — F# is not in A#dim**

So what is A#–C#–F#?

- A# to C# = m3
- C# to F# = P4
- A# to F# = **diminished 5th**

So this is a **diminished triad?** No — diminished triad has **two** minor thirds.

A#–C#–E → m3 + m3 → dim5

But A#–C#–F# → m3 + P4 → not a standard triad

Wait — **C# to F# = perfect 4th** = 5 semitones → so not symmetric

But let's consider: **F# = Gb**, so C# to Gb = **diminished 4th**, which is enharmonic to M3, but in function?

Perhaps better to reinterpret **enharmonically in a key**

Let’s try to write all chords with **enharmonic spellings** to see a key.

Let’s use **A# instead of Bb**, and **G instead of Gb?** Not helpful.

Let’s consider the **bass notes**:

Bass line:
- Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb
- Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb

So mostly **Bb** in bass, then **Ab**, then Bb.

Now chords:

### Reinterpret chords enharmonically:

#### Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb ≡ A#–C#–E

This is **fully diminished triad**, so it is symmetrical every minor third.

It can function as vii°7 in C minor, or in C major, or act as a passing chord.

Now **Gb/Bb**:
- Gb = F#, Bb = A# → same pitch class?
Bb = A#? Yes (enharmonically)

So:
- Gb/Bb = Gb (F#) – Bb (A#) – Db (C#), with Bb (A#) in bass
→ pitches: A#, F#, A#, C# → so **A#, C#, F#**

Now: A# to C# = minor 3rd, C# to F# = perfect 4th (5 semitones) — not a triad.

Wait — is this **E major in third inversion?**
E major = E–G#–B
No.

Alternatively: **C# dim?** C#–E–G → no F#

Wait — **F#–A#–C#** is **F# diminished triad**

Ah! Here it is:

- Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db → **but that’s not a real chord** because Gb–Bb is augmented 2nd? No.

Gb to Bb is a **major third** — yes, so Gb major is valid: Gb–Bb–Db

But **Bb = A#**, Db = C#

So Gb major = **Gb–A#–C#**

With **Bb (A#)** in bass → A#–Gb–C# → which spells **A#, C#, F#** (since Gb = F#)

So pitches: **A#, C#, F#**

Now, **F#–A#–C#** = **F# diminished triad** (F#–A–C#) → but A ≠ A#

**F# min** = F#–A#–C#

Wait — yes! **F#–A#–C#** = **F# minor triad**

Because:
- F#–A# = major 3rd (4 semitones)
- A#–C# = minor 3rd (3 semitones)
- F#–C# = perfect fifth (7 semitones)

So Gb/Bb = **Gb major over Bb bass**

But Gb = F#, Bb = A#, Db = C#

So chord: F#–A#–C# → **F# minor triad**, with A# (Bb) in bass

So **F#m/A#** → which is **first inversion of F# minor**

But we wrote it as Gb/Bb — so enharmonically, this is **F#m/A#**

So **Gb/Bb = F# minor with A# in bass**

Similarly, **Dbm/Ab**:
- Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab (or Db–E–Ab enharmonically? No, Fb = E, but in minor chord it should be Eb)

Wait — **Db minor** = Db–**Eb**–Ab

**Fb = E**, not Eb

Eb is 3 semitones above Db, Fb is 4 semitones → so Fb is major third.

So Db minor is **Db–Eb–Ab**

Eb = D#

Ab = G#

So Dbm = Db–Eb–Ab = C#–D#–G#

With **Ab (G#)** in bass → so G#–C#–D#–G#

So pitches: G#, C#, D#

G#–C# = augmented 4th (tritone), C#–D# = major 2nd

G#–B# would be major 3rd for G# major, but here B# is C

So G#–C# = diminished 5th

G#–D# = minor 6th

Not a major or minor triad on G#

But **C#–D#–G#** = C#–D#–G#

C#–D# = M2, D#–G# = P4

But is this a triad? Try: **C# minor** = C#–E–G#

But here we have D# instead of E (D#=3, E=4)

So not.

Alternatively: **G# dim** = G#–B–D → not matching

Wait — **Dbm = Db–Eb–Ab** → notes: Db, Eb, Ab

Bass: Ab

So chord is: Ab–Db–Eb → in bass: Ab

So interval from Ab: up to Db = P4, up to Eb = P5

So Ab–Db–Eb = **Ab suspended 4th chord with added 5** → **Ab sus4**

But Ab–Db–Eb is actually **Ab 9sus4 no 5?** or just **Ab4**

But Ab–Db = perfect 4th, Db–Eb = major 2nd

Alternatively, **second inversion of Gb major?**
Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db
First inversion: Bb–Db–Gb
Second inversion: Db–Gb–Bb

But here we have Ab–Db–Eb

Eb ≠ Gb or Bb

No.

But let's keep enharmonically:

- Dbm = C# minor = C#–E–G#
- Ab = G#

So **C#m/G#** = G#–C#–E–G#

So pitches: G#, C#, E

G#–C# = diminished 5th, C#–E = minor 3rd, G#–E = minor 6th

But C# minor is C#–E–G# — that’s it!

So **C# minor in second inversion** → G# in bass

So **Dbm/Ab = C#m/G#**

Yes.

Now the next one: **B/Bb**

- B major chord over Bb bass
- B major = B–D#–F#
- Bass = Bb (A#)

So pitches: A#, B, D#, F#

So **Bb and B together — minor second clash**

This is a **polychord** or **passing chord**

B major over Bb — very chromatic.

Finally, **Emaj7/Ab**
- E major 7th chord: E–G#–B–D#
- Over Ab bass

Ab = G#

So bass = G#

Chord: E–G#–B–D# → so combined: G#, E, G#, B, D#

So pitch classes: G#, B, D#, E

E–G#–B–D# = **E maj7**

But bass is G# → so **E major 7th over G#**

G# is the **third** of E major → so this is **first inversion of Emaj7**

So **Emaj7/G#**

Now, let’s rewrite the entire progression using **enharmonic equivalents** for clarity.

---

### Full Progression with Enharmonic Spellings

Let’s go step by step:

| Written        | Enharmonic Equivalent      | Notes (pitch classes)               | Likely Interpretation              |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Bbdim         | A#dim                      | A#, C#, E                            | A#dim (standard dim triad)         |
| Gb/Bb         | F#m/A#                     | A#, C#, F#                           | F# minor, first inv.               |
| Dbm/Ab        | C#m/G#                     | G#, C#, E                            | C# minor, second inv.              |
| B/Bb          | B/A#                       | A#, B, D#, F#                        | Major chord a half-step above bass |
| Emaj7/Ab      | Emaj7/G#                   | G#, B, D#, E                         | Emaj7 in first inversion           |

Now, note:
- A# = Bb
- C# = Db
- E = Fb
- F# = Gb
- G# = Ab
- B = B
- D# = Eb

So let’s try to find a key.

List of chords (simplified by function):

- A#dim (Bbdim) — appears often
- F#m/A# — so F# minor chord
- C#m/G# — C# minor
- B/A# — B major over A#
- Emaj7/G# — E major 7th

Now notice:
- F#m, C#m, Emaj7 — these are chords in the **A major** scale?

A major: A–B–C#–D–E–F#–G#

Chords:
- F#m = vi
- C#m = iii
- E = V
- Emaj7 = V7

But we have **A#dim** — A# is not in A major (A is in, but A# is not)

A# is a half-step above A.

Alternatively, **Bb dim** — Bb is not in A major.

But Bb dim = A# dim = **vii° of B major**

Let’s try **B major**:

B major: B–C#–D#–E–F#–G#–A#

Yes! All accidentals match.

B major key signature: 5 sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#)

Now let’s see:

- **Bbdim** = A#dim → **A#–C#–E** → this is **vii° of B major** → **leading tone diminished chord**
- **Gb/Bb** = F#m/A# → A# is the leading tone, F#m is **vi chord** in B major
  - F# minor is **vi** in B major
  - A# is the third of F#m → so F#m/A# = first inversion of vi chord
- **Dbm/Ab** = C#m/G# → C# minor is **ii chord** in B major
  - G# is fifth of C#m → so C#m/G# = second inversion of ii chord
- **B/Bb** = B/A# → B major is **I chord** in B major
  - A# (7th scale degree) in bass → so first inversion of I chord? But B major over A# bass — that’s **first inversion?**
    - B in root: B–D#–F#
    - A#–B–D#–F# → so yes, B with A# in bass = **I6** (first inversion) in B major
- **Emaj7/Ab** = Emaj7/G# → E major is **V chord** in B major
  - G# is third of E → so Emaj7/G# = first inversion of V7 chord

And finally ends on **Bbdim** = A#dim = **vii° of B**

But wait — we end on **vii°**, not tonic. That’s unusual, but could be a suspension.

Now the full progression with B major interpretation:

```
Bbdim     = A#dim  → vii°
Bbdim     = A#dim  → vii°
Gb/Bb     = F#m/A# → vi in first inversion
Gb/Bb     = F#m/A#
Bbdim     = A#dim
Bbdim     = A#dim
Dbm/Ab    = C#m/G# → ii in second inversion
B/Bb      = B/A#   → I in first inversion

Bbdim
Bbdim
Gb/Bb
Gb/Bb
Bbdim
Bbdim
Emaj7/Ab  = Emaj7/G# → V7 in first inversion
Bbdim     = A#dim → vii°
```

So the harmonic function in **B major**:

```
vii° - vi⁶ - vi⁶ - vi⁶ - vii° - ii⁶₄ - I⁶
...
vii° - vi⁶ - vi⁶ - vii° - vii° - V⁶₅ - vii°
```

Wait, not perfectly regular, but we see:
- Use of **vii° (A#dim)** as passing chord
- **vi = F#m**
- **ii = C#m**
- **I = B**
- **V = E**

All diatonic to **B major**

All chords fit within B major **except possibly B/Bb**, but:
- B major chord: B, D#, F# — all in B major
- Bass: A# — which is in B major (leading tone)
- So yes, **I⁶**

Even **Emaj7** = E–G#–B–D# — G#= in key, D#= in key → yes, **V7** is diatonic.

So **all chords are diatonic to B major**

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

- **Key: B major**
- **Mode: Ionian (major mode)**

The progression uses diatonic chords in **B major**, with inversions and passing diminished chords for voice leading.

Even though it starts and ends on vii° (leading tone diminished), the tonic chord (B major) appears clearly in the middle, and the dominant (E) is present, confirming the tonal center.

**Final Answer:**
- **Key: B major**
- **Mode: Ionian**
