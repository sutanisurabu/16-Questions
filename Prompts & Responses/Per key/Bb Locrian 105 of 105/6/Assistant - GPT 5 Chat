Let's analyze the chord sequence carefully:

**Progression:**
```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

---

### Step 1 – Interpret the chords

- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–E (enharmonically: Bb–Db–Fb)
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major triad with Bb in the bass → notes: Bb–Db–Gb
- **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor over Ab → notes: Ab–Db–Fb
- **B/Bb** = B major triad over Bb bass → notes: Bb–B–D#–F#
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G#–B–D# over Ab bass

We see lots of flats: Bb, Db, Gb, Ab—all suggesting a **flat-heavy key (Db major or Gb major region)**.  
However, we also have **Emaj7** and **B major**, which are enharmonically outside Gb major (Emaj7 = F♭maj7 in a Gb key).

### Step 2 – Look for tonal center

The chord that recurs most persistently is **Bbdim** – it’s everywhere, functioning almost like a pedal or leading-tone-type chord.

- Bbdim (Bb–Db–E) could function as *vii°* in a **C minor** key (C–Eb–G)? Not exactly: Bb° would be spelled Bb–Db–E (E instead of Eb), so no.
- If we respell E as Fb, it becomes Bb–Db–Fb, **Bbdim = vii° of Cb major / Cb minor (= same as B major region)**.

Let's test that:  
If we take key of **Cb major (i.e., B major enharmonically)**:
- I = B (enharmonic for Cb major)
- ♭II = C (though not used)
- ♭III = Db (we have Dbm)
- IV = E (we have Emaj7)
- V = Gb (we have Gb)
- vii° = Bb° (we have Bbdim!)

This is strong evidence that we're in the area of **Cb major (enharmonic: B major)**.

### Step 3 – Functionally in B major

Let’s re-spell everything in enharmonic equivalents of B major:

| Written chord | Enharmonic equivalent (for key of B major) | Functional notes |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Bbdim** | A#dim (vii°/B) | Leading-tone diminished → tonic |
| **Gb/Bb** | F#/A# | IV or subdominant first inversion |
| **Dbm/Ab** | C#m/G# | ii6 |
| **B/Bb** | B/A# | I7 over leading tone (kind of I/7) |
| **Emaj7/Ab** | Emaj7/G# | IVmaj7 over 3rd |

Now it looks much more cohesive:

```
A#dim  A#dim  F#/A#  F#/A#  
A#dim  A#dim  C#m/G#  B/A#  
A#dim  A#dim  F#/A#  F#/A#  
A#dim  A#dim  Emaj7/G#  A#dim
```

This makes clear harmonic sense in **B major** (Ionian mode):

- **A#dim (vii°)** → **B (I)**
- **F# (V or IV, depending on function)** → part of common progressions
- **C#m (ii)** → diatonic in B major
- **Emaj7 (IV)** → diatonic in B major

Everything is consistent with **B major** being the home key.

✅ **Final determination:**

- **Key:** B major (enharmonic Cb major)  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major)

**Summary:**
This progression is in **B major**, with the **Bbdim (A#dim)** functioning as the leading-tone chord repeatedly resolving to B-related or subdominant sonorities.
