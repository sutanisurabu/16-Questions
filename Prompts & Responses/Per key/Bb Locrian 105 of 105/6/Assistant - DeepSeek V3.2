Let’s break this down step by step.

## 1. Identify the chords and enharmonics

- **Bbdim** = Bb Db Fb (E)  
  - Diminished triad: Bb–Db–Fb (Fb = E natural)  
  - Could be part of Bbdim7: Bb Db Fb Abb (G)  

- **Gb/Bb** = Bb Gb Bb Db? Wait, Gb major triad = Gb Bb Db. So Gb/Bb is just first inversion.

- **Dbm/Ab** = Dbm = Db Fb (E) Ab — so minor triad, with Ab in bass.  
  - Db Fb Ab = C# minor (enharmonic to Dbm).  

- **B/Bb** = B major triad (B D# F#) with Bb in bass — a polychord or slash chord.  

- **Emaj7/Ab** = E G# B D# with Ab in bass.

## 2. Look for functional relationships

Bbdim is a common-tone diminished chord or leading-tone diminished of something.  
Bbdim7 = Bb Db Fb Abb = same notes as Gdim7, Bdim7, Ddim7 (diminished 7th symmetry).  

Let’s check keys:  
- Bbdim7 occurs in Cb major (B major?) as vii°7, or in Gb major as vii°7 of Gb? Let’s check:  
  In Gb major: scale = Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F. vii°7 = Fdim7 = F Ab Cb Ebb (D). Not Bbdim7.  
  In Ab minor: harmonic minor scale = Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G, vii°7 = Gdim7 = G Bb Db Fb. Not Bbdim7.  

Actually: Bbdim7 notes = Bb Db Fb Abb (G). Enharmonically = Bb Db E G.  
That set is also Ddim7 (D F Ab B), Fdim7 (F Ab Cb Ebb), G#dim7 (G# B D F).  

So Bbdim7 could act as G#dim7 → A minor (common-tone function with A or C or E).

## 3. Check the progression for tonal center

Sequence pattern:  
Bbdim → Gb/Bb (repeat) → Bbdim → Dbm/Ab → B/Bb → Bbdim → Gb/Bb (repeat) → Bbdim → Emaj7/Ab → Bbdim  

Let’s map bass line:  
Bb → Bb → Bb → Ab → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Ab → Bb  

So bass is mostly Bb, with two Ab bass notes under Dbm and Emaj7.

## 4. Interpret B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab

B/Bb: B major triad (B D# F#) over Bb bass — no traditional diatonic function in a simple key, possibly chromatic mediant or a transition.  

Emaj7/Ab: E G# B D# over Ab bass — Ab against E major creates an E major #11 (lydian) sound: E G# B D# Ab (b9? no, Ab is #11 if E is root). But here Ab is in bass, so it’s an E/Ab chord: Ab–B–D#–G# = Abmaj7#5? Let’s rearrange: Ab C E G = Abmaj7, but here E G# B D# = E major 7, plus Ab in bass = Ab–E–G#–B–D# = Ab + Emaj7 = polychord. Could be Ab Lydian sound (Ab B D E G# etc.).

## 5. Look for key candidates

Gb major: Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F — Bbdim7 is not in this scale.  
Db major: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C — Bbdim7 not in scale.  

Given Bbdim and Gb major appear, maybe key is **Gb major**? But Bbdim is chromatic.  

B/Bb suggests movement to Bbm? Possibly key of **Db major / Bb minor**?  

Let’s test Bb minor harmonic: Bb C Db Eb F Gb A —  
Bbdim7? No, vii°7 in Bb harmonic minor = A dim7 (A C Eb Gb).  

So Bbdim7 is a common-tone diminished of Gb (Bbdim7 → Gb):  
Bbdim7 = Bb Db Fb Abb; Gb = Gb Bb Db — shares Bb and Db.  

Also Bbdim7 → Dbm/Ab: Dbm = Db Fb Ab — shares Db and Fb (E) with Bbdim7.  

B/Bb: B = B D# F# — no obvious relation, maybe borrowed chord.  

Emaj7/Ab: E G# B D# — far from Gb major, but could be a tritone sub: E major is tritone away from Bb, maybe functioning as V of A? But then Ab in bass — maybe just a chromatic planing.

## 6. Determine key from recurring stable chords

The only non-diminished triads are: Gb major, Dbm, B major, E major.  
Gb and Dbm are both in Db major (Gb = IV, Dbm = i).  
B major and E major are not in Db major — possibly borrowed from parallel key?  

But E major → Bbdim? No direct function.  

Given the prevalence of Bbdim acting as a common-tone diminished to Gb, and Gb major as a stable point, the tonal center feels like **Gb major**.  
Bass Bb is the 3rd of Gb, so maybe tonic is Gb.  

Mode: Gb major = Gb Ionian.  

---

## 7. Conclusion

The progression is very chromatic, but the recurring resolution of Bbdim to Gb major suggests **Gb major** as the key, with Bbdim as a common-tone diminished (Ct°7) of Gb.  

Mode: **Ionian (major)**.

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Gb\ major}
\]
