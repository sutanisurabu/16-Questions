Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords given:**
1. Bbdim  
2. Bbdim  
3. Gb/Bb (Gb major with Bb in bass)  
4. Gb/Bb  
5. Bbdim  
6. Bbdim  
7. Dbm/Ab (Db minor with Ab in bass)  
8. B/Bb (B major with Bb in bass – unusual, likely a typo or enharmonic spelling)  
9. Bbdim  
10. Bbdim  
11. Gb/Bb  
12. Gb/Bb  
13. Bbdim  
14. Bbdim  
15. Emaj7/Ab (E major 7 with Ab in bass)  
16. Bbdim

### Step 1: Look at the **Bbdim** chord
Diminished chords are **symmetrical** and can function in multiple keys. But **Bbdim** is **diatonic** in a few keys:
- In **C minor**: B° is the vii° chord (but Bbdim is **B♭ D♭ F♭**, which is **vii° in C♭ major / A♭ minor**, not C minor)
- Actually, **B♭dim** is **vii°7 in C minor** if spelled **B♭ D♭ F♭ A♭♭ (A♭♭ = G natural)**, but here it's just **B♭dim**, a **triad**.

So **B♭dim** is:
- **vii° in C minor** (if spelled B♭ D♭ F♭)
- **ii° in A♭ major**
- **vi° in D♭ major**
- **i° in B♭ minor** (but B♭ minor is rare and has 5 flats – unlikely)

---

### Step 2: Look at the **other chords**

#### Gb/Bb
- Gb major: Gb Bb Db
- So Gb/Bb is **Gb major in first inversion**
- Gb major is **IV in Db major**, or **I in Gb major**, or **VI in Bb minor**

#### Dbm/Ab
- Db minor: Db Fb Ab
- So Dbm/Ab is **Db minor in second inversion**
- Db minor is **i in Db minor**, or **iv in Ab minor**, or **ii in Cb major**

#### B/Bb
- This is **very chromatic** – B major (B D♯ F♯) over B♭
- This is **not diatonic** in any standard key – it's a **chromatic passing tone** or **upper structure**
- Likely a **voice-leading chord**, not functional in a traditional sense

#### Emaj7/Ab
- Emaj7: E G# B D#
- Over Ab bass: **Ab E G# B D#**
- This is **Emaj7 in third inversion**, or **Ab lydian aug** (very jazz)
- In **Db major**, Emaj7 is **III7**, a **secondary dominant** (V/vi)
- But here it's **inverted**, and **Ab is the bass**
- This could be interpreted as **Ab augmented lydian**, or **a modal interchange chord**

---

### Step 3: Look at **bass line**
Let’s just extract the **bass notes**:

- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Ab  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Bb  
- Ab  
- Bb

So the **bass is mostly Bb**, with **Ab** appearing twice – at chords 7 and 15.

This strongly suggests **Bb is the tonal center**.

---

### Step 4: What **mode** has **Bbdim** as a **central chord**?

Let’s consider **Bb as tonic**, and ask:

> What mode has **B♭dim**, **G♭ major**, **D♭ minor**, and **E major7**?

This is **not diatonic** in any standard mode.

But **B♭dim** is **vii° in C minor**.

And **Gb major** is **IV in C minor**.

**Db minor** is **v in C minor** – but **v is normally minor**, so **Db minor** is **borrowed** from **C phrygian** or **C minor with modal interchange**.

**Emaj7** is **III in C minor**, but **III is normally Eb major** – so **Emaj7** is **a chromatic third relationship**, or **a tritone substitution**, or **a modal interchange from C harmonic minor**.

---

### ✅ Final Analysis:

- **Tonal center**: **Bb** (bass is anchored to Bb)
- **Harmonic语言**: **Chromatic, jazz-influenced, modal interchange**
- **Best interpretation**: **C minor with Bb as pedal tone**, and **chords voiced above it**

So:

> **Key: C minor**  
> **Mode: C minor with Bb pedal tone and chromatic harmony**

The **Bbdim** is **vii° in C minor**,  
**Gb/Bb** is **IV64 in C minor**,  
**Dbm/Ab** is **v6/4 in C minor (borrowed from phrygian or harmonic minor)**,  
**Emaj7/Ab** is **III7+ in C minor (from harmonic minor or tritone sub)**

---

### ✅ Answer:
**Key: C minor**  
**Mode: C minor with Bb pedal tone and chromatic jazz harmony**
