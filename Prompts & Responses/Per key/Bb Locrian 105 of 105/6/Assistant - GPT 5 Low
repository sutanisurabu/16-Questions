**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to analyze the chord progression: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim." First, I’ll determine the key and mode. The heavy use of Bbdim makes it unusual, possibly indicating it's in Ab major.

The Bbdim chord consists of Bb, Db, and Fb, which I realize isn’t the leading tone of B. The Gb/Bb chord shows it’s a first inversion of Gb major. I need to clarify these relationships further.**Examining chord relationships**

I notice that the Gb major triad shares Bb and Db with Bbdim, differing only by a semitone between Gb and Fb.

Next, the Dbm/Ab chord is D-flat minor over A-flat bass. This chord is enharmonically equivalent to C# minor and has a second inversion. Its notes, Db, Fb, Ab, mean it shares Fb and Ab with Bbdim, reinforcing the connections.

The B/Bb is a B major chord over Bb bass, creating a tritone relationship. Finally, Emaj7/Ab consists of E, G#, B, and D# over an Ab bass.**Determining key and mode**

Considering Emaj7 over Ab bass, I see that Ab is enharmonically equivalent to G#. The Emaj7 chords—E, G#, B, and D#—can be viewed as first inversion since G# is in the bass. However, labeling it Emaj7/Ab suggests a key with flats, while E major typically uses sharps, indicating an enharmonic mixture.

Several chords feature Bb in the bass, like Gb/Bb and B/Bb, creating an anchor. It seems the bass alternates between Bb and Ab, which might hint at influences from Rachmaninoff or a jazz standard!**Analyzing repeating patterns**

I notice a repeating chord pattern: Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb and so on, suggesting an 8 + 8 measure structure that changes in the seventh chord — first appearing as Dbm/Ab and then B/Bb in the second half, transitioning to Emaj7/Ab. 

I’m considering whether this is in the key of Bb, either minor or major. Bbdim doesn’t fit as tonic in Bb minor since it’s not diatonic. In Bb major, Bbdim could serve as ii°. 

But what if I interpret it as Gb major instead? The Gb major scale includes Gb, Ab, Bb, and others.**Determining key and mode**

I see a repeating pattern in the chord progression where Bbdim relates to A#dim, establishing it as vii° in B major. Moving to Gb/Bb, this becomes F#/A#, the V6 chord in B major. Dbm/Ab converts to C#m/G#, showing it as ii6. B/Bb represents B over leading tone A#. Lastly, Emaj7/Ab turns into Emaj7/G#, or IVmaj7 in first inversion. 

The bass alternates between A# and G#, indicating a leading-tone pedal effect. Thus, the key is B major (Ionian mode), neatly spelled with flats.

B major (Ionian).

Reason: reading with enharmonics:
- Bbdim = A#dim = vii° in B
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# = V6
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# = ii6
- B/Bb = B/A# = I with leading-tone in bass
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# = IVmaj7 in first inversion

The progression centers on B major with frequent leading-tone (A#/Bb) and 6th-degree (G#/Ab) bass pedals.
