### Reasoning

**Assessing Chord Functionality**

I'm now zeroing in on the chord functions. The Bbdim chords seem to be a recurring element, and with the root as Bb for each of the chords in the progression, that seems like a good place to start. I'll need to figure out how these altered chords work within a key.


**Deciphering Chord Roles**

Now, I'm examining how each chord interacts with the others. It's becoming clearer that the Bbdim chords are key and I think they can have a dominant function. I'm considering whether we're dealing with a tonal center, or something more chromatic. I need to figure out how the slash chords play in.


**Pinpointing Key Centers**

I'm now putting together the core harmonies. It looks like the diminished chords do not resolve in the usual ways, and the bass notes alternate, which indicates the key might not be tonal. The presence of the Gb chord leads me to consider the Cb major key, which would be the flat-six, relating to the diminished chords. Now, I must work out the role of the B and E chords.


**Refining Key Identification**

I'm now investigating the potential role of octatonic scales. The half-whole version seems promising, but it doesn't quite fit. I'm now looking at the whole-half variant, to see if the whole-half octatonic scale might provide a better fit. Specifically, I need to see how the inclusion of the G-flat in the octatonic scale interacts with the B and E chords.


**Evaluating Octatonic Applications**

I'm now revisiting the Octatonic scales, but it's clear neither one perfectly suits the progression. It appears the harmony works around chromatic motion. The conclusion is a highly dissonant, chromatic movement built around the Bb diminished chord. The key signature is focused on the gravitational center of Bb, and points towards either a diminished or minor key.


**Revisiting Harmonic Implications**

I'm now integrating the implications of the constant Bb bass, and the diminished chord emphasis. It's leaning towards Bb minor, but the chromaticism throws a wrench in the typical harmonic analysis. I'm focusing on how the non-diatonic chords impact the sense of a key.


**Refining Modal Conclusions**

I'm now revisiting the overall conclusion. Though a central tonal note is clear, and the mode centers on a diminished structure, the chromatic nature means it may not fit a singular "key." Instead, the best description of the progression is its use of a highly dissonant, chromatic mode centered on the Bb diminished chord.


**Concluding Harmonic Analyses**

I'm now synthesizing everything. The constant Bb bass and diminished chords establish a Bb center, but the chromaticism prevents a simple key designation. However, the Octatonic scale seems like a solid descriptor of the *sound*, since the core harmony is a diminished structure. The final call is a Bb center, with a Chromatic/Diminished mode.




This chord progression is highly non-functional (it does not follow typical Tonic-Dominant-Subdominant relationships) and relies heavily on symmetric harmony, primarily focusing on the diminished chord quality.

Here is the determination of the key and mode:

### 1. Identify the Tonal Center (Key)

The most repeated chord is **B-flat diminished (Bbdim)**, and the B-flat note is the foundation for the vast majority of the progression, either as the root of the chord or the bass note of a slash chord (Bbdim, Gb/Bb, B/Bb). This establishes **B-flat** as the gravitational center or key center.

### 2. Analyze the Harmonic Structure (Mode)

The core harmonic color is the prolonged B-flat diminished chord. This chord is symmetrical, meaning its components are spaced by minor thirds (Bb - D-flat - E [F-flat]).

When a diminished chord is prolonged, the scale associated with it is the **Octatonic Scale** (also known as the Diminished Scale).

*   **Relationship to the Octatonic Scale:** The octatonic scale is known for its ambiguity and tension, making it ideal for the suspenseful or unresolved effect achieved by this progression. If used strictly, the scale would be an Octatonic Whole-Half or Half-Whole starting on B-flat, either of which contains the notes of Bbdim.
*   **Chromatic Movement:** The progression introduces highly chromatic chords like $B$ major and $Emaj7$ over the foreign bass notes ($Bb$ and $Ab$), suggesting that the material is not strictly diatonic or strictly octatonic, but rather uses these outside chords for color and tension while returning consistently to the Bbdim foundation.

### Conclusion

This progression is centered on B-flat, utilizing symmetrical harmony revolving around the B-flat diminished chord.

*   **Key Center:** **B-flat**
*   **Mode:** **Diminished Mode (Octatonic)**

(Note: In a descriptive sense, this piece is likely exploiting the tension of the Diminished/Octatonic structure, common in modern film scores and certain styles of jazz, where the goal is to sustain tension rather than resolve to a tonic.)
