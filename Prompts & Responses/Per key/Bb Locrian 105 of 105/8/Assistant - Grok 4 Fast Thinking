**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast Thinking**

**Key:** B♭ minor  
**Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor), with melodic minor and chromatic elements for color

This progression is characteristic of the jazz standard "I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)" by Duke Ellington and Paul Francis Webster, which centers on B♭ minor harmony. The repeated B♭dim acts as a passing or substitute chord (related to iiø7 in related keys or for tension), while Gb/B♭ functions as a bVI chord. The slash chords introduce inversions and chromaticism (e.g., D♭m/Ab and E♭maj7/Ab suggest temporary shifts, with B/B♭ as a passing dominant), but the bass anchor on B♭ and overall minor tonality confirm the center.
