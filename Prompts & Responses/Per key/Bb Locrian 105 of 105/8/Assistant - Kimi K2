This progression is:

**Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Db/E♭ – B/B♭ – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim**

Let’s break it down.

---

### Step 1: Identify the chord types and roots

- **Bbdim** appears repeatedly — this is a **diminished triad**: Bb – Db – Fb (E)
- **Gb/Bb** is a **Gb major triad in first inversion** (Bb in the bass): Bb – Db – Gb
- **Db/E♭** is **Db major in second inversion**: E♭ – Ab – Db
- **B/B♭** is ambiguous — likely a typo or shorthand. Possibly **B major over Bb**, which would be B – D♯ – F♯ / Bb — a **chromatic polychord** or **bitonal clash**.
- **Emaj7/Ab** is **Emaj7 in third inversion**: Ab – E – G♯ – B

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal centers

The **Bbdim** chord is the **vii° chord of Cb major** (or **ii° of Ab minor**), but Bbdim is also enharmonic to:

- **A#dim**, **C#dim**, **F#dim** — all inversions of the same **diminished chord** (symmetrical)

So **Bbdim** could resolve or function in **Ab minor**, **Cb major**, or **Bb minor**, depending on context.

But the **Gb major chords** and **Emaj7/Ab** suggest a **Gb major** or **E major** tonal center.

---

### Step 3: Check for modal or chromatic movement

This is **not diatonic** in any traditional major/minor key. The **Bbdim** acts as a **passing or chromatic diminished chord**, not a functional ii° or vii°.

The **Emaj7/Ab** at the end is **E major**, **Ab in the bass** — a **chromatic mediant** or **modal interchange** chord.

---

### Final Assessment:

This progression is **chromatic and modal**, not rooted in a traditional major or minor key. However, **the closest tonal center is**:

> **Gb major / E♭ minor**,  
> with **chromatic diminished passing chords** and **modal interchange**.

So:

- **Key center**: **Gb major**
- **Mode**: **Chromatic / modal** — not strictly major or minor
- **Function**: **Bbdim** is used as a **chromatic diminished chord**, not a diatonic ii° or vii°

---

### Summary:

- **Key**: **Gb major**
- **Mode**: **Chromatic / modal**
- **Bbdim** is **not functional** — it's **chromatic color**
- **Emaj7/Ab** is **modal interchange** or **chromatic mediant**
