**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are many diminished chords, it might be in a key that uses diminished chords as leading tones or passing chords. Also, there are chords like Gb/Bb, which is Gb major with a Bb in the bass, and Dbm/Ab, which is Db minor with Ab in the bass, and B/Bb, which is B major with Bb in the bass, and Emaj7/Ab, which is E major 7th with Ab in the bass.

Let me list out all the chords clearly:

- Bbdim: This is B diminished. Since it's dim, it's probably a diminished triad or full diminished seventh? In chord symbols, "dim" usually means diminished triad, but in context, it might imply diminished seventh. I'll assume it's a diminished triad for now, but I might need to consider the seventh.

Bbdim consists of notes: Bb, Db, Fb (which is E), and if it's diminished seventh, it would include Gbb (which is F). But since it's written as dim, it might be just the triad: Bb, Db, E.

In standard notation, Bdim triad is B, D, F. But here it's Bbdim, so Bb, Db, Fb (E). But Fb is enharmonic to E, so in practice, it's Bb, Db, E.

But let's think in terms of key signatures. I see Gb major, which has six flats, and Dbm, which has five flats, and B major, which has five sharps, and E major, which has four sharps. This is confusing because there are mixed flats and sharps.

Perhaps I should think of the chords in relation to a common key.

Let me look at the bass notes. The bass notes are: for Bbdim, bass is Bb? But when it's written as Bbdim, the bass is the root unless specified. But in the progression, some chords have slashes, indicating inversions.

So let's list the chords with their full names and bass notes:

1. Bbdim - root position? Probably, since no slash.

2. Bbdim - same

3. Gb/Bb - so chord Gb major, bass Bb. Gb major chord: Gb, Bb, Db. So with bass Bb, it's first inversion.

4. Gb/Bb - same

5. Bbdim - root

6. Bbdim - root

7. Dbm/Ab - chord Db minor, bass Ab. Db minor chord: Db, Fb (E), Ab. So with bass Ab, it's first inversion.

8. B/Bb - chord B major, bass Bb. B major chord: B, D#, F#. So with bass Bb, this is unusual because Bb is not in the B major chord. So this is a polychord or something? B major over Bb bass. So the chord tones are B, D#, F# with bass Bb. So overall notes: Bb, B, D#, F#. This is a dissonant chord.

9. Bbdim - root

10. Bbdim - root

11. Gb/Bb - first inversion Gb major

12. Gb/Bb - same

13. Bbdim - root

14. Bbdim - root

15. Emaj7/Ab - chord E major 7th, bass Ab. E major 7th chord: E, G#, B, D#. With bass Ab, so notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Again, Ab is not in E major, so dissonant.

16. Bbdim - root

So there are several diminished chords and some major chords with foreign bass notes.

Now, to find the key, I need to see which key these chords might belong to. Diminished chords often function as leading tone chords or vii° chords in a key.

Let me consider Bbdim. What keys have Bbdim? Bbdim is the vii° chord in Cb major or Cb minor? But Cb major is enharmonic to B major, which has sharps, but let's think in flats.

Bbdim chord: notes Bb, Db, Fb (E). So if we consider it as a diminished triad, it could be from the harmonic minor or major scale.

In major keys, the vii° chord is diminished, but it's based on the leading tone. For example, in C major, vii° is Bdim: B, D, F.

So for Bbdim, the leading tone would be to Cb? But Cb is B, so it might lead to B major or B minor? But B major has D# and F#, which don't match Bbdim's Db and Fb.

Perhaps Bbdim is not from a major key but from a minor key.

In minor keys, the vii° chord is from the harmonic minor scale. For example, in C minor, the vii° is Bdim: B, D, F, leading to C.

So for Bbdim, it would lead to Cb minor? But Cb minor is B minor, which has B, D, F#? But Bbdim has Db and Fb (E), so Db is not D, and Fb is E, not F#. So it doesn't lead to B minor.

Let's think of Bbdim as a common-tone diminished chord or passing diminished chord.

Another thought: diminished chords are symmetric and can be used in various keys.

Let's list all the chord roots: Bb dim, Gb, Db minor, B, E major.

Gb major and Db minor are related; Gb major is the relative major of Db minor? No, relative major of Db minor would be Fb major? Let's calculate.

The relative major of a minor key is a minor third above. So for Db minor, the relative major is Fb major, which is E major? Fb is E, so Db minor relative major is E major? But E major has four sharps, and Db minor has five flats, so enharmonically, E major is Fb major, but Fb major is not commonly used.

This is messy. Perhaps I should think in terms of circle of fifths.

Let's look at the chords that are not diminished: Gb major, Db minor, B major, E major.

Gb major has flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Cb? Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. So chords: Gb major, Ab minor, Bb minor, Cb major, Db major, Eb minor, F diminished.

But here we have Gb major and Db minor? Db minor is not in Gb major; in Gb major, the chord on Db is Db major, not minor.

Similarly, B major has sharps: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So B major chord: B, D#, F#.

E major has E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. Emaj7: E, G#, B, D#.

Now, the diminished chords are Bbdim. Bbdim notes: Bb, Db, Fb (E). So Bb, Db, E.

Notice that E is common in Bbdim and in Emaj7? But Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D#, so E and G#, B, D#.

Also, B/Bb has B, D#, F# with Bb, so Bb, B, D#, F#.

Db minor has Db, Fb (E), Ab.

Gb major has Gb, Bb, Db.

So let's see common notes or patterns.

Perhaps the key is Gb major, but then Db minor doesn't fit, and B major doesn't fit.

Another idea: perhaps the Bbdim is actually functioning as a dominant chord or something.

Bbdim is often used as a substitute for G7b9 or something. Bbdim shares notes with G7b9: G, B, D, F, Ab? G7b9 has G, B, D, F, Ab. Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, Gb? If Bbdim is full diminished, it would have Bb, Db, E, Gb. But Gb is F#, and E is Fb? Let's clarify.

A full diminished seventh chord has minor thirds between each note. So Bbdim7 would be Bb, Db, Fb (E), Gbb (F). So notes: Bb, Db, E, F. But F is enharmonic to E#? No, Bb, Db, E, F. But E and F are half steps, so in a diminished chord, it should be symmetric, so Bb, Db, E, Gb? Let's calculate properly.

Standard diminished seventh chord: root, minor third, diminished fifth, diminished seventh. So for Bb: Bb, Db, Fb, Abb. But Fb is E, and Abb is G. So Bb, Db, E, G. Yes! So Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G.

But in the chord symbol, it's written as Bbdim, which might imply dim7, or just dim triad? In jazz and popular music, "dim" usually means diminished seventh, but in classical, it might mean triad. However, in this context, since there are many, it might be dim7.

Similarly, in the progression, we have Emaj7/Ab, which has Ab, and B/Bb has Bb, so if Bbdim7 has G, that might connect.

So let's assume Bbdim is Bbdim7: notes Bb, Db, E, G.

Now, Gb major chord: Gb, Bb, Db.

So Gb/Bb is Gb major with bass Bb, so notes Bb, Gb, Db — which are all in Bbdim7? Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G, so Gb is not in Bbdim7, but Gb is enharmonic to F#? Gb is not the same as G. So Gb is a half step below G.

So when moving from Bbdim to Gb/Bb, the notes change from Bb,Db,E,G to Bb,Gb,Db — so E and G move to Gb and Db? But Gb is not G, so E to Gb is a half step? E to Gb is a minor third? E to Gb is a diminished third, but enharmonically E to F# is a whole step, but Gb is F#, so E to F# is whole step? Let's use enharmonics.

If I think in terms of E and F#, then Bbdim7 has E and G, but G is F#? No, Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G. G is G natural.

Gb major has Gb, which is F#, so G natural to Gb is a half step down? But in equal temperament, it's the same note, but in notation, G natural and Gb are different.

This is complicated. Perhaps I should think of the chords in a different key.

Let's list all the chords with their notes assuming dim7 for Bbdim.

- Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G

- Gb/Bb: Bb, Gb, Db  (so notes Gb, Bb, Db)

- Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb (E), Ab with bass Ab, so notes Ab, Db, E

- B/Bb: B, D#, F# with bass Bb, so notes Bb, B, D#, F#

- Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D# with bass Ab, so notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Now, let's see the key based on the chords that sound resolved or the context.

The progression starts and ends with Bbdim, so it might not be a tonic chord, but a passing chord.

Notice that Gb/Bb appears after Bbdim, and Gb major has notes Gb, Bb, Db, which are all in Bbdim7 except E and G. Bbdim7 has E and G, while Gb has Gb and no E. So from Bbdim7 to Gb, the E and G resolve to F? But Gb is F#, so if E moves to F# and G moves to Gb? But G to Gb is half step down, and E to F# is whole step up, which is not typical resolution.

In diminished chord resolution, diminished chords usually resolve to a chord a half step above or below one of the notes.

For example, Bbdim7 can resolve to A major or Cb major, etc.

But here it resolves to Gb major? Gb is a half step above F? Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G. If it resolves to Gb major, which has Gb, Bb, Db, then the E would resolve to F? But Gb has no F, so E might resolve to F? But F is not in Gb major? Gb major has F natural? Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. So yes, it has F natural. So if E resolves to F, that would be a half step resolution, and G resolves to Gb? But G to Gb is half step down, which is also possible. So Bbdim7 to Gb major: E to F and G to Gb? But Gb is F#, so G to F# is half step down, and E to F is half step up? But in Gb major, the note is F natural, so E to F is half step up, and G to F is half step down? But G to F is a whole step? No, G to F is a whole step only if G natural to F natural, but G natural to F natural is a whole step down? Let's think in semitones.

E to F is one semitone up.

G to F is one semitone down? G to F is two semitones down? G to F is a major second down, which is two semitones. But in equal temperament, if G resolves to Gb, G to Gb is one semitone down? G natural to G flat is one semitone down? Yes, because G natural is one semitone above G flat? No, G natural is one semitone above F#/Gb? F# and Gb are the same note. So G natural to F# is one semitone down. Yes! So G natural to F# is one semitone down.

But in Gb major, the note is Gb, which is F#, so G natural to Gb (F#) is one semitone down.

And E to F is one semitone up.

So in Bbdim7 to Gb major, the notes E and G resolve to F and Gb? But Gb major has Gb and F? Gb major has Gb and F? No, Gb major has Gb and F? Let's see: Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. So yes, it has F natural and Gb. So when moving from Bbdim7 to Gb major, the E can resolve to F, and the G can resolve to Gb? But Gb is the root, so G resolves to Gb, which is one semitone down, and E resolves to F, which is one semitone up. So that works well for two notes. The other notes Bb and Db are common to both chords. So yes, Bbdim7 resolves nicely to Gb major.

Similarly, Bbdim7 to Dbm/Ab? Dbm/Ab has notes Ab, Db, E. So from Bbdim7 Bb,Db,E,G to Dbm/Ab Ab,Db,E, so Bb resolves to Ab? Bb to Ab is one semitone down? But Bb to Ab is a whole step down? Bb to Ab is two semitones down? Bb to A is one semitone down? Bb to A is one semitone down? Bb is A#? Let's think: Bb is one semitone below B natural, and A is one semitone below Bb? So Bb to A is one semitone down? But A is not Ab. Ab is one semitone below A? So Bb to Ab is two semitones down? Yes, Bb to Ab is a whole step down.

In diminished resolution, we usually resolve one note by half step and hold others, but here Bb to Ab is not half step. But let's see the chord: Bbdim7 to Dbm/Ab. Dbm is Db minor, which has Db, Fb (E), Ab. So notes Db, E, Ab. Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G. So common notes: Db and E. So Bb and G need to resolve. Bb to Ab? Bb to Ab is whole step, not half step. G to ? Dbm has no G, so G might resolve to Ab? G to Ab is one semitone up? Yes! G to Ab is one semitone up. And Bb to ? Bb to Ab is one semitone down? But Bb to Ab is two semitones down? Bb to Ab is a major second down, which is two semitones. But if Bb resolves to A, that would be one semitone down, but here it resolves to Ab, which is two semitones down, so not typical.

Perhaps in this context, it's not a resolution but a voice leading.

Similarly, we have B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. Notes Bb, B, D#, F#. From Bbdim7, notes Bb,Db,E,G to B/Bb Bb,B,D#,F#. So common Bb? But Db to D# is two semitones up, E to D# is one semitone down? E to D# is one semitone down? E to D# is enharmonic to E to Eb? But D# is Eb? No, D# is one semitone above D, and E is one semitone above D#? So E to D# is one semitone down? Yes, because E to D# is one semitone down if we consider D# as Eb, but in equal temperament, E to Eb is one semitone down, but Eb is D#, so yes, E to D# is one semitone down. And G to F# is one semitone down? G to F# is one semitone down. So from Bbdim7 to B/Bb, the notes E and G both resolve down by semitone to D# and F#? But D# and F# are in B major, and Bb is still there, but Bb is not in B major, so it's a dissonance.

Then we have Emaj7/Ab: notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. From Bbdim7, if it goes to Emaj7/Ab, then Bb,Db,E,G to Ab,E,G#,B,D#. So E is common, Bb to Ab? Bb to Ab is whole step, Db to G#? Db to G# is three semitones up? Not smooth. G to G#? G to G# is one semitone up, but then Db to D#? Db to D# is two semitones up? Not smooth.

So perhaps Bbdim7 doesn't directly resolve to Emaj7/Ab in this progression; there might be other chords in between.

Let's look at the sequence: after Bbdim Bbdim, we have Gb/Bb Gb/Bb, then Bbdim Bbdim, then Dbm/Ab B/Bb, then Bbdim Bbdim, then Gb/Bb Gb/Bb, then Bbdim Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab Bbdim.

So the pattern is: Bbdim repeated, then Gb/Bb repeated, then Bbdim repeated, then Dbm/Ab and B/Bb, then Bbdim repeated, then Gb/Bb repeated, then Bbdim repeated, then Emaj7/Ab and Bbdim.

So the Gb/Bb appears twice, and Dbm/Ab and B/Bb appear once, and Emaj7/Appears once.

Now, from earlier, Bbdim7 to Gb/Bb seems to have good voice leading if we assume E to F and G to Gb.

But in Gb major, the F is natural, so E to F is half step up, and G to Gb is half step down.

Similarly, for Dbm/Ab, from Bbdim7, if we have E and G, and Dbm has E and Ab, so G to Ab is half step up, and Bb to Ab is whole step down, which is less ideal, but perhaps acceptable.

For B/Bb, from Bbdim7, E to D# half step down, G to F# half step down, and Bb remains, but Bb is the bass, so it might be a pedal point or something.

Notice that in many cases, the bass is Bb for Bbdim and for Gb/Bb, and for B/Bb, the bass is Bb, so perhaps Bb is a pedal point or common tone.

Let's list the bass notes throughout the progression:

1. Bbdim - bass Bb

2. Bbdim - bass Bb

3. Gb/Bb - bass Bb

4. Gb/Bb - bass Bb

5. Bbdim - bass Bb

6. Bbdim - bass Bb

7. Dbm/Ab - bass Ab

8. B/Bb - bass Bb

9. Bbdim - bass Bb

10. Bbdim - bass Bb

11. Gb/Bb - bass Bb

12. Gb/Bb - bass Bb

13. Bbdim - bass Bb

14. Bbdim - bass Bb

15. Emaj7/Ab - bass Ab

16. Bbdim - bass Bb

So for most of the progression, the bass is Bb, except for two chords: Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, where the bass is Ab.

So Bb is a constant bass note, which suggests that the key might be centered around Bb, but Bb what? Bb major or Bb minor?

But the chords are mostly diminished or major chords with Bb bass.

Now, Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G. If we consider the bass Bb as a pedal point, then the chords above are changing.

So perhaps the key is Bb minor or Bb major.

But let's see the chords that sound like tonic. Gb major might be a tonic? But with Bb bass, it's first inversion, so not root position.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, which is not Bb.

Perhaps the tonic is Bb, and the chords are passing chords.

Another idea: perhaps the Bbdim7 is acting as a dominant chord to Bb major or minor? But Bbdim7 leading to Bb? But Bbdim7 has notes that don't resolve to Bb major? Bb major has Bb, D, F, so from Bbdim7 Bb,Db,E,G to Bb major Bb,D,F, so Db to D is half step up? Db to D is one semitone up, E to F is one semitone up, G to F is one semitone down? So yes, that could work? But in the progression, we don't have Bb major chord; we have Gb/Bb, which is Gb major with Bb bass, which is not Bb major.

Gb major with Bb bass is the first inversion of Gb major, which is similar to Bb minor? Gb major chord: Gb, Bb, Db. If we compare to Bb minor chord: Bb, Db, F. So Gb major has Gb instead of F, so it's different.

So not Bb minor.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Gb major, since Gb/Bb appears multiple times, and Bbdim7 resolves to it.

In Gb major, the vii°7 chord would be Fdim7? Let's see the scale degrees in Gb major.

Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

Chords: I Gb, ii Abm, iii Bbm, IV Cb, V Db, vi Ebm, vii° Fdim7

Fdim7: F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? F, Ab, Cb (B), Ebb (D)? So F, Ab, B, D? But B is Cb, and D is Ebb? So notes F, Ab, B, D? But B and D are not in Gb major? Gb major has Bb and Db, so B natural and D natural are not in the scale? Let's see: Gb major has Cb which is B, and Ebb which is D? But Ebb is D, and yes, D is not in the scale? Gb major has Eb, which is D#? No, Eb is D#? No, Eb is E flat, which is D#? But in Gb major, the seventh note is F, and the leading tone is F, but F is natural, so the diminished chord on F would be F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? Cb is B, and Ebb is D, so F, Ab, B, D. But B and D are not in the scale? Gb major has Bb and Db, so B natural and D natural are not part of the scale. So in Gb major, the vii°7 chord should be from the harmonic minor? But in major key, the vii° is from the natural scale? In major key, the seventh scale degree is a half step below tonic, so in Gb major, the seventh is F, which is a half step below Gb, so it is the leading tone, and the vii° chord is diminished, but in natural major, the vii chord is half-diminished, not fully diminished? Let's clarify.

In major key, the seventh chord built on the leading tone is a diminished triad and a half-diminished seventh chord if we use the natural scale. For example, in C major, vii° is Bdim triad, and Bm7b5 is half-diminished. But if we use the harmonic major, we might have fully diminished, but typically in classical, the fully diminished seventh chord is from the harmonic minor scale.

So in Gb major, the natural vii chord is Fm7b5: F, Ab, Cb, Eb? But Cb is B, and Eb is Eb, so F, Ab, B, Eb? But Eb is the sixth scale degree, so it's half-diminished.

But for fully diminished, we need a diminished seventh, so we would use F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? But Ebb is D, so F, Ab, B, D. But D is not in the key, so it would be borrowed from parallel minor or something.

So in Gb major, the fully diminished chord might not be diatonic.

But in this progression, we have Bbdim7, which is not on the leading tone of Gb major; the leading tone is F, so Bb is the third scale degree, so Bbdim7 is not diatonic to Gb major.

So perhaps Gb major is not the key.

Let's consider Db minor. Db minor scale: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? So chords: i Dbm, ii° Ebdim, III Fb major, iv Gbm, V Ab major, VI Bbb major, vii° Cdim7? Cdim7: C, Eb, Gb, Bbb? C, Eb, Gb, A? So notes C, Eb, Gb, A.

But we have Bbdim7, which is not in Db minor.

Another thought: perhaps the Bbdim7 is a common-tone diminished chord for Gb major? But we already saw that Bbdim7 resolves to Gb major with good voice leading.

Similarly, it might resolve to other chords.

Let's look at the Emaj7/Ab chord. Emaj7/Ab has notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. This chord is like E major with Ab bass. E major is far from Gb major.

Perhaps the key is B major or E major.

But let's see the overall progression.

Perhaps I can consider the circle of fifths or the relationship between the chords.

Notice that Gb major and B major are tritone apart? Gb and B are tritone apart.

Similarly, Db minor and E major are also tritone apart? Db and E are tritone apart.

So perhaps there is a tritone substitution happening.

In jazz, diminished chords are used for tonicization or modulation.

Another idea: perhaps the Bbdim7 is acting as a diminished chord that can be from multiple keys.

Bbdim7 notes: Bb, Db, E, G. This is the same as Adim7, Cdim7, Ebdim7, F#dim7 because diminished chords are symmetric.

So Bbdim7 can be used as vii°7 of C major, or of A major, etc.

But in this case, we have chords like Gb major, which is Gb, Bb, Db. So if Bbdim7 is vii°7 of C major, then it should resolve to C major, but here it resolves to Gb major, which is not related.

Similarly, if Bbdim7 is vii°7 of A major, it should resolve to A major, but not to Gb.

So perhaps it is not functioning as vii°7.

Perhaps it is functioning as a passing chord between chords.

Let's list the chords that are not diminished: Gb major, Db minor, B major, E major.

Now, Gb major and Db minor are related? Db minor is the ii chord of Gb major? In Gb major, the ii chord is Ab minor, not Db minor. Db is the V chord in Gb major? In Gb major, V is Db major, not minor.

So Db minor is not diatonic to Gb major.

B major and E major are related? E major is the V of A major, but B major is the IV of E major? In E major, IV is A major, not B major. B major is the V of E major? In E major, V is B major, yes! So B major is the dominant of E major.

So in the progression, we have B major and then Emaj7, so B major to E major is a V-I progression in E major.

But in the progression, it is B/Bb to Emaj7/Ab, so not directly B to E, but with altered bass.

And before that, we have Dbm/Ab, which is Db minor with Ab bass, so Db minor chord.

Db minor is not directly related to E major.

But Db minor and B major might be related through chromaticism.

Db minor has Db, Fb, Ab. B major has B, D#, F#. So no direct relation.

Perhaps all these chords are related through the diminished chord.

Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G.

Now, Gb major has Gb, Bb, Db — so it shares Bb and Db.

Db minor has Db, Fb (E), Ab — so it shares Db and E.

B major has B, D#, F# — so it shares no common notes with Bbdim7? Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G. B major has B, D#, F#. So B is not Bb, E is not D#, G is not F#. So no common tones.

But in the progression, Bbdim7 goes to B/Bb, so with Bb bass, so the chord B major has B, which is a half step above Bb, so perhaps there is a chromatic move.

Similarly, Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D#, so E is in Bbdim7, so common E.

So from Bbdim7 to Emaj7/Ab, there is common E, but other notes change.

So perhaps the key is E major, since we have B major to Emaj7, which is V-I in E major.

But then what about the other chords? Gb major and Db minor don't fit in E major.

E major has four sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#. So chords like Gb major (Gb, Bb, Db) have all flats, so not in E major.

So unless it's modulated, but the progression has Gb major repeatedly.

Another thought: perhaps the Bb in the bass is the dominant of Eb major or something? But let's see.

Perhaps the key is Bb minor, and the chords are borrowed from other keys.

But let's list the scale degrees based on Bb minor.

Bb minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab? Harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A? So chords: i Bbm, ii° Cdim, III Db major, iv Ebm, V F major, VI Gb major, vii° Adim7? Adim7: A, C, Eb, Gb.

But we have Bbdim7, which is not diatonic to Bb minor. Bbdim7 would be the i dim? But i chord is minor, not diminished.

So not.

Perhaps Bb harmonic minor has A dim7 as vii°7, so Bbdim7 is not that.

Bbdim7 has notes Bb, Db, E, G. In Bb minor, the natural notes are Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,Gb,Ab? So E natural is not in the scale; it would be Fb? But Fb is E, so in Bb harmonic minor, the seventh is A natural, so scale: Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,Gb,A? So A natural, not E natural. So Bbdim7 has E natural, which is not in Bb minor.

So not Bb minor.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Cb major or something.

Cb major scale: Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bb? So notes: B, Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, Bb? Messy.

Cb major is enharmonic to B major, so let's use B major.

But then Gb major is not in B major.

I recall that in some progressions, diminished chords are used to connect chords a minor third apart.

Notice that Gb major and B major are a minor third apart? Gb to B is a major third? Gb to B is three semitones, which is a minor third? Gb to A is major second, to B is minor third? Gb to G is semitone, to A is whole step, to B is minor third? Yes, Gb to B is a minor third? But Gb to B is three semitones, which is a minor third? No, three semitones are a minor third? From Gb to A is two semitones? Gb to G is one semitone, Gb to Ab is two semitones, Gb to A is three semitones? Gb to A is three semitones? Gb to A is a major second? Let's calculate: Gb to G is 1, G to Ab is 2, Ab to A is 3? So from Gb to A is three semitones, which is a minor third? No, from G to B is three semitones, which is a minor third? G to B is two whole steps? G to A is whole step, A to B is whole step, so G to B is major third? No, G to B is two whole steps, which is major third? But in terms of semitones, G to G# is1, G# to A is2, A to A# is3, A# to B is4? So from G to B is four semitones? G to G# is1, G# to A is2, A to A# is3, A# to B is4? But A# is Bb, so from G to B natural, if G to G# is1, G# to A is2, A to Bb is3, Bb to B is4? So G to B is four semitones, which is a major third.

Similarly, from Gb to B: Gb to G is1, G to Ab is2, Ab to A is3, A to Bb is4, Bb to B is5? So Gb to B is five semitones, which is a perfect fourth? Gb to Cb is fourth? Gb to Cb is four semitones? Let's use piano keys.

Gb is the black key between F and G. So from Gb to B: Gb to G is1, G to G# is2, G# to A is3, A to A# is4, A# to B is5. So five semitones, which is a perfect fourth? From G to C is five semitones? G to G#1, to A2, to A#3, to B4, to C5, yes G to C is five semitones, perfect fourth. So Gb to B is five semitones, so Gb to B is a perfect fourth? But Gb to B is enharmonic to F# to B, which is a fourth? F# to B is four semitones? F# to G is1, G to G#2, G# to A3, A to A#4, A# to B5? No, F# to G is1, but G is not G#? Let's list: F# to G is1 semitone, G to G# is2, G# to A is3, A to A# is4, A# to B is5? So F# to B is5 semitones, perfect fourth. So Gb to B is same as F# to B, perfect fourth.

So Gb and B are not closely related.

Perhaps I should consider the mode based on the constant Bb bass.

So with Bb bass, the chords above are changing, so the harmony is over Bb pedal.

So the key might be Bb something, and the chords are various.

But what mode? Let's see the chords that are played over Bb.

When Bbdim7 is played, it has Bb, Db, E, G. So over Bb bass, the notes are Db, E, G, which are all above Bb.

When Gb/Bb is played, it has Gb, Db over Bb, so notes Gb, Bb, Db.

When B/Bb is played, it has B, D#, F# over Bb, so notes B, D#, F#, Bb.

When Emaj7/Ab is played, but bass is Ab, so not over Bb.

So for most parts, the bass is Bb, and the chords have notes that include Db, E, G, Gb, etc.

So the collection of notes over Bb bass: from Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G

From Gb/Bb: Bb, Db, Gb

From B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

So overall notes: Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, G, Gb? Gb is F#.

So let's list unique pitches: Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, G

But D# is Eb, and F# is Gb, so notes: Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G

So from Bb to B is semitone, B to Db is two semitones? B to C is1, C to Db is2? So B to Db is two semitones, minor second? But B to Db is diminished third? Anyway, we have B natural and Bb, so both.

Similarly, Db to Eb is whole step, Eb to E is semitone, E to Gb is semitone, Gb to G is semitone.

So the scale has Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G. So it has all notes except A and C? But we have Ab from other chords? From Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, we have Ab, but when bass is Ab, so not over Bb.

So over Bb pedal, the notes are from Bb to G, with chromatic notes between.

This looks like a diminished scale or something.

The notes Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G are part of the half-whole diminished scale on Bb? Let's see the half-whole diminished scale on Bb: Bb, B, Db, D, E, F, G, Ab? So from Bb: Bb, Cb? No, half-whole: Bb, Cb? But Cb is B, so Bb, B, Db, D, E, F, G, Ab? But we have Eb instead of D? Our notes have Eb and E, but no D? We have Db and Eb, so after Db, we have Eb, then E, so no D.

So not exactly.

Perhaps it's a chromatic scale fragment.

Another idea: perhaps the key is Gb major, and the Bb pedal is a pedal point, but then the chords should fit in Gb major, but Db minor and B major do not fit.

Let's list the chords without the bass pedal for a moment.

The chord changes are: Bbdim, Gb, Bbdim, Dbm, B, Bbdim, Gb, Bbdim, Emaj7, Bbdim.

So the sequence is: dim, Gb, dim, Dbm, B, dim, Gb, dim, Emaj7, dim.

So between dim chords, we have Gb, Dbm, B, Emaj7.

Now, Gb, Dbm, B, Emaj7.

Gb to Dbm is what? Gb major to Db minor. Gb and Db are fifth apart? Gb to Db is fifth below? Gb to Db is perfect fourth above? In terms of root movement, Gb to Db is down fifth or up fourth.

Similarly, Db to B is down minor third? Db to B is three semitones down? Db to C is1, C to B is2? Db to B is two semitones down? Db to C is1, C to B is2, so Db to B is two semitones down, which is major second? But roots: Db to B is minor third? Db to B is from Db to B natural: Db to D is1, D to D# is2, D# to E is3, E to F is4, F to F# is5, F# to G is6, G to G# is7, G# to A is8, A to A# is9, A# to B is10? No, from Db to B: Db to D is1 semitone, D to D# is2, D# to E is3, E to F is4, F to F# is5, F# to G is6, G to G# is7, G# to A is8, A to A# is9, A# to B is10? But Db to B is actually Db to C is1, C to B is2, so two semitones? Db to C is one semitone? Db to C is one semitone down? No, Db to C is one semitone down? Db is one semitone above C? So from Db to C is one semitone down, and from C to B is one semitone down, so from Db to B is two semitones down, which is a whole step, so major second.

But in terms of chord quality, Gb major to Db minor is not typical.

Then Db to B: Db minor to B major. Db to B is major second down? Db to B is two semitones down, so major second.

Then B to E: B major to E major, which is perfect fourth down or fifth up, so V-I in E major.

Then E to Bbdim? E major to Bbdim, which is not related.

So the only clear functional progression is B to E, which is V-I in E major.

So perhaps the key is E major, and the other chords are borrowed or passing.

But then the first part has Gb major, which is not in E major.

E major has chords like E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim.

So Gb major is not in E major.

Gb major is enharmonic to F# major, which is the II of E major? In E major, II would be F# minor, not major. So not.

Perhaps it's a modal mixture from E minor or something.

Another idea: perhaps the constant Bb dim is actually a dominant chord in C minor or something.

Let's consider that Bbdim7 is the same as G7b9 without the root? G7b9 has G, B, D, F, Ab. So notes G, B, D, F, Ab. Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G. So if we take Bbdim7, it is the same as G7b9 if we consider G as root? But G7b9 has B, D, F, Ab, and Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G. So common G, but Bb vs B, Db vs D, E vs F, so not the same.

Bbdim7 is the same as Adim7, Cdim7, Ebdim7, F#dim7, so it can be vii°7 of A, C, Eb, F#.

So if it is vii°7 of A, it should resolve to A major or A minor.

In the progression, it resolves to Gb major, which is not A.

Similarly for C, it should resolve to C, but not.

For Eb, it should resolve to Eb, but we have Gb, which is not Eb.

For F#, it should resolve to F# major, which is Gb major? F# major is enharmonic to Gb major! Yes!

So if Bbdim7 is vii°7 of F# major, then it should resolve to F# major. And in the progression, it resolves to Gb major, which is enharmonic to F# major! So yes!

So Bbdim7 is functioning as the vii°7 of Gb major (F# major), and it resolves to Gb major.

Similarly, in other places, it resolves to Gb major.

But in the progression, it also goes to Dbm and B major etc.

But let's see the resolution to Gb major: when Bbdim7 goes to Gb/Bb, it resolves to Gb major with first inversion, but since the bass is Bb, it's still resolution to tonic.

So in this case, for the Gb major sections, the key is Gb major.

But then what about the Dbm/Ab and B/Bb?

Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord. In Gb major, the chord on Db is Db major, not minor. So Db minor is borrowed from somewhere? Perhaps from Gb minor? Gb minor would have Db major as V? Let's see Gb minor: Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb, Db, Ebb, Fb? So chords: i Gbm, ii° Abdim, III Bbb major, iv Cbm, V Db major, VI Ebb major, vii° Fbdim? So Db major, not minor. So Db minor is not from Gb minor.

Perhaps it is from Db minor itself.

But then how does it fit?

After Dbm/Ab, we have B/Bb, which is B major with Bb bass.

Then after that, we have Bbdim to Gb/Bb again.

So perhaps there is a modulation.

Let's consider the B/Bb chord. B major with Bb bass. This could be seen as a dominant chord with a flat 9? B major is B, D#, F#. With Bb bass, it might be B7b9 or something? B7b9 would be B, D#, F#, A, C? But here we have B, D#, F# with Bb, so if Bb is the flat 9, then it would be B7b9, but B7 has A, which is not here? So without the A, it's just B major with added Bb, which is the flat 9.

So B/Bb could be interpreted as B7b9 without the seventh? But typically, a dominant 7b9 chord has the seventh, so here it might be implied.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, so E major with Ab bass, which could be E7b9? E7b9 would be E, G#, B, D, F? But here it's Emaj7, so with D# instead of D, so it's major seventh, not dominant seventh. So Emaj7 has D#, which is the major seventh, so it's not dominant; it's tonic or something.

But in the progression, it comes after Bbdim, and then Bbdim again, so perhaps Emaj7 is a tonic chord.

But if Emaj7 is tonic, then the key is E major, and B/Bb is the dominant with flat 9, so B7b9 to E major, which is a common jazz progression.

So in this case, for the last part, we have Bbdim then Emaj7/Ab then Bbdim.

But Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, which is the flat 9 of the dominant? If B7b9 to E, then the B7b9 has B, D#, F#, A, C? But in B/Bb, we have B, D#, F#, Bb, so missing A, but Bb is the flat 9, so it might be B7b9 without the A, or the A is omitted.

Then Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, so if Emaj7 is the tonic, why Ab bass? Ab is the flat 9 of G? Not sure.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is actually functioning as a substitute for something else.

Another thought: in the progression, we have Dbm/Ab before B/Bb. Dbm/Ab is Db minor with Ab bass, so it's first inversion Db minor. Db minor and B major might be related through tritone substitution.

In jazz, the tritone substitute of the dominant is used. So if the dominant is B7, its tritone substitute is F7? But here we have Db minor, which is not F7.

B7 has notes B, D#, F#, A. Its tritone substitute is F7, which has F, A, C, Eb? So Db minor has Db, Fb, Ab, which is Db, E, Ab. So no direct relation.

Perhaps Db minor is the ii chord of something.

Let's list the roots: Gb, Db, B, E.

Gb to Db is down fifth, Db to B is down major second, B to E is down fifth? So root movement: down fifth, down major second, down fifth.

So from Gb to Db is like IV to I in Db major? But Gb is IV of Db major? In Db major, IV is Gb major? Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C? So IV is Gb major, yes! So in Db major, IV is Gb major.

Then from Db to B? Db to B is not in Db major.

After Db, we have B, which is not in Db major.

Then from B to E, which is V-I in E major.

So perhaps there is a modulation from Db major to E major.

But then what about the diminished chords? The diminished chords are on Bb, which is not in Db major or E major.

In Db major, the V is Ab major, so Bb is not V.

In E major, B is V, so Bb is not.

So still not.

Perhaps the key is not traditional, and it's based on a mode or atonal.

But let's look at the title or context? The user didn't provide any context, so I need to find from the chords.

Another idea: perhaps the Bbdim is not a chord but a passing sound, and the real harmony is from the other chords.

But let's listen to the progression in my mind.

Suppose we have Bb pedal throughout, and the chords change.

When Bbdim7 is played, it sounds tense because it's diminished.

When Gb/Bb is played, it sounds more stable because it's major.

Similarly, when B/Bb is played, it sounds dissonant because of the Bb against B.

When Emaj7/Ab is played, it sounds stable but with Ab bass, so might be tense.

So the stable points are Gb/Bb and Emaj7? But Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, so not over Bb.

So when bass is Bb, Gb/Bb sounds stable, so perhaps Gb major is the tonic.

Then when bass moves to Ab, we have Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, so perhaps then the tonic is E major? But then it returns to Bbdim with Bb bass.

So perhaps there are two keys: Gb major when bass is Bb, and E major when bass is Ab.

But then how to determine the overall key?

Perhaps the mode is based on the Bb pedal with changing chords, so the mode is Bb something.

Let's list the scale from the notes over Bb.

From earlier, notes over Bb: from Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G

From Gb/Bb: Bb, Db, Gb

From B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

So the notes are: Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, G, Gb? But Gb is F#, so let's use one name.

So notes: Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, F#, G

So if we consider Bb as tonic, the scale has: 1 Bb, 2 B? but B is sharp 1? So chromatic.

The intervals from Bb: minor second? B natural is major second? B natural is actually Cb? But let's use scale degrees.

If Bb is tonic, then the notes are: b2? B natural is not b2; b2 would be Cb, which is B? So B natural is enharmonic to Cb, so b2? But then Db is b3? Eb is 4? E is #4? F# is #5? G is 6? So scale: 1, b2, b3, 4, #4, #5, 6? But #4 and #5 are augmented, so it's like a altered scale or something.

But then when Gb/Bb is played, the notes are Bb, Db, Gb, so 1, b3, b6? So it's like Bb minor with b6? But Bb minor would have Bb, Db, F, so here Gb instead of F, so it's Bb minor with b6? But b6 is Gb, so yes, so Gb/Bb is first inversion of Gb major, but over Bb bass, it sounds like Bb minor with b6.

Similarly, Bbdim7 over Bb bass sounds like Bb diminished, which is tense.

B/Bb over Bb bass sounds like B major with Bb, so it has B and Bb, so major and minor second, so dissonant.

So perhaps the overall key is Bb minor, but with borrowed chords.

But in Bb minor, the natural chord is Bbm, which has Bb, Db, F. But here we have Gb instead of F, so it's using the harmonic minor or something.

In Bb harmonic minor, the scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A? So chords: i Bbm, ii° Cdim, III Db major, iv Ebm, V F major, VI Gb major, vii° Adim7.

So indeed, Gb major is the VI chord in Bb harmonic minor.

And Bbdim7 is not diatonic, but if we consider Bbdim7, it has Bb, Db, E, G. But in Bb harmonic minor, we have A natural, not E natural. So Bbdim7 has E natural, which is not in the scale.

So not.

Perhaps it's Bb phrygian or something.

Let's give up on traditional key and think about the mode from the constant notes.

Notice that in the progression, the chords Bbdim and Gb/Bb are prominent, and Bbdim has E natural, and Gb has Gb, so over Bb bass, the notes include E and Gb.

So the scale might be Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab? But we have G natural from Bbdim7? Bbdim7 has G natural, so from Bb, Db, E, G, so G natural.

So scale: Bb, Db, E, G? So that's a diminished scale on Bb? Bb, Db, E, G is a diminished seventh chord, so it's symmetric.

So over Bb pedal, the harmony is using the diminished scale occasionally.

But when Gb/Bb is played, it uses Gb, Bb, Db, which is from the whole tone scale or something.

This is not helping.

Perhaps the key is Gb major, and the Bb pedal is just a pedal point, and the diminished chord is passing.

In Gb major, the notes are Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

So when Bbdim7 is played, it has Bb, Db, E, G. But E is not in Gb major; Cb is B, so E is not B; E is between Eb and F? So E is not in the scale.

So Bbdim7 introduces E and G, which are foreign to Gb major.

So it's chromatic.

Similarly, when Dbm/Ab is played, Dbm has Db, Fb, Ab, but Fb is E, so same E, so it's consistent with the E from Bbdim7.

So perhaps the E is a common tone.

Similarly, when B/Bb is played, it has B, D#, F#, so B and D# and F#, which are not in Gb major, but B is Cb? Cb is B, so B is in Gb major? Gb major has Cb, which is B, so yes, B is in Gb major! Cb is B, so the note B is in Gb major as Cb.

But in B/Bb, we have B natural, which is Cb, so it's the same note.

But B major chord has B, D#, F#. In Gb major, D# is not in the scale; the scale has Eb, which is D#? Eb is D#? No, Eb is E flat, which is D#? In terms of pitch, Eb and D# are the same note? In equal temperament, yes, but in notation, they are different, but sound the same.

So in Gb major, the scale has Eb, which is D#? Eb is the same as D#? So yes, Eb is enharmonic to D#.

So B major chord has B, D#, F#. In Gb major, B is Cb, D# is Eb, and F# is Gb? So B major chord is enharmonic to Cb, Eb, Gb? But Cb, Eb, Gb is not a chord in Gb major; in Gb major, the chord on Cb is Cb major, which is Cb, Eb, Gb? Yes! Cb major is Cb, Eb, Gb, which is exactly the notes of B major chord? B, D#, F# is enharmonic to Cb, Eb, Gb? So yes! So B major chord is the same as Cb major chord.

And in Gb major, the IV chord is Cb major! So B major is actually the IV chord of Gb major!

Similarly, Gb major is I, so when we have Gb/Bb, it's I with third in bass.

And when we have B/Bb, it's IV with Bb bass? But IV chord should be Cb major, which is B major, so B/Bb is IV chord with Bb bass? But Bb is not in the IV chord; IV chord has Cb, Eb, Gb, so Bb is not a chord tone, so with Bb bass, it's IV with added bass note, which might be a suspension or something.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord. In Gb major, the chord on Db is Db major, not minor. So Db minor is not diatonic. But if we consider Db minor, it has Db, Fb, Ab. Fb is E, which is not in Gb major? Gb major has F natural, so Fb is E, which is not F, so it's chromatic.

But from earlier, Bbdim7 has E, so E is used in both Bbdim7 and Dbm, so it's consistent.

So in Gb major, the use of E natural is chromatic.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th with Ab bass. E major 7th has E, G#, B, D#. In Gb major, E is not in the scale, G# is Ab? G# is Ab? Yes, G# is Ab, so G# is in Gb major as Ab? But Ab is in Gb major as the second scale degree? So G# is Ab, so that's fine. B is Cb, which is in Gb major, D# is Eb, which is in Gb major. So Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D# which is E, Ab, Cb, Eb. But E is not in Gb major; Gb major has F and Gb, so E is between Eb and F? So E is not in the scale. So Emaj7 introduces E natural, which is foreign.

But from earlier, E natural is already used in Bbdim7 and Dbm, so it's a common chromatic tone.

So overall, if we consider Gb major as the key, then the chords Bbdim7, Dbm, and Emaj7 are chromatic chords that use the E natural note.

So the key is Gb major, but with chromaticism.

And the mode is Gb major, but with occasional use of E natural.

So the scale might be Gb major with raised fourth? But E natural is the raised fourth? In Gb major, the fourth is Cb, so raised fourth would be C? But E natural is not C; let's see the scale degrees.

In Gb major, the notes are: 1 Gb, 2 Ab, 3 Bb, 4 Cb, 5 Db, 6 Eb, 7 F.

So E natural is between Eb and F, so it's like a sharp 6? Eb is 6, so sharp 6 would be E? But E natural is actually Fb? So it's enharmonic to Fb, but in terms of scale, if we use E natural, it would be #6? But in major scale, #6 is used in harmonic major or something.

So perhaps the mode is Gb major with #6? But #6 would be E natural, yes.

But in the chords, when we have Bbdim7, it has E natural, and when we have Dbm, it has E natural (Fb), and when we have Emaj7, it has E natural, so yes, E natural is frequently used.

So the scale is Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, E, F? But then between Db and E, there is a gap, and between E and F, there is a semitone, so it's not a standard scale.

Perhaps it's the Gb melodic minor scale? Gb melodic minor: Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb, Db, Eb, F? So Bbb is A, and Eb is Eb, so no E natural.

So not.

Another possibility: since Bb is constantly in the bass, and the key is Gb major, the Bb is the mediant, so it's not unusual to have pedal on the mediant.

So I think the key is Gb major.

And the mode is Gb major, but with chromatic alterations.

So for the purpose of this problem, I'll say the key is Gb major.

But let's confirm with the last chord Emaj7/Ab. If key is Gb major, then Emaj7 is not diatonic, but as we saw, it is enharmonic to something? Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D# which is E, Ab, Cb, Eb. So in Gb major, this is like the IV chord with an added E? But IV chord is Cb major: Cb, Eb, Gb. So Emaj7 has E, Ab, Cb, Eb. So it has Ab instead of Gb, and E instead of Cb? So it's different.

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant or something.

But in the progression, it comes after Bbdim, and then to Bbdim, so it might be a passing chord.

So I think Gb major is the best bet.

So the key is Gb major.

And the mode is major.

So for the answer, key of Gb major.

But let's see the initial chord: Bbdim. In Gb major, Bb is the third, so Bbdim is not diatonic, but it can be used as a passing chord.

So I'll go with that.

The chord progression features a constant Bb pedal point throughout most of the sequence, with chords changing over this bass note. The recurring Gb/Bb chords (first inversion of Gb major) suggest that Gb major is the tonal center, despite the presence of chromatic chords like Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, and Emaj7/Ab. These chromatic chords introduce notes such as E natural, which is not diatonic to Gb major but is used consistently as a common tone, adding color and tension. The progression resolves to Gb major at points, reinforcing it as the key.

Thus, the key is **Gb major**, and the mode is **major**. The chromaticism does not alter the overall major mode but adds expressive harmony.
