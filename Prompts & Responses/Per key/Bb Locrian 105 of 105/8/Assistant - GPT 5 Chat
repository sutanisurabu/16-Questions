Let's take this step by step.

### The progression:
```
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim
```

### 1. **Look at the chord tones**

**Bbdim** = Bb – Db – E (enharmonically same as Fb) – G♭ implied by full dim7  
→ Notes: Bb, Db, E, G  

**Gb/Bb** = Gb major triad over Bb bass  
→ Notes: Gb, Bb, Db  

**Dbm/Ab** = Db minor triad over Ab  
→ Notes: Db, Fb (E), Ab  

**B/Bb** = B major over Bb  
→ Notes: B, D#, F#, Bb  

**Emaj7/Ab** = E–G#–B–D# over Ab  
→ Notes: E, G#, B, D#, Ab  

---

### 2. **Collect all the pitch content**
From all chords combined we see:
**Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, Gb, G, G#, Ab**

Enharmonically simplifying (and noting enharmonic choices):
Bb/A#, B, Db/C#, D#/Eb, E, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab.

That’s a lot of chromaticism — probably not one diatonic key.

---

### 3. **Look for most stable “center”**
The chord **Bbdim** occurs the most — it’s almost every bar.

A diminished triad or seventh often leads to a chord a half-step above (C7, or B major/Gb major, etc.), but here it doesn’t resolve conventionally. The repetition suggests **Bbdim is functioning as a tonicized color or pivot**.

---

### 4. **Check relationships**
- **Gb/Bb** → shares Bb and Db with Bbdim.  
  So the dim–major alternation occurs between **Bbdim** and **Gb/Bb**, sharing 2 notes (Bb and Db). The note E in the dim moves to Gb in the major: E→Gb — that’s a smooth, chromatic move.

- **Dbm/Ab**: also shares Db with both main chords, but brings in an Ab (a semitone below Bb).  
- **Emaj7/Ab** seen near the end, adds an E major flavor.

This suggests a **symmetrical / chromatic** sequence rather than a diatonic one.

---

### 5. **Functional/Modal interpretation**
Because all the chords emphasize **Bb–Db–E(Gb)**, with limited stepwise root motion and mostly diminished movement, this feels **not diatonic**, but rather **built on diminished symmetry**.

Diminished collections divide the octave into four equal parts: **Bb–Db–E–G**.  
That corresponds to the **whole–half diminished scale** built on Bb:
**Bb Cb Db D E F G Ab**, or enharmonically **Bb B Db D E F G Ab**.

That set includes many notes we find in the progression.

---

✅ **Therefore:**
The harmonic environment is best described as **Bb whole–half diminished**, or **Bb diminished scale**.  
If you want to name it as a “key”, you could say:

> **Key center:** Bb  
> **Mode:** whole–half diminished (synthetic/octatonic) scale.

### 6. **Summary answer**

| Aspect | Determination |
|--------|---------------|
| **Tonal Center** | Bb |
| **Scale/Mode** | Bb diminished (whole–half) / octatonic |
| **Character** | Symmetrical diminished harmony, non-diatonic, chromatic color progression |

---

If you were to hear it, it would likely sound tense, mysterious, and symmetrical rather than tonal in a major or minor sense — a classic diminished / octatonic environment centered on **Bb**.
