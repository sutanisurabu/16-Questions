The provided chord progression is: **Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**

This progression is highly unusual and doesn't fit standard diatonic (major/minor) or even simple modal conventions easily. However, a pattern emerges:

1.  **Tonal Center Focus:** The chord **Bbdim** is prominent, appearing 11 times. The bass note is almost always **Bb** (except for the passing bass notes in the fraction chords). This strongly suggests that **Bb** is the tonic or a central tonal foundation.
2.  **Diminished Quality:** The prevalence of diminished chords (Bbdim and Dbm) indicates a sound palette drawing from minor, harmonic minor, or more exotic scales.
3.  **Analyzing Bb Diminished:** The notes of **Bbdim** are Bb - Db - E (or Fb) - Gbb (or Ebb). This triad (Bb-Db-E) is the diminished triad built on Bb.

### Evaluation of Potential Key/Mode Based on Chord Tones:

Let's list the unique notes from the core chords (ignoring bass notes for a moment, focusing on chord quality):

*   **Bbdim:** Bb, Db, E
*   **Gb:** Gb, Bb, Db (Notes: Gb, Bb, Db)
*   **Dbm:** Db, Fb (E), Gbb (F double flat) (Notes: Db, E, Gbb)
*   **Emaj7:** E, G#, B, D#

The full set of unique notes used in the progression is: **Bb, Db, E, Gb, G#, B, D#** (and we can confirm Fb $\rightarrow$ E, Gbb $\rightarrow$ F).

The collection of notes contains a diminished arpeggio (Bb, Db, E) and a complex combination of other notes. The presence of **both Db and D#, and both E and G#** is highly characteristic of non-diatonic or highly chromatic music.

### The Most Likely Key/Mode:

Given the strong emphasis on **Bb** as the root, and the pervasive use of the **diminished** sound, we must look for a scale that generates a diminished chord on the tonic.

The most famous scale to generate a diminished tonic chord is the **Locrian** mode, or more frequently, the **Locrian Natural 2** mode.

1.  **Bb Locrian:** Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab (Tonic Bb minor triad) - *Does not fit the E (raised fifth) in Bbdim.*
2.  **Bb Harmonic Minor:** Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A (Tonic minor triad) - *Does not fit the E (raised fifth) in Bbdim.*

The scale that perfectly contains the **Bb diminished triad (Bb-Db-E)** is the **Diminished Scale** (also known as the octatonic scale).

#### Option 1: Bb Half-Whole Diminished Scale

*   **Scale:** Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, F#, G, A
*   **Analysis:** This scale contains Bbdim (Bb-Db-E) and Dbm (Db-E-G), but it is missing Gb, G#, B, and D#. The chords Gb and Emaj7/Ab are therefore not diatonic to this scale.

#### Option 2: Bb $\downarrow$ Whole-Half Diminished Scale

*   **Scale:** Bb, C#, D, E, F, G, G#, A# (If played as Bb, C#, D, E, F, G, Ab, Bb)
*   **This does not seem to fit well either.**

#### Option 3: Phrygian Dominant (or Modified Phrygian)

Phrygian Dominant would be Db - Eb - F - Gb - Ab - Bb - Cb. This is the **5th mode of Harmonic Minor**, which often has a diminished iv chord, but not a diminished tonic.

### Conclusion Based on Jazz/Chromatic Harmony:

In highly chromatic or jazz contexts, when a diminished chord dominates an entire progression, the music is often analyzed as being *in* the key of the diminished chord, using the **Diminished Scale** as the primary source material, with the other chords being chromatic substitutions or voice-leading figures.

However, the chords Gb (major) and Emaj7 (major/major seventh) clash strongly with a simple diminished scale. The resulting sound is highly *polymodal* or *atonal* but anchored by the pitch Bb.

*   The movement $\text{Bbdim} \rightarrow \text{Gb}$ is a common classical voice-leading move where the diminished root drops by a tritone (Bb to E, or Bb to Gb).
*   The inclusion of **Emaj7** (E, G#, B, D#) introduces the notes that create a strong chromatic contrast and are key components for the Db/Eb $\rightarrow$ D#/E contrast mentioned earlier.

Given the overwhelming repetition and placement, the key is centered on **Bb**. Given the sound palette, the mode is highly chromatic, borrowing heavily from the diminished scale and other elements.

**Most Precise Answer:**

*   **Key:** **Bb** (due to the overwhelming number of chords rooted on Bb), though it functions more as a tonal center than a traditional tonic.
*   **Mode:** **Chromatic/Atonal/Diminished**. This style does not strictly adhere to one mode but uses **Bb Diminished** as its primary harmonic structure, often associated with the **Diminished Scale** or other scales that offer that color. The progression is best defined by the **Bb Diminished** quality.
