## 2. Identify enharmonics and chord qualities

- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–Fb(E)  
  Diminished triad, or could be part of a diminished 7th chord (Bbdim7 = Bb–Db–Fb–G).

- **Gb/Bb** = Gb–Bb–Db (Gb major triad, first inversion).  
  Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db.

- **Dbm/Ab** = Db–Fb–Ab (Dbm minor triad, second inversion).  
  Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab.

- **B/Bb** = B–D#–F# over Bb bass.  
  This is a polychord or slash chord: B major triad over Bb bass.  
  Notes: Bb + B–D#–F# = Bb, B, D#, F# → messy, possibly a chromatic passing chord.

- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G#–B–D# with Ab bass.  
  Notes: Ab + E–G#–B–D# = Ab, E, G#, B, D#.  
  This is an E major 7 chord over Ab bass.

---

## 3. Look for functional relationships

Bbdim is vii° in Cb major (or B major), but also appears as common-tone diminished or leading-tone diminished in various keys.

Gb major is Gb–Bb–Db.  
Dbm is Db–Fb–Ab.  
These two chords (Gb and Dbm) are IV and i in **Db minor** (if natural minor) or could be bVI and iv in another key.

---

## 4. Try to find a key center

Let’s check **Db minor** (key signature: Cb major = 7 flats):  
- Gb major = IV  
- Dbm = i  
- Bbdim = ? In Db minor: Bb–Db–Fb–G = viidim7 (G is G natural in harmonic minor? No, Db harmonic minor has Cb and B natural, not Bb. So Bbdim7 doesn’t fit Db harmonic minor naturally unless Bbdim is Bb–Db–Fb–Abb(G) which is enharmonic to Gdim7? Let’s check: Gdim7 = G–Bb–Db–Fb. Yes! Gdim7 = Bbdim7 = Dbdim7 = Edim7 (all same diminished 7th chord). So Bbdim7 is symmetric.)

So Bbdim7 could be Gdim7, functioning as vii°7 of Ab minor/major. But Ab isn’t present except in Dbm/Ab.

---

## 5. Look at the B/Bb chord

B major = B–D#–F#. Over Bb bass: Bb + B–D#–F# = Bb, B, D#, F#.  
That’s a very dissonant cluster: semitone Bb–B, augmented 2nd Bb–D# etc.  
Could be a **tritone sub** of something? B major is tritone away from F (V of Bb). But here bass is Bb, so maybe it’s a **German augmented sixth chord** in Db minor?  
Spell Bb–D#–F#–(A?) no A here. But B–D#–F# is E#–Gx–B#? No.  
Let’s respell: B = Cb? No.  
Actually, B major triad = B–D#–F#. Over Bb bass, maybe it’s **Bb7#9** without the 5th? Bb7#9 = Bb–D–F–Ab–Cb(B). But here we have D# not D, F# not F. So not exactly.  

Maybe it’s a **dominant chord with #5 and b5**? Bb–D#–F#–B = Bb–E–F#–B? Messy. Possibly just a chromatic approach chord.

---

## 6. Check Emaj7/Ab

Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D#. Over Ab bass: Ab + E–G#–B–D#.  
Ab–E = major 6th; Ab–G# = minor 7th? Actually Ab–G# is a minor 7th interval.  
This is like **AbmMaj7(add6)**? No, Abm would have Cb, not E.  
It’s an **E major triad over Ab**, so maybe a **tritone substitution** of Bb7 (V of Eb).  
E7 is tritone away from Bb7. Emaj7 is similar but major 7 instead of b7.  
So Emaj7/Ab could be a lydian sound: E lydian #9? Not standard.

---

## 7. Try key of **Gb major** (6 flats)

Gb major: Gb–Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F.  
Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb(E) → Fb = E, not in Gb major scale (Gb major has F natural). So Bbdim is not diatonic to Gb major.  
But Bbdim7 = Bb–Db–Fb–G = fully diminished, could be common-tone diminished to Gb (Gb–Bb–Db shared with Gb chord). Yes! Bbdim often used as CT°7 of Gb: notes Bb–Db–Fb–G, where Gb chord is Gb–Bb–Db, two common tones (Bb, Db), other notes Fb= E (leading tone to F? not in key) and G (b9 of Gb?).

---

## 8. Try **E major / C# minor**

Bbdim7 = Gdim7 = vii°7 of Ab minor, not closely related to E major. But Emaj7/Ab could be a borrowed chord?  
But Gb major = F# major enharmonic. F# major: F#–G#–A#–B–C#–D#–E#.  
Bbdim = A#dim? A#dim7 = A#–C#–E–G = vii°7 of B major. Yes! That’s it:  
Bbdim7 = A#dim7 in B major / C# minor.  

Let’s test:  
In **C# minor** (harmonic minor): A#dim7 = vii°7.  
Gb major? Gb = F# major? No, Gb major ≠ F# major enharmonically but Gb chord in C# minor? Gb = F# = ? Wait, Gb is F#? No, Gb is G-flat, F# is F-sharp, same pitch but different spelling.  
Gb major in C# minor context? That’s bVI in C# minor (Gb = F# major chord? No, F# major is F#–A#–C#, Gb major is Gb–Bb–Db = F#–A#–C# enharmonically! Yes exactly! So Gb major = F# major = bVI in C# minor (common in rock minor key)).  
Dbm = C#m = i chord. Yes! Dbm/Ab = C#m/G#.  
B/Bb = B major/F#? Wait B/Bb = B major with Bb bass = A# bass? Enharmonic to A#–B–D#–F#? That’s messy.  
Emaj7/Ab = E–G#–B–D# over Ab = G# bass? Enharmonic to Emaj7/G# which is V/vi in G# minor? Not fitting C# minor simply.

---

## 9. Likely conclusion

The progression strongly suggests **C# minor** (enharmonic to Dbm but here mixed spellings).  
Why?  
- Dbm = i  
- Gb (F#) = bVI  
- Bbdim = A#dim = vii°7 of C# minor (harmonic)  
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# = V of A#m? Not standard but could be a borrowed dominant from A# minor (iii of F# major?).

But the mix of Bb dim and Gb and Dbm fits C# minor:  
i (Dbm) – bVI (Gb) – vii°7 (Bbdim) – and B/Bb is a chromatic passing chord.

---

## 10. Final answer

**Key:** C# minor (or enharmonically Dbm, but given Gb and Dbm spelling, it’s probably written in flats but tonally C# minor).  
**Mode:** natural/harmonic minor mixture.
