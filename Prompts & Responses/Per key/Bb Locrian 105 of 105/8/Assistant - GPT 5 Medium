### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequence**

I need to figure out the key and mode from the sequence of chord symbols: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim."

Okay, so we've got a mix of various chords like Bbdim, which is a diminished triad (Bb-Db-Fb, where Fb is enharmonically E). Gb/Bb indicates a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. For Dbm/Ab, it’s a Db minor over Ab. I’ll dive deeper into each chord to determine their roles in the progression!**Finding tonal center**

I see there's a lot of flats in this sequence, which could point to a Gb major context. The chord Gb/Bb has the notes Gb, Bb, and Db while Dbm includes Fb. For Emaj7, the notes are E, G#, B, and D#. It seems like D# and Eb are enharmonically related, and Emaj7/Ab gives the Ab in the bass with a structure of E major 7.

I’m noticing that we should find a likely tonal center. The repeated "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb" suggests a vamp between those chords. In Gb major, Bbdim might correlate to a specific scale degree. Let’s explore that!**Analyzing Gb major chords**

In Gb major, Bb is scale degree 3. The scale notes are Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, returning to Gb. The Bbdim chord comprises Bb, Db, and Fb, where Bb is indeed the third scale degree. However, Fb, which is enharmonically E natural, isn’t part of the Gb major scale because Gb major has F natural instead.

I notice that Bbdim isn’t diatonic to Gb major. The Gb/Bb chord fits perfectly within the scale, but Db minor (Db Fb Ab) also includes Fb, which makes it non-diatonic too!**Exploring Db minor and modal mixture**

The Db minor chord suggests there's a borrowed parallel minor mixture at play. In Gb major, the v minor would typically be Db minor, possibly derived from Gb minor. However, I’m also considering the key of Ab minor. 

In that scale, the chords are Abm, Bbdim, and Dbm. Here, Bbdim functions as ii° and appears promising with its relation to other chords. Emaj7/Ab could be seen as VImaj7 over the tonic bass, which creates a nice color. 

Hmm, Gb/Bb in this context might just be a second inversion of the VII chord!**Determining key and mode**

I’ve noticed that Gb/Bb is Gb major over a Bb bass, which is unusual in Ab minor where Bb is the second scale degree. In functional minor, the VII chord is Gb major. When analyzing G# minor, I find an enharmonic relationship: Bbdim is A#dim, and the other chords also match up. 

After analyzing the chords, it becomes clear that the piece is centered around G# minor (enharmonic to Ab minor) and follows the Aeolian mode. The key is G# minor, with its mode being natural minor, or Aeolian. 

I’ll keep it concise and present the key as G# minor (or Ab minor), and note it’s in the Aeolian mode.

G# minor (enharmonic: Ab minor), in the natural minor (Aeolian) mode.
