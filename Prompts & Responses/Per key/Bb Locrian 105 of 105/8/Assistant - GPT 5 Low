### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to figure out the key and mode from the chord symbols provided: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim."

The recurring chords are Bbdim, Gb/Bb, and Dbm/Ab, which is a Db minor triad with Ab in the bass. The B/Bb chord is peculiar, as it indicates a B major triad over a Bb bass. Emaj7/Ab features an Ab bass with an Emaj7 chord. The Bbdim can imply a diminished seventh chord, but I'm uncertain about its exact form, whether it's typically considered a triad or a seventh.**Examining chord functions**

Given the chord progression, it seems that Bbdim could act as a passing chord to Gb/Bb. The Gb/Bb chord is likely a first inversion of the Gb major triad since Bb is in the bass. This means Bbdim might function as a connecting chord leading to Gb major.

In the key of Gb major, the scale includes Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F, making the leading tone F natural. However, the notes in Bbdim are Bb, Db, and Fb. In Gb major, Bb is the third degree, while Bbdim could potentially be a chord built on the third degree instead of the seventh.**Understanding chord relationships**

In Gb major, the third degree is Bb, which forms a minor triad (Bbm), not a diminished one like Bbdim. Since Bbdim isn't diatonic to Gb major, it could still act as a decorative common-tone diminished chord leading to Gb. 

Now, considering Dbm/Ab, this would suggest a borrowed minor v chord, although in Gb major, the dominant is actually Db major. The Emaj7/Ab chord adds complexity since E major isn’t diatonic to Gb major but behaves interestingly in this context. So, I’m observing how these chords interact!**Analyzing B major enharmonically**

Let’s consider the key of B major and how some chords can convert enharmonically. For example, Gb relates to F# in this key, where F# is the V chord. The IV in B major is E, and since Gb converts to F#, the Gb/Bb chord becomes F#/A#.

Now, transforming chords to sharp keys makes analysis easier. Bbdim becomes A# diminished (A# C# E), while Gb/Bb is represented as F#/A#. Dbm/Ab translates to C# minor over G#, and B/Bb changes to B over A#. This process simplifies our understanding!**Exploring key relationships and chord functions**

Considering the chord B over A# suggests a tritone. The Emaj7/Ab chord indicates a key centered on F# major, especially with the F#/A# chord recurring. There’s also a notable pattern of alternating bass notes between Bb and Ab.

In this context, the Bbdim chord acts as a chromatic lower neighbor to the Gb chord, providing a diminished flavor. As we trace these relationships, the focus shifts to determining whether we're solidly in Gb major or flirting with E major standards—it's plausible that E major fits better, given the roles of the chords involved!**Determining the key and mode**

I’m recognizing that A# serves as a leading tone to B in E major, while B/A# acts as a V chord with its leading tone in the bass. The alternation between G# and A# in E major seems to indicate a standard chromatic progression. 

After assessing the chords, I conclude the key is E major in the Ionian mode, supporting tonal relationships with clear progressions. The presence of Emaj7 strengthens the idea that E major is the tonic throughout this analysis!

Key: E major
Mode: Ionian (major)

Why: Reading enharmonically, the progression centers on G# and A# in the bass with functions around E major:
- Bbdim ≈ A#° (vii°/V)
- Gb/Bb ≈ F#/A# (V/V in first inversion)
- Dbm/Ab ≈ C#m/G# (vi in first inversion)
- B/Bb ≈ B/A# (V over its leading tone)
- Emaj7/Ab ≈ Emaj7/G# (Imaj7 in first inversion)

This points clearly to E major.
