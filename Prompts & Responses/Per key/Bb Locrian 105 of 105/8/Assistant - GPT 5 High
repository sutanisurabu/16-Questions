### Reasoning

**Analyzing chords and inversions**

Okay, so the Gb triad is made up of Gb, Bb, and Db, and the first inversion has Bb in the bass. That confirms Gb/Bb is indeed the first inversion. For Dbm/Ab, the Db minor triad is Db, Fb, Ab, and having Ab in the bass means it's in second inversion. 

Now with B/Bb, the major triad is B, D#, and F#, which sounds quite crunchy. As for Emaj7/Ab, that has E, G#, B, and D# over Ab. This is turning into an interesting mixture with these notes!**Exploring octatonic scales**

I'm trying to figure out how the set D# and F# relates to Eb, where D# equals Eb and F# is the enharmonic equivalent of Gb. Looking at an octatonic scale starting on Bb, I see the notes: Bb, B, Db, D, E, F, G, Ab. These notes include E (or Fb), but it seems F# (or Gb) is missing.  

I also checked another octatonic variant starting on Bb, which includes Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, F#, G, and A, but it doesn’t have B either. Let's try the octatonic starting on B— that gives me B, C, D, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, and A. This last scale contains all the necessary notes I'm after!**Examining chord relationships**

I'm wondering if this chord set includes Bb and Db. DB is not present but it contains D, so I think that rules it out. Maybe it's related to a tritone substitution with a Bb diminished chord leading to B? Typically, a Bb diminished seventh resolves to B minor or Cb major. 

Wait— Bbdim triad has Bb, Db, and Fb, but can that be interpreted differently? The Bbdim fits well in the context of the Gb major scale instead. In E major, we see that our B chord serves as the dominant, while Db minor aligns with C# minor, being the sixth in E major. Also, Gb relates to F# as the second!**Exploring chord inversions and contexts**

I'm analyzing the relationship between F#/Bb and Gb, considering that in E major, F# minor is the second chord while this is a Gb major chord. They both have different qualities! I wonder if the chords are actually derived from E major with flat spellings for slash chords relative to Bb in the bass.

Looking at Emaj7/Ab, in E major, it’s the Imaj7, so with Ab in the bass, it’s like the first inversion. It all fits nicely with E major. 

Now for Dbm/Ab, I see that Ab is G#. C# minor over G# fits as the sixth chord depending on its position!**Determining key and mode**

I'm looking at the progression in E Lydian. For Dbm/Ab, the notes Db, Fb, and Ab relate enharmonically to C#, E, and G#, which makes it the sixth minor chord in Lydian. Then for B/Bb, that chord is still diatonic as B major is the fifth chord while A# serves as the #4 scale tone. 

The Emaj7/Ab chord gives me a nice Imaj7 with the third in the bass, and everything fits neatly into E Lydian. The emphasis on A# indicates that characteristic raised fourth. So, my concise conclusion is that we’re in E Lydian with key center on E!

E Lydian (key center E).

Why: Enharmonic spellings show all chords are diatonic to E Lydian:
- Bbdim = A#° = #iv°
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# = II in first inversion
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# = vi in second inversion
- B/Bb = V over #4 in bass
- Emaj7/Ab = Imaj7 over 3rd in bass

The raised 4th (A#) is featured repeatedly in the bass and harmony, confirming Lydian.
