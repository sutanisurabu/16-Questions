### Reasoning

**Deciphering the Chords**

\n\n

I've started to break down the provided chord progression. Recognizing the repeated Bbdim chords is the initial step. Currently, I'm focusing on the Gb/Bb and Dbm/Ab chords, trying to understand their function in relation to the Bbdim chords. The slash chords are throwing me a bit, as I have to really think about the relationship between the bass notes and the overall sound. I'm leaning toward a diminished context, but will see if these chords can give a major or minor feel.


**Identifying the Root**

\n\n

My analysis of the chord functions points toward B♭ as a potential tonal center, thanks to the frequent Bbdim chords. I'm now exploring the role of the Gb/Bb and Dbm/Ab chords, trying to determine their relationship to the Bbdim, which I believe is acting as a pivot. The Emaj7/Ab chord is tricky, but I think the G# will be key.


**Pinpointing the Tonality**

\n\n

My analysis of the Locrian mode is starting to feel right. Confirming the B-flat Locrian key, I'm now cross-referencing all chords to that scale to confirm this. I've noted that Gb/Bb, as the bVI major chord, is a bit unusual. Now, I'm examining the function of Emaj7/Ab to complete the analysis, especially its relationship with G#.


**Finalizing the Analysis**

\n\n

My analysis has evolved, and now I'm certain that Bb Locrian is the correct mode. While I'm quite confident that the Bbdim is the key center, the B major chord has thrown me. Given the prominence of the Bbdim chords, it appears as a highly dissonant passing chord, likely used for color or effect. Similarly, the Emaj7/Ab is more complex than I thought, so I will analyze the notes to see if it is a chromaticism or not.


**Confirming the Framework**

\n\n

My analysis has evolved further, and I am zeroing in on the Locrian mode, which seems most likely. Examining the notes of the B chord shows that the B major chord is not in the key. The Emaj7/Ab is more interesting now, as it fits well with a Locrian scale. I will focus on understanding the use of this chord within the Locrian framework.


**Concluding the Mode**

\n\n

My analysis has led me to believe the tonality is B-flat Locrian, which I've now confirmed. While the B major chord felt out of place, upon closer look, it can act as a chromatic passing chord. The Emaj7/Ab is more interesting now, as it fits well with a Locrian scale. I will focus on understanding the use of this chord within the Locrian framework, but overall, the analysis is complete.




This chord progression is unusual due to the persistent use of the diminished tonic chord, which is highly unstable in traditional Western harmony.

Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the key and mode:

### 1. Identify the Tonic Center

The progression is structurally anchored by two factors:

*   **Repetition and Placement:** The chord **Bbdim** is repeated constantly, appearing at the beginning and the end of the entire progression, defining the harmonic center.
*   **Bass Persistence:** Out of 16 chords, 14 have a B♭ in the bass (Bbdim, Gb/Bb, B/Bb). This strongly establishes **B♭** as the tonal center or root.

### 2. Analyze the Tonic Chord Quality

The tonic chord is **Bbdim** (B♭, D♭, F♭).

*   B♭ (Root/1)
*   D♭ (Minor third/m3)
*   F♭ (Diminished fifth/d5)

A mode that uses a diminished triad built on the tonic must contain a minor third and a diminished fifth. This immediately rules out all major, Lydian, Mixolydian, Dorian, Phrygian, and Aeolian modes. **Only the Locrian mode meets this criteria.**

### 3. Verify the Mode (B-flat Locrian)

The B-flat Locrian scale is: **B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭** (1, m2, m3, P4, d5, m6, m7).

Now we check if the other chords derive from or fit this mode:

| Chord | Notes | Fits B♭ Locrian Scale? (Y/N) | Function within B♭ Locrian (Approx.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bbdim** | B♭, D♭, F♭ | Y | i° (Tonic) |
| **Gb/Bb** | G♭, B♭, D♭ | Y | bVI (Suspended sense of stabilization) |
| **Dbm/Ab** | D♭, F♭, A♭ (over A♭ bass) | Y | iii° (Specifically, built on m3) |
| **Emaj7/Ab** | E, G♯, B, D♯ over A♭ bass. (Enharmonically: F♭, A♭, C♭, E♭ over A♭ bass) | Y (All notes F♭, A♭, C♭, E♭ are in the scale) | A highly colored chord built on the d5 (F♭) using intervals 5, 7, 2, 4. |
| **B/Bb** | B, D♯, F♯ (over B♭ bass) | N | Appears as a chromatic passing chord, used for textural contrast before resolving back to Bbdim. (The notes B, D♯, F♯ are enharmonically C♭, E♭, G♭, which *are* in the scale, but the written enharmonics A♯, D♯, G♭ create tension.) |

The vast majority of the harmonic material (Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab) is diatonic to B-flat Locrian. The progression is heavily focused on the unstable, diminished quality of the tonic.

### Conclusion

*   **Key/Tonic Center:** **B-flat**
*   **Mode:** **Locrian**

The key and mode of the progression is **B-flat Locrian**.
