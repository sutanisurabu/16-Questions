**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chords: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Hmm, I need to analyze this step by step.

First, I recall that chord sequences can indicate key centers through common progressions and shared tonal centers. Let me list out all the chords clearly:

- Bbdim (B♭ diminished)
- Gb/Bb (G♭ major with B♭ in the bass, which is actually a B♭ minor chord? Wait, no. Gb major triad is G♭-B♭-D♭. So Gb/Bb means B♭ is the bass note, so the chord is G♭ major over B♭, so the notes are B♭, G♭, B♭, D♭? Wait, no. When you have X/Y, Y is the bass note. So Gb/Bb means the chord is Gb major with Bb as the bass. So the notes would be Bb (bass), then Gb, Bb, Db (since Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db). So actually, the chord is Bb minor? Wait, no. Let's see: Gb major in first inversion would be Bb as the bass, so the notes are Bb, Gb, Db. But that's the same as Bb minor? Wait, Bb minor is Bb, Db, F. But Db is a minor third from Bb. Wait, Gb major triad is Gb, Bb, Db. So if you play it with Bb as the bass, the notes are Bb (root), Gb (a minor 6th above Bb?), wait no. Wait, bass note is Bb, then the next note is Gb above that, then Db above. So the intervals: Bb to Gb is a diminished fifth? Wait, let's count: Bb to Gb is a minor 6th (Bb to G is major 6th, so Bb to Gb is minor 6th). But in terms of chord structure, a chord with bass note Bb, and then Gb and Db. So the notes are Bb, Gb, Db. But that's a Bb diminished triad? No: Bb, Db, Fb (but Fb is E). Wait, Bb diminished is Bb, Db, Fb. But Db is actually the minor third, and Fb would be the diminished fifth. But here we have Db, which is the minor third, and then Db above Bb is a minor 6th, but no, wait. Let me map this out.

Actually, the chord Gb/Bb is the Gb major triad inverted, so the notes are Bb (bass), Gb, Db. So the notes are Bb, Db, Gb. Wait, but Bb to Db is a minor third, Db to Gb is a perfect fourth? Wait, Db to Gb is a perfect fourth? Db to Gb: D to G is perfect fourth, so Db to Gb is also a perfect fourth. So Bb (bass), then Db (minor third above Bb), then Gb (sixth above Bb? Wait, Bb to Gb is a minor 6th). So the chord is Bb minor 7th flat 5? Wait, no. Let's see: the chord is composed of Bb, Db, Gb. But usually a diminished chord would be Bb, Db, Fb. But here the top note is Gb instead of Fb. Wait, perhaps Gb/Bb is actually a Bb half-diminished? No. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the root.

Wait, when you have "Gb/Bb", the chord symbol means that Gb is the root, and Bb is the bass note. So the chord is Gb major triad with Bb in the bass. So Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So the notes when played with Bb bass would be Bb (bass), then Gb (a minor 6th above Bb), then Db (a perfect 4th above Bb, or a minor 10th, but usually thought of as the note above). Wait, but in terms of the actual pitches: Bb is the lowest, then Db above Bb, then Gb above Db. So the notes are Bb, Db, Gb. So that's a Bb minor 7th flat 5? Wait, no. Let's see: Bb minor 7th is Bb, Db, F, Ab. But here we have Bb, Db, Gb. So F is missing. Instead, it's Gb. So Bb to Db is minor 3rd, Db to Gb is perfect fourth (since Db to E is minor 2nd, E to F is major 2nd, F to G is major 2nd, so Db to Gb is four semitones from Db to F, then F to Gb is a semitone, so total 5 semitones? Wait, Db to D is 1, D to D# 2, D# to E 3, E to F 4, F to Gb 5. So Db to Gb is a diminished fifth. So the chord is Bb, Db, Gb. So Bb (root), Db (minor 3rd), Gb (diminished 5th)? Wait, yes. A diminished triad is root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th. So Bb diminished would be Bb, Db, Fb. But Fb is E. However, in this case, the top note is Gb instead of Fb. Wait, Gb is a G flat, which is the same as F natural? No, Gb is a G flat, so it's not same as F. Wait, Bb dim is Bb, Db, Fb (F flat), which is equivalent to E. But wait, Fb is enharmonic to E, but in terms of the chord, Bb diminished is Bb, Db, Fb (which is E). However, here we have Gb as the third note. So Bb, Db, Gb. But Gb is the same as F#? No, Gb is not F#. Wait, Gb is G flat, which is the same as F#? No, in equal temperament, G flat is enharmonically equivalent to F sharp, yes. But in context, depends on the key. Hmm, but let's not get confused.

Wait, the chord Gb/Bb is Gb major with Bb bass, so notes Bb, Gb, Db. So Bb as bass note, then Gb and Db above. So the notes in the chord are Bb, Db, Gb. Now, Bb to Db is minor 3rd, Db to Gb is... Db to Eb 1, Eb to E 2, E to F 3, F to F# 4, F# to G 5, so Db to G would be a perfect fifth. But Db to Gb is a diminished fifth (since F# to G is a semitone, so Db to Gb would be diminished fifth). Wait, Db to Gb is actually a diminished fifth? Wait, Db to G is a perfect fifth (8 semitones? Wait: Db to D is 1, D to D# 2, ..., Db to G: Db to E (3), E to F (4), F to G (5). So Db to G is 7 semitones (perfect fifth). But Db to Gb would be 6 semitones? Because Db to G is 7 semitones, so Gb is one semitone lower than G, so Db to Gb is 6 semitones, which is a diminished fifth. Yes, because a perfect fifth is 7 semitones, so a diminished fifth is 6. So yes, the chord is Bb diminished triad? No. Wait, Bb diminished triad is Bb, Db, Fb (F flat), which is enharmonic to E. But here, the notes are Bb, Db, Gb. But Gb is equivalent to F# in some contexts. Wait, no. Bb minor 7th flat 5 would be Bb, Db, Fb? Wait, maybe this is a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps the chord Gb/Bb is considered as a Bb minor chord in second inversion? But Bb minor is Bb, Db, F. So if it's second inversion, the bass would be F, but here the bass is Bb. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the overall key. Let's list all the chords and see which key they might fit into. Let's list the chord names with their roots:

First chord: Bbdim. So root is Bb.

Second: same.

Third: Gb/Bb. So the root of the chord is Gb, with bass on Bb.

But the chord itself is Gb major triad.

Fourth: same.

Then Bbdim again, etc.

Wait, let's consider the chord symbols as written. Bbdim is B♭ diminished. Gb/Bb is G♭ major triad with B♭ in the bass. So that's the same as B♭ minor? Because a B♭ minor chord consists of B♭, D♭, F. But Gb major triad is G♭, B♭, D♭. So if you have G♭/B♭, the notes are B♭ (bass), G♭, D♭. Wait, but B♭, G♭, D♭. But G♭ is enharmonic to F♯? Not sure. Maybe the key is related to Bb minor?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of Bbdim and Gb major chords. Let's think about common keys.

Bb diminished chord: in what keys is B♭dim present? Diminished chords are often part of the diatonic chords in harmonic minor. For example, in C minor, the dim chord would be vii°, but in C minor, B♭dim would be the vii° chord. But wait, B♭ diminished is part of C harmonic minor? Let me check.

C harmonic minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. The vii° chord is B diminished: B, D, F. But B♭ is different.

Wait, if we have B♭dim, that's B♭, D♭, F♭ (which is E). In C minor, the diatonic chords: Cm, D°, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, B°. So B° would be B dim. But B♭dim is not part of C minor.

Alternatively, maybe B♭ minor key? Let's see. B♭ minor scale: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭. Wait, but that's complicated. Alternatively, B♭ minor as a key. The natural minor would be B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭. But maybe it's better to think in terms of relative majors. Alternatively, B♭ minor is relative to D♭ major.

But perhaps the chords are part of a B♭ minor key. Let's list the diatonic chords in B♭ minor.

Natural minor:

B♭ minor scale: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭

But perhaps using the common harmonic minor. Alternatively, maybe this is in B♭ minor, but let's see.

But let's take a step back. Let's look at the sequence. We have multiple Bbdim chords. Then Gb/Bb appears.

Wait, Gb/Bb: Gb major with Bb bass. So as I thought before, notes are Bb (bass), Gb, Db. So chord tones: Bb, Gb, Db. Which is a Bb minor 6th chord? Or perhaps it's better to consider that Gb/Bb is actually a D♭maj7? No. Wait, chord symbols: Gb/Bb. So the root is Gb, with Bb as bass. So the inversion is first inversion of Gb major.

But maybe thinking of the bass line. The bass has Bb for the first two chords (since Bbdim has Bb as root), then Gb/Bb, so bass is Bb, then same for next. Wait, but Bbdim chord typically has Bb as root. If it's Bbdim, the bass note is Bb unless specified. But here, Gb/Bb specifies the bass is Bb. So the bass movement might be Bb for several chords.

Let me consider possible keys where Bbdim and Gb chords appear.

Another approach: look at the chord qualities. Diminished chords often function as leading tones. Bbdim could be the vii° in C minor? Wait, in C minor, the vii° chord is Bdim (B, D, F), but Bbdim would be B♭dim. That's not part of C minor. Maybe C# minor? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the key of D♭ major. In D♭ major, diatonic chords:

D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C

Chords would be:

I: D♭maj

ii: E♭min

iii: Fmin

IV: G♭maj

V: A♭maj

vi: B♭min

vii°: Cdim

Wait, so B♭dim? Wait, vii° chord in D♭ major would be Cdim. So B♭dim isn't diatonic here.

Wait, but maybe key of B♭ minor. B♭ minor natural scale is B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭. Let's list chords:

i: B♭min

ii°: C♭dim

III: D♭maj

iv: E♭min

v: F♭min

VI: G♭maj

VII: A♭maj

But not sure. Alternatively, maybe harmonic minor of B♭. B♭ harmonic minor would be B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A. So the chords:

i: B♭min

ii°: C♭dim

III+: D♭maj (augmented)

iv: E♭min

V: F♭maj (but F♭ is E, so E major)

VI: G♭maj

vii°: A dim

Hmm, this seems messy. Let's see if the chords listed fit into some scale.

Looking at the chords:

- Bbdim (B♭ diminished: B♭, D♭, F♭)
- Gb/Bb: Gb major with Bb bass, so Gb, Bb, Db
- Dbm/Ab: Dbm chord with Ab bass. So Db minor triad: Db, Fb, Ab? Wait, Db minor is Db, Fb, Ab. But with Ab in bass, so Ab, Db, Fb. So Fb is E natural? No, Fb is E, but enharmonic.

But let's list the notes in Dbm/Ab. Db minor triad with Ab as bass. So the chord is Db minor: Db, Fb, Ab. But with Ab bass. So the bass is Ab, then Db, Fb. So the notes are Ab, Db, Fb. Which is Ab major? Wait, Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. But here we have Ab, Db, Fb. Db is the fourth of Ab, Fb is E. Not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to consider possible modes.

Alternatively, maybe the key is B♭ minor, considering the chords. Let's see:

In B♭ minor (harmonic minor), scale notes: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A.

Chords derived:

i: B♭min

ii°: C♭dim (could be spelled B dim if we consider enharmonics? Not sure)

III+: D♭maj (augmented? Not sure)

iv: E♭min

V: F♭maj (which is E major, but F♭ is E)

VI: G♭maj (G♭ major)

vii°: Adim (A diminished)

Wait, so G♭maj is part of the chords listed (Gb is same as F#, but G♭maj? Wait, G♭ and F# are enharmonic, but depending on context.

If the key is B♭ minor, then G♭maj would be a chord in the scale. Wait, in the natural minor of B♭, the VI chord is G♭ major. Yes! Because natural minor scale of B♭ is B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭. So chord on VI is G♭ major. So Gb is actually G♭, same thing. So G♭maj.

But in our chord list, we have Gb/Bb. So G♭ major with B♭ in the bass. Which would be the first inversion of G♭ major. And B♭ minor is the tonic. So if the key is B♭ minor, then the G♭ chord is the VI chord.

So in B♭ minor, the chords would be:

i: B♭min

ii°: C♭dim

III: D♭maj

iv: E♭min

v: F♭min (which is E min)

VI: G♭maj

VII: A♭maj

So if we have Gb/Bb, which is G♭maj with B♭ bass, then that's VI chord in first inversion.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Db minor with Ab bass. Dbm is not diatonic to B♭ minor. Wait, in B♭ natural minor, the chords are as above. So iv chord would be E♭minor, and v is F♭minor. So Db minor would be a borrowed chord? Not sure.

Wait, Dbm is D♭ minor. In B♭ natural minor, the scale has D♭ as part of it (since scale is B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭ etc.), so D♭ minor chord? The iii chord would be D♭ major in B♭ natural minor. Because the third note is D♭, and in natural minor, iii is a major chord? Wait:

B♭ natural minor: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭.

Building triads:

i: B♭ - D♭ - F♭ → B♭minor

ii°: C♭ - E♭♭ - G♭ → C♭dim (E♭♭ is D♭)

iii: D♭ - F♭ - A♭ → D♭major

iv: E♭ - G♭ - B♭ → E♭minor

v: F♭ - A♭ - C♭ → F♭minor (but F♭ is E, so E minor)

VI: G♭ - B♭ - D♭ → G♭major

VII: A♭ - C♭ - E♭♭ → A♭major

Wait, so the iii chord is D♭ major, iv is E♭ minor, etc. So Dbm (D♭ minor) would not be diatonic to B♭ natural minor. So maybe harmonic minor?

In B♭ harmonic minor: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A.

Chords:

i: B♭min

ii°: C♭dim

III+: D♭aug (D♭, F♭, A)

iv: E♭min

V: F♭maj (E major)

VI: G♭maj

vii°: Adim

Here, III is augmented, V is major (E major). So Dbm (D♭ minor) doesn't seem to be diatonic here either. Hmm.

Wait, but the chord listed is Dbm/Ab. So Db minor with Ab as bass. So notes: Ab (bass), Db, Fb. Fb is E. So Ab, Db, E.

Wait, but E is not in B♭ minor scale. Unless key is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is E major? Let's see.

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

But we have Bb, Gb, Db, etc. Which are all flats, so probably not E major.

Alternatively, key of B♭ major? In B♭ major, the chords would be:

I: B♭maj

ii: Cm

iii: Dm

IV: E♭maj

V: Fmaj

vi: Gm

vii°: A°

So Bbdim would be the vii° of C minor? Wait, no. In B♭ major, the seventh chord is A°, which is A diminished. So B♭dim is not part of B♭ major.

Hmm. B♭dim is not in B♭ major. So where is B♭dim common?

It could be part of a minor key where minor scale has a flattened seventh or other alterations. Alternatively, perhaps in a G minor key. G natural minor: G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F.

Wait, in G minor natural:

i: Gm

ii°: A♭dim

III: B♭maj

iv: Cm

v: D♭m

VI: E♭maj

VII: Fmaj

So B♭ is the III chord, which is major. So B♭dim isn't there. But let's see.

Wait, perhaps key of C minor. C minor natural: C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: D♭dim

III: E♭maj

iv: Fm

v: G♭m

VI: A♭maj

VII: B♭maj

So B♭ is the VII chord, which is major. Not diminished.

But B♭dim would require a diminished B♭. Not present here.

Alternatively, C harmonic minor: C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: D♭dim

III+: E♭aug

iv: Fm

V: G♭maj

VI: A♭maj

vii°: Bdim

So here, the VII chord is Bdim, not B♭dim. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: look at the bass notes. The bass has Bb for several chords. Bbdim, then Gb/Bb (bass Bb), then Dbm/Ab (bass Ab), then B/Bb (bass Bb?), wait the chord is B/Bb? Wait, the chords given are: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

So looking at the bass notes:

First two chords: Bbdim → bass Bb (assuming root position, though dim chords often root position)

Next two: Gb/Bb → bass is Bb

Next two: Bbdim → bass Bb

Then Dbm/Ab → bass Ab

Then B/Bb → bass Bb? Because B/Bb is B major chord with Bb as bass? So the chord is B major with bass Bb. So that note would be Bb, then B, D#, F#? Wait, B major is B, D#, F#. So B/Bb would mean bass is Bb, so the chord is B major over Bb bass. So the notes are Bb (bass), B, D#, F#. But that's a bit dissonant.

Wait, but that's possible. But that might be a clue. A major chord with Bb bass. So for example, B maj over Bb bass could be part of a Bb major scale? No, not sure.

Wait, but let's list all the bass notes:

- Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb.

Wait, the bass seems mostly Bb and sometimes Ab. So the bass is moving between Bb and Ab.

So the root notes of the chords vary, but bass line has Bb and Ab. For example, when the chord is Dbm/Ab, bass is Ab, but for Emaj7/Ab, bass is Ab as well.

So the bass is alternating between Bb and Ab? Let's see:

After Dbm/Ab (bass Ab), next is B/Bb (bass Bb), then Bbdim (bass Bb), etc. Then later Emaj7/Ab (bass Ab). So perhaps the bass is moving between Ab and Bb.

So perhaps the key center is between Ab and Bb. Maybe the key is Ab major or Bb minor.

But Bb minor would have a scale of B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭. Wait, but the VII chord would be A♭maj. So if the bass is Ab and Bb, maybe the key is Ab major or Bb minor.

Wait, let's consider Ab major. In Ab major, the chords:

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords:

I: Abmaj

II: Bbm

III: Cm

IV: Dbmaj

V: Ebmaj

VI: Fm

VII: G°

So in this key, the vii° chord is G diminished. Not sure how Bb diminished fits in here. Bbdim chord would be Bb, Db, Fb. But in Ab major, the ii chord is Bbm. So Bb minor, not diminished. Bbdim isn't diatonic here.

Alternatively, in the key of D♭ major. Let's see:

D♭ major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

Chords:

I: Dbmaj

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gbmaj

V: Abmaj

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

So Bbm (Bb minor), which is the vi chord. But we have Bbdim here, which is different. Bbdim would be Bb, Db, Fb. Not diatonic to D♭ major.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Bbdim could be the diminished chord functioning as vii° in C minor. But as before, in C minor natural, vii° is Bdim. Not B♭dim.

Wait, but if we have B♭dim, which is B♭, D♭, F♭ (E), then perhaps the key has a B♭ root. But B♭dim itself is a diminished chord, which could be used as part of a progression in a minor key where it's a substitute or borrowed chord.

Alternatively, this might be in the key of F minor. Let's check F minor natural.

F minor scale: F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: G♭dim

III: A♭maj

iv: B♭m

v: C♭m (Bminor)

VI: D♭maj

VII: E♭maj

So here, B♭ minor (iv chord), but B♭dim? Not sure. The ii chord is G♭dim. Not B♭dim.

How about F harmonic minor? F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: G♭dim

III+: A♭aug

iv: B♭m

V: C♭maj (B major)

VI: D♭maj

vii°: Edim

Still not seeing B♭dim. B♭dim would be part of another key.

Wait, perhaps B♭dim is the same as A#dim. So A#dim is A#, C#, E. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe looking at the Emaj7/Ab chord. E major 7th with Ab bass. So Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass. So bass note Ab, then the chord tones E, G#, B, D#. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#. That seems complicated. What scale would have these notes?

But this might be the key to figuring it out. Let's see.

If there's an Emaj7/Ab, meaning the bass is Ab, and the chord is Emaj7. So the notes are Ab (bass), E, G#, B, D#. So combined notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. What key has these notes?

Possible scales: perhaps C# minor harmonic or something. Wait, C# minor harmonic: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#.

But Ab is not in that. Alternatively, a key like G major? No, G major has F#.

Wait, Ab major scale is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. But Emaj7 chord has E natural, which is not in Ab major.

Alternatively, if the key is E major, but it has G# and B, but Ab is not in E major (E major has F#).

Hmm. Maybe it's a different scale. Let's see the chord Emaj7/Ab: Ab bass, Emaj7. So notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. So the pitches: Ab, B, D#, E, G#. So looking at a scale that includes these notes. Let's list all notes: Ab, B, D#, E, G#.

That seems like a weird set. Alternatively, thinking of it as Ab, then E (which is a minor third above Ab? No, Ab to B is a minor 3rd? Wait, Ab to B: Ab to A is 1, A to B is 2, so Ab to B is a major 2nd. No, wait: Ab to Bb is major second, Bb to B is a semitone. Wait, Ab to B: Ab to Bb is 1 semitone, Bb to B is another, so two semitones: major 2nd. Then Ab to D# would be a major third? Ab to B is major second, B to C is major second, C to D is major second, D to D# is minor second. So total: Ab to D# is A3? Maybe.

This is getting too messy. Perhaps another approach.

Let's take all the chord symbols and list their notes:

Bbdim: B♭, D♭, F♭ (which is E)
Gb/Bb: G♭, B♭, D♭ with B♭ bass → same notes as B♭, G♭, D♭
Dbm/Ab: D♭, F♭, A♭ with A♭ bass → A♭, D♭, F♭
B/Bb: B, D#, F# with B♭ bass → B♭, B, D#, F#
Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D# with Ab bass → Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Hmm, now looking at the notes involved:

From Bbdim: B♭, D♭, E

Gb/Bb: B♭, G♭, D♭ → which is equivalent to B♭, D♭, G♭ (same notes as above)

Dbm/Ab: A♭, D♭, E (since F♭=E)

B/Bb: B♭, B, D#, F#

Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

So combining all these notes:

B♭, D♭, E, G♭, A♭, B, D#, F#

This seems like a lot of different notes. But maybe not. Let's list all unique pitches:

- B♭ (or A#)
- D♭ (or C#)
- E (which is Fb)
- G♭ (or F#)
- A♭ (or G#)
- B natural
- D# (Eb)
- F#

Wait, that's a lot. Maybe some of these are enharmonically equivalent. But this seems messy. Perhaps the key is not standard, or maybe it's a modulation.

Alternatively, let's look for common keys that include a B♭dim chord.

B♭dim = B♭, D♭, E (since F♭=E)

This diminished chord is often part of the vii° of C minor, but in C minor, the vii° is B°, not B♭dim. So not directly.

Wait, but maybe if we consider that this music is using chords from B♭ minor, or perhaps another minor key.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is G minor. Let's see: G minor scale (natural) has G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F. So B♭ is part of the scale. B♭dim chord might not be diatonic, but in G harmonic minor, it's G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, A. Still, B♭ is in the scale.

But G harmonic minor has B♭ as the third scale degree, major chord. Not sure.

Alternatively, the chord progression might suggest the key is B♭ minor but with borrowings.

Wait, another thought: the presence of Emaj7/Ab. If Ab is the bass note, and Emaj7 is the chord, then the combination of Ab and Emaj7. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. Ab is a note. So Ab to E would be a minor sixth interval? Ab to E is Ab to A (1), A to Bb (2), Bb to B (3), but wait, E is a major sixth above Ab? Let's count:

Ab to A: 1 semitone

A to A# (Bb): 2

Bb to B: 3? No, better to use semitones.

Ab to A: 1 semitone

A to B: 3 semitones (A, A#, B)

But Ab to E: starting from Ab:

Ab to A: 1

A to A#: 2

A# to Bb: 3? No. Wait, better to count semitones:

Ab (A flat) = A♭

A♭ to A: 1 semitone

A to A♯: 2

A♯ to B♭: 3

But to get to E: let's go from Ab upwards:

Ab → A: 1

A → Bb: 2

Bb → B: 3

B → C: 5? This is messy. Let's do it properly.

Ab (A flat) is the note. The note E is 7 semitones above Ab? Let's see:

Ab to A: 1

A to A#: 2

A# to Bb: 3

Bb to B: 4

B to C: 6? No. Wait, in 12-tone system:

Ab: 0 semitones (for counting)

A: 1

Bb: 1

B: 2

C: 3

C#: 4

D: 5

D#: 6

Eb: 6

E: 7

F: 8

F#: 9

Gb: 9

G: 10

Ab: 11

So from Ab (0) to E (7 semitones above). So E is a minor 7th above Ab? Wait, no. Minor 7th is 10 semitones. Wait:

From Ab (0):

Minor 7th down is C (since from Ab down to C is 3 semitones up from C? Wait, better to think of interval.

Ab to E: let's count the number of semitones. From Ab (A♭) to A: 1, B♭: 2, B: 3, C: 4, C♯: 5, D: 6, D♯: 7, E: 8? No. Wait:

Ab, A, A#, Bb, B, C, C#, D, D#, E.

Wait, Ab to A is 1 semitone.

A to Bb is same as A to A#? No. In terms of notes on piano:

Ab (G#), A, A#, Bb, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#.

Wait, no. Let's list all keys:

Starting from A flat:

A♭, A, B♭, B, C, C♯, D, D♯, E, F, F♯, G, G♯, A♭.

So from A♭ to E: A♭ (0), A (1), B♭ (2), B (3), C (4), C♯ (5), D (6), D♯ (7), E (8 semitones above A♭). Yes, 8 semitones. Which is a major 6th? Wait, major 6th is 9 semitones. Minor 6th is 8. Yes, because minor sixth is 8 semitones up. So Ab to E is a minor 6th. Interesting.

But how does this help? Not sure.

Let's consider the Emaj7/Ab chord. The Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D#. So if the bass is Ab, then combined with Ab, the notes are Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Now, if we're considering that all these notes need to fit into a key. Let's list all these notes: Ab, B, D#, E, G#.

But D# is Eb, G# is Ab. So notes:

Ab, B, Eb, E, G# (but G# is Ab). So maybe Ab is both G# and Ab. So the unique notes are Ab, B, Eb, E.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's convert all to sharps or flats for consistency.

Ab = G#

E = E

B = B

D# = Eb

So notes: G#, B, Eb, E.

That's still a bit odd. But perhaps there's a scale.

Alternatively, maybe this is in a different key where the Emaj7 is borrowed. But this seems challenging.

Wait, another angle. Let's look for dominant chords. But there's nothing here that looks like a dominant seventh. The chords are mostly diminished, minor, or major chords.

Wait, but in the sequence, there's a Dbm/Ab which is Db minor. If we consider Dbm in a key, perhaps the key is Ab major. Because in Ab major, the ii chord is Bbm. Wait, no. Ab major: II is Bbm, III is Cm, IV is Dbmaj. So Db is the IV chord in Ab major. So Db major. So Dbm would not be diatonic. But if it's Ab minor? Wait, Ab minor would have:

Ab minor natural: Ab, Bbb (A), Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Not sure. Maybe this isn't helpful.

Wait, let's consider that the key might be B minor. But B minor has lots of sharps, but the chords given have Bb, Gb, Db, which are flats. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps B♭ minor. Let's take B♭ natural minor:

Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab.

Chords (triads):

Bbm: Bb, Db, Fb

Cb°: Cb, Eb, Gb

Db: Db, Fb, Ab

Eb: Eb, Gb, Bb

Fbm: Fb, Ab, Cb

Gb: Gb, Bb, Db

Ab: Ab, Cb, Eb

So in this key, the chords would be:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cb°

III: Dbmaj

iv: Ebm

v: Fbm

VI: Gbmaj

VII: Abmaj

Ah, interesting. In Bb natural minor, the VI chord is Gb major (Gb major? Gb is G♭, yes. So Gb major chord: Gb, Bb, Db. Which matches the Gb/Bb chord we have – it's the VI chord. But Gb/Bb would be first inversion of Gb major chord.

Similarly, the Bbdim chord: in Bb natural minor, the triad on Bb is Bbm. Not diminished. So why is there a Bbdim chord here? Unless it's harmonic minor.

Bb harmonic minor: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, A.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cb°

III+: Db aug (Db, Fb, A)

iv: Ebm

V: Fb maj (E major)

VI: Gbmaj

vii°: A° (A diminished)

Here, in harmonic minor, the v chord is often V, major. Here V would be Fb Maj (E major). But still, Bbdim isn't diatonic. However, the VII chord is A diminished. Not B♭dim.

Alternatively, if the Bbdim chord is actually a diminished chord serving as a leading tone for the next chord. For example, Bbdim could be related to C♭ major or something.

Hmm. This is tough.

Wait, the chord Dbm/Ab. If we are in the key of Bb minor, Dbm would not be diatonic. But in Bb natural minor, the iii chord is Db major, as listed earlier. So Db minor is not diatonic there.

But if the key is F minor. Let's check F minor.

F minor natural: F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: Gb°

III: Abmaj

iv: Bbm

v: Cbm (B minor)

VI: Dbmaj

VII: Ebmaj

So Dbmaj is VI chord in F minor? Yes. So Db major. But we have Dbm/Ab here. So Db minor. Not diatonic. Dbm would be part of some other scale.

But wait, the chord Dbm/Ab is D♭ minor with A♭ bass. So in F minor, Dbm isn't diatonic but perhaps borrowed. But let's see.

If the key is F minor, then the VI chord is Dbmaj. So if we have Dbm/Ab, that's a minor version, which could be from F harmonic minor or melodic minor.

In F harmonic minor: F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, E.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: Gb°

III+: Abaug

iv: Bbm

V: Cbm (B major)

VI: Dbmaj

vii°: E°

Still, Dbmaj is the VI chord. So Db major. Not minor.

In F melodic minor ascending: F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb.

Chords would be different. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe this is in the key of G minor. G minor natural: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F.

Chords:

i: Gm

ii°: Ab°

III: Bbm

iv: Cm

v: Dbm

VI: Ebmaj

VII: Fmaj

Ah! Here, the v chord is Db minor. So Db minor. And in this key, the VI chord is Ebmaj. But we have a chord Dbm/Ab. Which would be the v chord, Dbm, with Ab in bass. If the key is G minor, then Dbm is chord v. Then Gb/Bb: Gb is the ii° chord in G minor natural. Because G minor ii° is Ab°, wait:

Wait in G minor natural:

Scale: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F.

Triads:

i: Gm (G, Bb, D)

ii°: Ab° (Ab, Cb, Eb)

iii: Bbm (Bb, Db, F)

iv: Cm (C, Eb, G)

v: Dbm (Db, F, Ab)

VI: Ebmaj (Eb, G, Bb)

VII: Fmaj (F, A, C)

Yes, so v chord is Dbm. And the chord Dbm/Ab would mean the v chord with Ab in bass. Which is the root position of Dbm is Db, F, Ab. So if we have Ab in the bass, that's second inversion. So Dbm in second inversion: Ab, Db, F.

Similarly, Gb/Bb: wait, what is Gb? In G minor, the ii° chord is Ab°, so Gb is not a chord here. Wait, but the chord is Gb/Bb. So a Gb major chord with Bb bass. Gb major chord is Gb, Bb, Db. Which would be the VII chord of C minor? Not sure.

Wait, in G minor minor, the scale includes Db and Ab. So if we have Gb (which is actually F#), but that's not in G minor. So maybe Gb chord is a borrowed chord.

Alternatively, if we consider key of C minor.

C minor natural: C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Db°

III: Ebmaj

iv: Fm

v: Gbm

VI: Abmaj

VII: Bbm

Ah! Here we go. In C minor, the v chord is Gb minor. Gbm is the chord on Gb, which is Gb, Bb, Db. Wait, no: C minor scale chords:

Cm: C, Eb, G

ii°: Db° (Db, Fb, Ab)

III: Ebmaj (Eb, G, Bb)

iv: Fm (F, Ab, C)

v: Gbm (Gb, Bb, Db)

VI: Abmaj (Ab, C, Eb)

VII: Bbm (Bb, Db, F)

Ah yes! So in C minor, the v chord is Gb minor (Gbm). So Gb minor chord. So if the chord Gb/Bb is mentioned, that would be Gbm in first inversion? Because Gbm chord is Gb, Bb, Db. So with Bb bass, yes, it's Gbm first inversion. But the chord is written as Gb/Bb – which is Gb major with Bb bass. Wait, but Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. Yes! Wait, Gb major chord is Gb, Bb, Db. But in C minor, the v chord is Gb minor, which would be Gb, Bb, Db? No. Wait, no. For minor triads, the chord is root, minor third, fifth.

So Gbm chord in C minor: Gb (root), Bbb? No. Wait, C minor scale:

The fifth degree of C minor is Gb. So the triad built on Gb would be Gb, Bb, Db? Let's see.

C minor scale: scale degrees 1=C, 2=Db, 3=Eb, 4=F, 5=Gb, 6=Ab, 7=Bb.

So chord built on Gb: Gb (root), A (minor third? No). Wait, Gb to A is a major third. Wait, no – the triad would be Gb, Bb, Db. Because the note after Gb is Ab (6th scale degree), so third above Gb is Bb (since Gb to Ab is minor second, Ab to Bb major second, so Gb to Bb is major third). Then fifth is Db.

Yes, so the v chord in C minor is Gbmaj. Wait, that's not right. Major chord? No, in minor keys, the v chord is often minor. Wait, this is where it differs for harmonic minor.

In natural minor, the v chord is minor. For example, C natural minor has scale degrees:

1: C, 2: Db, 3: Eb, 4: F, 5: Gb, 6: Ab, 7: Bb.

So the chord built on 5th degree: Gb, then the third above would be Ab to B? Wait:

Root: Gb

Third: Gb to Bb is major third (as in Gb to Ab is minor second, Ab to Bb major second, Gb to Bb is major third)

Fifth: Gb to Db is perfect fifth (Gb to Ab, Gb to A natural would be diminished fifth, but Gb to Db: Gb, Ab, A, Bb, B, Cb, Db. Let's count semitones: Gb to Ab is 1, Ab to A is 2, A to Bb is 3, Bb to B is 4, B to Cb is 5, Cb to Db is 6. So total of 6 semitones from Gb to Db. Which is a diminished fifth. But in the natural minor scale, the fifth above Gb would be Db? Yes. Wait, natural minor's fifth chord has a diminished fifth.

Wait, no. Let's construct the chord for fifth scale degree in natural minor. The fifth degree of the natural minor scale is the root, then the third interval above is a minor third or major? Let's take an example.

A natural minor scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Chord on E: E, G, B. E minor chord – root, minor third, perfect fifth. Yes.

Similarly, in C natural minor: C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

Chord on Gb: Gb, Bb, Db. Gb to Bb is major third (4 semitones), Bb to Db is minor third. So the chord is Gb major? Because root, major third, perfect fifth. Wait, Gb to Db is 6 semitones (diminished fifth), wait. No, let's count:

Gb to Db: from Gb to G is 1 semitone, G to G# 2, G# to A 3, A to A# 4, A# to B 5, B to B# 6, no. Better:

Gb: note 0

Ab: 1

A: 2

Bb: 3

B: 4

C: 5

C#: 6

Db: 7. Wait, no. Semitones from Gb to Db.

Gb → G (1), G→G# (2), but wait, standard semitone count:

Gb (0), G (1), G# (2), A (3), Bb (4), B (5), C (6), C# (7), D (8), D# (9), Eb (10), E (11), F (12), F# (13), Gb (14).

This isn't helpful. Let's count the distance from Gb to Db.

Gb to A is a diminished fourth? No.

The interval between Gb and Db.

Gb, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db. That's 6 semitones above Gb. So Gb to Db is six semitones: diminished fifth. Because perfect fifth is seven. So yes, diminished fifth.

So chord Gb (root), Bb (major third from Gb), Db (diminished fifth). Which makes a diminished chord. So Gb°.

But in C natural minor, the v chord is diminished? But usually in minor keys, you have a minor v or major V depending on harmonic minor.

Wait, maybe natural minor has a diminished v chord. Let's verify with A natural minor.

Scale: A B C D E F G

Chord on E: E G B. Which is minor – perfect fifth. E to B is perfect fifth. Why the difference?

Because in A natural minor, E is fifth scale degree, and E to B is perfect fifth. Ah, right, because A minor scale: notes are A B C D E F G.

But in C minor natural: C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb.

The fifth scale degree is Gb. Then the third above Gb is Bb (since Gb to Ab is semitone, Ab to Bb is second), so Gb to Bb is major third. And the fifth would be Db. But Gb to Db, as above, is diminished fifth (6 semitones). So chord is Gb°. But in A minor, the v chord is E minor: E G B. Perfect fifth.

Why the difference? Because A minor is the relative minor of C major, which has natural scale with no accidentals. So the fifth scale degree in A natural minor is E, which is the fifth of C major. So in natural minor, v chord is minor because it's minor triad. Because the fifth note of natural minor is the same as the V degree of relative major.

Wait, A minor → C major's relative minor. So in C major, V is G major, but in A natural minor, the chords are built on its own scale. So the fifth note of A minor is E, and the triad is E minor: E, G, B. Which has G and B – E to G is minor third.

Ah! So perhaps I was confused earlier. For C natural minor scale: the fifth note is Gb, but the third above it would be Bb. Wait, Gb to Bb is major third. Gb to Db is perfect fifth? Wait, Gb to Db: what is that interval?

Gb to A: minor third? No.

Let's do it right.

From Gb:

Gb → G = 1 semitone

G → G# = 2

G# → A = 3

A → A# = 4

A# → B = 5

B → C = 6

C → C# = 7

C# → D = 8

D → D# = 9

D# → Eb = 10

Eb → E = 11

E → F = 12

F → F# = 13

F# → G = 14

G → G# = 15

G# → A = 16

This isn't helping. Better to use semitones between Gb and Db.

Gb is equivalent to F#.

F# to G is 1

G to G# 2

G# to A 3

A to A# 4

A# to B 5

B to C 6

C to C# 7

C# to D 8

D to D# 9

D# to Eb 10

So F# to D: wait, F# is 8 semitones from C. Not sure.

Wait, standard pitch names:

Let's use half-steps.

From Gb up to Db:

Gb to Ab: 1

Ab to A: 2

A to Bb: 3

Bb to B: 4

B to C: 5

C to Db: 6.

Yes, 6 semitones. A diminished fifth (since perfect fifth is 7). So chord Gb, Bb, Db: root Gb, major third (Gb to Bb is 4 semitones), and diminished fifth (Gb to Db is 6 semitones). So this is not a regular minor chord; it's a diminished chord? No, minor chord has minor third and perfect fifth. Here we have major third and diminished fifth – that's a diminished chord.

Wait, a diminished chord has root, minor third, diminished fifth. So a diminished triad consists of two minor thirds stacked.

So starting from Gb:

Gb to Bbb = minor third (Bbb is A)

But that's not right. Let's take a standard example: Cdim is C, Eb, Gb.

Minor third from C is Eb (3 semitones), then minor third from Eb is Gb (another 3).

Yes. So for Gbdim: root Gb, minor third is Bbb (A), then diminished fifth is Dbb.

But in our case, we have Gb to Bb is 4 semitones (major third), and Gb to Db is 6 semitones (diminished fifth). So it's a major-minor? No. Wait, a major triad with a diminished fifth? No, typically minor is root, minor third, perfect fifth.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should refer back to the original chord symbols.

In the sequence, there's a Gb/Bb chord. If we take it as written: Gb major with Bb bass. So the notes are Bb, Gb, Db.

Now, if this fits into a key, perhaps the common key where Gb major and Bb diminished chords are used.

Another idea: the Bbdim chord – B♭ diminished – is often the vii° chord in C minor (if it were B°), but for B♭dim. Maybe the key is A minor? In A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. There's no B♭.

Alternatively, looking at the Emaj7/Ab chord. E major 7th is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab as bass note. So the combined pitches are Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Which has G# and Ab – enharmonic. So maybe G# is Ab. So notes Ab, B, D#, E. Which could be part of Ab major scale? Ab major includes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

But D# is En. Eb in Ab major. So D# is not diatonic. But D# could be seen as Eb.

B is not in Ab major. So Ab major has Bb, not B. So this complicates things.

Wait, what if the key is G# minor? But that's awkward due to many sharps. Or A minor with some accidental?

Alternatively, perhaps the key is Bbm (B♭ minor), and the Bbdim chord is a different function than the tonic.

Wait, another thought. The presence of Emaj7/Ab might suggest that Ab is functioning as a tonic or subtonic. Or maybe the chord Emaj7/Ab is part of a progression in the key of B♭ minor where E comes from somewhere.

Wait, if the key is B♭ minor, then we have Eb note in the scale. But Emaj7 has E natural. So unless the Emaj7 is a borrowed chord, like from the parallel major or something.

This is really complicated. Maybe I need to look for a pattern in the progression.

Let's list the chords again:

1. Bbdim

2. Bbdim

3. Gb/Bb

4. Gb/Bb

5. Bbdim

6. Bbdim

7. Dbm/Ab

8. B/Bb

9. Bbdim

10. Bbdim

11. Gb/Bb

12. Gb/Bb

13. Bbdim

14. Bbdim

15. Emaj7/Ab

16. Bbdim

So the progression has a lot of repetition: Bbdim twice, Gb/Bb twice, then Bbdim twice more, then Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, then more repeats of Bbdim and Gb/Bb, then finally Emaj7/Ab and ending with Bbdim.

Looking at this, the Gb/Bb and Bbdim are recurring. Gb/Bb could be VI chord in B♭ minor. If B♭ minor is the key, then VI is Gb major, yes (since in B♭ minor natural, VI is Gb Major). So Gb is VI. Then Bbdim might be part of a different function.

But why is there a Bbdim there? In B♭ minor natural, B♭ minor is the tonic. But diminished chord on B♭? B♭ diminished would be part of a different context.

Wait, in B♭ minor key, you might use a leading tone chord. But the leading tone would be A. So Adim. But not B♭dim.

Alternatively, perhaps B♭dim is used as a passing chord or something. Or maybe the key isn't B♭ minor.

Wait, another angle: Gb/Bb chord is the same as B♭ minor chord. Because B♭ minor is B♭, D♭, F. Whereas Gb/Bb would be Gb major inverted to B♭ bass, which is B♭, Gb, Db. Wait, but Gb is F#, Db is C#. So not sure.

Wait, B♭ minor chord is B♭, D♭, F.

Gb/Bb chord: notes B♭, G♭, D♭.

If we compare B♭ minor (B♭, D♭, F) to Gb/Bb's notes (B♭, D♭, G♭). F vs G♭. G♭ is same as F#.

So different notes. So not the same chord.

But if we consider Dbm/Ab: Db minor chord with Ab bass. Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab. So the chord is Ab, Db, Fb (which is E natural). So Ab, Db, E.

Now, E natural in a key with flats? Possible if it's using harmonic minor or something.

If the key is Ab minor? Let's check.

Ab minor: Ab, Bbb (A), Cb, Db, Ebb (D), Fb, Gb.

This is getting even more complicated. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe this progression is in a mode of Bb minor.

Wait, another thought: the chord Emaj7/Ab. If Ab is the bass, then Emaj7 could be the chord. Let's see what key includes Emaj7 and Ab as possible notes.

Emaj7: E, G#, B, D#.

Ab: A♭.

Combining these, we have Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Now, D# is Eb, G# is Ab. So the notes are Ab, B, Eb, E. Wait, E and Eb are both present, which is unusual. Unless it's a mistake, or perhaps in a scale like a chromatic scale.

This seems to not fit a standard key.

So maybe this progression isn't diatonic to a single key, but has modulation or borrowed chords.

Alternatively, maybe the key is C minor, where Dbm is v chord. But let's see.

In C minor natural:

v chord is Gbm (Gb minor), but we have Dbm which is ii chord? Wait, no.

Wait C minor chord on ii: Db°, iii is Ebmaj. Not helpful.

Wait, Db minor chord would be the v of Gb major.

Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

Chords in Gb major:

I: Gbmaj

II: Abm

III: Bbm

IV: Cbm

V: Dbmaj

VI: Ebm

VII: F°

So Dbmaj is V chord. So Db minor chord would not be diatonic here. But Dbm might be from a different key.

But if the key is Gb major, then Dbmaj is the V chord. But we have Dbm/Ab. If Ab is the bass, then Dbm/Ab is Dbm in first inversion.

But the chord progression with Emaj7/Ab in a Gb major key: Emaj7 isn't diatonic.

This is really challenging.

Wait, another approach: Bbdim chords often occur when using diminished seventh chords as passing chords or in jazz. But the symbol says Bbdim, which is a diminished triad.

Wait, perhaps a Bb minor key with the use of a borrowed chord. Like in Bb natural minor, the VI chord is Gb major. So Gb/Bb is VI in first inversion. If the progression is Bbdim, Bbdim, VI, VI, etc., but why Bbdim there?

Wait, could Bbdim be functioning as a vii° in A minor?

A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#

vii° chord is G#dim.

But Bbdim would not be in A minor.

Alternatively, B♭dim could be the ii° chord in A major.

A major: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#

ii° chord is Bdim: B, D, F.

But B♭dim is different.

Wait, no. So it's not matching.

Wait, let's consider if the key is G minor. Let's look again:

G minor natural:

G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

v chord: Dbm (Db, F, Ab). Yes! So Dbm is v chord. What's the vi chord? Ebmaj.

So Dbm/Ab would be v chord in second inversion. That fits.

Now, what about Gb/Bb? Gb is a note that's not in G minor natural. G minor natural has Ab, but Gb would be F#. Let's see.

In G minor natural, the chords:

i: Gm

ii°: Ab°

iii: Bbm

iv: Cm

v: Dbm

VI: Ebmaj

VII: Fmaj

So the Gb chord isn't diatonic here. But if it's harmonic minor, G harmonic minor: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F#.

Chords:

i: Gm

ii°: Ab°

III: Bbm

iv: Cm

V: Dbmaj (yes, V chord in harmonic minor is major)

VI: Ebmaj

vii°: F#°

In this key, the V chord is Db major, not minor. But we have Dbm/Ab. So Db minor. Not matching.

Wait, but in G harmonic minor, the V chord should be major. So Dbmaj. But the chord listed is Dbm/Ab. Db minor, so that would not be the V. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe a different key.

Let me think of all chords in the progression:

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb

- Dbm/Ab

- B/Bb

- Emaj7/Ab

B/Bb is B major with Bb as bass. So it's a B major chord over Bb bass – which is B, D#, F#, with Bb in the bass. So the chord is Bb (bass), B, D#, F#. This is actually a "B major add flat 9" or something? Not sure. But this is a very dissonant chord, often used in jazz as a passing chord.

The Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

If I take all these notes: the chords seem to have a lot of chromatic movement.

Wait, another idea: the bass line might be the key. From the bass notes:

The bass seems to be mostly Bb, then Ab appears in Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, and also B/Bb which has bass Bb.

B/Bb chord – if it's written as B/Bb, it means bass is Bb, chord is B major. So the bass notes for the sequence:

1. Bb

2. Bb

3. Bb

4. Bb

5. Bb

6. Bb

7. Ab

8. Bb

9. Bb

10. Bb

11. Bb

12. Bb

13. Bb

14. Bb

15. Ab

16. Bb

So the bass alternates between Bb and Ab.

This suggests a I - bVII relationship in the key of Bb major? Because Bb major's I is Bb, and VII is Ab.

Yes! In Bb major, the VII chord is Ab major. So if the bass is alternating between Bb (I) and Ab (VII), that would fit. Let's explore this.

Key: Bb major.

Chords in Bb major:

Bbmaj, Cm, Dm, Ebmaj, Fmaj, Gm, A°

But our chords include Bbdim, which is not in Bb major.

But perhaps the chords are using extensions or substitutions.

Wait, Bbdim would be B♭, D♭, F♭. In Bb major, the scale has Db and Fb? No, Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A.

So no D♭ or F♭. So Bbdim is not diatonic. Hmm.

But if it's Bb major, then Ab is the VII chord (Ab major). So if the bass is moving between Bb and Ab, that's I and VII.

But the chords given: Bbdim, Gb/Bb.

Wait, Gb/Bb: if in key of Bb major. Gb is F#; so F# major chord in key of Bb? Not really.

But maybe if the key is Ab major. In Ab major, chords:

Abmaj, Bbm, Cm, Dbmaj, Ebmaj, Fm, G°

So VII chord is G°. But again, Bbdim is Bb diminished, which might be a iv chord in Ab major? No.

In Ab major, iv chord is Dbmaj. Not related.

This doesn't seem to work.

Wait, another idea. The chord B/Bb: B major with Bb bass. In a key of A minor, for example. A minor has G and G# in harmonic minor.

But A minor scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#.

The B chord could be related. But B/Bb bass – so B major over Bb bass. Not sure.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is C minor with lots of chromaticism.

C minor natural: C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb.

v chord is Gbm.

But the chord Dbm/Ab – Dbm is ii chord? No. In C minor, ii is Db°.

Not sure.

Wait, going back to the beginning. Maybe "Bbdim" is actually a B♭dim7 chord. But the symbol says Bbdim, which is usually triad.

Alternatively, perhaps the mode is Dorian or something.

Another thought: let's look at the Emaj7/Ab chord. If Emaj7 is played over Ab bass, this could be a Db major chord with a raised sixth or something. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. Ab bass: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. If we combine all these pitches: Ab, B, E, G#, D#.

But if we arrange them in ascending order: Ab, B, D#, E, G#.

Which is equivalent to: G#, A, B, D#, E – which doesn't seem to ring a bell.

Wait, G#, B, D#, E – that's a G# major triad with E. Wait, G# major is G#, B#, D#. But here we have G#, B, D#, E. B natural instead of B#. So not quite.

This is getting too hard. Let's try a different strategy.

List all the chords with their functions.

1. Bbdim: could be vii° in C minor (but C minor has B°), no. Or perhaps in F minor, but F minor has Bb°.

Wait, in F minor natural: F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: Gb°

III: Abmaj

iv: Bbm

v: Cbm (B minor)

VI: Dbmaj

VII: Ebmaj

So Bbdim would not be present.

Wait, Gb° is the ii° chord. Gb° is Gb, Bbb, Db. Which with Bbb being A, so Gb, A, Db.

But Bbdim is Bb, Db, F.

Not matching.

Wait, another approach. Let's assume common chord progressions have a tonic, dominant, etc.

But without major or dominant chords, it's hard.

Wait, there's a B/Bb chord. B major with Bb bass. That sounds like a chord where the bass is Bb, and the chord is B major. This resembles a tritone substitution or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, the B/Bb could be part of a Gb major chord.

If B is a bass note, no – but here bass is Bb.

Wait, perhaps the key is D♭ major.

D♭ major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords: I Dbmaj, ii Ebm, iii Fm, IV Gbmaj, V Abmaj, vi Bbm, vii° Cdim.

If we have Bbdim chord, it's not diatonic here. But Bb is vi chord (Bbm). Bbdim is different.

But let's imagine the progression has some of these chords. Gb/Bb would be IV chord in D♭ major. Gbmaj, yes. So Gb/Bb is first inversion of Gbmaj.

But then Dbm/Ab: Db minor. In D♭ major, the iii chord is Fm. Not Db minor.

Hmm.

Wait, if the key was something like E minor:

E minor natural: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

Not matching the flats.

Another idea: the presence of Bbdim could mean the key has B♭ as flattened seventh of something. Not sure.

Wait, think about the song's possible use of Phrygian mode. Phrygian has flat second, which is common in Spanish music.

For example, C Phrygian: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb.

Chords include Cm, Dbmaj, etc.

But not sure how it fits.

In C Phrygian:

Chord on i: Cm

ii°: Db°

III: Ebmaj

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Abmaj

VII: Bbm

So Bbdim isn't present.

But if in Ab Phrygian: Ab Bbb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb.

Not helpful.

Wait, let's consider the bass movement between Ab and Bb. That's a stepwise motion down. In Bb major, the VII chord is Ab major, so moving from Bb to Ab is I to VII.

If the key is Bb major, the VII chord is Ab major. So if they're using Ab major as a chord, that makes sense. But our chord progression has Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab. So Ab is serving as a chord.

If key is Bb major, then Ab is VII chord. But the chord symbols given for those bars:

- Dbm/Ab would be Db minor chord in bass Ab? So Ab, Db, Fb.

- Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, and Emaj7.

In Bb major key, Eb is the subdominant. So a Db minor chord would not be part of Bb major.

But perhaps it's a borrowed chord from a different mode.

Another thought: the chord B/Bb – if B is the chord root, with Bb bass. So it's like a B major chord but with Bb in bass. That gives a Bb B D# F# chord. Which can be considered as Eb7(b9) if we rearrange the notes. Eb7b9 would have E flat, G, Bbb (A), D flat, minus the 7th. No. Maybe.

Alternatively, B/Bb could be part of a V chord in Eb minor. Not sure.

I'm really stuck here. Let's try to look up chord functions in common keys.

Wait, Bbdim as the diminished chord for a V/vi in a minor key. For example, in Am, the V of vi (which is F major) would be E dim or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, the common diminished chord in many contexts is as a leading tone to a minor chord.

For example, Bbdim could be the leading tone to Cm. But Cm is not in our chords.

Another idea: the chord Emaj7/Ab. Emaj7 has G# and D#. If we consider Dbm/Ab is D♭ minor, then Ab bass.

Perhaps this is in the key of G minor with a borrowed chord.

Wait, let's think of the Ab bass notes. If the bass is mostly Ab and Bb, that suggests a tonic of Ab or Bb. If it's Ab, then chords built on Ab...

If the key is Ab minor:

Ab minor natural: Ab, Bbb (A), Cb, Db, Ebb (D), Fb, Gb

This is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps it's simpler to consider that the presence of B♭dim chord and Gb chord – Gb is F# – which might imply a key where F# is common.

But all the other notes are flats.

Alternatively, perhaps this is in the key of B minor, but with lots of flats? Doesn't make sense.

Wait! What if the key is G minor? Let's re-examine.

G minor natural: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F.

Chords:

i: Gm

ii°: Ab°

III: Bbm

iv: Cm

v: Dbm

VI: Ebmaj

VII: Fmaj

So Dbm is v chord. So Dbm/Ab would be v chord with Ab bass (second inversion).

Now, Gb/Bb – in G minor, Gb is the same as F#. Not in the natural minor scale. But in G harmonic minor, the scale has F#, not Gb. So if we have Gb/Bb, it's an A♭ chord, which isn't standard.

But what about the B/Bb chord? B major with Bb bass. In G minor, B is the raised 7th scale degree in harmonic minor. B natural is in harmonic minor. So B chord could be the III chord. In G harmonic minor: chords include Bbm. Not sure.

In G harmonic minor:

V chord is Db major. So Dbmaj.

But the V chord is major in harmonic minor.

So Dbmaj is V, but we have Dbm/Ab which is minor. So not matching.

But maybe if the key is D minor? D minor natural: D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb, C.

Chords:

i: Dm

ii°: Eb°

III: Fmaj

iv: Gm

v: Am

VI: Bbm

VII: Cmaj

No Bbdim mentioned here.

Wait, this isn't working. Let's try a different strategy.

Let's list the pitches in all chords and see if they fit a scale.

All chord symbols:

- Bbdim: B♭, D♭, F♭ (E)

- Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db → Bb, Gb, Db

- Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb, Ab → Ab, Db, Fb

- B/Bb: B natural, D#, F#; with Bb bass → Bb, B, D#, F#

- Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D#; with Ab bass → Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Combined notes from all chords:

B♭, D♭, E (from Bbdim)

B♭, G♭, D♭ (from Gb/Bb) → G♭ is F#, D♭

Ab, Db, Fb (E) → Ab, Db, E

B♭, B, D#, F# (B/Bb)

Ab, E, G#, B, D# (Emaj7/Ab)

Now, gathering all these unique notes, including enharmonics:

- B♭ (A#)

- D♭ (C#)

- E (Fb)

- G♭ (F#)

- Ab (G#)

- B

- D# (Eb)

- F#

Wait, let's list all distinct pitches:

F# (or G♭), G# (Ab), A natural? Not sure.

Wait:

- B♭

- C# (D♭)

- E (or Fb)

- F# (G♭)

- G# (Ab)

- B natural

- D# (Eb)

- Also, in Emaj7/Ab: D# (which is Eb), G# (Ab), E

So the unique pitches include: B♭, C#, E, F#, G#, B, D#.

That's a lot. Let's see:

B♭, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, B.

That's almost all the chromatic notes except A natural, A#, etc.

This scale would be very chromatic. But maybe it's the octatonic scale? Octatonic scales have alternating whole and half steps.

For example, starting on B:

B, C, D♭, D, E♭, E, F#, G.

Not quite. This seems too random.

Given how complex this is, perhaps the intended key is B♭ minor, and many chords are used from the natural minor scale or with borrowed chords.

In B♭ natural minor:

Scale: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭

Chords:

i: B♭m (B♭, D♭, F♭)

ii°: C♭° (C♭, E♭♭, G♭)

III: D♭maj

iv: E♭m

v: F♭m

VI: G♭maj

VII: A♭maj

So the key has:

VI chord is G♭maj (which matches Gb/Bb chord)

B♭m is the tonic, but the chords given have Bbdim. Not sure. But Bbdim might be the ii° chord of C minor, but it's not matching.

However, the scale has G♭maj which fits Gb/Bb.

Also, Dbm/Ab: Db minor. In B♭ minor, the iii chord is D♭maj. So it's major, not minor. So Db minor would be a borrowed chord from somewhere else.

Maybe it's in B♭ minor with harmonic or melodic influences.

For example, if the VII chord is A natural (harmonic minor), then in B♭ harmonic minor: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A

Chords:

i: B♭m

ii°: C♭°

III+: D♭aug

iv: E♭m

V: F♭maj

VI: G♭maj

vii°: A°

Here, the VI is G♭maj, which fits. The ii° is C♭°.

But Bbdim isn't present, unless the song uses some other chord.

The D♭maj chord could function as III. But the song has Dbm chords, which isn't diatonic here.

Wait, but Dbm would be Db minor – in this scale, if you have the minor key, maybe it's using D♭ minor as a borrowed chord from parallel major. But this is speculative.

Another idea: the progression might be in E minor, but with many flats. Doesn't seem likely.

Wait, think about the last chord: Emaj7/Ab. If this is the ending chord, but it ends with Bbdim. So the tonic would be the most prominent chord.

If Bbdim is recurring many times, maybe the root is B♭.

But Bbdim is a diminished chord, which is usually not tonic.

Unless it's a mode that has diminshed tonic.

But that's rare.

Wait, maybe the mode is Locrian. Locrian mode has diminished tonic chord.

For example, B Locrian: B, C, D, E, F, G, A.

Chord on B is Bdim.

Yes! B Locrian mode would have Bdim as tonic.

But the key is based on the scale, but all the other chords need to fit into it.

B Locrian: notes B, C, D, E, F, G, A.

But our chords have flats like B♭, G♭, etc. So likely not.

But if it's B♭ Locrian:

B♭ Locrian: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭

Yes! The B♭ Locrian mode.

Let's check:

B♭ Locrian is built on B♭ as the root, with scale: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭.

It's the mode that has a diminished tonic chord. In fact, for any Locrian mode, the tonic triad is diminished.

Yes! For example:

The seventh mode of the major scale is Locrian, and its tonic chord is diminished.

So for the B♭ Locrian mode, it's the 7th mode of C major.

C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B

7th mode: B Locrian.

But B♭ Locrian would be the 7th mode of C♭ major? C♭ major scale: C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭.

Yes! The 7th mode of C♭ major is B♭ Locrian.

So the scale for B♭ Locrian is all the notes in C♭ major starting from B♭:

B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭

Yes.

Now, let's check if the chords in the progression fit into this scale.

The scale notes: B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭

Now, the chord symbols:

- Bbdim: yes, this is the tonic chord. In Locrian mode, tonic is diminished.

- Gb/Bb: G♭ chord. G♭ is part of the scale (as seventh note of C♭ major), and B♭ is the root in Locrian.

- Dbm/Ab: Db minor. In the scale of B♭ Locrian, Db is the third note. The chord on Db would be: Db, F♭, Ab.

F♭ is E, which is not in the scale (scale has F♭ as the sixth degree, but F♭ is E natural? No, F♭ is E. Wait, in C♭ major, F♭ is the fourth degree, which is E natural in equal temperament.

Wait, the B♭ Locrian scale uses F♭, which is equivalent to E natural.

Yes. So Dbm chord: Db root, F♭ (E), Ab. All notes in the scale.

- B/Bb: This is a problem. B natural isn't in B♭ Locrian scale. B♭ Locrian has C♭ (which is B), D♭, etc. So B natural would be outside the scale.

But the chord is B/Bb, which has B natural. That does not fit the scale.

Ah! So this might be a dead end. Unless they're using accidentals.

But the B natural in B/Bb suggests chromaticism.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab has E natural and G#. Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D#. G# is Ab in our scale? Wait, G# is A♭ in this scale.

Yes, Ab is in the scale.

E is Fb (F natural flat), which is the same as E natural.

But F♭ is part of the scale (yes, in B♭ Locrian scale, the sixth note is F♭).

So Emaj7/Ab has E (F♭), which is in the scale. And D# would be Eb, but Eb is in the scale as the fourth degree. Wait:

B♭ Locrian scale notes:

B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭

So E♭ is present, F♭ present, G♭ present.

But Emaj7 includes E natural, which is F♭? No: E natural is different from F♭. Wait, in music theory, F♭ is enharmonic to E natural. So yes, technically the same note. So E natural and F♭ are the same pitch.

Similarly, D# is Eb, and Eb is in the scale (fourth degree is E♭).

So let's see Emaj7/Ab.

Emaj7: E (F♭), G#, B, D# (Eb)

Now, G# is A♭ (since A♭ is in the scale), D# is Eb (which is in the scale).

B: in B♭ Locrian scale, the notes don't include B natural. The scale has C♭ and B♭. C♭ is B. So B natural would be outside the scale. Because in B♭ Locrian, the interval from root B♭ to C♭ is a semitone, so C♭ = B natural.

Ah! Yes! C♭ is B natural. So in the B♭ Locrian scale:

B♭, C♭ (B), D♭, E♭, F♭ (E), G♭ (F#), A♭

Yes! So the scale is:

1. B♭

2. C♭ = B

3. D♭

4. E♭

5. F♭ = E

6. G♭ = F#

7. A♭

So all the notes of B♭ Locrian scale are pitch names:

B♭, B, D♭, E♭, E, F#, A♭

Wait, but typically you wouldn't write it with both B and B♭. But yes, the notes of B♭ Locrian are: B♭, B, D♭, E♭, E, F#, A♭? No, wait.

Wait, C♭ = B, yes.

F♭ = E.

G♭ = F#.

E♭ is E flat.

So the scale contains: B♭, B (as C♭), D♭, E♭, E (as F♭), F# (as G♭), A♭.

But in reality, the scale has seven notes:

B♭, C♭ (B), D♭, E♭, F♭ (E), G♭ (F#), A♭

So in terms of pitches, it's:

B♭, B, D♭, E♭, E, F#, A♭.

But this has two different spellings for same pitches: B and E.

But yes, the scale has all these pitches.

Now, let's check the chords against these notes:

- Bbdim: B♭, D♭, F♭ (F♭ is E). So B♭, D♭, E. Yes, all in scale.

- Gb/Bb: Gb is F#, which is in scale. Bb is root.

- Dbm/Ab: Db minor. Db, F♭ (E), Ab. Yes, D♭, E, A♭. All in scale.

- B/Bb: B/Bb – chord is B major. B major chord is B, D#, F#. B is the C♭ note in scale, D# is Eb (but Eb is in scale as E♭), F# is G♭, which is in scale.

Wait! B major chord is B, D#, F#.

In B♭ Locrian scale, the pitches are B (from C♭), D♭, Eb (note), F#, A♭.

So B major chord would be B, D#, F#.

D# is Eb in the scale (which is present), F# is present (as G♭).

So B, Eb, F# – but B major typically has D# and F#, but Eb is not D#.

Wait, Eb is same as D# in equal temperament. So yes, theoretically, B, D#, F# is allowed with those pitches.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab: Emajor seventh is E, G#, B, D#.

In scale: E (F♭), G# (A♭), B (C♭), D# (Eb). So yes! All these pitches are in the B♭ Locrian scale.

G# is A♭, which is present.

Thus, B♭ Locrian seems to fit all the chords.

Let me check one by one:

- Bbdim: B♭, D♭, E (F♭) → all in scale.

- Gb/Bb: G♭ (F#), B♭, D♭ → all in scale.

- Dbm/Ab: D♭, F♭ (E), A♭ → yes.

- B/Bb: the bass is B♭, chord is B major → B, D#, F#. In scale: B (C♭), D# (Eb), F# (G♭) → yes.

- Emaj7/Ab: E (F♭), G# (A♭), B (C♭), D# (Eb), with Ab bass. So yes, all notes in scale.

Perfect! So all the chords fit into the B♭ Locrian mode.

Locrian mode is the seventh mode of the major scale. B♭ Locrian would be the 7th mode of C♭ major.

Which is a pretty unusual key, but possible.

The key signature for B♭ Locrian: since it's based on C♭ major, which has seven flats (C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭), but Locrian mode starts on seventh degree: B♭.

But in terms of key, it's often said to be in B♭ Locrian.

The chords all use notes only from B♭ Locrian scale:

B♭ Locrian: B♭, C♭ (=B), D♭, E♭, F♭ (=E), G♭ (=F#), A♭

So yes, the chords fit.

Let's verify one more chord: Emaj7/Ab is E, G#, B, D#. Which is:

E = F♭ (sixth scale degree)

G# = A♭ (seventh scale degree)

B = C♭ (second scale degree)

D# = Eb (fourth scale degree)

All present in scale.

B/Bb has B, which is C♭ in scale. D# is Eb (fourth), F# is G♭ (sixth). All good.

Dbm/Ab: Db, F♭(E), Ab → second, sixth, seventh degrees.

Gb/Bb: Gb (F#), Bb (root), Db → seventh, root, second.

Bbdim: root, second, sixth.

Yes, all fit.

Therefore, the key is B♭ Locrian.

The mode is Locrian.

This makes sense because Locrian has a diminished tonic, which matches the Bbdim chords being prominent. And all the other chords are built from the scale degrees.

The chord progression provided is **Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim**.

---

### **Key Analysis:**
After examining all chord symbols and their note components, the chords align perfectly with the **B♭ Locrian mode** scale.

#### **B♭ Locrian Scale (notes):**
```
B♭, C♭ (B), D♭, E♭, F♭ (E), G♭ (F#), A♭
```

This is the **7th mode of C♭ major**, and all chord tones in the progression fit within this scale:

- **Bbdim**:  
  - Notes: B♭, D♭, F♭ (E)  
  → All present in B♭ Locrian.

- **Gb/Bb**:  
  - G♭ major triad (G♭, B♭, D♭) with B♭ in the bass  
  → Notes: B♭, G♭, D♭  
  → All present in B♭ Locarian scale.

- **Dbm/Ab**:  
  - D♭ minor triad (D♭, F♭, A♭) with A♭ in the bass  
  → Notes: A♭, D♭, F♭  
  → All present in B♭ Locrian.

- **B/Bb**:  
  - B major triad (B, D♯, F♯) with B♭ in the bass  
  → Notes: B♭, B, D♯ (E♭), F♯ (G♭)  
  → All present in B♭ Locrian (D♯ = E♭, F♯ = G♭).

- **Emaj7/Ab**:  
  - E major 7th (E, G♯, B, D♯) with A♭ in the bass  
  → Notes: A♭, E (F♭), G♯ (A♭), B (C♭), D♯ (E♭)  
  → All present in B♭ Locrian.

---

### **Why This Key?**
- The **Bbdim** chord is the **tonic chord of Locrian mode**, as Locrian is characterized by a **diminished tonic chord** (Root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th).
- All other chords (Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Emaj7/Ab) use only notes from the B♭ Locrian scale, with no chromatic deviations.
- The bass line alternates between B♭ and A♭, which aligns with the **root (B♭)** and **seventh degree (A♭)** of the Locrian scale.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **Key**: **B♭ Locrian**  
- **Mode**: **Locrian** (7th mode of the major scale)  
- **Key Signature Implication**: C♭ major (7 flats: C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭)

This is an unusual but valid key, often used in jazz and modern music where a diminished tonic chord provides a dissonant, unstable tonal center. The progression fits entirely within the B♭ Locrian scale, confirming its identity.  

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**  
**Key: B♭ Locrian**  
**Mode: Locrian**
