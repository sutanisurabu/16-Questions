Analyzing the chord progression:

**Chord List:**
- Bbdim ×2  
- Gb/Bb ×2  
- Bbdim ×2  
- Dbm/Ab  
- B/Bb  
- Bbdim ×2  
- Gb/Bb ×2  
- Bbdim ×2  
- Emaj7/Ab  
- Bbdim

### Step 1: Look for a tonal center
The chord **Bbdim** appears **9 times**, far more than any other chord, suggesting **B♭** is a strong candidate for the tonal center.

However, **diminished chords are symmetrical** (built of stacked minor 3rds), so Bbdim = Ddim = Fdim = Adim. That means the chord alone doesn’t confirm a key—context matters.

---

### Step 2: Analyze bass notes and slash chords
Many chords are **slash chords with B♭ in the bass**:
- **Gb/Bb**: G♭ major (Gb–Bb–Db) over B♭ bass → notes: **Bb–Db–Gb**
- **B/Bb**: B major (B–D#–F#) over B♭ bass → notes: **Bb–B–D#–F#** → very chromatic!
- **Dbm/Ab**: Db minor (Db–E–Ab) over Ab → notes: **Ab–Db–E** (E is enharmonic to F♭)
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7 (E–G#–B–D#) over Ab → notes: **Ab–E–G#–B–D#**

These are **highly chromatic** and don’t fit neatly into a diatonic key.

---

### Step 3: Consider harmonic function
- **Gb/Bb** can be seen as **Bb minor 7♭5** (Bb–Db–Gb–? → missing 7th) → that’s the **iiø7** chord in **A♭ minor**.
- **Dbm** is the **iv** chord in **A♭ minor**.
- **Bbdim** functions as a **leading-tone diminished chord** in **C♭ major** (enharmonic to B major) or **A♭ minor** (as vii°).

But then we see **B/Bb** and **Emaj7/Ab**, which are **not native to A♭ minor**.

- **Emaj7** is **VII7** in **F# minor** or **III7** in **C# minor**, but over **Ab bass**, it creates a polychord: **Ab in bass + E major 7** → extremely dissonant, possibly a **tritone substitution** or **chromatic mediant**.

---

### Step 4: Check for octatonic or diminished scale usage
Given the **repetition of Bbdim** and highly chromatic chords (B/Bb, Emaj7/Ab), this progression may be based on the **diminished (octatonic) scale**.

- Bbdim fits into the **C half-whole diminished scale** (C–Db–Eb–E–F#–G–A–Bb) or **Bb half-whole**.
- The chords may be derived from **symmetrical diminished harmony**, common in jazz and 20th-century classical music.

---

### Step 5: Final assessment
Despite the chromaticism, the **consistent return to Bbdim** and **Gb/Bb** (which contains Bb in bass and Gb chord) suggests **B♭ is the tonal anchor**.

The presence of **Dbm** (iv) and **Gb** (bVI or II in minor) points toward **B♭ minor**, but B♭ minor would have:
- i: Bbm  
- ii°: C°  
- iv: Ebm (not Dbm)  
So **Dbm** is not diatonic to B♭ minor.

However, **Dbm = bIII in B major**, but we’re centered on B♭.

Alternatively, consider **A♭ minor**:
- i: Abm  
- ii°: Bbdim → ✔️  
- iv: Dbm → ✔️  
- VI: Fb = E major → Emaj7 appears! ✔️  
- V: Eb

So:
- **Bbdim = ii° in Ab minor**
- **Dbm = iv in Ab minor**
- **Emaj7 = VI (since F♭ = E)** in Ab minor

And **Gb/Bb** = Gb major over Bb = **iv/V?** or more clearly: **Gb = bVI in B major**, but in **Ab minor**, Gb is **bVII**.

Wait—in **Ab minor**, the **bVII chord is Gb major** → yes! So **Gb/Bb** is just **Gb major in first inversion**, functioning as **bVII** in **Ab minor**.

**B/Bb** is trickier—but B = E# = **VII of C#**, but in **Ab minor**, B is **#ii**, possibly a chromatic passing chord.

However, **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 over Ab = **VI7 in Ab minor** (since VI = Fb, enharmonically E).

So **Ab minor** explains:
- Bbdim = ii°  
- Dbm = iv  
- Gb = bVII  
- Emaj7 = VI7 (enharmonic)

Thus, despite the chromaticism and slash chords, the **most plausible key is A♭ minor**.

### Mode?
A♭ natural minor (Aeolian) is the base, but the use of **Emaj7 (VI major)** suggests **borrowing from melodic/harmonic minor** or **Dorian influence** (which has major VI). However, **VI major is characteristic of melodic minor (ascending)**.

But given the **ii° chord (Bbdim)**, which only occurs in **natural and harmonic minor** (not Dorian, which has ii half-diminished in minor keys), and **VI major** from melodic minor, this is likely **A♭ minor (harmonic or melodic)**.

However, the **tonal center feels like B♭** due to repeated B♭ bass.

Wait—reconsider: if **B♭ is the bass anchor**, and chords are built over it, maybe it's **B♭ as a pedal point**, not the tonic.

But **Emaj7/Ab** ends the phrase—on **Ab bass**, suggesting **Ab is the root**.

### Conclusion:
**Key: A♭ minor**  
**Mode: Minor (harmonic or melodic minor due to VI major and ii°)**

✅ Supported by:
- ii° = Bbdim  
- iv = Dbm  
- bVII = Gb  
- VI = E (enharmonic F♭)

Thus:

> **Key: A♭ minor**  
> **Mode: Minor (harmonic/melodic)**
