Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**

> Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb,  
> Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb,  
> Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb,  
> Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim

We’ll go step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### Step 1: Normalize the chord symbols

- **Bbdim**: Bb diminished (Bb, Db, Fb)
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb major with Bb in the bass (Bb, Db, Gb)
- **Dbm/Ab**: Db minor with Ab in the bass (Ab, Cb, Eb – but Cb = B)
- **B/Bb**: B major chord over Bb bass? That would be B natural (B), but Bb is B-flat. That creates **B/Bb (B over B-flat)** → very dissonant. This is likely a **spelling error** or **misinterpretation**.
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7th over Ab bass → Ab, E, G#, B (very dissonant with Bbdim context)

Wait — this last chord **Emaj7/Ab** is extremely unusual and likely **not correct notation**, or possibly a typo.

Let’s reevaluate.

---

### Step 2: Look for consistent root movement or harmonic function

We see repeated **Bbdim**, then **Gb/Bb**, **Dbm/Ab**, then **B/Bb**, then again Bbdim.

But let’s look more closely:

#### Common tones and voice leading:

- **Bbdim** = Bb, Db, Fb (Fb = E)
- **Gb/Bb** = Bb, Db, Gb → this is **Gb major in first inversion** (3rd in bass)
- **Gb major** = Gb, Bb, Db → so Gb/Bb is just Gb with Bb in bass
- So **Bbdim → Gb/Bb**: they share **Bb and Db**. Only the root differs: Bb → Gb (same as F#)

Now, what key contains both **Gb major** and **Bb diminished**?

Let’s consider **C minor** — especially **Bb diminished** is the **ii°** in C minor?

No — in **C minor**: ii° is **Ddim** (D, F, Ab)

Wait — in what key is **Bb diminished** a diatonic chord?

Bb diminished is built on **Bb**, with **Db** and **Fb (E)** — so it's **Bb, Db, E**

But that’s not a diatonic diminished triad in any major or natural minor key, because diminished triads in diatonic scales have two minor 3rds (whole step then half step), but Bb → Db → Fb is correct: **Bb–Db = m3**, **Db–Fb = m3**, so yes, it's a diminished triad.

But Fb is enharmonic to E, so the chord is **Bb, Db, E**

That’s a **Bb diminished triad** — but this **cannot** be diatonic to any standard key because **E natural** (Fb) is not a scale tone in keys with Bb and Db.

Wait — unless it's a **leading tone chord**.

Recall: diminished chords are often **leading-tone chords (vii°)**.

So what key has **Bb dim as vii°**?

Then the tonic would be **C**, because:
- vii° of C major = B dim = B, D, F
- vii° of C minor = Bb dim = Bb, Db, F

But F ≠ E — **Bbdim = Bb, Db, E**, not F.

So **Bb, Db, E** implies the third note is **E natural**, not F. So this is **not** Bb° as vii° of C minor (which would have **F**, not **E**).

Therefore, this **Bbdim with E** is actually:

- Bb, Db, E → this is **Bb dim(maj7)** or possibly a misanalysis?

Wait — this chord has **E natural**? But E natural is **enharmonic to Fb**, which is rare.

Alternatively: **Bbdim** is more commonly spelled as **Bb, Db, Fb**, where Fb = E, but in 12-TET it's E.

But Bb dim = Bb–Db–Fb = Bb–Db–E

However, **Fb is E**, so pitch-wise it’s Bb, Db, E — that’s not symmetric? Wait, no — a diminished triad has two minor thirds:

- Bb → Db = minor 3rd
- Db → E (Fb) = minor 3rd? Db to E is a **major 3rd** enharmonically, but **Db to Fb is a minor 3rd** (Db–Eb–Fb), so yes, it’s correct.

So **Bb dim** = Bb, Db, Fb (i.e., Bb, Db, E)

So it's a fully diminished triad? No — diminished triad has two stacked m3s → Bb to Db (m3), Db to Fb (m3), so yes, it's a **diminished triad**.

But it's **not** the diatonic vii° of any major or minor scale, because:

- In C minor: vii° = **Bb dim (Bb-Db-F)** → has **F**, not **E**
- In C major: vii° = **B dim (B-D-F)** → no Bb

So a **Bb dim chord with E (Fb)** isn't diatonic — unless it’s a **secondary leading tone chord** or **chromatic alteration**.

Wait — **Bbdim** = **leading tone chord to C?**

But **Bdim** leads to C, not Bbdim.

Bbdim would resolve to **C-flat**, but C-flat is B.

So:

### **Bbdim → Cb?** (Cb = B)

That makes sense — **Bbdim is the vii°7 of Cb**, which is enharmonic to **B**.

So **Bbdim** is **vii°7 of Cb major**, but Cb = B, so **Bbdim = vii°7 of B major?**

No:

- Cb major: Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb
- vii° of Cb = Bb dim = Bb, Db, Fb → yes
- So **Bbdim is the leading tone chord of Cb**

But **Cb** is **enharmonic to B**

So **Bbdim** functions as a **vii°7/Cb**, leading to **Cb**, but **Cb is enharmonic to B**

But in your progression, Bbdim goes to **Gb/Bb**, not to Cb.

Wait — let’s look:

After two Bbdim chords, we get **Gb/Bb** — which is **Gb major over Bb bass**

So **Bbdim → Gb** — shares **Bb and Db** — the Gb has **Gb**, not Cb

So **Bbdim → Gb**

Now, **Bb dim = Bb, Db, Fb**
**Gb = Gb, Bb, Db**

So shared tones: **Bb, Db**
Chromatic movement: **Fb (E)** → **Gb** — that's an **augmented unison or minor 2nd** — E to Gb = minor 3rd? No: E to Gb is enharmonic to E to F, which is m2.

Wait — Fb → Gb = **half step up (enharmonically E to Gb?)** — no:

Fb = E
Gb = Gb (≈ F#)
So E to Gb = **minor 3rd**, not a half step

That’s not smooth voice leading.

But **Fb → E**, and **in Gb chord**, the third is Bb, fifth is Db — no E or Fb

But Gb chord has **Gb** (the root), which is **not in Bbdim**

So voice leading: Bb stays, Db stays, Fb (E) → Gb? That’s a **half step up to Gb**? E to F = half step, but F to Gb is half step — so E → Gb = whole step? E–F–Gb → minor 3rd leap.

Not smooth.

Alternatively, maybe Fb resolves **down** to E (but already E), or to **D**, but no.

Wait — this may be better interpreted enharmonically.

Let’s try **enharmonic respelling**.

---

### Enharmonic Analysis

Let’s rewrite all chords with enharmonic equivalents:

- **Bb dim** = Bb, Db, Fb = **A#, C#, E** → so **A# dim**
- **Gb/Bb** = Bb, Db, Gb = **A#, C#, F#**
    - So: A#, C#, F# — which is **A# diminished 7th?**
    - A#-C#-E-G# → no, here we have F#
    - A# → C# → E → G#
    - But C# to F# is a **P4**, not m3

Wait — Bb, Db, Gb → all flat names: better to think as:

- Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db
- Gb/Bb = Bb, Db, Gb → same chord

So chord tones: **Bb, Db, Gb**

Now, **Gb** is enharmonic to **F#**

So maybe we are in **G# minor?** or **B major?**

Let’s look at **Dbm/Ab**:

- Dbm = Db, E (Fb), Ab
- Dbm/Ab = Ab, Db, E (Fb) — so Ab in bass

Chord: Ab, Cb (B), Eb — wait, Db minor is Db, E double flat? No

Minor triad: root, minor 3rd, perfect 5th

- Db minor = Db, **Ebb** (D), **Ab**
- But in practice, it's written as **Db, E, Ab** — **E** is enharmonic to **Fb**, but **E is a major third**, not minor.

This is a **common mistake**: **Db minor** must have **Ebb (D)** as the third — but we often see it notated as **Db, E, Ab** — which is **wrong** — E natural is **enharmonically Fb**, but Fb is a diminished third from Db (Db to Fb = diminished 3rd), not minor.

Actually:

- Db to Ebb = minor 3rd (Eb)
- Ebb = D
- So **Db minor = Db, D, Ab** — enharmonically **Db, C#, Ab**

So if a chord shows **Db, E, Ab**, that would be **Db, E, Ab** → Db to E = **augmented 2nd**, which is not a minor third.

So likely **Dbm/Ab** is intended to be **Db minor with Ab in bass** → **Ab, Db, Fb (E)** — wait no, **Ab, Db, C#?**

Wait — confusion.

Let's clarify:

- **Db minor** chord: **Db** (root), **Ebb** (♭3), **Ab** (5)
- Ebb = D (enharmonically)
- So pitches: **Db, D, Ab**
- But D is enharmonic to **C#**, not E.

**E natural is Fb**, which is enharmonic to E, but Fb is not Ebb.

So if the chord is **Db, E, Ab**, that's **Db, E, Ab** — which is **not Db minor**, because E is a **major 3rd above Db** → this is **Db augmented** or just a misanalysis.

This suggests the notation might be using **enharmonic shorthand**.

Perhaps **Dbm** means the key of **Db minor**, but the chord is **D minor or C# minor**?

Let’s try enharmonic spelling of the entire progression:

Assume:

- Bbdim → A#°
- Gb → F#
- Dbm → C#m
- B → B
- Emaj7/Ab → Emaj7 over G#? (Ab = G#)

So let’s re-spell everything in sharps:

| Original       | Enharmonic Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Bbdim          | A#°                   |
| Gb             | F#                    |
| Dbm            | C#m                   |
| Ab             | G#                    |
| B              | B                     |
| Emaj7/Ab       | Emaj7/G#              |

Now the progression becomes:

> A#°, A#°, F#/B, F#/B,  
> A#°, A#°, C#m/G#, B/B,  
> A#°, A#°, F#/B, F#/B,  
> A#°, A#°, Emaj7/G#, A#°

Wait:

- Gb/Bb → Bb = A#, so F#/A# — but A# is not the third of F#
- F# chord is F#, A#, C#
- So F#/A# is **F# major in first inversion** — correct

Similarly, **C#m/G#** = G# in bass, C#m chord = C#, E, G#

And **B/B** is B major with B in bass = root position

**Emaj7/G#** = E, G#, B, D# with G# in bass

Now look at this:

- **A#°** appears repeatedly — leading tone chord?
- A#° resolves to **B major**? Yes — A# is leading tone to B

So **A#° → B** is a classic **vii° → I** in **B major**

Now check:

- **B major scale**: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, B
- A# is the leading tone
- A#° = A#, C#, E → yes, the **vii°** chord of B major

Then what about **F# chord**?

F# is the **V** of B major — F# major = F#, A#, C#

Yes!

So **F#/A#** is **F# major in first inversion** — still V chord

Then **C#m** = C#, E, G# — that's the **ii** chord in B major

Then **C#m/G#** = ii in third inversion

Then **B** = **I**

And **Emaj7/G#** — E major 7th = E, G#, B, D#

In B major:
- E is the **IV** degree
- E major is **not diatonic** — in B major, IV should be **E minor**, not E major

So **E major** is a **chromatic alteration** — **IV** instead of **iv**

This is a **common modal mixture** or **borrowed chord from B Lydian**? Not exactly — Lydian has #4, but IV chord is still major in major.

Wait — in **B major**, the IV chord is **E major** — yes! **E major is diatonic to B major**

B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, B

E major = E, G#, B → all in B major scale

G# is in B major (3rd note is D#; G# is 6th note)

Yes: B major has **G#**, not G natural

So E major = E, G#, B — all in B major

And D#? Emaj7 = E, G#, B, D#

Is D# in B major? Yes — D# is the 3rd of B major

So **Emaj7** = E, G#, B, D# — all notes are in **B major**

So **Emaj7/G#** is the **IV7** chord of B major in first inversion

Now check all chords:

- **A#°** = vii° of B major → **B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#**
    - A#° = A#, C#, E → yes
- **F#** = V of B
- **F#/A#** = V⁶ (first inversion)
- **C#m** = ii of B
- **C#m/G#** = ii⁶₄? Third inversion — rare but possible
- **B** = I
- **Emaj7** = IV⁷
- **Emaj7/G#** = IV⁶ or IV⁶₅ with G# in bass

So all chords are diatonic to **B major**!

Wait — but earlier we had confusion with **Dbm** — but we reinterpreted it as **C#m**

Similarly, **Ab** = G#

**Gb** = F#

**Bb** = A#

So the entire progression, when enharmonically respelled, fits **B major** perfectly.

---

### Final enharmonic respelling of chords:

| Original       | Enharmonic Spelling | Function in B major |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Bbdim          | A#°                 | vii°                |
| Gb/Bb          | F#/A#               | V⁶                  |
| Dbm/Ab         | C#m/G#              | ii⁶₄                |
| B/Bb           | B/B (was B/A#?)     | Wait — B/Bb?       |

Wait — hold on.

Original: **B/Bb**

We have **B major chord over Bb bass**? But Bb = A#, so **B/A#**

But B chord = B, D#, F#
A# = the leading tone

So **B/A#** = A#, B, D#, F# — very dissonant

But if we interpret **B/Bb** as **B/A#**, and since we're in B major, **A# is scale tone**, but **B chord over A#** is **unstable**

But in context, it appears after **C#m/G#** and before **Bbdim (A#°)**

Sequence:

> ... C#m/Ab (C#m/G#), B/Bb (B/A#), Bbdim, ...

So: **C#m/G# → B/A# → A#°**

But **B/A# → A#°** makes sense — the **B in chord drops to A#**, and the chord becomes A# diminished.

So **B/A#** could be a **I chord in second inversion**? No — A# is not the fifth of B.

B major: B (root), D# (3rd), F# (5th), A# (7th) — no, A# is not in B major chord.

B major = B, D#, F#

A# is chromatic in this context? No — A# is in the scale, but not in the B major chord.

So **B/A#** = **B major with A# in bass** — this is not a standard diatonic chord.

Unless it’s a **misnotation**.

Possibility: **"B/Bb"** was meant to be **"Bb/Bb"**, but that contradicts.

Another idea: **"B/Bb"** might be a typo for **"Bdim/Bb"**, but it’s written as **B**, not **Bdim**.

Wait — in the original: "B/Bb"

But in context, it comes after "Dbm/Ab", then "Bbdim"

And earlier: Gb/Bb, etc.

Wait — look: the bass line might be telling.

Let’s extract the **bass notes**:

1. Bbdim → bass? Usually root, so **Bb**
2. Bbdim → **Bb**
3. Gb/Bb → **Bb** (explicit)
4. Gb/Bb → **Bb**
5. Bbdim → **Bb**
6. Bbdim → **Bb**
7. Dbm/Ab → **Ab**
8. B/Bb → **Bb**
9. Bbdim → **Bb**
10. Bbdim → **Bb**
11. Gb/Bb → **Bb**
12. Gb/Bb → **Bb**
13. Bbdim → **Bb**
14. Bbdim → **Bb**
15. Emaj7/Ab → **Ab**
16. Bbdim → **Bb**

So bass line:

> Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb

So the bass alternates between **Bb** and **Ab**

Now, in **B major**, **Bb** is **A#**, **Ab** is **G#**

So bass line: A#, A#, …, G#, A#, ..., G#, A#

And chords:
- Over Bb (A#): Bbdim (A#°), Gb (F#), Dbm (C#m), Emaj7
- Over Ab (G#): Dbm, Emaj7

So chords:

- A#° over A# → A#°
- F# over A# → F#/A# → V⁶
- C#m over G# → C#m/G# → ii⁶₄
- B over A# → B/A# → problematic
- Emaj7 over G# → Emaj7/G# → IV⁶₅

But **B/A#** = B with A# in bass — not in B major harmony

However, if we assume **"B/Bb"** is a typo, and it should be **"C#m/B"** or something else, but not likely.

Alternatively, **"B"** might be a misnotation for **"Bdim"** — which would make sense: **Bdim/Bb** = Bdim over Bb

But Bdim = B, D, F

Bb = A#

Bdim/A# → A#, B, D, F

Not obviously helpful.

But **Adim7**?

Wait — **A#°** is the same as **Bbdim** — already used.

But **Bdim** is different from **Bbdim**

Bbdim = Bb, Db, Fb (A#, C#, E)

Bdim = B, D, F

Not the same.

But perhaps **"B/Bb"** is meant to be **"Ab"** or **"G#"** chord?

Given that after **C#m/Ab**, we have **B/Bb**, which goes to **Bbdim**

But C#m/Ab → B/Bb → Bbdim

Smoother: C#m/Ab → G#/B → A#° → B

But we have **B/Bb** written

Perhaps it's **"G#/B"** misread as **"B/Bb"**?

Unlikely.

Alternatively, **"B/Bb"** could be **"Bdim"** with bass **Bb**, but still.

Given that all other chords fit **B major** when enharmonically spelled, and **B/Bb** is the only outlier, likely this is a **notational error**, or it's short for **B°**.

But in context, after **C#m/G#**, a **B major over A#** bass doesn’t make harmonic sense.

Unless it’s a **passing chord** or **voice leading** device.

But if we ignore the internal tension and look at the overall harmony:

- Repeated **A#°** (Bbdim) — vii° of B
- **F#/A#** — V⁶ of B
- **C#m/G#** — ii⁶₄
- **Emaj7/G#** — IV⁶₅
- Then back to A#°

This progression feels like a **cycle of fifths** or **descending fifths**:

- A#° → F# → C#m → B? Not quite
- F# → C#m → B → A#° → but not logical

But the chords are:

A#° → F# → A#° → C#m → B/A#? → A#° → F# → Emaj7 → A#°

Not strong.

Alternatively, the **Emaj7/Ab** might be a **chromatic mediant** or modulation.

But earlier analysis shows **Emaj7** is **IV** in B major — fine.

---

### Final Determination:

Despite the **"B/Bb"** chord being problematic, the majority of chords — when enharmonically respelled — are diatonic to **B major**:

- **Bbdim** = A#° = vii°
- **Gb/Bb** = F#/A# = V⁶
- **Dbm/Ab** = C#m/G# = ii⁶₄
- **Emaj7/Ab** = Emaj7/G# = IV⁶₅

Only **B/Bb** doesn't fit.

Possibility: **"B/Bb"** is a typo for **"B/B"**, i.e., **I chord** in root position.

That would make perfect sense:

> ... C#m/Ab → B/B → Bbdim ...

But Bbdim is A#, not B.

But **B → A#°** is classic: **I → vii°**, which then resolves back to V or I.

In fact, common progression: **ii → V → I → vii°**, but here it's **ii → I → vii° → V**, etc.

So likely, **"B/Bb"** is a **mistake**, and it should be **"B/B"** (B major in root position).

Alternatively, if it's **"Bdim/Bb"**, that could work as a **vii°7** chord, but already have Bbdim.

Given all this, the most coherent interpretation is:

### ✅ Key: **B major**  
### ✅ Mode: **Ionian** (major)

All chords (except possibly "B/Bb") are diatonic to B major when enharmonically respelled.

---

### Final Answer:

**Key: B major**  
**Mode: Ionian**
