To determine the **key and mode** of this chord progression:

```
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb –  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim
```

We’ll analyze harmonic function, tonal center, and possible scales/modes that fit.

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center

- **B♭dim** appears **very frequently**—it’s the backbone of the progression.
- The bass often stays on **B♭** (e.g., Gb/Bb, B/Bb), suggesting **B♭ as a pedal tone** or tonal center.
- The chord **B/Bb** (B major over B♭ bass) is highly dissonant and colorful—this is an **upper structure** or altered chord, not a functional dominant.
- Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab** is also highly chromatic.

So, the **bass note B♭** is a strong candidate for **tonic**, even though the harmony is highly chromatic and non-diatonic.

---

### Step 2: Analyze chord qualities

List of unique chords (simplified):

- **B♭dim** = B♭–D♭–E–G (fully diminished 7th if extended)
- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major over B♭ → B♭–D♭–G♭ (actually **B♭m7♭5**, or half-diminished)
- **Dbm/Ab** = D♭ minor over A♭ → A♭–C♭–D♭–F♭ = A♭–C♭–D♭–E (since F♭ = E) → This is **A°7** (A–C–E♭–G♭ enharmonically), but written oddly. Might function as **diminished**.
- **B/Bb** = B major (B–D♯–F♯) over B♭ → creates a **B♭ bass with +1, #9, #11** tensions → very altered, used for tension or polychord.
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G♯–B–D♯ over A♭ bass → again, extreme dissonance; possibly **Ab7#9#5** or similar if reinterpreted.

These chords suggest **chromaticism**, **diminished harmony**, and possibly **modal interchange** or use of **symmetrical scales**.

---

### Step 3: Consider diminished symmetry

- **B♭dim7** = B♭–D♭–E–G
- This is one of the **three diminished 7th chords** in the **fully diminished scale** (which repeats every minor 3rd).
- The **half-whole diminished scale** starting on B♭ is:  
  **B♭–B–D♭–D–E–F–G–A♭–(B♭)**

This scale contains:
- B♭dim7 (B♭–D♭–E–G)
- Gb major (G♭–B♭–D♭) → present as Gb/Bb
- D♭ minor (D♭–F♭–A♭ = D♭–E–A♭) → close to Dbm/Ab
- E major (E–G♯–B) → present in Emaj7/Ab (though G♯ = A♭ enharmonically)
- B major (B–D♯–F♯) → D♯ = E♭, F♯ = G♭ → fits the diminished scale’s notes

**All these chords can be derived from the B♭ half-whole diminished scale**:

> **B♭ Half-Whole Diminished Scale**:  
> B♭ – B – D♭ – D – E – F – G – A♭

Enharmonic equivalents:
- E = F♭
- B = C♭
- D = C♯
- G = F♯

So:
- **Gb = F♯**, present
- **D♭m** uses D♭–E–A♭ (E = F♭), fits
- **E major** uses E–G♯(=A♭)–B, all in the scale
- **B major** uses B–D♯(=E♭)–F♯(=G♭); E♭ is **not in the B♭ half-whole scale** → Wait!

Hold on: **E♭ is not in the B♭ half-whole diminished scale**.

B♭ half-whole: B♭–B–D♭–D–E–F–G–A♭

→ Contains **E natural**, **not E♭**.

But **B major chord = B–D♯–F♯ = B–E♭–G♭**

→ **E♭ is missing**, which suggests **B/Bb** might be a **non-scale tone** for added tension.

However, **fully diminished chords and scales are symmetrical**, and composers often **borrow from adjacent diminished collections** or use **chromatic passing chords**.

---

### Step 4: Is this in a traditional key?

Try fitting into **major/minor keys**:

- **B♭ minor?**  
  Diatonic chords: B♭m, C°, D♭, E♭m, Fm, G♭, A♭  
  → B♭dim is not diatonic (would be B♭m or B♭° in harmonic minor)  
  → Gb major is the **VI chord** – okay  
  → But Dbm is **iv**, okay  
  → But **Emaj7** and **B major** are **not in B♭ minor**

- **G♭ major?** (enharmonic to F♯ major)  
  Tonic = G♭ → but bass is B♭, which is the **3rd**, not tonic.

- **No traditional key** accommodates **Emaj7**, **B major**, and **B♭dim** together.

Thus: **not in a diatonic key**.

---

### Step 5: Evaluate mode

Given:
- Pedal on **B♭**
- Heavy use of **diminished harmony**
- Chords derived from **symmetrical diminished scales**
- Dissonant, tense, ambiguous sound

This strongly suggests the **B♭ diminished (octatonic) scale**, specifically the **half-whole diminished scale starting on B♭**.

In jazz and modern harmony, this is often used over **dominant 7♭9 chords**, but here it's used **modally**—with **B♭ as a static pedal** and chords rotating around it.

Thus, the **mode** is the **B♭ Half-Whole Diminished Scale**, used **modally** (not functionally).

> **Key center**: B♭  
> **Mode**: Half-Whole Diminished (Octatonic)

This is **not a traditional "mode"** like Dorian or Mixolydian, but in modern music theory, **octatonic scales are considered symmetrical modes**.

---

### Final Answer:

- **Tonal center**: **B♭**  
- **Mode**: **B♭ Half-Whole Diminished Scale** (octatonic)  
- **Not in a traditional major/minor key** — the harmony is **modal and symmetrical**, centered around **B♭** with extensive use of **diminished and chromatic upper structures**.
