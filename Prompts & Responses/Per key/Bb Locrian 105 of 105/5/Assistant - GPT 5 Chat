Let’s analyze the chord progression:  

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

### Step 1. Identify what chords we have
Let's flatten them out for clarity:

- **Bbdim** = Bb – Db – E (or F♯ enharmonically)
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major triad (Gb–Bb–Db) over Bb bass  
- **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor (Db–E–Ab) over Ab bass  
- **B/Bb** = B major (B–D#–F#) over Bb  
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 (E–G#–B–D#) over Ab bass  

---

### Step 2. Note relationships
- Bbdim (Bb–Db–E) could function as a **leading-tone diminished** chord to either **B minor** (as vii°) or **Cb major** (enharmonically the same).
- Gb major and Dbm occur together — these both fit naturally in **Gb major** (V is Db major/minor, IV is Gb itself).
- Emaj7 could be IVmaj7 in B major or a chromatic mediant to Gb major.

The **dominant tonality center** from recurring Gb chords suggests **Gb** is the home key or tonic area.

---

### Step 3. Spelling enharmonic relations
If we rewrite:
- Bbdim = vii° of **Cb (B)** — often used as a chromatic passing diminished built on the 6th scale degree of Gb.
- Dbm — a **minor v chord** relative to Gb major.
These are common color chords in **Gb major** progressions with borrowed/altered quality.

---

### Step 4. Bass movement
The bass alternates Bb–Ab–Bb frequently — Bb as scale degree **3** of Gb (6th when considering Bb as in the submediant role).  
That would make Bbdim (Bb–Db–E) a color chord on vi°.
Ending on Bbdim reinforces the diminished color rather than a clean tonic.

---

### Step 5. Tonal conclusion
All these chords relate most naturally to **Gb major** (or its parallel **Gb mixolydian/lydian/bebop** flavors).  
The frequent use of Bb in bass (the third of Gb) and relational chords like Dbm, Gb, and Emaj7 (chromatic mediant) suggests modal mixture.

---

✅ **Final Analysis**

**Key center:** Gb major (with borrowed/altered chords)  
**Mode:** Primarily **Gb major (Ionian)** with mixture from **parallel minor (Dbm as v**) and **chromatic mediant (Emaj7)**.  
If one wished to get more modal: could also describe it as **Gb Lydian**–inflected due to presence of E natural in Bbdim.

---

**Summary:**  
> The progression centers on **Gb major (Ionian/Lydian mixture)**, with **Bbdim** acting as a recurring chromatic embellishing chord.
