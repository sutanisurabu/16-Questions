**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast Thinking**

**Key:** A♭ minor

**Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor)

This progression uses only diatonic chords from the A♭ natural minor scale (A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭), including ii° (B♭dim), VII (G♭/B♭), iv/I (D♭m/A♭), III/ii (C♭/B♭, enharmonic to B/B♭), and VI maj7/I (F♭maj7/A♭, enharmonic to Emaj7/A♭). The bass emphasizes the tonic (A♭) and supertonic (B♭) for a repetitive, modal feel.
