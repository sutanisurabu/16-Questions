The chords present are:

*   **Bbdim**: Bbd, Dd, Fb
*   **Gb/Bb**: Bb, Dd, Fb, Gbb (or E) - This is a diminished triad in the numerator (Gb major chord in root position is Gb-Bb-Db; Gb major triad over Bb is a second inversion of Gb major)
*   **Dbm/Ab**: Ab, Bb, Dd, Fb - (or Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, Fb) - This is a first inversion of Dbm triad over Ab
*   **B/Bb**: Bb, Dd, Fb, Bb - (or B major triad over Bb)
*   **Emaj7/Ab**: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Let's look more closely at the common underlying pitch classes, especially those defining the diminished chords: **Bb, Dd, Fb**. This is the **B-flat diminished triad ($Bb^\circ$)**.

The most frequent chord is **Bbdim**. In music theory, a diminished chord often functions as a dominant substitute (a $\text{vii}^\circ$) or a tonicizing chord, leading to the root a half-step above (C major key) or a whole step above (D-flat major key if it's the $vii^\circ$ chord). However, when a diminished chord is the most prominent harmony, it often suggests the key itself is focused around the diminished sound, meaning the mode is typically related to **Harmonic Minor** or **Melodic Minor**.

Let's analyze the progression again, paying attention to the bass movement:
$Bb \to Bb \to Bb \to (Ab) \to Bb \to Bb \to Bb \to (Ab) \to Bb$
The bass is dominated by **Bb**.

The overall pitch collection used in the chords is:
*   Bbdim: Bb, Dd, Fb
*   Gb/Bb (I suspect this meant a root position Gb chord or $Gb^\circ$ chord given the context of Bbdim. If it's Gb $F^\circ$ B then the notes are $\text{Gb, Bb, Db}$): Let's assume the composer meant Gm (Bb, D, G)
*   Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, Fb, Bb (or Ab, Bb, Db, Eb)
*   B/Bb: Bb, Dd, Fb (assuming the B referred to $Fb$ being the B chord $B^\circ$)
*   Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Given the overwhelming presence of $Bb^\circ$ (Bb, Dd, Fb), this strongly suggests a focus on the $\text{Bb}$ pitch and the diminished quality.

**Possible Contexts for $Bb^\circ$:**

1.  **C Major/C Harmonic Minor:** $Bb^\circ$ is the $\text{vii}^\circ / \text{V}$ leading to $\text{V}$ (G or $\text{G}^\circ$). (Unlikely, as C is not resolved to)
2.  **D Harmonic Minor ($\text{Dm}_{harm}$):** $Bb^\circ$ is the $\text{v}^\circ / \text{iv}$ or $\text{vii}^\circ / \text{V}$. (Unlikely to be the tonic)
3.  **A Harmonic Minor ($\text{Am}_{harm}$):** The pitches of A Harmonic Minor are A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. $Bb^\circ$ (Bb, Dd, Fb) is not strongly contained.

**The most common mode that emphasizes a tonicized diminished triad is the Octatonic Scale (Diminished Scale).**

**The Diminished Scale (W-H pattern)** starting on $\text{Bb}$:
Bb, C, Db, Ed, Fb, Gb, Ad, $\text{Bb}$
The pitches present are **Bb, Fb, Db**. All these notes are included in the scale.

**The Diminished Scale (H-W pattern)** starting on $\text{Bb}$:
Bb, B, C#, D, E, F, G, $\text{Bb}$
(Less likely as it does not contain the Dd and Fb of the Bb dim)

Let's re-examine the progression using the common chords in Bbdim ($\text{Bb, Db, Fb}$):

*   $Bb^\circ$ (Bb, Dd [Db by enharmonic], Fb)
*   $Gb/Bb$ is likely $Gb \text{ major over Bb}$ ($Gb, Bb, Db$) -- This is $Bb^\circ$ if $Gb^\circ$ is meant.
*   $Dbm/Ab$ ($Ab, Db, Fb$) -- This is $\text{Db}$ minor triad, suggesting $\text{Db}$.
*   $B/Bb$ (B, D#, F# over Bb) -- This chord contains no notes of $Bb^\circ$ except $Bb$.
*   $Emaj7/Ab$ (E, G#, B, D# over Ab) -- This contains no notes of $Bb^\circ$.

The second half of the progression strongly contradicts the first half.

Given the extreme focus on the **Bbdim** triad in the progression (it is the dominant recurring chord *and* the bass note is consistently $\text{Bb}$), the tonality is centered around **Bb diminished**.

When a section is built primarily on a diminished triad, especially if it returns repeatedly to that triad in the bass, it emphasizes the qualities of that chord. This is often characteristic of music that modulates constantly or uses non-functional harmony (like in certain French music or specific types of film scoring).

**Conclusion based solely on the predominant harmony:**

**Key Focus:** $Bb^\circ$ (Bb Diminished) is the tonic anchor.
**Mode:** The structure is almost certainly influenced by a scale that contains $Bb^\circ$. The most appropriate scale is the **Diminished Scale (Whole-Half)** starting on $\text{Bb}$ (Bb, C, Db, Ed, Fb, Gb, Ad, Bb), or the **Bb Lydian b2** mode (implied by the $Bb^\circ$ chord).

However, since a majority of academic identification requires a clear diatonic or common minor key, and given this composition resists a simple label, we must prioritize the most stable, recurring chord.

***Final Determined Key and Mode:***

**Key:** Centered on Bb Diminished ($Bb^\circ$)
**Mode:** Given the highly chromatic and non-diatonic nature, the mode is best described as **Chromatic/Symmetrical**, specifically utilizing elements of the **Bb Octatonic Scale (W-H)** due to the nature and frequent reinforcement of the $Bb^\circ$ triad.
