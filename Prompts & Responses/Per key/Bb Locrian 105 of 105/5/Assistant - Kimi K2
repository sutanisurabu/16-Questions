This progression is built around **diminished and major 7 chords with chromatic bass movement**, not a traditional diatonic key. Here's the concise analysis:

1. **B♭dim** (B♭-D♭-E/F♭) implies a **diminished tonic** (unstable).  
2. **G♭/B♭** is a **G♭ major triad in 1st inversion**, creating tension with the B♭ bass (B♭ clashes with G♭’s B♭ as the 3rd).  
3. **E♭m/♭A♭** (Dbm/Ab) is **Db minor in 2nd inversion**, introducing **A♭** (♭II of G♭) and **Db** (♭V of G♭), intensifying the chromaticism.  
4. **Emaj7/Ab** is **E major 7 with ♭9 (E-G#-B-D# over Ab)**, a **tritone-substituted dominant** (E7/♭9 = B♭7/♭9) resolving back to B♭dim.  

**Conclusion**:  
- **No single key/mode** governs this progression.  
- **Syntax**: A **diminished-tonic loop** (B♭dim) destabilized by **chromatic inversions** and **tritone substitutions**, creating a **phantom key center** between **B♭ (diminished tonic) and G♭ (major triad)**. The **Emaj7/Ab** acts as a **collapsed dominant**, recontextualizing B♭ as a **non-resolving leading tone**.
