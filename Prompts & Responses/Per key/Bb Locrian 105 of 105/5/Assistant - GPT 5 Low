### Reasoning

**Analyzing chords for key and mode**

I need to determine the key and mode from a given chord sequence, which includes Bbdim, Gb/Bb, and others. The chords entail some interesting combinations, like Bbdim functioning as a leading-tone diminished chord. 

It seems like this could potentially be in the key of Gb major, especially since I see the Gb major chord here. Let’s see if Bbdim and the other chords align with this scale. It's essential to analyze carefully to get to the right conclusion.**Clarifying chord context**

I’m analyzing the enharmonic equivalents with the Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. The diatonic triads here include I Gb and ii Abm, but I realized that Fdim is the leading-tone diminished, not Bbdim. So, Bbdim isn’t native to this key. 

In Bb minor, which has its own scale notes and chords, I see that Bbdim isn't diatonic either because it includes Fb (E), not fitting in here. I’m starting to think that Bbdim might just be used as a passing diminished chord.**Exploring chord relationships**

I’m noticing that there’s no B major chord in the sequence, just B/Bb. Now, that’s intriguing! B major over Bb bass creates a tritone and suggests a dominant function. It feels like we might be borrowing from E major or following a Lydian context here. 

Then there’s Dbm/Ab, which is a Db minor triad over an Ab bass. This seems like it could be an Ab7b5sus chord. But since Db minor isn’t diatonic to Gb major, it likely suggests borrowing from either Gb minor or E major, which adds to the complexity!**Reharmonizing the chords**

I’m thinking about how C# minor is the vi chord of E major and how Dbm can be considered enharmonic to C#m. To simplify things, I’ll convert flats to sharps, suggesting E major as a potential key center.

For Bbdim, it turns out to be enharmonic to A#dim, a diminished triad that appears as vii° in B minor. This helps confirm that B is the key center. 

Then with Gb/Bb, I see that this becomes F# major over A# bass, which fits neatly into the diatonic structure of B major.**Determining key and mode**

I’ve analyzed the chords in the context of B major, where F#/A# is the diatonic V chord. Bbdim corresponds to A#dim, which fits into this key. For Dbm/Ab, this enhances to C#m/G#, maintaining the diatonic structure as ii6/4. 

B/Bb suggests a non-standard usage but can be viewed as B major over A# bass. Overall, it looks like the center is B major, in the Ionian mode. The progression creates tension around the leading tone, returning to Bbdim, supporting this conclusion.**Finalizing key and mode**

I realize that Emaj7 doesn’t fit into Gb major since the IV chord in that key would be Cb major instead. Also, Emaj7 would become Fbmaj7, which complicates things. In Gb major, Fb isn't diatonic.

So sticking to B major makes it clearer, where the prominent bass notes are A# and G#, indicating scale degrees 7 and 6. Therefore, the key center is B major in the Ionian mode. I can note how each chord functions, but I’ll keep it succinct.

B major (Ionian).

Why: Interpreting enharmonically,
- Bbdim = A#dim (vii° in B)
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# (V6 in B)
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# (ii6/4 in B)
- B/Bb = B/A# (I over leading tone)
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# (IVmaj7/3)

These functions fit cleanly in B major.
