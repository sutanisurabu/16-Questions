### Reasoning

**Identifying key and mode**

I’m trying to determine the key and mode, and it seems likely that it's Gb major. The Gb chord shows up frequently, and I see the Bbdim leading tone chord repeated, which aligns with Gb major. The scale for Gb major includes Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F, confirming the key signature has six flats. I note the leading tone is F natural, which fits with the diatonic vii° chord. However, our chord is Bbdim, possibly indicating it’s the ii°.**Computing diatonic triads in Gb major**

I’m working on identifying the diatonic triads in Gb major. The I chord is Gb-Bb-Db, the ii is Ab-Cb-Eb, which could indicate Abm, and the iii is Bb-Db-F, corresponding to Bbm. However, the Bbdim chord includes Fb instead of F, which suggests it may not fit. Bbdim is ambiguous, and I’m wondering if it might relate to C minor or Db minor, but neither aligns. Could it possibly be in Bb Locrian or Gb Mixolydian?**Exploring Bbdim and its function**

I’m considering that the Bbdim could act as an A#dim leading to B. A# is the leading tone to B, with the A#dim triad comprising A#, C#, and E. If I enhance it to match Bbdim as Bb, Db, E, I see the connection. This A# diminished triad might be the vii° in B minor or B major, resolving nicely to the B chord. I also note that the Gb/Bb chord, which is interesting, ties into this context.**Analyzing chord functions in B major**

Alright, looking at the Gb/Bb chord: it enhances to F#/A#, representing F# major over an A# bass. This makes it the V chord in B major, specifically in first inversion. Since Bb can enhance to A#, I confirm that Gb/Bb = F#/A#, fitting as V6 in B major. The Bbdim turns out to be A#dim, acting as the vii° of B. I’m also considering the B over A# chord, but realizing it's not exactly a typical cadential 6/4, despite the leading tone connection.**Determining key and mode**

Let’s summarize the mapping in B major. The Bbdim turns into A#dim, acting as the vii°. The Gb/Bb becomes F#/A#, functioning as V6. The B/Bb chord also shows B over the leading tone. Notably, the Dbm/Ab transforms to C#m/G#, representing ii6. Emaj7/Ab serves as IVmaj7 in first inversion. So, the overall key is B major, with the mode being Ionian (major). I'll present these findings concisely and show the roman numerals if needed.

B major (Ionian).

Enharmonic view:
- Bbdim = A#dim = vii°
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# = V6
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# = ii6
- B/Bb = I over leading tone (passing)
- Emaj7/Ab = IVmaj7/3

All point to B major.
