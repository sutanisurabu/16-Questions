Let’s break this down step by step.

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:  

1. **Bbdim**  
2. **Bbdim**  
3. **Gb/Bb**  
4. **Gb/Bb**  
5. **Bbdim**  
6. **Bbdim**  
7. **Dbm/Ab**  
8. **B/Bb**  
9. **Bbdim**  
10. **Bbdim**  
11. **Gb/Bb**  
12. **Gb/Bb**  
13. **Bbdim**  
14. **Bbdim**  
15. **Emaj7/Ab**  
16. **Bbdim**

---

## **2. Simplify chord names**

- **Bbdim** = Bb diminished triad (Bb Db Fb/E) — in a tonal context, diminished triads are often leading-tone chords.  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major with Bb in bass → Gb = Gb Bb Db, so /Bb makes it first inversion.  
- **Dbm/Ab** = Dbm = Db Fb (E) Ab, with Ab in bass → first inversion of Dbm triad.  
- **B/Bb** = B major (B D# F#) with Bb in bass — this is a very chromatic sound, possibly a **tritone substitution** or passing chord.  
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E G# B D# with Ab in bass — Ab is enharmonic to G#, so this is actually **Emaj7 in first inversion** (E G# B D# / G#).

---

## **3. Look for a tonal center**

The most repeated chord is **Bbdim**.  
Diminished chords often function as **vii°** or **common-tone diminished** chords.  

Let’s check Bbdim notes: Bb Db E (Fb) Gb? Wait — Bb dim triad = Bb Db Fb (E).  
Fb = E natural. So Bb dim = Bb Db E Gb? No — that’s Bb°7 (full dim 7).  
But here it’s just Bbdim triad, so Bb Db E (Fb).  

---

## **4. Possible keys**

Bbdim as vii° would be in **Cb major / Ab minor** (since vii° of Cb major = Bb Db Fb).  
But Fb = E, so in Cb major scale: Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb Cb. Yes, Bb° fits.  

But Gb major (Gb Bb Db) is bVI in Bb minor? Or IV in Db major? Let’s check:  

If key = **Db major**:  
- Gb = IV  
- Bbdim = ? In Db major, Bb min is vi, Bb dim is not diatonic. So maybe not Db major.  

If key = **Gb major**:  
- Gb = I  
- Bbdim = ? In Gb major, Bb min is iii, Bb dim not diatonic.  

---

## **5. Check Bbdim as common-tone diminished of Bb minor or Bb major**

Common-tone diminished: Bbdim → Bbm or Bb.  
But here Bbdim goes to Gb/Bb — Gb major with Bb bass — that’s not Bb tonic.  

---

## **6. Check B/Bb chord**  

B major = B D# F#. Over Bb bass = Bb B D# F# — very dissonant, could be a **German augmented sixth** in Eb minor.  
Spelling: Bb D F Ab is German aug6 in Eb minor → resolves to V = Bb maj. But here it’s B D# F# / Bb — enharmonically Bb D# F# A? No, B = B D# F#, plus Bb in bass = Bb B D# F#.  
That’s like a **tritone sub of F7 (V7 of Bb)** → but here it goes to Bbdim, not to Eb or Bb.  

---

## **7. Look at Emaj7/Ab**  

Emaj7/Ab = E G# B D# / G#.  
G# = Ab enharmonic.  
In terms of Eb minor, E major is V of A, not closely related.  
But E G# B D# with Ab in bass is a **polychord** effect — maybe it’s actually **Ab augmented major 7th**?  
Ab aug maj7 = Ab C E G — but here we have E G# B D# = E maj7, not Ab chord. So it’s two keys clashing.  

---

## **8. Possible interpretation**

Given Bbdim repeated so much, and Gb major appearing, maybe the key is **Gb major** and Bbdim is a borrowed/common-tone diminished.  
But B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab suggest **chromatic mediant** relations — maybe it’s **Bb minor** as tonic:  

In Bb minor:  
- Bbdim = ? Not diatonic but common-tone dim of i.  
- Gb major = bVI  
- Dbm = iv (Db Fb Ab)  
- B major = borrowed major III?  
- Emaj7 = borrowed VI?  

But Bb minor to E major is a distant relation.  

---

## **9. Mode suggestion**

The Gb major and Bb minor areas mixing suggest **Phrygian b4?** No — more like **melodic minor harmony** or **non-functional**.  

But given the final chord Bbdim and no clear major tonic, plus the Gb major as a stable sound, maybe the actual tonic is **Gb major** and Bbdim is just a chromatic neighbor.  

However, Bbdim is more likely vii°7 of **Cb major** (but we only have triad). Cb major = B major enharmonic — but then Gb is IV of Cb major, Dbm is i of Cb minor? Not consistent.  

---

## **10. Likely conclusion**

The progression is **highly chromatic**, but the most repeated “resting” harmony besides Bbdim is Gb major.  
Bbdim could be acting as **Gb major’s vii°** if we respell:  
Bbdim = Bb Db E (Fb) — but in Gb major, vii°7 = Fb A Cb Ebb (which is Fb A B D) — not matching Bb dim.  

But if we take Gb Lydian or Gb major with borrowed chords, Bbdim might be from G harmonic major? Gb harmonic major: Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Ebb F — Bb dim not there.  

Given the evidence:  

- **Tonic likely Gb major**  
- **Mode**: Major, but with heavy chromaticism (common-tone diminished, tritone sub B/Bb, borrowed from parallel minor/major)

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Gb\ major}
\]
