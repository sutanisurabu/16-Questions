Alright, let's tackle this chord progression step by step to determine its key and mode. Here's the given sequence:

**Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**

### Step 1: Understand the Chords
First, let's list out the chords with their full names to understand their structure.

1. **Bbdim** - Bb diminished triad: Bb, Db, Fb (E)
2. **Gb/Bb** - Gb major triad with Bb in the bass: Gb, Bb, Db over Bb
3. **Dbm/Ab** - Db minor triad with Ab in the bass: Db, Fb (E), Ab over Ab
4. **B/Bb** - B major triad with Bb in the bass: B, D#, F# over Bb
5. **Emaj7/Ab** - E major seventh chord with Ab in the bass: E, G#, B, D# over Ab

### Step 2: Analyze the Notes Present
Let's list all unique notes from these chords, ignoring bass notes for now (since slash chords just specify the bass).

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E
From Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db
From Dbm/Ab: Db, E, Ab
From B/Bb: B, D#, F#
From Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D#

Unique notes (enharmonic equivalents considered):
- Bb, Db, E (Fb), Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#

This seems a bit all over the place, but let's see if we can find a scale that fits most of these.

### Step 3: Look for a Central Key
Given the frequent Bbdim, let's consider Bb as a potential root or related key.

Diminished chords often function as leading tone chords or passing chords. Bbdim can be seen as:

- In the key of C minor: Bb is the 7th degree, so Bbdim is vii°7 (but here it's a triad).
- In the key of Db major: Bbdim is vii°/vi (but not directly diatonic).

Alternatively, let's consider the notes we have and see if they fit any standard scales.

Notes: Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, Gb, G#, Ab

This includes both B and Bb, D# and Db, etc., suggesting chromaticism or modal interchange.

But the presence of Emaj7/Ab is stark. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. The Ab in bass is the same as G#, so Emaj7/Ab is essentially Emaj7 in first inversion.

Given that, the Emaj7 stands out as a major seventh chord, which is diatonic in major keys. Let's see what key has Emaj7 as I or IV.

- Emaj7 as I: key of E major.
- Emaj7 as IV: key of B major.

But in E major, the diatonic chords are:
I: Emaj7
ii: F#m7
iii: G#m7
IV: Amaj7
V: B7
vi: C#m7
vii°: D#ø7

None of the other chords fit neatly into E major.

In B major:
I: Bmaj7
ii: C#m7
iii: D#m7
IV: Emaj7
V: F#7
vi: G#m7
vii°: A#ø7

Here, Emaj7 is IV, which fits. Now, let's see if other chords can be related to B major.

Bbdim: Notes Bb, Db, E. In B major, Bb is b9, Db is b3, E is 5. This is like a rootless A#ø7 (A#, C#, E, G#), but spelled differently. Not directly diatonic.

Gb/Bb: Gb major is bII in B major (neapolitan), but usually in first inversion (Gb/Bb is second inversion). Still, Gb major is chromatic in B major.

Dbm/Ab: Dbm is iv in Ab major, but here it's in B major. Dbm is iii in B major if we consider D#m, but Dbm is chromatic.

B/Bb: B major over Bb is just B major with b9 in bass, very chromatic.

This seems too chromatic for B major.

### Step 4: Consider Minor Keys
Let's try B minor.

B natural minor:
i: Bm
ii°: C#dim
III: Dmaj7
iv: Em7
V: F#7
VI: Gmaj7
vii°: A#ø7

Emaj7 is not diatonic here (would be Em7).

B harmonic minor:
i: Bm
ii°: C#dim
III+: Dmaj7#5
iv: Em7
V: F#7
VI: Gmaj7
vii°: A#dim

Still no Emaj7.

B melodic minor:
i: Bm
ii: C#m
III+: D#maj7#5
IV: Emaj7
V: F#7
vi: G#m7b5
vii°: A#ø7

Here, Emaj7 is IV, which fits! Now, let's see other chords in B melodic minor.

Bbdim: Bb, Db, E. In B melodic minor, Bb is b9, Db is b3, E is 11. This could be a passing diminished.

Gb/Bb: Gb is bII, very chromatic, but in melodic minor, bII is sometimes used (phrygian ♭2).

Dbm/Ab: Dbm is biii, which is chromatic (diatonic is D#maj7#5).

B/Bb: B major is not in melodic minor (i is Bm).

This still seems shaky.

### Step 5: Re-examine the Role of Emaj7/Ab
Emaj7 is the clearest major chord here. Let's consider E as the root.

E major:
As before, other chords don't fit.

E minor:
E natural minor:
i: Em7
ii°: F#ø7
III: Gmaj7
iv: Am7
V: B7
VI: Cmaj7
vii°: D#ø7

Emaj7 is not here.

E harmonic minor:
i: Em7
ii°: F#ø7
III+: Gmaj7#5
iv: Am7
V: B7
VI: Cmaj7
vii°: D#dim

No Emaj7.

E melodic minor:
i: EmMaj7
ii: F#m7
III+: G#maj7#5
IV: Amaj7
V: B7
vi: C#m7b5
vii°: D#ø7

Here, E is i, but we have Emaj7, not EmMaj7.

### Step 6: Consider Modal Approaches
Given the chromatic nature, perhaps it's better to see the diminished chords as passing or functioning in a modal way.

Bbdim appears frequently. Bbdim can be seen as:

- A rootless G7b9 (G, B, D, F, Ab) without G: B, D, F, Ab. But Bbdim is Bb, Db, E (Fb), which is like Bb, Db, E, Gb if fully diminished (Bb°7).

But we have Bbdim triad, not °7.

Similarly, Gb/Bb is Gb major over Bb, which is like Bb, Db, Gb, suggesting Gb major.

The sequence moves between Bbdim and Gb/Bb, which share Bb and Db, suggesting these are central.

### Step 7: Focus on Gb Major
Let's try Gb major:

Gb major:
I: Gbmaj7
ii: Abm7
iii: Bbm7
IV: Cbmaj7
V: Db7
vi: Ebm7
vii°: Fdim

Bbdim is not diatonic (vii° is Fdim), but Bbdim is like vii°/ii (Bbdim is vii° in C minor, but here it's in Gb).

Dbm/Ab: Dbm is iv in Ab minor, but in Gb major, Dbm is iii (normally Bbm).

This doesn't fit well.

### Step 8: Consider Gb Minor
Gb natural minor:
i: Gbm
ii°: Abdim
III: Bbbmaj7 (Amaj7)
iv: Cbm7 (Bm7)
V: Db7
VI: Ebbmaj7 (Dmaj7)
vii°: Fdim

Too convoluted with double flats.

### Step 9: Reconstruct the Harmonic Movement
Let's see the movement between chords, ignoring bass notes for key:

Bbdim -> Gb/Bb: Bbdim shares Bb and Db with Gb major, suggesting a tonic prolongation.

Dbm/Ab: Dbm is parallel minor to Db major, which is IV in Gb, but minor.

B/Bb: B major is very chromatic, leading to Emaj7/Ab.

Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 is a major seventh, which could be a modulation target.

Given the centrality of Gb and Bb, and the movement to Emaj7, this seems like a chromatic passage centered around Gb, with Emaj7 as a borrowed or modulation point.

However, the persistent Bbdim suggests a diminished function. In Gb major, Bbdim could be a passing vii°/IV (but normally Fdim).

### Step 10: Consider Diminished Symmetry
Diminished chords are symmetric. Bbdim (Bb, Db, E) can resolve in multiple ways, often acting as a leading tone chord.

Bbdim can resolve to:

- Cb (B) minor (as vii°)
- Eb minor (as vii°/iv)
- Gb major (as vii°/ii, but ii is Abm)

But it's not clearly resolving.

### Step 11: Final Key Assessment
Given the chords, the most stable major chord is Emaj7, appearing once, while Gb major chords (Gb/Bb) and Bbdim revolve around Gb.

Despite chromaticism, the tonal center seems to gravitate towards **Gb major**, with heavy chromaticism and modal borrowing. The Emaj7 is a surprise, possibly a brief modal interchange or chromatic approach, but the predominant shared tones are around Gb.

The mode is best described as **Gb major** with chromatic elements, given the diatonic basis is Gb major despite the non-diatonic chords.

However, the persistence of Bbdim and the lack of clear Gb major tonic makes this more like a **chromatic passage centered around Gb**, but since we must choose a key and mode, **Gb major** is the closest diatonic center, even if heavily altered.

Upon deeper reflection, the Bbdim and Gb/Bb share Bb and Db, suggesting these are the roots, and the movement is within a **Gb major tonality**, with the other chords as passing chromaticism.

Thus, the **key is Gb major**, and the **mode is major (Ionian)**, acknowledging significant chromatic deviation.
