To determine the **key and mode** of this chord progression:

```
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb –  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb –  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb –  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim
```

### Step 1: Analyze the chords

We’ll rewrite each chord in a more analyzable format:

- **Bbdim** = B♭–D♭–E–G♭ (a fully diminished 7th chord: B♭°7 = B♭–D♭–E–G♭)
- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major chord with B♭ in the bass = G♭–B♭–D♭ (a G♭ major triad)
- **Dbm/Ab** = D♭ minor over A♭ = D♭–E–A♭ (D♭m = D♭–E–A♭)
- **B/Bb** = B major over B♭ bass → B–D♯–F♯ / B♭ → highly chromatic, possibly a tritone substitution or altered dominant
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 over A♭ = E–G♯–B–D♯ / A♭ → very dissonant, possibly functioning as a German augmented sixth or altered dominant

---

### Step 2: Look for a tonal center

The **most recurring chord** is **Bbdim**, appearing **9 times** — this suggests B♭ is significant, but **diminished chords are unstable** and usually **lead somewhere**.

However, **Gb major** appears multiple times (as Gb/Bb), and **Gb = E♭ minor’s relative major**. Also note:

- **Gb major** = key signature of **6 flats**
- **Bbdim** = vii°7 in **C♭ major** (enharmonic to B major), but that seems unlikely.
- Alternatively, **Bbdim** can be seen as **vii°7 of C♭**, but again, C♭ is enharmonic to B.

But consider **B♭ as a root**:

- In **C minor**, B♭ is the ♭VII chord (B♭ major), but we don’t see C minor here.
- In **D♭ major**, B♭ is the **vi** degree, and **Bbdim** would be **vi°**, which is not diatonic (D♭ major has B♭ minor, not diminished).

Wait — **Bbdim** as a diminished chord **resolving to C♭**? But again, C♭ = B — that seems far.

Alternative idea: **This may be in D♭ minor**.

- D♭ minor = 7 flats (enharmonically C♯ minor — but let’s stay in flats).
- D♭ natural minor: D♭–E♭–F♭–G♭–A♭–B𝄫–C♭
- But **Bbdim** = B♭–D♭–E–G♭ → contains E natural, which is **not** in D♭ minor.

But **E natural** is the **raised 7th** in **D♭ harmonic minor** (C♮ → but wait, D♭ harmonic minor raises C♭ to C♮ — not E).

Hold on — maybe **enharmonic reinterpretation** is needed.

---

### Step 3: Consider enharmonic respelling

**Bbdim = B♭–D♭–E–G♭**

But **E = F♭**, and **G♭ = F♯**, so this could be **spelled as A♯°7 = A♯–C♯–E–G**

A♯°7 is the **vii°7 of B**, so maybe the key is **B major or B minor**?

Let’s try **B minor**:

- B natural minor: B–C♯–D–E–F♯–G–A
- B harmonic minor: raises A → A♯
- Chords:
  - vii°7 = A♯–C♯–E–G = **A♯°7**
  - That’s enharmonically **B♭°7** (since A♯ = B♭)

So **Bbdim = A♯°7 = vii°7 of B minor**

That fits!

Now check other chords:

- **Gb/Bb**: G♭ = F♯ — so **F♯ major** chord → in B minor, **IV chord** is E (minor), but F♯ is **V of ii**, or **Neapolitan**?

Wait, in **B minor**, the **Neapolitan chord** is **C major** (♭II), not F♯.

But **F♯ major** is **V/vi** or **V of iii**, but not diatonic.

However, **F♯ major** can be viewed as **secondary dominant**: V/vi (vi = G♯ minor), but again, not strongly supportive.

But what if **Gb = F♯**, and **F♯ major** is **the dominant of B**? No — dominant of B is **F♯ major** **only in B major**, not minor.

Wait — in **B major**, dominant is F♯ major — yes!

So if we’re in **B major**:

- B major scale: B–C♯–D♯–E–F♯–G♯–A♯
- V = F♯ major → matches **Gb = F♯**
- vii°7 = A♯°7 = Bbdim → yes!

So **Bbdim = A♯°7 = vii°7 in B major**
**Gb = F♯ = V in B major**

So far, so good.

Now check **Dbm/Ab** → D♭ minor = C♯ minor enharmonically

- C♯ minor = vi in E major, but in **B major**, C♯ is the **ii**, which is **C♯ minor** — yes!
- So **Dbm = C♯m = ii chord in B major**

And **Ab = G♯**, so **Dbm/Ab = C♯m/G♯**, which is **ii⁶** in B major (first inversion ii chord)

Great!

Now **B/Bb** → B major over B♭ bass

- B major = I chord in B major
- B♭ in bass = chromatic, possibly a **modal mixture** or **passing tone**
- Could be a **tritone sub**: B♭ is tritone of E, which is IV in B major — not clear, but possibly a **bass line movement**: G♭ (F♯) → G → A♭ (G♯) → A → B♭ → B

Wait — look at bass line:

From the chord symbols (bass notes):

- Bbdim → bass B♭
- Gb/Bb → bass B♭
- Dbm/Ab → bass A♭
- B/Bb → bass B♭
- Emaj7/Ab → bass A♭

So bass alternates **B♭ – A♭ – B♭ – A♭**

That’s a **chromatic or octatonic bass motion**, not strongly tonal.

But **Emaj7/Ab** → E major 7 = E–G♯–B–D♯

In **B major**, E is **IV chord**, but **E major** is diatonic (IV = E major in B major)

So **Emaj7 = IVmaj7 in B major**

And **Ab = G♯**, which is the **3rd of E major**, so **Emaj7/G♯** = IV⁶ in B major

Perfect!

So **Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G♯ = IV⁶ in B major**

Everything enharmonically fits **B major** if we respell:

- Bbdim → A♯°7 (vii°7)
- Gb → F♯ (V)
- Dbm → C♯m (ii)
- Ab → G♯ (leading tone)
- Emaj7 → IVmaj7

And the strange **B/Bb** — B major over B♭ — is likely a **voice-leading chord**, perhaps a **passing diminished or altered dominant**, or a **bass slide** from A♭ (G♯) to B via B♭.

This is common in jazz or chromatic harmony — the B♭ bass under B major creates a **minor 2nd clash**, but may be part of a descending chromatic bass: G♯ → G → F♯, but here it’s used differently.

Given all other chords **strongly point to B major**, and the **vii°7–V–ii–I–IV** relationships are all present (enharmonically), the **key is B major**.

---

### Step 4: Determine mode

Since the harmony aligns with **B major** (Ionian mode), and chords like V (F♯), IV (E), ii (C♯m), vii°7 (A♯°7) are all **diatonic to B major**, the **mode is Ionian**.

Even though there’s chromaticism (e.g., B/Bb), the **tonal center and diatonic framework** is **B Ionian**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: B major**  
**Mode: Ionian**
