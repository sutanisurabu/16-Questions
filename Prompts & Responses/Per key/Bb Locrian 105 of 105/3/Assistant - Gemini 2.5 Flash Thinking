### Reasoning

**Identifying the Progression's Core**

I'm focused on analyzing the chord sequence. So far, the repeated Bbdim chords are really grabbing my attention, and I'm looking for patterns in how they connect to the other chords, specifically Gb/Bb and Dbm/Ab. The repetition is key here; it really makes me wonder what the function of these chords is.


**Deciphering Chord Function**

I'm now zeroing in on the role of the B♭dim chords. They seem to be acting as a pivot, or even a deceptive cadence. The Gb/Bb often follows, which is interesting, but so does the Dbm/Ab. The B/Bb is a true head-scratcher. It's chromatic and dissonant in a way that suggests a passing or altered function, but the Emaj7/Ab is more confusing. I'm starting to think this is a modal piece, but can't yet confirm.


**Confirming the Tonal Center**

After analyzing the recurring chords, I've concluded this piece is centered around B♭, but with an intriguing twist. The diminished chords and chromatic movement suggest a non-traditional key. I'm leaning toward a diminished scale or a highly altered minor key. I'm now trying to find out where the Emaj7/Ab fits in, which is tricky.


**Synthesizing the Scale**

I've been trying to bring all the various elements together. After a lot of thought, I've concluded that the use of a diminished scale is most likely. Focusing on the intervals, especially around the core chords, the whole-half diminished scale appears most probable, as it contains most of the core pitches. Further analysis of the B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab chords may confirm this assessment.


**Finalizing Scale and Function**

The analysis is complete. After an exhaustive process, I've confirmed the key as B♭, employing a Half-Whole diminished scale, given the use of B♭dim and the prominence of notes like G♭ and A♭. The chord functions seem to center around a diminished tonic, reinforced by symmetrical relationships. The Emaj7/Ab is now more obviously a passing chord.


**Synthesizing the Observations**

I'm now consolidating the pieces of the puzzle. The B♭ is the tonal center, and the half-whole diminished scale is a very strong contender. I've re-evaluated the function of the B♭dim and Gb/Bb chords as the key to confirming this. The presence of Emaj7/Ab is still tricky, but I think the half-whole scale could explain it.




This progression is highly suggestive of non-diatonic harmony, primarily utilizing the features of the **Diminished (Octatonic) Scale**. The strong recurrence of the $\text{Bb}^\circ$ chord establishes B♭ as the tonal center, but the diminished quality of this "tonic" prevents it from fitting into standard major or minor keys.

### 1. Determining the Key Center

The most frequent chord (the chord of resolution, even if momentary) is $\text{Bbdim}$. Furthermore, the bass note $B\flat$ is present throughout almost the entire sequence, anchoring the harmony.

**Key Center: B♭**

### 2. Analyzing the Chord Palette and Scale

The progression features chords related by symmetrical intervals (minor thirds or tritones), characteristic of Octatonic music:

*   $\text{Bbdim}$: B♭, D♭, F♭ (E natural) (Tonic triad)
*   $\text{Gb/Bb}$: G♭, B♭, D♭ (A major chord built on $\text{B}^\flat$'s lowered 6th)
*   $\text{Dbm/Ab}$: D♭, E, A♭ (A minor chord built on $\text{B}^\flat$'s $\flat 3$)

If we compile the most consistent notes that define the $\text{B}^\flat$ center, we find: B♭, D♭, E, G♭, A♭.

This set of notes aligns perfectly with the **B♭ Diminished Scale, Half-Whole version ($\text{B}^\flat$ Octatonic)**:

**B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭♭ (D) E F G♭ A♭♭ (G) A♭**

*(Note: The B and Emaj7/Ab chords introduce chromatic inflections outside the main diminished scale but function as passing or color chords intended to deepen the symmetrical, "eerie" quality.)*

### Conclusion

The piece is centered around B♭, but the use of the diminished tonic and the symmetrical relationships between the other primary chords ($\text{Gb/Bb}$, $\text{Dbm/Ab}$) dictates a symmetrical scale.

**Key:** **B♭**
**Mode:** **Diminished / Octatonic** (specifically, B♭ Half-Whole Diminished Scale)
