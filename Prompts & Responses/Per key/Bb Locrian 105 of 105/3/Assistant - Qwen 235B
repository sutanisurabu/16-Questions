Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chord progression:**

> Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb –  
> Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb –  
> Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb –  
> Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

---

### Step 1: List the chords clearly with roots and bass notes

We'll interpret enharmonic equivalents where needed:

- **Bbdim** = Bb–D–F (diminished triad). Since Bb dim is vii° of Cb major or of C minor, but more likely rooted in C minor (vii°), we keep that in mind.
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major triad over Bb bass → Gb–Bb–Db, bass on Bb. So chord is **Gb major**, first inversion.
- **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor triad over Ab bass → Db–Fb (Eb)–Ab, so Db minor in first inversion.
- **B/Bb** = B major triad (B–D#–F#) over Bb bass. This is an odd bass; B and Bb are a half step apart, may be a passing chord or altered sound.
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th chord (E–G#–B–D#) over Ab bass. This creates a very dissonant, possibly altered chord (Ab to E is a tritone). Enharmonically, **Ab = G#**, so if Ab is the bass of an E major 7th, you have G# and E—so potentially a root/bass conflict.

But notice: **Ab and E are enharmonically a tritone apart**. Emaj7/Ab may actually be an **Fb/Cb or Ab7#5 or some altered dominant**, but let's proceed carefully.

---

Wait: **Emaj7 over Ab bass** is unusual because:
- Ab = G#, and E to G# is a major 3rd — so G# is the **third** of E major.
- So **Emaj7/Ab** = **Ab as third of E major**?
- That would mean: **Ab (as G#)** is part of **Emaj7**. But written as **Emaj7/Ab**, the bass is Ab. So the chord includes Ab (as G#), B (M3), D# (M7), E (root?), but bass is Ab.

But if the **bass is Ab (G#)**, and chord is E major 7th, then **Ab/G# is the third** — so this is **Emaj7 in first inversion**, but written as **Emaj7/Ab** which assumes **Ab is a note**, but functionally it's **G#**.

So **Emaj7/G#** is correct notation — **Emaj7 in first inversion**, written here as Emaj7/Ab due to enharmonic confusion.

But **Ab ≠ G# in functional harmony** — unless we're in a key where Ab is diatonic.

Wait — earlier we have **Gb**, **Dbm**, **Bb**, **Ab** — all flats. So the key likely uses flats, suggesting **Ab** is correct, not G#.

Therefore, **Emaj7/Ab** means: **Ab in bass**, with **E major seventh chord** above.

That is **very dissonant**:
- Ab to E is an augmented fifth (Ab to E is A5).
- So **Ab–E = augmented fifth**, very harsh.
- The chord would contain: **Ab, E, G#, B, D#** → which is like an **Ab7(#5)** or **Ab7+** with E as an #11 or alteration?

Alternatively, this might be a **misspelling**.

Let’s consider: could “Emaj7/Ab” be meant as **Abmaj7/C#**? But no — Ab major 7th has G, not G#.

Or maybe it’s **Ab7(#5)**, which would be Ab–C–E–Gb → E is the #5. Yes! So:
- **Ab7 with #5** = Ab–C–E–Gb
- Which is exactly the same notes as **Emaj7(b5)** or interpreted as **Emaj7/Ab** — this is a **tritone-related altered dominant**.

This is critical.

So: **Emaj7/Ab** → likely intended to be **Ab7#5**, but written enharmonically confusingly.

In fact, **E major 7th is E–G#–B–D#**, while **Ab7#5 is Ab–C–E–Gb**.

They share **E**, but **G# ≠ Ab**, **B ≠ C**, **D# ≠ E♭** — they are **enharmonically different**.

Wait — **G# ≠ Ab** in equal temperament they are the same, but **functionally they are different**.

E–G#–B–D# vs. Ab–Cb–E–Gbb (messy).

But if we assume **G# = Ab**, **B = Cb**, **D# = Eb**, then:
- E–G#–B–D# → E–Ab–Cb–Eb
- That’s **E°7** = E–G–Bb–Db, not matching

So no — **Emaj7 is not enharmonic to Ab7#5**.

- Emaj7: E–G#–B–D#
- Ab7#5: Ab–C–E–Gb

Shared note: **E**

But **G# = Ab**, **C = C**, **B = Cb?** — too messy.

But G# and Ab are same pitch, so:
- Emaj7 = E, Ab, B, D#
- Ab7#5 = Ab, C, E, Gb

So **Ab, E** common.

But B ≠ C, D# ≠ Gb.

So they are **not the same chord**. Thus, **Emaj7 over Ab** is a **polychord**: Ab in bass, Emaj7 on top — very dissonant.

Alternatively — maybe it's a typo.

Let’s re-think: looking at the bass motion:

We have a progression using **Bb**, and the bass is often **Bb** or **Ab** or **Gb**.

Bass line (simplified):

- Bb (Bbdim)  
- Bb (Bbdim)  
- Bb (Gb/Bb → Gb with Bb bass)  
- Bb (same)  
- Bb → Bb → Ab (Dbm/Ab) → **B/Bb (B major over Bb bass)** — B over Bb = minor 9th  
- Then back to Bb  
- Finally: **Ab bass with Emaj7 chord above**

This is extremely chromatic and dissonant.

But perhaps this is **chromatic voice leading**.

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal centers or patterns

Let’s list the chords with root and function:

1. **Bbdim** — Bb, D, F → this is **diminished**, could function as **vii° of Cb** or **C**, but more likely **vii°7 of Cb major** or **C minor**.

   Bbdim = Bb–D–F–Ab (if full 7th)

   Bbdim7: Bb–D–F–Ab

   This is the **dim7 chord** that is symmetrical, enharmonically equivalent to:

   - Dim7 on Bb = Ddim/F = Fdim/Ab = Abdim/C

   Could be used as **common-tone diminished** or **passing diminished**.

2. **Gb/Bb** — Gb major, Bb in bass → 1st inversion. Gb major is a **bV** in C minor, or **IV** in Db major? Not clear.

3. **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor, Ab in bass → 1st inversion. Db minor is **ii** in Cb major, or **iv** in Ab minor, or **i** in Db minor.

4. **B/Bb** — B major chord (B–D#–F#) over Bb bass.

   B major is very out of place — D# is **Ebb**, which is double flat — not typical.

   B over Bb bass = major 7th interval, very dissonant.

   Enharmonically: B = Cb, so **Cbmaj/Bb** = Cb–Eb–Gb over Bb.

   But Cb–Bb = minor 7th — could be a Bb7#5#9 or something.

   But chord is written as **B**, so likely **B natural**.

5. **Emaj7/Ab** — Ab bass, E–G#–B–D# above.

   E–Ab = minor 6th, but **E to G# is major third**, etc.

   This polychord (Ab+E) creates **C#, E, G#, B, D#** — potentially an **alt chord**.

---

Alternatively, suspect notation errors.

Could **"B/Bb"** mean **Bb/Bb**, or **A/Bb**? Or **Bdim/Bb**?

And **Emaj7/Ab** could be **Abmaj7**, or **Em7/Ab**, or **Ab7#5**?

Let’s reconsider with possible **enharmonic reinterpretation**.

---

Try re-notating everything in simpler keys.

Let’s go **enharmonic**: use sharps instead of flats?

But almost all chords are flat-based, except last one uses E.

Wait — **Emaj7/Ab**: if we interpret **Ab as G#**, and think in **C# minor** or **F# major**?

But earlier chords: Bbdim, Gb, Db — all flat-based, not sharp-based.

Bb = A#

Gb = F#

Db = C#

Ab = G#

So try enharmonic respelling:

- Bbdim = **A#°** → A#–C#–E
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# → F# over A# bass
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# → C# minor over G# bass
- B/Bb = B/A# → B over A# bass
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# → E over G# bass → first inversion E major 7th

Now, in **sharps**, we have:

A#° – A#° – F#/A# – F#/A#

A#° – A#° – C#m/G# – B/A#

A#° – A#° – F#/A# – F#/A#

A#° – A#° – Emaj7/G# – A#°

Wait — now we see: **G# bass** in C#m/G# and Emaj7/G#

And **A# bass** elsewhere

But **B/A#** is still B over A# (half step)

Now look at the **chord roots**:

- A#°
- F#
- C#m
- B
- E
- back to A#°

So roots: A#° → F# → C#m → B → E → A#°

But **A#° is same as C°**, which is **enharmonic** to **C°**, Eb°, etc.

But let's try to see a scale.

List roots: A#, F#, C#, B, E

Enharmonic:

- A# = Bb
- F# = Gb
- C# = Db
- B = B
- E = E

Not a standard progression.

Alternatively, notice the **bass line**:

- Bb – Bb – Bb – Bb
- Bb – Bb – Ab – Bb  ← unusual jump to B over Bb
- Bb – Bb – Bb – Bb
- Bb – Bb – Ab – Bb

So bass is mostly **Bb**, with two excursions: **Ab** and **B (natural)**.

So strong dominant pedal? But no clear resolution.

But then the final bass is **Ab**, with Emaj7 on top — maybe a cadence?

**Emaj7/Ab** as a **V/vi** or something?

Let’s consider this: **Emaj7** is the **V7/vi** in **A minor?**

But A minor uses **E major** as **V**, but with **G#**, yes.

But we have **Gb**, **Dbm**, **Bb**, which don't fit A minor.

A minor: A B C D E F G — no Gb, Db, Bb

So not.

Wait — **C minor**?

C minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb

Has: Bb, Ab, Gb (as F), Eb, F, C — Dbm? Not diatonic.

Dbm is not in C minor.

But **Ab major** is **bVI** in C minor.

**Gb major** is **bV**, not diatonic.

But bV is used in **borrowed chords or modal interchange**.

**Bbdim** could be **vii°** of Cb, but Cb is remote.

Wait — what if the key is **Ab major**?

Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

So:
- Bbdim: Bb–D–F–Ab — is this **ii°7 in Ab?** → Bb–D–F–Ab — D is not in Ab major (Ab has C, not C#)

No — D is C# — not in Ab.

So not.

**C half-diminished?** No.

Wait — **Bbdim** appears repeatedly. The Bbdim7 chord (Bb–D–F–Ab) is a **dim7 chord**, and dim7 chords are symmetrical: every note is a minor third apart.

So Bbdim7 = Bb–D–F–Ab

= enharmonically = Ddim7 (D–F–Ab–Cb), Fdim7 (F–Ab–Cb–Ebb), Abdim7 (Ab–Cb–Ebb–Gbb)

These are all the same pitches.

So **Bbdim7** can function as:
- **vii°7 of Cb major** → Bb–D–F–Ab → resolves to Cb
- **vii°7 of C minor** → Bb–D–F–Ab → resolves to C
- **as a common-tone diminished chord** (e.g., over Bb bass, decorating Bb)
- **as a passing chord**

But we have **Gb major**, which is the **bV chord in Db minor**? Or in C?

Let’s consider **C minor**.

C minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Chords:
- Gb major → not in C minor, but could be a **bV**, often from Phrygian or borrowed (modal interchange)
- Dbm → Db minor = **iiø** in Cb major, but in C minor, Db is flat 2, so Dbø or Dbm might be used
- B/Bb — B over Bb → B is major third of G#? Not clear.

Wait — **B/Bb** — could this be a **spelling error for Bb**? Like typo for **Bb**?

Or maybe it's **Bdim/Bb**? Bdim = B–D–F, which is in dim7 scale.

But still.

Another idea: could "B/Bb" mean **Bb with B natural** in melody? But written as slash chord, implies B as chord.

Perhaps "B" is meant to be "Ab"?

But then "Ab/Bb" would be Ab major over Bb bass — first inversion of Ab, which is possible.

But it's written as "B/Bb".

Alternatively, "Emaj7/Ab" could be "Abmaj7" by typo.

But it's the last chord before returning to Bbdim.

Let’s consider the only **major 7th chord** is **Emaj7/Ab**.

Emaj7 is E–G#–B–D#.

G# is enharmonic to Ab, so if the bass is Ab (i.e. G#), then this is **Emaj7 in first inversion**: G#–B–D#–E.

So **Emaj7/G#**.

Now, **Emaj7/G#** is I65 in E major.

Could this progression be in **E major**?

E major: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#

But we have:
- Bbdim = Bb–D–F–Ab — Bb, D, F, Ab not in E major
- Gb = Gb — not in E major
- Dbm — no
- Ab — Ab not in E major

So no.

But Emaj7 is V of **Amaj**, not common.

Another idea: the chord **Emaj7/Ab** is meant to be **Ab7#5**, which is a **tritone substitution** for **D7**, the V of G.

But not connected.

---

Perhaps this progression is **not in a key** — it's **chromatic**, using **passing diminished chords** and **linear harmony**.

But let’s look at voice leading.

Assume all Bbdim are Bbdim7: Bb–D–F–Ab

Then Gb/Bb = Gb–Bb–Db

Voice leading: Ab to Gb (down m3), D to Bb (down m3), F to Db (down m3), Bb to Bb (common tone)

Perfect **dim7 to major chord** — this is classic:

- Bbdim7 (Bb–D–F–Ab) → Gb/Bb (Gb–Bb–Db)
  - Ab → Gb
  - D → Bb
  - F → Db
  - Bb → Bb
- Yes, smooth voice leading.

Similarly, Gb/Bb to next chord — could go to Dbm/Ab: Db–Fb–Ab, with Ab in bass.

Gb–Bb–Db → Db–Fb–Ab over Ab bass

- Gb → Ab (up m2)
- Bb → Ab (down m2)
- Db → Db (common)
- Not as smooth.

Bbdim7 to Dbm/Ab?

Bbdim7: Bb–D–F–Ab

Dbm/Ab: Db–Fb–Ab

- Ab → Ab (common)
- F → Fb? Down half step — possible
- D → Db? Down half step — yes
- Bb → Ab? Down m2 — ok

So Ab common tone, other voices move by half step: possible.

Then Dbm/Ab to B/Bb — major leap.

Dbm to B major is jarring.

B/Bb: B–D#–F# over Bb

Bb to B = half step up

Ab (in Dbm) to B = up minor 3rd
Fb (Eb) to D# = enharmonically unison? Eb to D# = same note
Db to B = up minor 6th — not smooth

Not good voice leading.

Alternatively, perhaps **"B/Bb" is a typo for "Bbmaj" or "Bb7"**.

Or "Ab", or "A".

Another possibility: "B" might mean **B diminished**, but written as "B".

Or in some notations, "B" in European systems is Bb, but here B is likely B natural.

---

Now, final chord: **Emaj7/Ab**

If we interpret this as **Emaj7 with Ab in bass**, and Ab = G#, then it's **Emaj7/G#** = first inversion E major 7th.

But earlier we have B/Bb, which has B in chord.

So perhaps we're moving to **E major**?

But no other chords support that.

Unless the whole progression is in **C minor**, and the Emaj7/Ab is a **chromatic mediant** or **secondary dominant**.

E major is V/vi of G minor, but not helpful.

Another idea: **the key is Ab minor**.

Ab minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

Has: Bb, Db, Ab, Gb — matches

- Bbdim: Bb–D–F–Ab — D is C##? No, D is not in Ab minor (which has Cb). D = C# = enharmonic to C##? No.

Ab minor natural: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

So Bbdim would be Bb–D–F–Ab — D is **not in the key** (should be Db or Cb)

So Bbdim has D = major 3rd, but in Ab minor, the ii chord is Bb dim (Bb–Db–F) — so Bbdim should be Bb–Db–F–Ab.

Ah! Here's the mistake.

**Bbdim** in the key of Ab minor should be **Bb–Db–F–Ab**, not Bb–D–F–Ab.

But the user wrote **Bbdim**, which could be interpreted as:

- Bb–D–F–Ab → with **D natural** = C##, which is **not in Ab minor**
- But likely, in context, it should be **Bb–Db–F–Ab** = **ii°7 in Ab minor**

So perhaps the **"Bbdim"** is **Bb–Db–F–Ab**, the regular diminished chord in Ab minor.

Similarly, Gb/Bb = Gb–Bb–Db, which is **VI** in Ab minor — a common borrowed chord (from major).

Dbm/Ab = Db–Fb–Ab — Db–Eb–Ab? Fb = E double flat = D.

So Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab = Db–Eb–Ab — that's **iv** in Ab minor.

Yes! In Ab minor:
- i = Abm
- ii° = Bbdim (Bb–Db–F)
- III = Bbb or Cb (not used)
- iv = Dbm
- v = Eb dim or Ebm (depending on harmonic)
- VI = Gb major — yes, borrowed from Ab major
- VII = Bbb or Ab

So Gb major is **VI**, common in minor keys.

Then **B/Bb** — still problematic.

But if it's **Bb major**, that could be bIII (from Phrygian or modal), but Bb major is Bb–D–F

Then **Emaj7/Ab** — hard to fit.

Unless **Emaj7/Ab** is **Abmaj7 with G#** — but Abmaj7 has G, not G#.

No.

Wait — in **Ab harmonic minor**: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G

G is natural, not Gb.

Then **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–F–Ab — but F is not in the scale? Ab harmonic minor has G, not Gb or F.

F is not in Ab harmonic minor.

Ab harmonic minor: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G

So pitches: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G

So F is not in the scale.

So Bbdim = Bb–Db–F–Ab — includes F, which is not in scale.

But F = E#, so if we need it for leading tone, but G is the leading tone.

Perhaps the Bbdim is **vii° of Cb major**.

Cb major: Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb

So:
- Bb dim = Bb–D–F–Ab — again, D and F not in Cb major (should be Db and Fb)

Same issue.

 unless it's Bb–Db–Fb–Abb

But that would be Bbdim7 in Cb major.

So Bbdim7 = Bb–Db–Fb–Abb (A)

But written as Bbdim, likely includes Db, not D.

So probably, the user means **Bbdim = Bb–Db–F–Ab** — the regular ii°7 in Cb major or Ab minor.

And **D** is a typo or misunderstanding.

In many contexts, "Bbdim" means **Bb–D–F–Ab**, but **D** should be **Db** for proper in-key diminished.

But in equal temperament, pianists play D natural, but in theory, it's Db.

No, in practice, Bbdim is Bb–D–F–Ab — with D natural = raised Db.

But in a key like C minor, Bbdim7 = Bb–D–F–Ab = **vii°7** of C minor.

Yes! In **C minor**:

- C minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb
- With harmonic and melodic variations.

The **vii°7 chord** in C minor is **Bbdim7** = Bb–D–F–Ab

- Bb = bVII
- D = raised 6th (from natural minor)
- F = bII
- Ab = iv

Yes, and **D is the leading tone up to E**, but in C minor context.

So in C minor, Bbdim7 is common as dominant substitute.

Now check other chords:

- Gb/Bb = Gb–Bb–Db over Bb bass.

  Gb major is **bV major** in C minor — a common **modal interchange** chord from C Phrygian or C harmonic minor with flat 5? Not exactly.

  But bV (Gb) is used in jazz and film music over minor keys.

- Dbm/Ab = Db–Ebb–Ab over Ab bass.

  Dbm = iv in C minor? C minor has Db as b9, but iv would be F minor, not Db.

  No.

  iv in C minor is F minor.

  Dbm is not a chord in C minor.

  Unless it's ii in Cb, but not.

  But wait: **in Ab major**, Dbm is iv.

  Or could it be a **Neapolitan chord**?

  In C minor, the **Neapolitan** is **Db major**, not minor.

  So Dbm is not Neapolitan.

  So not.

  unless it's a typo for **Db major**.

  Then Db/Ab = Db–F–Ab, which is Neapolitan in C minor.

  Possible.

  Then B/Bb — if it's Bb, then it's I.

  But it's written as B.

  Alternatively, "B" could be "Ab", then "Ab/Bb" = Ab–C–Eb over Bb — which is Ab major in first inversion — possible in C minor.

  Or "B" is "G", then G/Bb = G–B–D over Bb = G7, V of C.

  That makes sense.

  Perhaps "B" is a typo for "G".

  Similarly, "Emaj7/Ab" — if it's "G7/Ab", but Ab is not in G7.

  or "Ab7" or "D7/Ab".

  But "Emaj7/Ab" — if it's "G#maj7/Ab", but not.

  another idea: in guitar tab, "B" might mean Bb, but unlikely.

Given the repeated Bbdim and bass on Bb, and Gb and Dbm, the most likely key is **Ab minor**, with these chords:

- Bbdim = ii°7 (Bb–Db–F–Ab) — if we accept F as not in scale, but in practice it's used
- Gb/Bb = VI (borrowed from major)
- Dbm/Ab = iv (minor iv)
- B/Bb — still issue

Assume that "B/Bb" is a typo for "Ab/Bb" or "Bbm" or "Bb".

Then the progression is:

Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – Bb (instead of B/Bb)  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

Then last: Emaj7/Ab — maybe "Abmaj7" typo.

If "Emaj7/Ab" is meant to be **Abmaj7**, then it's the tonic.

So in **Ab major**, but Bbdim not in key.

In **Ab minor**, Abm would be.

But we have no Abm.

Perhaps the tonal center is **Bb**, with passing chords.

Given the overwhelming number of Bbdim and bass on Bb, the tonic may be **Bb something**.

But Bb with surrounding chords.

Another possibility: the key is **E half-diminished?** No.

---

After careful analysis, the only logical conclusion is that:

### The key is **C minor**, and the chord progression uses chromaticism and modal interchange.

- Bbdim = **vii°7 of C minor** (common dominant substitute)
- Gb major = **bV chord**, borrowed from C Phrygian or used for color
- Dbm/Ab = perhaps meant to be **Db major** (Neapolitan) in C minor, but written as minor by mistake
- B/Bb = likely a typo for **G/Bb** or **Bb**
- Emaj7/Ab = likely a typo for **G7** or **Ab7** or **Cm**

But without changes, the most consistent tonal center is **Ab minor**, even though the spelling is off.

### Final guess:

**Key: Ab minor**  
**Mode: natural minor or harmonic minor with chromaticism**

- Tonic: Ab minor (implied, though not played)
- Bbdim = ii°7
- Gb = VI (borrowed from major)
- Dbm = iv
- Emaj7/Ab may be a spelling error for Abmaj7 or Ab7

Given the evidence, and the bass note Ab in two chords, and Bb, Db, Gb present, **Ab minor** is the most likely key.

### Therefore:

**Key: Ab minor**  
**Mode: natural minor (with modal interchange from Ab major, e.g., VI chord)**

But the B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab remain inconsistent.

Perhaps a final re-examination:

Maybe "Emaj7/Ab" is "Eb7/Ab" or "Ab7" — typo in chord.

Or "E" is "Eb".

If "Emaj7/Ab" is meant to be "Ebmaj7/Ab" = Ab–C–Eb–G over Ab bass, so Abmaj7.

Then the last chord is Abmaj7, and the progression cadences on Ab.

Then the key is **Ab major**, and earlier chords are chromatic passing.

- Bbdim, Gb/Bb (IV), Dbm/Ab (ii), etc.

In Ab major:
- Gb = bVII
- Dbm = v (but should be Db major)
- Bbdim = biii° or passing
- Abmaj7 = I

So possible if Dbm is meant to be Db, but it's minor.

Given the difficulty, I conclude:

### Most plausible answer:

**Key: Ab minor**  
**Mode: natural minor**, with modal interchange (using Gb major from Ab major)

The progression is centered around Ab, with chromatic approach.

**Answer:**
**Key: Ab minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**
