### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to parse a chord progression that includes "Bbdim," "Gb/Bb," and more, determining its key and mode. The progression repeats "Bbdim" a lot and has various slash chords. There’s a suggestion it could be in Bb Phrygian, especially with the Bb bass pedal. Almost every chord features Bb, and the diminished triad consists of Bb, Db, and E. I’m trying to understand what all this implies in terms of musical structure and nature!**Evaluating chord relationships**

I’m working through the key of Gb major and realizing the leading tone is F, making F° the vii°. But in B major, the vii° is A# dim. I'm trying to identify where Bbdim fits: is it vii° of Cb major? That didn’t work out since the leading tone is A#. Rather, Bbdim acts as ii° in Ab minor. In Ab harmonic minor, Bbdim makes sense as ii°, particularly since it's associated with a repeated emphasis that suggests an Ab minor key center. Now I’ll look at the next chords.**Analyzing chord inversions**

I’m interpreting Gb major as a chord with Bb in the bass, making it VI6 in Ab minor. Then I look at Dbm/Ab, identifying it as iv6/4 in Ab minor. The Db minor triad places the fifth (Ab) in the bass, which fits perfectly! Now for B/Bb, this B major chord seems out of place. In Ab minor context, it's enharmonically Cb major; however, B major is not diatonic here. I wonder if they intended Cb instead!**Considering chord function**

I'm analyzing B/Bb, which could relate enharmonically to Cb/Bb, posing a question of whether it's a bVII. In Ab minor, the Neapolitan could indeed be Bbb major. Alternatively, with Bb in the bass, B major creates an altered upper structure, incorporating intervals like b9 and b13. Since the progression mostly lists Bbdim, Gb/Bb, and Dbm/Ab, I find it intriguing that Emaj7/Ab brings E natural into the mix—although it complicates things since E natural isn't diatonic in Ab minor!**Exploring Bb Locrian and key functions**

I’m analyzing the Locrian mode on Bb, stemming from Cb major, which differs from Bb minor. The notes confirm it's Bb Locrian or Ab Aeolian. The progression includes Bbdim as the i°, with Gb/Bb functioning as the bVI in first inversion. Dbm/Ab acts as bIII, and B/Bb introduces a Neapolitan flavor as bII over i. Considering Emaj7/Ab, that aligns with bVmaj7 over b7. So, the overall feel suggests a Bb Locrian center, distinctly characterized by diminished tonalities.**Defining the tonal center**

To clarify, I can say the key center is Bb, with the mode as Locrian derived from B major or Cb major. Many label this as "Bb Locrian," consistent with its flats and the enharmonic spelling. Thus, the parent scale is Cb major with 7 flats. The emphasis on Bbdim at both the start and end strongly indicates a Locrian center on Bb. I could summarize it as: "Tonal center: Bb; Mode: Locrian; Parent scale: Cb major." This keeps things concise and clear!

Bb Locrian (modal center on Bb; parent scale Cb major / relative to Ab natural minor).

Reason: The chords use only tones of Cb major (Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab), and the progression begins and ends on Bbdim, which functions as i° in Bb Locrian. Slash chords like Gb/Bb (bVI over 1), Dbm/Ab (bIII over b7), B/Bb ≈ Cb/Bb (bII over 1), and Emaj7/Ab ≈ Fbmaj7/Ab (bVmaj7 over b7) are all diatonic to Bb Locrian.
