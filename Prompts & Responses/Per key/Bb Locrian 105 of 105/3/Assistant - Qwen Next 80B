**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B**

This chord progression:

> **Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim**

is rich in chromaticism and altered harmonies, but we can determine the **key and mode** by analyzing functional relationships, root movements, and tendencies.

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords

Let’s transcribe all chords clearly:

| Chord | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Bbdim | B♭ diminished (B♭–D♭–F♭) — vii° in C minor |
| Gb/Bb | Gb major triad over B♭ bass → **B♭–D–F♭** = **B♭ minor 7♭5**? Wait — Gb is G♭–B♭–D. So **Gb/Bb** = B♭ in bass, G♭–B♭–D = **B♭m7♭5** (same as A°7 in enharmonic spellings) |
| Dbm/Ab | Db minor over Ab bass → Ab–C♭–E♭ = **Ab7** (dominant 7) since Ab–C♭–E♭–G♭ = Ab7 in enharmonic equivalent? Let’s check — C♭ = B, so Ab–B–E♭? That’s not right. Hold on. |

Wait — we need to be careful with enharmonics and spelling.

Let’s rewrite everything in **flat** keys for consistency (since Bb, Gb, Db are all flat-based).

---

### Step 2: Enharmonic spellings and true harmonic function

#### Chord: Bbdim = B♭–D♭–F♭

Standard diminished triad.

#### Chord: Gb/Bb = bass B♭, upper chord Gb major = G♭–B♭–D

> G♭–B♭–D = **B♭ half-diminished 7th (B♭m7♭5)**!

Because: B♭ + D♭ (minor 3rd) + F♭ (dim 5th) = B♭m7♭5  
But here we have: B♭ + D (major 3rd!) + G♭ (diminished 5th) — that’s not B♭m7♭5.

Wait a second!  
**G♭–B♭–D** = **B♭** as root? No — the root is G♭, and **B♭** is the 3rd, **D** is the 5th → so it's technically a **G♭ major triad in first inversion**. But we’re told it’s **Gb/Bb** → so **Bb is the bass**, Gb is the root of the triad above.

So the chord is **G♭ major triad = G♭–B♭–D**, with **B♭ in the bass**.

What note is **G♭–B♭–D**?

- G♭ to B♭ = major 3rd
- B♭ to D = major 3rd
- G♭ to D = augmented 5th — **So this is a G♭ augmented triad?**  
G♭–B♭–D is **G♭+**, augmented triad!

Wait — G♭ to B♭ is 4 semitones (major 3rd), B♭ to D is also 4 semitones → entire chord: **G♭ augmented**.

Yes! **G♭+ = G♭–B♭–D**

So **Gb/Bb = G♭+ / B♭** = **B♭ augmented with G♭ and D** — so the chord is an **inverted augmented triad**: **G♭+ / B♭**

Similarly, we see this pattern repeated.

Also:

#### Dbm/Ab = D♭ minor / A♭ bass → A♭–C♭–E♭

C♭ is B — a **Augmented 6th chord**? Let’s check:

A♭–C♭–E♭ = **A♭ minor** **triad**.

Wait: A♭–C♭–E♭ = A♭ minor triad → so **Dbm/Ab = Ab minor triad?**

That can't be right — Dbm is D♭ minor → D♭–F♭–A♭

So **Dbm/Ab** = **A♭ in bass**, D♭–F♭–A♭ above → gives us **A♭–D♭–F♭**

That is: **D♭ minor triad in second inversion** → Mapped: **A♭ (5th) – D♭ (root) – F♭ (minor 3rd)** → So the full chord is **D♭m** with A♭ in bass → **D♭m/A♭**

The **notes** are: A♭, D♭, F♭

But A♭–D♭–F♭ = **D♭ minor triad in second inversion** → that’s just **D♭m** with bass note A♭.

So no new harmonic color here — just inversion.

But then...

#### B/Bb = B natural / B♭ bass

This is **B natural major triad** over **B♭ bass** → B–D♯–F♯ over B♭

So notes: **B♭ – B – D♯ – F♯**

That’s **B♭ major 7#11?** — no, B and B♭ are a minor 2nd apart — that’s a **clash**.

Better to think: **B major triad** over **B♭ bass** = **B♭/B** — that’s a **half-step pedal tone underneath a major chord**, very common in jazz/pop.

This chord is **B major triad over B♭ bass**: **B–D♯–F♯ / B♭**

That makes the full sonority: **B♭, B, D♯, F♯**

→ This is **B major with B♭ bass** → it’s an **altered dominant** or **borrowed chord**.

Commonly used as: **V7#5 or V/B♭**, but B major is not a triad in any common key — but wait — maybe it’s a **secondary dominant**?

B major = V of E major.

Alternatively, this might suggest a **chromatic mediant** relationship.

Finally:

#### Emaj7/Ab = E maj7 over Ab bass

E maj7 = E–G♯–B–D♯

Bass: Ab

So full chord: **Ab – E – G♯ – B – D♯**

That’s five notes: **E–G♯–B–D♯** (E major 7) plus **Ab** in bass

Ab is enharmonic to G♯ — so Ab and G♯ are the same pitch.

So we have **Ab = G♯**, and **G♯** is the **3rd** of E major 7.

So: **G♯** is in the chord as the 3rd, and now it's played in the bass → **E major 7 with 3rd in bass** = **Emaj7/G♯**

But we have **Ab** bass → **Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G♯**

So it’s just an **inversion** — **E major 7 with third in bass**.

So **Emaj7/Ab** = **E major 7 chord, 3rd inversion**

**Normal notes:** E–G♯–B–D♯ → Inversion: G♯–E–B–D♯ = **Emaj7/G♯**

But written as **Emaj7/Ab** — so the composer is spelling it **enharmonically** (Ab instead of G♯). That's fine — it was probably for smooth voice-leading from the previous Dbm/Ab = Ab–C♭–E♭ → then Ab–E–G♯–B–D♯ → so Ab is held as a pedal tone.

So Ab is the bass throughout.

So now let’s map the **overall bass line**:

---

### Step 3: Analyze the **bass line** (root notes of chords)

List each chord’s **bass note**:

1. Bbdim → **B♭**
2. Bbdim → **B♭**
3. Gb/Bb → **B♭**
4. Gb/Bb → **B♭**
5. Bbdim → **B♭**
6. Bbdim → **B♭**
7. Dbm/Ab → **A♭**
8. B/Bb → **B♭**
9. Bbdim → **B♭**
10. Bbdim → **B♭**
11. Gb/Bb → **B♭**
12. Gb/Bb → **B♭**
13. Bbdim → **B♭**
14. Bbdim → **B♭**
15. Emaj7/Ab → **A♭**
16. Bbdim → **B♭**

So bass line:

**B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – A♭ – B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – B♭ – A♭ – B♭**

So main bass movement is: **B♭ going down to A♭, then back up to B♭**

This creates a **lowered 7th degree** motion: **B♭ → A♭ – B♭**

That’s a **melodic minor** flavor: **leading tone resolution down** (but often seen in Johann Sebastian Bach and Romantic chromaticism).

Also note: **A♭ is the flat 6 of B♭**.

B♭ major scale: B♭–C–D–E♭–F–G–A♭

So A♭ is the **b6** of B♭ major.

This naturally suggests the key is **B♭ minor**.

Look at B♭ minor scale:

**B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭**

B♭ minor scale note: **B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭**

Now compare chords:

- **Bbdim** = B♭–D♭–F♭ → **vii°** in B♭ natural minor? Let’s see:

In **B♭ minor** (natural minor):

- i: B♭m
- ii°: C°
- III: D♭
- iv: E♭m
- v: Fm
- VI: G♭
- **vii°: A♭–C–E♭?** — No.

Wait: **vii°** in B♭ minor should be: A♭–C♭–E♭ → **A♭ diminished**

But we have **B♭dim** — that is **B♭–D♭–F♭**

That’s not the vii° in B♭ minor — B♭dim would be the **tonic diminished**.

B♭dim is **not diatonic to B♭ minor**.

Wait — what if we're in **E major or C# minor**? But all the chords have flats — Gb, Db, Bb — so it’s definitely flat-oriented.

Let’s think differently.

---

### Step 4: Recognize harmonic pattern — "Barber's Blues" or “Minor iv – I” progression

There’s a famous progression in jazz/pop:

> **i – i – iv – iv – i – i – VI – bVII – i – i – iv – iv – i – i – bIII – i**

In **B♭ minor**:

- i = B♭m
- iv = E♭m
- VI = G♭
- bVII = A♭
- bIII = D♭

But we have:

- Bbdim (B♭dim) — not B♭m
- Gb/Bb — Gb maj over Bb → Gb is **VI** in B♭ minor
- Dbm/Ab — Db minor over Ab → Dbm is **bIII**
- B/Bb — B major over Bb — enharmonically = **#V** or **V of vii**?
- Emaj7/Ab — E major 7 over Ab → E is **#V**? But Ab is VI

Another pattern: **B♭dim → G♭ → B♭dim** — this looks like **vii° → VI → vii°**

In **B♭ minor**, **B♭dim is vii°?** No.

Wait — **B♭dim** is **B♭–D♭–F♭**, which is enharmonic to **E°7** or **G°7**

It’s actually **the same as G°7** if you respell it: G°7 = G–B♭–D♭–F♭ → YES

So **B♭dim = G°7** if we operate with enharmonic equivalence:

- B♭dim = B♭–D♭–F♭
- G°7 = G–B♭–D♭–F♭ — so it’s the same notes as G°7 without the G? Or in voicing.

Actually, it’s a **B♭ diminished triad**, which can be functionally representative of **vii° in C minor**.

Wait — **C minor**: C–D♭–E♭–F–G–A♭–B♭

vii° = B♭–D♭–F♭ → YES!!!

So **B♭dim is vii° in C minor**.

Let’s test: we have:

- B♭dim (vii° in C minor)
- Gb/Bb — Gb = G♭, which is **IV in C minor**? C minor has: F♭ = E — no.

C minor scale: C–D–E♭–F–G–A♭–B♭

So:  
- i: Cm  
- ii°: D°  
- III: E♭  
- iv: Fm  
- v: Gm  
- VI: A♭  
- **vii°: B♭dim**

So vii° = B♭dim — YES.

IV = Fm — but we have **Gb/Bb**

Gb major = G♭–B♭–D

G♭ is **bVI** in C minor? C minor has A♭, not G♭.

G♭ in C minor? No — C minor’s 6th scale degree is A♭.

So G♭ is a **chromatic** note.

But G♭ is enharmonic to **F#** — which is **leading tone to G** — so perhaps the key is **C minor** with borrowed **bVI = G♭ ?**

In C minor, **bVI = A♭** — not G♭.

**G♭ = #V**? G♭ is a tritone from C — yes: **augmented 6th chord**.

Wait — G♭–B–D — if you make G♭–B–D (G♭–F𝄪–D), it’s **German Augmented 6th** → but here it’s written as **Gb/Bb**, so B♭ in bass — that makes **G♭–B♭–D** — which is **G♭ augmented**.

G♭+ is the **augmented sixth chord**? Only if bass is **F**.

Standard German augmented sixth: Ab–C–F–G♭ → in C minor: Ab–C–F–G♭ (bVI–III–bV–bVII)

But here we have **Gb/Bb = G♭–B♭–D** — a **G♭ augmented triad**

And **G♭+** is the same as **F# major triad (F♯–A♯–C♯)** enharmonically.

In context: **B♭dim–Gb+/B♭–B♭dim**

That’s **vii° – G♭+ – vii°**

This is a **common jazz substitution**: the augmented triad over vii° tonic.

The G♭+ (G♭–B♭–D) contains **B♭** (same as B♭dim) and **D** — which is the minor third of **B♭m**? No — D is major 3rd of B♭?

Wait — **B♭ to D** = major 3rd — so **B♭+ = B♭–D–F♯**, but here it's **G♭+ = G♭–B♭–D**

So **B♭ is 3rd of G♭+**

The whole progression is built around **B♭ as an anchor**, with upper chords in G♭+ and Dbm, etc.

But the bass is **B♭ for 14 bars**, then **A♭**, then **B♭**

So the **central tonic** is **B♭**

And the key signature has no sharps — flat keys.

Let’s get bold.

---

### ✅ Final Conclusion: **Key = B♭ minor**, Mode = **Harmonic Minor**

#### Why?

- All chords are spelled with flats → key signature of B♭ minor: **2 flats: B♭, E♭** — plus accidentals.
- The chord **Bbdim** is the **vii° chord in C minor**, yes — **but also, in B♭ minor, B♭dim can function as a chromatic leading tone chord**.
- The magic: **B♭dim → G♭/B♭ → B♭dim** is **vii° – bVI+ – vii°**
  
In **B♭ harmonic minor**:

Scale: **B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A**

- i: B♭m
- ii°: C°
- III: D♭
- iv: E♭m
- v: Fm
- **VI: G♭**
- **vii°: A–C–E♭?** → **A diminished**

But on the 6th degree: **G♭ Major** triad = **G♭–B♭–D** — which is **not diatonic to B♭ natural minor**, but **is diatonic to B♭ harmonic minor**?

Wait — B♭ harmonic minor: **B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F–G♭–A**

→ So G♭ is the **6th degree** — so **G♭ major triad** is **VI** in **B♭ harmonic minor** — YES!

And **B♭dim** = B♭–D♭–F♭ — this is **not** the tonic.

But listen: **B♭dim can be interpreted as the vii° in C minor**, which has strong pull to F minor — but not to B♭.

Wait — another idea:

What if we treat **G♭ major triad (G♭–B♭–D)** as **bVI** in B♭ minor — which is common in Minor keys.

And **B♭dim** — what if it’s a **tritone substitution** for **F#7**? But chord is B♭dim — not F#7.

But here's the miracle:

In **B♭ minor**, you can have:

- **B♭dim** as **vii° of C minor** → functioning as a **secondary leading tone** → **vii°/V = leading to Fm**

But in this progression, **B♭dim** keeps returning — no resolution in sight.

We have **Dbm/Ab** → that’s **D♭ minor over A♭ bass = A♭–D♭–F♭**

A♭ is bVI in B♭ minor? In B♭ minor: Ab is the 6th degree → **normal VI = Ab major**, but here we have **D♭ minor / Ab** → so **D♭ minor chord**, bass A♭ — making **Ab–D♭–F♭**

Which is **Ab melodic minor scale**? A♭ = Ab: A♭–B♭–C♭–D♭–E♭–F–G — so D♭ minor = D♭–F♭–A♭ — that’s iv in A♭ major.

This is getting too messy.

Let’s return to the **key of B♭ minor** with **harmonic minor** expansion.

**Why harmonic minor?**

- Common use of **G♭ major chord (VI)** as **borrowed from parallel major** — wait, B♭ major has B♭–D–F, so no G♭.

Actually, the use of **bVI chord (G♭ major)** in **B♭ minor** is a **standard chromatic alteration**, called the **"Picardy third" turned inside out** — common in pop, jazz, and Urals-style music.

B♭ minor: **i – iv – bVI – iv – i**

We have **B♭dim – G♭/B♭ – B♭dim**

The chord **B♭dim** is **vii° in C minor**, but more importantly — it’s the **flattened supertonic** or a **diminished substitute for the tonic**.

But here’s the clincher:

In jazz and modern harmony, **B♭dim** is often used as a substitute for **G7♭9** (which is V7 of Cm), but also, as a **tritone substitution** for **F#7** — F#7 = F#–A#–C#–E → B♭dim = B♭–D♭–F♭ = enharmonic to A#–C#–E → **same as F#7♭9 without the root**

So **B♭dim = F#7♭9 chord**

Therefore, **B♭dim** = **F#7♭9** → which is V7♭9 of **B major**.

So then we have a possible key of **B major**

B major has 5 sharps, but the bass can be anything.

But the chord **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G♯–B–D♯ over Ab — and **E is the V of B** — yes!

V = E major

So we might be in **B major**

Then:

- Emaj7 = I of E major — maybe it’s a modulation?

Wait — Emaj7/Ab — E is major 7th chord over Ab

Ab is not in B major — B major: B–C#–D#–E–F#–G#–A#

Ab = G# — so **Ab = G#**

So **Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G#** = **E major 7 with 3rd in bass**

So **Emaj7** = I of E major — so **E major** is the key?

But we keep nagging with B♭ and G♭ and D♭ — flavor of F minor or C minor.

Ultimately, the easiest and most accurate explanation is:

---

### ✅ ✅ ✅ FINAL ANSWER:

> **Key: B♭ minor**  
> **Mode: Harmonic Minor**

### Justification:

- The progression centers around B♭ as the tonal center (bass anchoring B♭ for 14 of 16 bars)
- The chord **Gb/Bb** = **G♭ major triad**, which is the **♭VI chord** in **B♭ minor** — *a hallmark of harmonic minor*
- **Bbdim** = B♭–D♭–F♭ — corresponds to the **vii° of C minor**, but in this context, it serves as a **chromatic passing or embellishing chord** rooted on B♭, implying tonic instability
- The appearance of **B major over B♭ bass (B/Bb)** creates a **tritone clash** with the tonic — common in **chromatic mediant** or **secondary dominant** context, suggesting modulation toward E major as V of B — which would be V of V
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 over Ab — Ab (G♯) is the 3rd of E — so **E major 7 with 3rd in bass**, reinforcing **E as a tonal target** — which is the **V chord of B major**, but we’re in B♭ minor — so E major is **#V (augmented 5th)**
- **Dbm/Ab** = D♭ minor over A♭ → this is **iv / ♭VI = E♭ minor / A♭** → that’s **iv6 of B♭ minor**! Wait: D♭ minor = iv in B♭ minor? B♭ minor has A♭ as ♭VI, D♭ as iii — D♭ minor is **iii chord** — yes! Third degree.

Wait — in B♭ minor:

- i: B♭m  
- ii°: C°  
- **iii: D♭** — major? B♭ minor scale: B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F–G♭–A → so **D♭ = minor BY DEFAULT**? No — the III chord in natural minor is *major*.

In B♭ natural minor:  
- i: B♭m  
- ii°: C°  
- **III: D♭ major** (because scale has D♭ as 3rd, but passive)  
Wait — chord built on 3rd: D♭–F–A♭ → that’s **D♭ major** → but we have **Dbm/Ab = D♭ minor**

So **D♭ minor** is **not diatonic to natural minor** — it *is* diatonic to **B♭ melodic minor**

D♭ minor chord: D♭–F♭–A♭

In **B♭ melodic minor** ascending:  
B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F–G–A → so chord on 3rd: D♭–F–A — **D♭ major**.

So D♭ minor = **flattened 5th** → borrowed from **B♭ minor with lowered V or IV**

Actually — F♭ is E — so D♭–F♭–A♭ = D♭–E–A♭ — which is **D♭ diminished chord** in nature — so **Dbm = D♭ minor with fl5**? Not standard.

But we have **Dbm/Ab = D♭–F♭–A♭** with A♭ in bass → A♭–D♭–F♭ — that’s **D♭ minor** **in second inversion**

This chord: **D♭ minor** is **not** diatonic to B♭ harmonic or natural minor — but it *is* diatonic to **C minor**

C minor scale: C–D–E♭–F–G–A♭–B♭ → D♭ is **bIII**

Ah-ha!

### More importantly, consider **this progression is functionally part of C minor**:

B♭dim = **vii° of C minor**  
Gb/Bb = G♭ major = **Ab major? No** — G♭ is **bVI in C minor**

C minor:  
- i: Cm  
- ii°: D°  
- III: E♭  
- iv: Fm  
- v: Gm  
- **VI: A♭**  
- vii°: B♭dim

So **B♭dim = vii°**  
and **G♭** is **not in C minor** — it’s the **bVI**, enharmonic to **F#**, which would be **#V or augmented 6th**

But here's the insight:

> The entire progression is in the **key of C minor** using **chromatic mediants and borrowed chords**

But the bass is **B♭** — which is the vii° of C minor — *and* the **tonic** of B♭ minor

So most likely, the key is **C minor**, **but with tonic pedal on B♭**?

No — because **B♭ is not the root of C minor**

---

### 🌟 BEST ANSWER:

> **Key: C minor**  
> **Mode: Harmonic Minor**

#### Rationale:

- **B♭dim** = vii° in C minor → **core harmonic function**
- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major triad over B♭ bass → G♭ is **bVI** in C minor? No — C minor is A♭ for VI — G♭ is **G♭ = F#** → so **G♯+ + B♭** → this is **German augmented 6th chord** if bass were F.

But **not** standard.

Wait — G♭–B♭–D = we said it’s **G♭ augmented**

G♭+ is the **enharmonic equivalent** of **F# augmented**

F# augmented = triad: F#–A#–C## — C## = D

So G♭+ = F#+ = **augmented triad on +5 of the leading tone?**

In C harmonic minor: leading tone is **B**

B + A# very close.

But **G♭+** is **tritone relation** to C — same as **F#**, which is **C’s leading tone**?

F# is not in C minor — but G♭ is, with enharmonics.

Actually, **G♭ + B♭ + D = G♭ triad**

G♭ is the tritone of **C** → **diminished 5th**

G♭ + B♭ + D = **G♭ (root)–B♭ (3rd)–D (5th)** → interval from root to 5th is **augmented fifth** — so it's an **augmented triad**

This augmented triad is a **common substitution** for **dominant 7#5 chord**

In C minor: dominant is G7 → **G7#5 = G–B–D#–F**

Wait — G–B–D#-F = **G7#5**

Now G–B–D# = G augmented — and **G+ = G–B–D#**

But we have **G♭+ = G♭–B♭–D**

That’s **enharmonic to F# + = F#–A#–C## = F#–A#–D**

So **G♭+ ≠ G+** — so it doesn’t substitute for G7#5

But **B♭dim = F#7♭9** = dominant in the key of **B**

B major scale: B–C#–D#–E–F#–G#–A#

V = F#7

So **B♭dim = F#7♭9** (enharmonic) = **V7 of B**

So now we have B♭dim = V7/vi → vi would be G minor? Not matching.

I give up on C minor.

### ✅✅✅ Definitive Answer:

The central tonality is **B♭ minor**

- **B♭** is the pedal tone (bass note for 14 of 16 chords)
- The chord **G♭ major** is the **♭VI** — common in B♭ minor
- **B/B♭** is a **chromatic lower neighbor** — common in jazz
- **E major 7 / A♭** = chord built on 3rd of E, and A♭ is ♭VI
- **A♭** in bass reinforces B♭ minor's ♭VI

All this strongly points to:

> **Key: B♭ minor**  
> **Mode: Harmonic Minor**

The ♭VI chord (G♭ major) is a hallmark of **harmonic minor**, and the diminished tonic substitute (B♭dim) reflects **chromatic embellishment** common in harmonic minor progressions.

**Final Answer:**

> **Key: B♭ minor**  
> **Mode: Harmonic Minor**
