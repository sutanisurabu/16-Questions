Let's analyze your chord sequence step by step.  

**Chord progression:**  
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

---

### Step 1. List the spellings
- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–E (or Fb enharmonically)
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major over Bb (Bb in the bass): Gb–Bb–Db
- **Dbm/Ab** = Db–E–Ab
- **B/Bb** = B major over Bb (Bb in the bass): Bb in bass, with B–D#–F# triad
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G#–B–D# over Ab in bass

---

### Step 2. Notice key areas
Common tones:
- Many chords contain **Bb** in the bass — possibly a pedal tone.
- Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db) and E major (E–G#–B) are a tritone apart.  
- The song alternates between chords that are roughly a semitone or tritone away, creating ambiguity.

---

### Step 3. Possible tonal centers
Let’s test candidates:

#### Option 1: **Gb major**
- Gb major scale: Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb → just the vii° of **Cb major**, but functioning as **ii° of Ab minor** (the relative minor of Gb).  
- Dbm/Ab (VIbm) is chromatic to Gb major (Dbm vs. Db major diatonically).
- Emaj7/Ab is even more chromatic.

So Gb major is partially fitting for the Gb/Bb chords, but several others are outside.

---

### Step 4. Bass motion and tonal anchor
The **constant Bb** suggests Bb could be the tonal center (pedal point).  
If we think of Bb as “home,” what are these chords relative to Bb?
- Bbdim: root chord, diminished instead of major/minor — tonic substitute sound.
- Gb/Bb: Gb major over Bb → relates to a ♭VI sound relative to Bb minor (Gb is the ♭VI degree of Bb minor).
- Dbm/Ab: could be IVm/♭2 or something chromatic in relation to Bb.
- B/Bb: a sort of Lydian or #II chord over tonic.
- Emaj7/Ab: very non-diatonic, gives another color.

These relationships orbit around **Bb as tonic**, but using chromaticism.

---

### Step 5. Mode identification (by color)
- The mixture of diminished tonic quality (Bbdim) and ♭VI (Gb/Bb) suggests **Bb Locrian** or **Bb half-diminished** flavor.
- However, the progression doesn't obey a clean scale; it uses chromatic mediants (Emaj7, Dbm).

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

The progression appears **centered on Bb** (Bb as pedal/tonic),  
but the harmony is **tonally ambiguous**, leaning toward a **Bb Locrian / Bb half-diminished** modal area with heavy **chromatic mediant** movement (Gb, E, Dbm, B major).

---

**Answer:**
- **Tonal center:** Bb  
- **Mode / quality:** Locrian or half‑diminished color (Bb as tonic with ♭2, ♭5, and lots of chromatic mediants)  
- **Functional description:** Bb‑centred chromatic harmony, not in a strict diatonic key.
