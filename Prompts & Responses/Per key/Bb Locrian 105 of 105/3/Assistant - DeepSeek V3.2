Let’s break this down step by step.

## **1. Identify the chords and their possible functions**

The chords given are:

1. **Bbdim**  
2. **Bbdim**  
3. **Gb/Bb**  
4. **Gb/Bb**  
5. **Bbdim**  
6. **Bbdim**  
7. **Dbm/Ab**  
8. **B/Bb**  
9. **Bbdim**  
10. **Bbdim**  
11. **Gb/Bb**  
12. **Gb/Bb**  
13. **Bbdim**  
14. **Bbdim**  
15. **Emaj7/Ab**  
16. **Bbdim**

---

## **2. Understanding the diminished chord**

**Bbdim** = Bb–Db–E–Gb (fully diminished 7th chord).  
A diminished 7th chord is symmetrical (minor 3rds) and can function in four possible keys as a **vii°7** chord.

Bbdim = vii°7 of **C minor** (or C harmonic/melodic minor)  
Also enharmonically = vii°7 of **Eb minor, Gb minor, A minor**.

---

## **3. Looking at the other chords**

- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major triad with Bb in bass = Gb (Gb–Bb–Db)  
- **Dbm/Ab** = Dbm (Db–Fb–Ab) with Ab in bass (so still Dbm triad)  
- **B/Bb** = B major triad (B–D#–F#) with Bb in bass — this is a **polychord** or slash chord, B major over Bb bass.  
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E–G#–B–D# with Ab in bass (Ab = G# enharmonic clash? Actually Ab ≠ G# in equal temperament, so this is a cross-relation).

---

## **4. Finding a key center**

Let’s test **C minor** as a possibility (since Bbdim = vii°7 in C minor):

In C minor:  
- Bbdim = vii°7  
- Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db = not in C minor naturally (Gb is bVI in C minor? No, Gb is not in C natural minor scale. But Gb is bVI in C *harmonic* minor? No, C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B — Gb not there. So Gb is foreign to C minor.)

Gb major in C minor would be a **borrowed chord** from C Phrygian (bII)? Actually Gb = F# major? Wait, Gb = F#? Enharmonically yes, but in C minor, F# major is not a standard borrowed chord. But maybe it’s functioning as a **tritone substitution** of the V (G7) in C minor? Possibly.

---

## **5. Check Gb major’s relation**

Gb major = Gb Bb Db.  
If we respell Gb as F# major (F# A# C#), maybe the key is **B major**? Let’s test B major:  
Bbdim = Bb Db E Gb = A# C# E F#? That’s not a standard diminished in B major (B major’s vii°7 is A# C# E G). G natural, not Gb. So no.

---

## **6. Try key of Db major / Bb minor**

Bbdim in Bb minor = vii°7 (Bbdim = A#dim in C# minor? Let’s be systematic:)

Bbdim = vii°7 of C minor.  
But maybe the actual key is **Gb major**? Let’s check:  
Gb major scale = Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F.  
Bbdim = Bb Db E Gb — Bb and Db are in Gb major, but E natural is not (should be E double flat = Fb? Actually E natural = Fb? No, E natural is not in Gb major; Gb major has Fb = E natural? Wait Fb is E natural? No, Fb is enharmonic to E natural? Yes, Fb = E on piano. So Gb major has Fb (E) indeed! So Bb Db Fb (E) Gb = all notes in Gb major: Bb=III, Db=V, Fb=VII, Gb=I. Yes! So Bbdim is actually **vii°7 of Gb major**! That’s it.

---

## **7. Verify other chords in Gb major**

Gb major scale: Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F  
- Gb/Bb = I chord with 3rd in bass  
- Dbm/Ab = Dbm = Db Fb Ab = ii chord in Gb major (Dbm = ii)  
- B/Bb = B major triad (B D# F#) with Bb bass — B major is not in Gb major, but maybe a chromatic passing chord.  
- Emaj7/Ab = E G# B D# with Ab bass — Ab is II in Gb major, but E major triad is foreign. This suggests **mode mixture** or temporary tonicization.

---

## **8. Mode**

We’re in **Gb major** (not minor) because:  
- Bbdim is vii°7 of Gb major (from harmonic major or minor? Actually in major, vii°7 comes from harmonic minor of relative minor? Let’s check: Gb major’s relative minor is Eb minor. Eb harmonic minor: Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb D — vii°7 of Eb minor = D F Ab Cb = Ddim7. Not Bbdim. So Bbdim is not from relative minor.)

Better: In major keys, the vii°7 chord is built on the leading tone (F in Gb major) = F A Cb Eb = Fdim7. But we have Bbdim, not Fdim7. So maybe we’re in **Gb harmonic major**? No, Bbdim = maybe it’s a common-tone diminished chord of Gb (Ct°7). Bbdim shares Gb with Gb major chord, so it’s Gb’s common-tone diminished: Bbdim = Gb Bbdim.

Yes! Bbdim often functions as **common-tone diminished** for Gb major:  
Bbdim = Bb Db E Gb — note Gb is in Gb chord. So it’s a chromatic embellishment.

---

## **9. Conclusion**

The key is **Gb major**.  
The Bbdim chords are common-tone diminished chords tonicizing Gb.  
The other chords Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab fit in Gb major.  
B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab are borrowed chords / chromatic.

Mode: **Major** (despite the dim chords, the tonic is Gb major).

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Gb\ major}
\]
