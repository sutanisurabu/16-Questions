The provided chord progression is:

**Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Dbm/Ab | B/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Gb/Bb | Gb/Bb | Bbdim | Bbdim | Emaj7/Ab | Bbdim**

To determine the key and mode, we need to analyze the chords and their relationships, especially the quality of the tonic/final chord (which appears to be Bb diminished/Bbdim) and the presence of dominant or characteristic chords.

### 1. Analyzing the Chords

* **Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb):** Diminished triad (i.e., Bb-Db-E natural) - This is unusual as the primary starting and ending chord.
* **Gb/Bb (Bb-Db-Gb):** Gb Major chord with Bb in the bass. This is enharmonically equivalent to **Ebm/Bb**. (However, given Gb Major is a key area, let's keep it as Gb/Bb for now).
* **Dbm/Ab (Ab-Db-Fb):** Db minor chord with Ab in the bass (or C# minor with G# in the bass).
* **B/Bb (Bb-D#-F#):** B Major chord with Bb in the bass. (This creates a tritone tension with the root $\text{B}\flat$ and the bass $\text{B}$)
* **Emaj7/Ab (Ab-E-G#-B):** E Major 7th chord with Ab in the bass. This chord is diatonic to the key of E Major or A Major, but it is enharmonically related to F $^\circ$ sharp diminished. (However, given Emaj7 is a chord, let's keep it as Emaj7/Ab for now).

### 2. Identifying Potential Key Center

The progression starts and ends overwhelmingly on **Bbdim**. In classical theory, a diminished triad cannot function as a tonic of a major or minor key, but it can be the tonic of a **diminished scale/mode**.

If we assume the key center is **Bb**, the diatonic relationship must explain the frequent use of Gb, Dbm, and Emaj7.

Let's test the scales that contain a Bb diminished triad (Bb-Db-Fb):

#### A. Bb Harmonic Minor ($\text{B}\flat-\text{C}-\text{D}\flat-\text{E}\flat-\mathbf{F}-\mathbf{G}\flat-\text{A}$)
* Contains Bbdim (Bb-Db-F$\flat \approx$ E natural)? No. (It contains Bb-Db-F)
* Contains Gb? Yes.
* Contains Dbm? No.
* Contains Emaj7? No.

#### B. Bb Phrygian Mode ($\text{B}\flat-\text{C}\flat-\mathbf{D}\flat-\mathbf{E}\flat-\mathbf{F}-\mathbf{G}\flat-\mathbf{A}\flat$)
* Contains Bb-Db-Fb? No. (It contains $\text{B}\flat-\text{D}\flat-\text{F}$)
* Contains Gb? Yes.
* Contains Db minor (D $\flat$ - E $\flat$ - A $\flat$) ? No.

#### C. Bb Diminished Scales

The most likely candidate for a tonic Bbdim is a diminished scale.

**Bb Whole-Half Diminished Scale (Bb WH/Octatonic Scale):**
**$\text{B}\flat-\text{C}-\text{D}\flat-\text{E}\flat-\mathbf{E}\natural-\mathbf{F}\#-\mathbf{G}-\text{A}\flat$**

* Contains **Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb)**? If we interpret F-flat as E natural, yes.
* Contains **Gb**? No.
* Contains **Dbm** (Db-Fb-Ab)? If we interpret Fb as E natural, then Db-E-Ab. This is not diatonic.
* Contains **B** Major (B-D#-F#)? No.
* Contains **Emaj7** (E-G#-B)? No.

**Bb Half-Whole Diminished Scale (Bb HW/Octatonic Scale):**
**$\text{B}\flat-\text{C}\flat-\mathbf{D}\flat-\mathbf{E}\flat\flat/\mathbf{C}\natural-\mathbf{E}\flat-\mathbf{F}\flat/\mathbf{E}\natural-\mathbf{G}\flat-\mathbf{G}\dots$** (Too messy to use standard half-whole)

Let's use the one that starts with HW: $\text{B}\flat-\text{C}\flat-\text{D}\flat-\text{D}\natural/\text{E}\flat\flat-\text{E}\natural/\text{F}\flat-\text{F}\#-\text{G}\#/\text{A}\flat-\text{A}\natural$

* Contains **Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb)**? Yes, Bb-Db-Fb.
* Contains **Gb**? No.
* Contains **Dbm** (Db-Fb-Ab)? No.

### 3. Interpreting the Progression Enharmonically and Functionally

The progression strongly suggests a reliance on specific notes: $\text{B}\flat, \text{D}\flat, \text{F}\flat (\text{E}\natural)$, $\text{G}\flat$, $\text{A}\flat$.

Let's consider the key of **G-flat Major / E-flat Minor**, as $\text{G}\flat$ and $\text{E}\flat$ related chords appear frequently.

In **Gb Major** ($\text{G}\flat-\text{A}\flat-\text{B}\flat-\text{C}\flat-\text{D}\flat-\text{E}\flat-\text{F}$):
* $\text{G}\flat$ (I)
* $\text{B}\flat \text{dim/E}\flat \text{m}$ (iii or v) - $\text{Gb}/\text{B}\flat$ is $\text{I}/\text{III}.$
* $\text{B}\flat$ dim (Bb-Db-Fb) is not diatonic (it would be $\text{B}\flat \text{m/iii}$)

The most plausible interpretation suggests a heavily chromatic or modal context centered on $\text{B}\flat$, but struggling to place $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ as a tonic in a standard scale.

Let's look at the movement between $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ and $\text{G}\flat/\text{B}\flat$.
* $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ ($\text{B}\flat-\text{D}\flat-\text{E}\natural$)
* $\text{G}\flat/\text{B}\flat$ ($\text{B}\flat-\text{D}\flat-\text{G}\flat$)

This is a movement of a common tone diminished chord resolving to a new chord one step up/down in the bass. The relationship between $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ and $\text{G}\flat$ is closely related to $\text{E}\flat \text{m}$ (G $\flat$ is the submediant).

If we assume the key is **D-flat Major**: $\text{D}\flat - \text{E}\flat - \mathbf{F} - \mathbf{G}\flat - \mathbf{A}\flat - \mathbf{B}\flat - \mathbf{C}$
* $\text{G}\flat/\text{B}\flat$ (IV)
* $\text{D}\flat \text{m}/\text{A}\flat$ (A borrowed chord from $\text{D}\flat \text{m}$)
* $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ (vii/III/vi)?

### 4. Conclusion on Key and Mode

Given the extremely consistent return to $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ and the complex, chromatic nature of the other chords (many appearing to borrow from $\text{B}\flat$ minor/Phrygian/diminished, or $\text{D}\flat$/$\text{G}\flat$ Major regions), the music is centered around **B-flat**.

The frequent use of $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ as the key center strongly suggests the use of the **Diminished Scale** or a highly altered minor scale structure.

The notes heavily implied are $\text{B}\flat, \text{D}\flat, \text{F}\flat (\text{E}\natural)$, $\text{G}\flat, \text{A}\flat$.

This collection of notes does not perfectly fit any standard diatonic scale or common form of the Chromatic, Melodic Minor, or Harmonic Minor scales. The two most common diminished scales are Octatonic.

The movement between $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ and $\text{G}\flat/\text{B}\flat$ is often highly characteristic of an **$\text{E}\flat$ minor region** (where $\text{G}\flat$ is the III).

The presence of $\text{D}\flat \text{m}$ / $\text{C}\# \text{m}$ (relative minor of $\text{E}\text{ Maj}$ in some contexts) and the $\text{E} \text{maj}7$ chord further complicates an Octatonic interpretation.

In contexts where a diminished chord serves as tonic, the mode is typically the **Diminished Mode (Octatonic)**. Since the $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ chord (Bb-Db-Fb $\approx$ Bb-Db-E natural) is used, we look for which Diminished scale fits best.

* **Bb Whole-Half Diminished (Bb-C-Db-Eb-E-F#-G-Ab)**: This scale contains the notes $\text{B}\flat$, $\text{D}\flat$, $\text{E}\natural$ (F$\flat$ equivalent), and $\text{A}\flat$. **It is the most likely source for the Bb Diminished Tonic and the A flat bass.**
* **Gb/Bb (Bb-Db-Gb)**: Gb is not in the Bb WH scale.

Due to the lack of a perfect fit for a single scale that includes all the main chords ($\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$, $\text{G}\flat$, $\text{D}\flat \text{m}$, $\text{E} \text{maj}7$), the music employs **Modal Mixture** centered on $\text{B}\flat$.

However, based on the **repetition of the $\text{B}\flat \text{dim}$ chord as the anchor**, the primary key center is **B-flat**, and the defining mode is **Diminished**:

**Key Center:** B-flat
**Mode:** Diminished (likely leaning toward the Half-Whole or Whole-Half variety, which often mix elements) or a highly chromatic Aeolian (Minor) mode with added accidentals.

Given the construction of the tonic, the most accurate theoretical classification is:

**Key:** B-flat
**Mode:** Diminished Mode (Octatonic)
