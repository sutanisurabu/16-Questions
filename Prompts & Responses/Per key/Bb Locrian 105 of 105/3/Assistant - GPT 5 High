### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to examine the chord sequence: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim." It seems like an unusual progression, likely from a specific song.

Looking closely, Bbdim is a fully diminished triad. Gb/Bb indicates a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. This means I'm working with specific notes in context. There's a lot to unpack here!**Comparing chord notes**

I'm comparing Bbdim, which consists of Bb, Db, and E, to see how it relates to other chords. The key difference note is E versus Gb, and I realize E is enharmonically Fb, but that doesn’t seem to fit.

For Dbm/Ab, I note Db minor is enharmonically the same as C# minor. The Db minor triad contains Db, Fb (E), and Ab. When I arrange these over Ab, I get some interesting combinations, but this alignment is a bit unusual for standard triads. There’s definitely a lot to think through!**Examining chord relationships**

I’ve got notes on Db, Fb, and Ab, which can be written as Db, E, and Ab enharmonically. When I put this over an Ab bass, it resembles an Ab sus4 b5, but I’m not completely sure about that.

Next, I look at B/Bb. Here, B major over Bb creates an appoggiatura, though it might not fit standard diatonic keys. It’s interesting that B is enharmonically Cb. Finally, the Emaj7/Ab arrangement reveals some complexities with notes shifting over the bass. It seems like I'm seeing consistent movement with Bb appearing frequently.**Exploring leading tones**

I realize that the leading tone of B is actually A#, which forms a diminished triad with A#, C#, and E, rather than Bbdim. In the key of B, the corresponding leading-tone chord is A#dim. It’s interesting how Bb dim is enharmonically equal to A#dim, suggesting Bbdim could serve as the leading-tone diminished triad for both B major and minor.

I’m considering how composers notate this differently, often using A#dim in the key of B. Now, I want to check other chords for their fit with B’s key context. For example, Gb is enharmonically F#, and I want to see how that relates!**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing the chords and how they relate to the key of B major. For example, over an A# bass, I find Gb/Bb is enharmonically F#/A#, which is the V chord in first inversion. The Dbm/Ab chord also translates to C#m/G#.

I notice that the repeated patterns strongly suggest B major, fitting into diatonic structures. Each chord like Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, and Emaj7 follows well within this context. After thorough consideration, I conclude that the key is B major and the mode is Ionian.**Finalizing key and mode**

I tested the idea of different keys, starting with Gb major where the scale's fourth degree is Cb, and quickly ruled it out. Then, I checked E major, but found Bbdim (Bb, Db, E) doesn't fit in that scale either. This all points back to my original conclusion that B major is consistent.

So, I conclude that the key is B major and the mode is Ionian, noting that Bbdim functions as the leading-tone diminished triad (vii°) to B. Keeping it concise will help!

B major (Ionian).

Reasoning (enharmonic spellings in B):
- Bbdim = A#dim = vii°
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# = V6
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# = ii6/4
- B/Bb = I over leading-tone pedal (A#)
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# = IVmaj7 in first inversion

The repeated A# (Bb) pedal and prominent vii° and V functions point clearly to B Ionian.
