Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**

> Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb,  
> Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb,  
> Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb,  
> Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim

First, rewrite the chords with enharmonic equivalents for clarity and consistency (using standard naming conventions):

### Step 1: Interpret the Chords

- **Bbdim** = B♭ diminished (B♭–D♭–F♭)
- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major with B♭ in the bass → same as G♭ major chord (G♭–B♭–D♭), inversion
- **Dbm/Ab** = D♭ minor with A♭ in the bass → D♭–F♭–A♭ over A♭
- **B/Bb** = B major chord (B–D♯–F♯) over B♭ bass? This is unusual because B and B♭ are a half-step apart. Enharmonically:
  - B = C♭
  - So B/B♭ = C♭ chord (C♭–E♭–G♭) over B♭
  - That is problematic: C♭ and B are enharmonic, but the chord spelled as **B major** (B–D♯–F♯) over B♭ bass creates a very dissonant clash.
  - This might be a typo. More likely: **Bdim/Bb** or **B°/Bb**, which would make more sense harmonically.
  - Alternatively, perhaps it's meant to be **Bdim** or **B°** over Bb, implying a B diminished chord over Bb bass: B°/Bb = B–D–F over Bb → Bb–B–D–F → that's Bb7(♭9)? Not a typical spelling.
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th chord (E–G♯–B–D♯) with Ab in the bass. But E and Ab are a tritone apart.
  - Ab = G♯ enharmonically → so Ab in the bass = G♯, which is the 7th of Emaj7. So **Emaj7/G♯** is just Emaj7 in 3rd inversion.
  - So Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G♯ → correct spelling should be Emaj7/G♯, but Ab is enharmonic to G♯.

Let’s use enharmonic equivalents for consistency:

| Original       | Enharmonic/Corrected       | Notes                     |
|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Bbdim          | B♭° (B♭–D♭–F♭)             | Diminished triad          |
| Gb/Bb          | G♭ major over B♭ (1st inv) | G♭–B♭–D♭ → B♭ in bass     |
| Dbm/Ab         | D♭m/A♭                     | D♭–F♭–A♭ / A♭ → 1st inv   |
| B/Bb           | ? → likely **B°/Bb** or typo | Suspicious — B vs B♭ clash |
| Emaj7/Ab       | Emaj7/G♯                   | E–G♯–B–D♯ / G♯ → 3rd inv  |

But here's a possible reinterpretation: **B/Bb** could be a typo for **B°/Bb** (B diminished over Bb). That chord would be B–D–F over Bb → Bb–B–D–F → Bb7♭9 (Bb–D–F–Ab–B → but this chord has B, not Ab).

Wait: B–D–F = B°, so B°/Bb = Bb–B–D–F → that’s a Bb augmented sixth chord? Not standard.

Alternatively, **B/Bb** could be **A#7/Bb**? Very messy.

But let's consider context. The progression uses **Bbdim** repeatedly, **Gb/Bb**, **Dbm/Ab**, so we're operating in a **Bb**-centric world.

Let’s look at the bass notes:

- Bbdim → bass Bb
- Gb/Bb → bass Bb
- Dbm/Ab → bass Ab
- B/Bb → bass Bb
- Emaj7/Ab → bass Ab

So the bass alternates between **Bb** and **Ab**, and the harmonies seem to revolve around the **Bb** axis.

Now look at the chords:

1. **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–Fb (Fb = E)
   - Often used as leading tone chord to Cb (rare) or as chromatic passing chord
   - In Cb major: Bbdim is vii° of Cb
   - But Cb major is rarely used; enharmonically = **B major**, which is odd.

Alternatively, consider **G minor key** or **Bb major**? But Bb diminished is not diatonic to Bb major (which would have Dm, not Bbdim).

But Bbdim = Bb–Db–E? Wait — diminished chord is Bb–Db–Fb → Fb = E, so Bb–Db–E.

So the notes are Bb, Db, E.

That’s a Bb diminished chord (root Bb), but **E** is the major third of Cb, not standard.

Alternatively, is **Bbdim** being used as a **common tone diminished chord**?

A common use: **Bbdim** with Gb/Bb could imply a **common tone diminished chord** prolonging Gb.

But let’s analyze function.

Try to reframe everything in terms of **Ab major** or **F minor**, since Gb = F#, but Gb major is enharmonic to **F#**, which is unusual in this context.

Wait — Gb appears frequently.

- Gb/Bb = Gb major: Gb–Bb–Db

That’s the **bVI** chord in **Bb minor**.

Let’s check **Bb harmonic minor**:

- Bb minor: Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–A–Bb
- Harmonic minor raises 7th: A instead of Ab
- So Bb minor: Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb, A

Triads:
- i = Bbm
- ii° = Cb°
- III+ = Dbaug
- iv = Ebm
- v = Fb° → not used
- VI = Gb
- VII = A°

So **Gb major** is the **VI** chord in **Bb minor** — but in **natural minor**, not harmonic.

But harmonic minor would have **A°**, not Bbdim.

But we have **Bbdim**, which is not diatonic to Bb harmonic or natural minor.

Wait: Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb = Bb–Db–E

But in **Cb major**, Bbdim is vii°: Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab–Bb

That’s possible.

Cb major = B major (enharmonically), but B major is very sharp (5 sharps), while Cb has 7 flats — not likely in popular notation.

Alternatively, **Ab major**?

Ab major: Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G

Chords:
- Bbdim? Bb–Db–Fb → Fb = E, which is not in Ab major (has E♭). So no.

But diminished chords are often chromatic.

Look at **Gb/Bb** = Gb major first inversion.

Gb = F#, so in **B** or **b** key? Unlikely.

Wait — **Gb** is **bVI** in **Bb minor** (natural minor).

Bb natural minor: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab–Bb

Yes: Gb is the **bVI**, common in minor keys.

Similarly, **Dbm** = **iv** in Bb minor.

Dbm/Ab → D flat minor with A flat in bass → 1st inversion.

So far:
- Gb = bVI
- Dbm = iv
- Both fit in **Bb minor**

Now, **Bbdim** — this could be a **common-tone diminished chord** (ct°7) serving to embellish Bb.

That is, **Bbdim** functions as a chromatic passing chord with **Bb** as a common tone, enhancing a Bb chord.

But we never see a Bb chord — only Bbdim and other chords over Bb bass.

So perhaps **Bbdim** is not a functional vii° chord, but a **chromatic lower neighbor chord** to **Bb**, used to embellish the tonic.

Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab** = Emaj7 with Ab in bass — but Ab = G#, E = E, G# = E's major 3rd.

Wait: Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D#

But G# = Ab, so Emaj7/Ab = **Ab–E–G#–B–D#**? Too many notes.

Likely it's written with **Ab** meaning **G#**, so this is Emaj7/G# — third inversion.

But what function does **E major** have in Bb minor? E is the **augmented triad** on the #7 degree? Not standard.

Wait — E = enharmonic of **Fb** — but Fb is 5th scale degree of Bb minor.

Alternatively, **Emaj7** = **bIII+7** in Bb minor?

Bb minor: bIII = Db major (not E).

No.

But consider: **E major** = **III+** in C minor? Not matching.

Another idea: **Emaj7/G#** = **G#°maj7** with G# in bass → G#–B–D–F##? No.

Wait: Emaj7/G# = G#–B–D#–G#? No: E–G#–B–D# → in inversion: G#–B–D#–E

That’s G#–B–D#–E → G# half-diminished 7th? No: G#–B–D# is G#m, plus E = 6th → G#m6.

But this chord is E major 7th.

Alternatively, **Emaj7/G#** could be interpreted as a **V of VI** in Ab major?

In Ab major:
- VI = F minor
- V of VI = C7
- But E is not C.

E = **V of A**, not helpful.

Let’s look at bass motion:

Bass notes:
- Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Ab → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Bb → Ab → Bb

So bass alternates between **Bb** and **Ab**

- Most chords over Bb: Bbdim, Gb/Bb
- Chords over Ab: Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab

So the harmonic rhythm groups:

- [Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb] x2
- Then [Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb]
- Then [Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb]
- Then [Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim]

"**B/Bb**" is still suspicious. Let's assume it's a typo and should be **B°/Bb** or **Bdim/Bb**.

But Bdim = B–D–F → B/Bb = Bb–B–D–F — very dissonant.

Alternatively, could it be **Bbm**? Typo in inversion?

Or **B7/Bb**? B7 = B–D#–F#–A, over Bb — even worse.

Wait — another possibility: **B/Bb** could mean **Bb** chord with **B** in the bass? But that would be Bb/B → B over Bb → Bb–B → minor 9th — very dissonant.

Unlikely.

Alternatively, in jazz, "B" over "Bb" might mean a polychord, but still odd.

Let’s consider **"B/Bb"** might be **"Ab/Bb"** — typo? Ab/Bb = Ab major over Bb = Bb–Ab–Cb → 13th chord flavor?

Or **"Db/Bb"**?

But we have Dbm/Ab already.

Wait — **B** could be a typo for **Ab**? But Ab is already there.

Another idea: In some notations, "B" means **H**, but not in English.

Let’s look at **Emaj7/Ab** — Emaj7 with Ab bass.

As noted, Ab = G#, so this chord = G#–E–G#–B–D# → E major 7th with G# in bass → normal 3rd inversion.

But **E major** in the key of **Bb minor**? E = raised 7th of **F harmonic minor**.

Wait — could this be **F minor**?

F minor: F–G–Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F

Harmonic minor: Eb → E natural

So:
- v = Cb° — no
- VII = Eb (not E)

But E major is not diatonic.

But **E major** is the **V of Am**, but not helpful.

Wait — **E major** is **V of A**, but A is the **bIII** of F# minor?

Too far.

**Epiphany**: The chord **Emaj7/Ab** — with Ab in bass and E major on top — might actually be interpreted as **Ab7(#5#9)** or something, but that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, **Emaj7/G#** is enharmonic to **Fbmaj7/G#**? No.

Let’s consider the possibility that this is in **Ab major** or **F minor**, and **Emaj7** is really **Fb**, but not.

Another approach: **Voice Leading**

Let’s examine the chord progression with enharmonic spellings in **Bb minor**.

Assume the key is **Bb minor**, and we’re using chromaticism.

Chords:

1. Bbdim → Bb–Db–E (Fb)
2. Gb/Bb → Bb–Gb–Bb (Gb–Bb–Db)
3. Dbm/Ab → Ab–Db–Fb (Ab–Db–F)
4. Emaj7/Ab → Ab–E–G#–B–D#

Wait — G# = Ab, D# = Eb? But Ab–E–Ab–B–Eb → very dissonant.

But E and Ab are opposite ends of tritone.

Alternatively, **Emaj7/Ab** could be a **misspelling** of **Ebmaj7/Ab**?

Eb major 7th over Ab = Ab–Eb–Gb–Bb → that’s **Ab7(9)** without 3rd? Not quite.

Ab7 = Ab–C–Eb–Gb → so Ebmaj7/Ab = Ab–Eb–Gb–Bb → Ab7(9) if Ab is root.

So Ebmaj7/Ab = Ab9/C → possible.

But the chord is written as **Emaj7/Ab**, not Eb.

But "E" and "Eb" are different.

Unless typo.

Alternatively, **Emaj7/Ab** might mean **E7/Ab**?

E7 = E–G#–B–D, over Ab = Ab–E–G#–B–D

That’s Ab7#11(b9)? Ab–B–D–E–G#–B → possible, but complex.

But E7 is V of A, not related.

Back to bass: Bb and Ab.

Ab is the **b7** of Bb, so this could be a **i – bVII** motion in Bb minor.

- Bbdim and Gb/Bb (over Bb) = tonic area
- Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab = bVII area (Ab)

So the progression may be outlining **i** and **bVII** in **Bb minor**.

Let’s map:

- Bbdim: could be **i°**, not i, but used as tonic substitute
- Gb/Bb = **bVI** in Bb minor
- Dbm/Ab = **iv** in Bb minor, in first inversion
- Emaj7/Ab = mysterious

But Emaj7/Ab has E major on top, which is not in Bb minor.

However, **E = the leading tone of F**, so could be **V of vi** in Bb minor?

In Bb minor:
- vi = Gb
- V of vi = D7
- But here is E, not D.

E = **III#**, or **bII** of D, not helpful.

Wait — what if "Emaj7/Ab" is a typo for "Dmaj7/Ab"?

D = 4th scale degree of Gb major.

Alternatively, consider that **Emaj7/Ab** might be **Amaj7/C#** with wrong labeling? Unlikely.

Another idea: **Emaj7** with Ab bass might be an **inversion of Ab minor major 7th**?

Abm(maj7) = Ab–B–Db–G → B, not E.

No.

Perhaps it's **B7** spelled as **Emaj7/G#**? B7 = B–D#–F#–A → no E.

No.

Let’s consider the chord **B/Bb** again.

If we assume it’s a typo for **Ab major** chord, then we have symmetry.

But it's over Bb bass.

Perhaps **B/Bb** is meant to be **Bb7**, with "B" being a typo for "7".

In ASCII, "7" can look like "B", but unlikely.

Perhaps "B" means "flat"? No.

After careful analysis, let's consider the most likely explanation:

### Hypothesis: The piece is in **Bb minor**, with chromatic and modal mixture.

- **Bbdim**: chromatic passing or common-tone diminished (ct°7) to embellish Bb
- **Gb/Bb**: bVI in Bb minor — common in minor key (major VI in minor)
- **Dbm/Ab**: iv chord in Bb minor (iv = minor), first inversion
- **Emaj7/Ab**: This is the odd one. But **E = enharmonic to Fb**, the **diminished fifth**? Not useful.

Wait — **E = raised fourth** in Bb minor? Bb–C–Db–E natural = #11.

And **Ab = b7**.

So E–G#–B–D# over Ab.

But G# = Ab — so in the bass, we have Ab, and in the chord, Ab (G#), so the chord has Ab in two places.

The chord is Ab (bass), G# (as 3rd of Emaj7), E, B, D#.

So the combined notes are: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

That’s **Ab7#9#11** or something.

Specifically: Ab–C–Eb–G♭ + E (major 7), but no C.

Missing the 3rd of Ab.

This is not a standard Ab chord.

But **Emaj7/G#** is a common chord in **A minor** or **C# minor**.

E major is V of A.

But not related to Bb.

### Final Assessment:

After reviewing the progression, the most stable tonal center is **Bb**, and the most frequent harmonies are **Bbdim**, **Gb/Bb**, **Dbm/Ab**, all of which can be interpreted as extensions or chromatic variants in **Bb minor**.

The chord **B/Bb** is very problematic and likely a typo. Given the context, it might be intended as **Ab/Bb** or **Bbm/Bb** or **B°/Bb**.

Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab** might be meant to be **Ebmaj7/Ab** or **Dm7/Ab** or something else.

But if we accept **Emaj7/Ab** as written, its notes are: E, G#, B, D#, with Ab in bass.

With Ab = G#, so G# is in both bass and chord.

So the chord is: G#–E–G#–B–D# → E–G#–B–D#–G# → Emaj7 with #11 (G# = #11), but in 3rd inv.

And E major is the **III chord** in C# minor, but far afield.

### Alternative Insight:

Could this be in **Ab major**, using the **flat seven substitution** or jazz harmony?

- Bb dim → could be a **dominant substitute** for Gb7 or something.

Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb = Bb–Db–E

This is the same as the upper structure of **D7(b9)**: D–F#–A–C–Eb

But Bb, Db, E (Fb) = not matching.

Bbdim = part of **Bbdim7**: Bb–Db–E–G

= same as **G7(b9)**: G–B–D–F–Ab → Bb = A#, not present.

No.

After extensive analysis, the most coherent conclusion is:

### Most Likely Key: **Bb minor**

### Mode: Natural minor with chromatic alterations, possibly Dorian or jazz minor, but primarily **Aeolian (natural minor)** with modal mixture.

- Characteristic chords: bVI (Gb), iv (Dbm) — both appear
- Bbdim used as chromatic embellishment of i (tonic)
- The bass alternates between i (Bb) and bVII (Ab)
- Ab is **b7** of Bb minor

So the progression outlines a **i–bVII** motion, common in minor keys.

The chord "B/Bb" is likely a typo and may be intended as **Ab/Bb** or **Bbm/Bb**.

"Emaj7/Ab" is the biggest outlier. It might be intended as **Ebmaj7/Ab** (which would be Ab9) or perhaps **Amaj7/Ab**, but not clear.

However, if we consider **Emaj7/Ab** as a **tonicization of F minor** (V of vi), but E is not D7.

Wait — **E major** is **#iv°7** in Bb minor? iv = Eb, #iv = E.

So **E major** is not diminished.

No.

Given the challenges, another possibility is that this is in **Gb major**, but Bb is not in that key.

Final Answer:

### 🟩 Key: **Bb minor**

### 🟩 Mode: **Aeolian (natural minor)**, with modal mixture and chromaticism

- The tonic is Bb
- Chords: bVI (Gb), iv (Dbm), common-tone diminished (Bbdim)
- Bass motion between Bb (i) and Ab (bVII)
- "Emaj7/Ab" may be a typo for "Ebmaj7/Ab" or serve as a #iv major chord for color
- "B/Bb" is likely a typo, possibly meant to be "Bbm/Bb" or "Ab/Bb"

So despite the irregular chords, the center is **Bb minor**.
