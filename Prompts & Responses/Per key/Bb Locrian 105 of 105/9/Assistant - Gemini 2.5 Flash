The provided chord progression is: **Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**

This progression is highly unusual for conventional diatonic music and relies heavily on diminished chords, specifically **Bb diminished (Bbdim)**, which serves as the central tonic for much of the piece.

### Analysis of Chords and Function

1.  **Bbdim (Bb - Db - Fb [E])**: This chord is emphasized as the primary harmony, functioning as a tonic.
2.  **Gb/Bb (Bb - Db - Gb)**: This is a Bb minor chord with an added Gb. If we consider enharmonic spellings, the pitches are the same as **Gb major in 2nd inversion**.
3.  **Dbm/Ab (Ab - Bb - Db - Fb)**: This chord is complex. Dbm is Db - Fb - Ab. The chord has the notes Ab, Bb, Db, and Fb. This is an **Ab altered chord** or a variation of a highly chromatic harmony.
4.  **B/Bb (Bb - B - D# - F#)**: This chord is a B major chord over a Bb bass note. The notes $B$ and $Bb$ create a major seventh interval clash, common in jazz or chromatic composition.
5.  **Emaj7/Ab (Ab - G# - B - D#)**: $Emaj7$ is $E - G\# - B - D\#$. The bass is $Ab$. Since $G\#$ and $Ab$ are enharmonic, the chord is essentially **Emaj7 in 1st inversion.**

### Hypothesis on Key and Mode

The extreme chromaticism and persistent use of the diminished chord ($Bbdim$) suggest the music is **not** strictly diatonic (Major or all modes of Major).

#### The Role of the Diminished Chord

A diminished triad is highly symmetrical. It divides the octave into three minor thirds. If the *entire piece* centers around $Bbdim$, the key is likely defined by the symmetries of the diminished scale.

The most likely underlying scale structure is a **diminished scale** based on the tonic $Bbdim$. There are two common diminished scales:

1.  **Half-Whole (HW):** Start $Bb$, then $B$, then $C\#$, $D$, $E$, $F$, $G$, $G\#$...
2.  **Whole-Half (WH):** Start $Bb$, then $C$, then $D$, $E$, $F$, $F\#$, $G\#$, $A$...

The chords used seem to pull notes from the $Bb$ diminished world:
*   $Bb$, $Db$, $Fb$ (from $Bbdim$)
*   $Gb$ (from $Gb/Bb$)
*   $Ab$ (from $Dbm/Ab$ and $Emaj7/Ab$)
*   $B$ (from $B/Bb$)

All these pitches are present in the **Bb-Whole-Half Diminished Scale** ($Bb, C, Db, E, F, F\#, G\#, A$).

#### Comparison to Other Diminished Keys (The $Bb$ Diminished Axis)

The key of $Bb$ Diminished is symmetric and contains the same notes as $Db$ (or $C\#$), $E$, and $G$ Diminished.

### Conclusion

Given the overwhelming emphasis on $Bbdim$ as the home chord and the chromatic nature of the accompanying harmonies, the piece is centered on a **diminished tonal center**.

**Key:** **Bb Diminished** (Specifically, the tonal center is $Bb$, and the harmony is based on the diminished triad $Bb-Db-Fb$).

**Mode:** **Bb Whole-Half Diminished Scale** (also known as the octatonic scale).

*   *Scale Notes:* Bb - C - Db - Eb* (enharmonically E) - F - F# - G# (enharmonically Ab) - A.
