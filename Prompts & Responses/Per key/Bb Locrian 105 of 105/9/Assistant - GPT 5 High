**Analyzing progression for key and mode**

I'm trying to determine the key and mode based on the provided chord progression. I notice a recurring bass note, Bb, which might imply a pedal point. From there, I’ll check the scale degrees relative to Bb. 

The chords show some interesting elements: Bbdim forms a diminished triad rooted on Bb, whereas Gb/Bb features a major triad, Dbm/Ab depicts a minor triad, and B/Bb presents a B major triad, which is quite unusual. Let’s keep exploring!**Identifying mode and chord relationships**

I’m analyzing the semitone clash between B and Bb while looking at the chord Emaj7/Ab. The chord tones aren’t diatonic in relation to Bb, so I’m thinking about the tonal center and checking the relationships from Bb. 

The Bbdim chord gives me insights into the Locrian mode, where the tonic triad is indeed diminished. The scale degrees confirm that Bb Locrian fits. The tones align with the Bbdim triad, so it reaffirms my conclusion of using Bb Locrian as the mode!**Examining chord relationships in Bb Locrian**

Next, I'm analyzing the Gb/Bb chord, which is a Gb major triad over a Bb bass. This means I'm looking at a VI chord in Locrian, and since Gb major fits as the b6 chord, it confirms it’s diatonic in Bb Locrian. 

Then there's the Dbm/Ab chord, which corresponds to the b3 in the scale and also fits—perfect! Lastly, I examine the B/Bb triad, which is a B major triad over Bb bass. Let's keep going!**Exploring enharmonics in Bb Locrian**

I’m looking at the enharmonic relationships within the chords. For instance, the B major triad is enharmonically a Cb major triad, which fits as the b2 chord in Bb Locrian. This makes sense because Cb has Eb as its major third.

Then I move to Emaj7/Ab. Here, I find that the chord can be seen as Fbmaj7 in enharmonic terms, and all the notes correspond to the Bb Locrian scale. This reinforces that these chords are diatonic to the mode!**Summarizing tonal analysis**

I need to clarify that the tonal center is Bb, and the mode is Locrian, which includes color tones like b2, b3, b5, b6, and b7. In terms of harmonic function, the chords serve various roles: Bbdim acts as i°, Gb as VI, Dbm as iii°, and Cb (B) as bII (Neapolitan) in Locrian. Emaj7 (enharmonically Fbmaj7) can be labeled as bVmaj7. So, the key is Bb, and the mode is Bb Locrian, with Cb major as the parent key.

Bb Locrian (tonic center Bb; Locrian mode). 
Parent scale: Cb major (enharmonically B major).
