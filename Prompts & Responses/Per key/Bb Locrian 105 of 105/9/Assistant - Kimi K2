Alright, let's tackle this chord progression to determine the key and mode. Here's the given sequence:

**Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**

### Step 1: List Out the Chords Clearly
First, let's list all the unique chords we have, ignoring repetitions for now:

1. Bbdim
2. Gb/Bb
3. Dbm/Ab
4. B/Bb
5. Emaj7/Ab

### Step 2: Understand Each Chord's Composition
Let's break down each chord to understand the notes they contain.

1. **Bbdim**: A diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth.
   - Bb - root
   - Db - minor third (Bb to Db is 3 half steps)
   - Fb (which is E natural) - diminished fifth (Bb to Fb is 6 half steps)
   So, Bbdim = Bb, Db, E

2. **Gb/Bb**: This is a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass.
   - Gb major chord: Gb, Bb, Db
   - With Bb in the bass, it's the same notes but Bb is the lowest.
   So, Gb/Bb = Bb, Gb, Db (order doesn't matter for notes)

3. **Dbm/Ab**: Dbm is D flat minor triad with Ab in the bass.
   - Dbm: Db, Fb (E), Ab
   - With Ab in the bass: Ab, Db, E
   So, Dbm/Ab = Ab, Db, E

4. **B/Bb**: B major chord with Bb in the bass.
   - B major: B, D#, F#
   - With Bb in the bass: Bb, B, D#, F#
   This is a bit unusual because B and Bb are a minor second apart, creating a lot of tension.

5. **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7th chord with Ab in the bass.
   - Emaj7: E, G#, B, D#
   - With Ab in the bass: Ab, E, G#, B, D#
   Again, Ab and E are a diminished fifth apart, which is quite dissonant.

### Step 3: Collect All Unique Notes
From all these chords, let's list all the unique notes we have:

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E  
From Gb/Bb: Bb, Gb, Db  
From Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E  
From B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#  
From Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Combining these: Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, Gb, G#, Ab

But Gb is the same as F# (enharmonic equivalent), so we can simplify:

Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, G#, Ab

### Step 4: Arrange Notes in Order
Let's arrange these in order starting from Bb:

Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, G#, Ab

This spans from Bb to Ab, covering most of the chromatic scale within an octave, but we can look for a scale that fits these notes.

### Step 5: Identify Possible Scales
Given the presence of both Bb and B (a minor second apart), and other altered notes, this suggests we're dealing with a chromatic or altered scale rather than a standard diatonic scale. However, the presence of diminished chords and major chords with altered bass notes hints at a more modal or jazz-influenced approach.

Let's consider the diminished chord's role. Bbdim is the vii° chord in the key of C minor (but C minor has Bb as the leading tone, which is B natural in C minor, not Bb). Wait, no: in C minor, the vii° is Bdim (B, D, F), not Bbdim.

Bbdim is the vii° in the key of Cb major (which is the same as B major, but spelled with flats). But Cb major is highly impractical.

Alternatively, diminished chords can function as passing chords or as part of a sequence where they don't necessarily indicate the key directly.

### Step 6: Look for Tonal Centers
Let's see if any note stands out as a tonal center. The chord Emaj7/Ab is quite striking. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#, and with Ab in the bass, it's Ab, E, G#, B, D#. This could be seen as an Ab augmented major 7 (Ab, C, E, G#) but with the C raised to D#, which is unusual.

However, the notes E, G#, B, D# form E major 7, and adding Ab creates a lot of tension. This might suggest that E is an important tone, possibly the tonic, with the Ab as a chromatic approach or passing tone.

Similarly, the B/Bb chord is B major over Bb, which is highly chromatic, suggesting movement or tension around B.

### Step 7: Consider the Diminished Chord's Function
Bbdim appears frequently. In jazz, diminished chords often function as passing chords or as substitutes for dominant chords. For instance, Bbdim can be seen as a rootless A7b9 (A7 with a b9 would be A, C#, E, G, Bb), but missing the A and C#, it has Bb, E, G, which is close to Bbdim (Bb, Db, E), but not exact.

Alternatively, Bbdim can resolve to Cm (as vii°/i in C minor), but we don't have Cm here.

### Step 8: Re-examine the Notes for a Scale
Let's list the notes again without enharmonic duplicates for clarity:

Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, G#, Ab

This is quite chromatic, but let's see if it fits any known scale or mode. The presence of both Bb and B, and Db and D#, suggests heavy chromaticism, but we might be in a key where these are alterations.

One approach is to see these as coming from a diminished scale or an altered dominant scale, but since we have major and diminished chords, it's more likely a tonal center with chromatic approach.

### Step 9: Hypothesize E as the Tonic
Given Emaj7/Ab is the last distinct chord before returning to Bbdim, and Emaj7 is a strong tonic sound, let's hypothesize E as the tonic.

In E major, the notes are: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

But we have:
- Bb (not in E major)
- B (in E major)
- Db (not in E major, C# is)
- D# (in E major)
- E (in E major)
- F# (in E major)
- G# (in E major)
- Ab (not in E major, A is)

This doesn't fit E major because of Bb, Db, Ab.

### Step 10: Consider E as Tonic with Alterations
If we think of E as the tonic but with altered notes, this could be an altered scale or a mode with chromatic approach. However, the presence of Bb and Ab suggests flattened tones.

Alternatively, thinking enharmonically:

Ab is G#, but we have both, which is impossible unless we consider microtones, but here it's more likely spelling.

Wait, Ab and G# are the same pitch in equal temperament, but spelled differently based on context. Similarly, Db is C#, and Bb is A#.

Rewriting the notes considering enharmonic spellings based on E:

E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#

But we have:
- Bb (A#)
- B
- Db (C#)
- D#
- E
- F#
- G#
- Ab (G#)

So unique pitches are: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D# - which is E major or E ionian, but the spelling uses flats for some, which is unusual unless descending or for chord construction.

However, the chords use these spellings for voice leading or chord construction, like Bbdim instead of A#dim (which would be the same notes).

### Step 11: Re-evaluate the Key Center
Given that the notes can be spelled as E major with enharmonics, but the chords are constructed with flats, this suggests that the key is centered around E, but the chords are using flat spellings for functional reasons.

The Bbdim is essentially A#dim in E major (vii°), but spelled as Bbdim for readability or voice leading.

Similarly, Gb is F#, Db is C#, etc.

Thus, the entire progression can be seen as being in E major, with chords spelled enharmonically for functional or voice-leading purposes.

### Step 12: Verify Against E Major
Let's check the chords against E major:

E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

Chord degrees in E major:
- I: E major
- ii: F#m
- iii: G#m
- IV: A major
- V: B major
- vi: C#m
- vii°: D#dim (D#, F#, A)

Now, our chords:

1. Bbdim = A#dim = A#, C#, E (but vii° is D#, F#, A) - this is not the same as D#dim, but A#dim is the same as D#dim respelled (A#dim is A#, C#, E; D#dim is D#, F#, A - these are the same intervals but different roots, actually they're a minor third apart, forming a diminished symmetry).

Wait, A#dim is indeed vii°/iii (relative to G#), but in E major, vii° is D#dim.

However, diminished chords are symmetric, so Bbdim (Bb, Db, E) is the same as Dbdim (Db, E, G) and Edim (E, G, Bb), each a minor third apart.

Thus, Bbdim can function as viidim in C minor (but we're not in C minor), or as a passing chord.

Given the heavy use of Bbdim, it's likely functioning as a chromatic passing chord leading to or from E.

### Step 13: Consider Modal Interchange
The progression seems to center around E, with chromatic approach using diminished chords. The Emaj7 is the clearest tonic, and the other chords create tension resolving back to E-related sounds.

Thus, the key is effectively **E major**, with heavy chromatic approach using diminished chords and altered bass notes for tension.

However, the mode is more accurately described as **E Ionian** (the major mode), since the underlying tonal center is E major, despite the chromatic decorations.

### Final Determination
After carefully analyzing the chord structures and their relationship to the tonal center, the progression is centered in:

**Key: E major**  
**Mode: E Ionian (major)**  

The extensive use of diminished chords and altered bass notes creates chromatic tension and release around the E major tonic.
