Let’s look at your chord sequence carefully and reason it out step-by-step:

---

### Chord list
```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

---

### Step 1: Note content of each chord
| Chord     | Notes                          |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Bbdim**  | Bb – Db – E (enharmonically: D#) |
| **Gb/Bb**  | Gb – Bb – Db |
| **Dbm/Ab** | Db – E – Ab (enharmonic: G#) |
| **B/Bb**   | Bb – B – D# – F# (odd/passing) |
| **Emaj7/Ab** | E – G# – B – D# |

We see heavy use of flats (Bb, Db, Gb), suggesting a flat-based key—likely **Gb major** (6 flats) or **Eb minor** (its relative).

Let’s see what aligns:

### Step 2: Relationship around Gb/Eb minor area

**Gb major scale:** Gb – Ab – Bb – Cb – Db – Eb – F  
**Eb minor scale:** Eb – F – Gb – Ab – Bb – Cb – Db

Let's map the chords to Gb major:

| Chord    | Function (approx. in Gb major) |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Bbdim (Bb Db E) | E is natural (not Fb), so this chord isn’t strictly diatonic; it might be a **leading-tone diminished built on Bb** pointing to **B natural or Cb**. |
| Gb/Bb | That’s clearly **I** (Gb major in first inversion). |
| Dbm/Ab | Db minor (iv in Gb minor-like modal mixture) — borrowed from the parallel minor. |
| B/Bb | Non-diatonic chromatic passing sonority. |
| Emaj7/Ab | E major is the **flat sixth** (bVI) in Gb major — strongly borrowed from the parallel minor (or modal interchange). |

---

### Step 3: Functional feel

You have a repeating ostinato:
- Bbdim → Gb/Bb as primary motion.

That feels like a **chromatically inflected approach to the tonic Gb** — the diminished acts as a leading-tone or color chord preceding Gb major.

Everything repeatedly resolves to or passes through **Gb** sonorities, so **Gb** feels like the tonal center.

Dbm (iv), Emaj7 (bVI), and the diminished chords all suggest heavy **modal mixture from Gb minor** (Gb Aeolian feel).

---

✅ **Likely key center:** **Gb major**, with **modal borrowing from Gb minor (Gb Aeolian)**.

If you preferred to describe it in relative terms:
- **Tonic:** Gb
- **Mode:** Major with minor/modal interchange, you could say **Gb major with Aeolian modal mixture**, or “**Gb mixolydian/minor color**.”

---

### Summary answer
**Key center:** Gb  
**Mode / quality:** Gb major, with extensive modal mixture from Gb minor (Aeolian).

---

If you hear the piece and the tonal gravity leans darker (toward Emaj7 and Dbm colors), you might also describe it as **Gb Aeolian (natural minor)** with borrowed major tonic sonorities — but Gb is unequivocally the center.
