Let’s analyze this chord progression:

**Chord list:**
- B♭dim  
- B♭dim  
- G♭/B♭  
- G♭/B♭  
- B♭dim  
- B♭dim  
- D♭m/Ab  
- B/B♭  
- B♭dim  
- B♭dim  
- G♭/B♭  
- G♭/B♭  
- B♭dim  
- B♭dim  
- E:maj7/Ab  
- B♭dim  

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center
The chord **B♭dim** appears **9 times**, and many other chords use **B♭ in the bass** (Gb/B♭, B/B♭, Emaj7/Ab has Ab in bass but appears only once). The consistent return to B♭dim *and* the use of B♭ in the bass of other chords strongly suggests **B♭ as a tonal center**, even if it’s not a stable major/minor chord.

### Step 2: Consider diminished harmony
A fully diminished chord (like B♭dim = B♭–D♭–E–G) is symmetrical and can resolve in multiple ways. However, when a diminished chord is repeatedly used as a **tonic substitute**, it often implies a **diminished scale** or a **mode of a diminished scale**.

But more tellingly, **B♭dim** contains the notes:
- B♭, D♭, E (or F♭), G

Now look at other chords:

- **G♭/B♭** = G♭ major with B♭ in bass → notes: G♭, B♭, D♭ → shares B♭ and D♭ with B♭dim.
- **D♭m/Ab** = D♭ minor over A♭ bass → notes: A♭, D♭, F♭ (E), A♭ → includes D♭, E (F♭), and A♭.
- **B/B♭** = B major over B♭ bass → notes: B♭ (bass), B, D♯, F♯ → this is VERY dissonant and chromatic. But note: B = C♭, so this is enharmonically C♭ major over B♭ – possibly a chromatic mediant or altered chord.
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 over A♭ bass → notes: A♭, E, G♯, B, D♯. Note enharmonically: E = F♭, G♯ = A♭, D♯ = E♭. So this is highly chromatic.

But perhaps more useful: consider the **octatonic (diminished) scale**.

### Step 3: Check octatonic scale fit
There are two octatonic scales:

1. **Half-whole diminished** (starting with half step):  
   B♭, B, D♭, D, E, F, G, A, (B♭)

2. **Whole-half diminished** (starting with whole step):  
   B♭, C, D♭, E♭, E, F♯, G, A, (B♭)

Now check chord tones:

- B♭dim = B♭, D♭, E, G → fits **half-whole** scale (1, 3, 5, 7 of the scale)
- G♭ major = G♭, B♭, D♭ → G♭ is not in the half-whole scale above (which has G natural, not G♭). But wait—G♭ = F♯, which **is** in the **whole-half** diminished scale on B♭:  
  B♭ whole-half = B♭, C, D♭, E♭, E, F♯, G, A

Here, G♭ = F♯ → present  
B♭ → root  
D♭ → present  
So G♭ major fits the **whole-half diminished scale** on B♭.

- D♭ minor = D♭, F♭ (E), A♭ → all these notes are in B♭ whole-half:  
  D♭ ✓, E ✓, A♭? Wait—A♭ is **not** in the B♭ whole-half diminished scale listed above (which has A natural). Hmm.

Wait—maybe consider **B♭ half-whole** again:
B♭, B, D♭, D, E, F, G, A♭

Wait! That’s the correct **half-whole** diminished scale starting on B♭:
- Start on B♭
- Half step → B
- Whole → C# (D♭)
- Half → D
- Whole → E
- Half → F
- Whole → G
- Half → A♭
- Whole → B♭

So B♭ half-whole = **B♭, B, D♭, D, E, F, G, A♭**

Now check chords:

- B♭dim = B♭, D♭, E, G → all in scale ✓  
- G♭ major = G♭, B♭, D♭ → but G♭ = F♯ → **not** in this scale (we have G natural and F natural, not F♯) → so **Gb major doesn’t fit** B♭ half-whole.

But wait—what if the tonal center is **G♭**?

Try **G♭ half-whole diminished**:
G♭, G, A, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, E

Chords:
- B♭dim = B♭, D♭, E, G → E and G are in this scale (E = E, G = G) → yes
- G♭ = root
- D♭m = D♭, E, A♭ → A♭ = G♯ → **not in** G♭ half-whole (which has G, not G♯)

This is getting messy.

### Step 4: Consider functional harmony / modal interchange
Another possibility: this progression is in **B♭ minor**, and B♭dim is acting as a **common-tone diminished chord** on the tonic.

In **B♭ minor**, the diatonic chords include:
- B♭m
- Cdim
- D♭maj
- E♭m
- Fm
- G♭maj
- A♭maj

But **B♭dim** is **not** diatonic to B♭ natural minor. However, **B♭dim** can appear as a **common-tone diminished chord** on the tonic in minor keys—used for color.

Also, **G♭ major** is the **bVI** chord in B♭ minor — a standard modal interchange chord from B♭ Aeolian or harmonic minor.

**D♭ minor** is the **bIII** — also common in minor keys.

**B major over B♭ bass** is **extremely chromatic**, but B major is the **V of E**, and **Emaj7** appears later — so maybe a secondary dominant or tritone substitution?

Now look at **Emaj7/Ab**:
- E major is **V of A**, but A is not in B♭.
- However, **E** is the **major third of C♭**, and C♭ = B — again, odd.

But note: **E major** contains G#, which is the **leading tone of A♭**, and A♭ is the **bVII** in B♭ minor.

Alternatively, consider **B♭ harmonic minor**:
Scale: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A, B♭

Chords:
- G♭ major = bVI — exists
- D♭ minor = bIII — exists
- B♭dim? Not directly, but **A° (A–C–E♭–G♭)** is the vii°7 in B♭ harmonic minor. B♭dim is **not** part of this.

But what if the tonic is **A♭**?

In **A♭ major**:
- B♭dim = ii° — possible
- G♭/B♭ = G♭ is bVII, B♭ is ii — plausible
- D♭m/Ab = D♭m is iv, over A♭ = tonic — makes sense
- B/B♭ = B major over B♭ — still odd
- Emaj7/Ab = E = V of A, but A is not in A♭

Not convincing.

### Step 5: Reconsider the bass line
Bass notes:
1. B♭  
2. B♭  
3. B♭ (from Gb/B♭)  
4. B♭  
5. B♭  
6. B♭  
7. A♭ (from Dbm/Ab)  
8. B♭ (from B/B♭)  
9. B♭  
10. B♭  
11. B♭  
12. B♭  
13. B♭  
14. B♭  
15. A♭ (from Emaj7/Ab)  
16. B♭

So bass is almost always **B♭**, with brief dips to **A♭**.

This strongly implies **B♭ is the tonal center**.

### Step 6: Analyze chord tones over B♭ bass
- B♭dim → B♭, D♭, E, G
- G♭/B♭ → B♭, D♭, G♭
- D♭m/Ab → A♭, D♭, E (F♭)
- B/B♭ → B♭, B, D♯, F♯ → very dissonant, but note **B = C♭, D♯ = E♭, F♯ = G♭** → so enharmonically: C♭, E♭, G♭ = **A♭ minor chord**! Wait—B major = C♭ major → C♭, E♭, G♭ → that’s **A♭ minor’s bVI?** No—C♭ major is the **Neapolitan** of A♭, but we’re in B♭.

But **C♭ major over B♭ bass** = **B♭ with a major 7th (A♭? No—C♭ is b9)** → extremely altered.

However, notice that **many chords share B♭, D♭, E (F♭), G, G♭**.

Collect all unique pitch classes:
- B♭
- D♭
- E (F♭)
- G
- G♭ (F♯)
- A♭
- B (C♭)
- D♯ (E♭)
- F♯ (G♭)

That’s **almost all 12 tones** — so this may be **atonal or highly chromatic**.

But the repetition of **B♭dim** suggests it’s the home chord.

### Step 7: Likely answer — B♭ diminished / octatonic
Given:
- Tonic pitch: B♭
- Dominant chord: B♭dim (used as stable point)
- Other chords fit within **B♭ half-whole diminished scale**

Let’s double-check **B♭ half-whole diminished scale**:
**B♭, B, D♭, D, E, F, G, A♭**

Now map chords:

- B♭dim = B♭, D♭, E, G → ✓ all in scale
- G♭ = F♯ → **not in scale** → problem

But wait—what if it’s **G major**, not G♭? Typo? Unlikely.

Alternative: maybe the key is **E major**, and this is a series of tritone substitutions?

Emaj7 appears once — maybe that’s the tonic?

But bass is almost always B♭, not E.

### Step 8: Consider polymodal or synthetic scale
Perhaps the mode is **Locrian ♮2** (6th mode of melodic minor)?

B♭ Locrian ♮2 = from C♭ melodic minor = B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭

Chords:
- B♭dim? B♭, D♭, F♭ — but F♭ = E, which is **not** in this scale (has E♭, not E) → no

### Final interpretation

The most consistent explanation is that this progression is centered on **B♭**, using **B♭ diminished as a tonic substitute**, and the harmony is derived from the **B♭ half-whole diminished scale (octatonic)**, with brief chromatic excursions (like G♭ major and B major) for color.

Thus:

> **Tonal center: B♭**  
> **Mode: Half-whole diminished (octatonic) scale, starting on B♭**  
> — also known as the **B♭ diminished scale**

This scale is symmetric and has no traditional "key signature," but is a **synthetic scale** used in jazz and 20th-century harmony.

### ✅ Final Answer:
- **Key center:** B♭  
- **Mode:** B♭ half-whole diminished (octatonic) scale
