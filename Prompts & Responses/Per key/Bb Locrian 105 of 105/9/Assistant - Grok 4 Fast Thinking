Ab Major (Ionian mode)

This progression centers on A♭ major, with a Bb pedal point throughout much of it. The repeated B♭dim (fully voiced as a dim7) is enharmonically equivalent to G°7—the leading-tone (vii°) chord in A♭ major—and serves as the primary structural element. The Ab bass inserts (under D♭m and Emaj7) emphasize the tonic root. Other chords (e.g., Gb/B♭, D♭m/Ab) incorporate chromaticism, modal mixture from A♭ minor, and passing/secondary functions, but do not disrupt the overall A♭ major tonality.
