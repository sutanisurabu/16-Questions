**Exploring Fb major in Locrian**

I’m diving into the chord quality in Locrian, specifically looking at the fifth of Locrian, which is Fb. I’m computing the triad on Fb, and it looks like the notes are Fb, Ab, and Cb, forming a major triad. The interval between Fb and Ab is indeed a major third. So, the v chord in Locrian, where the fifth is b5, is major after all. I’m piecing together that it ties to the scale structure nicely!**Analyzing chords in Locrian**

I’m looking at Emaj7 and its transition to Fbmaj7, both of which belong to the Cb major scale, over an Ab bass. B major, being enharmonically equivalent to Cb major, functions well as a bII chord in Bb Locrian. It's interesting that all these chords fit within the Cb major framework, maintaining a center around Bb Locrian. This leads me to think about how the repetition of certain diminished chords and the others contribute to establishing Bb Locrian as the effective mode.**Identifying chord relationships**

I’m recognizing that there’s a mixture of flats and sharps in the chords, like using Emaj7 instead of Fbmaj7 and seeing Gb and Dbm. I’m thinking it makes sense to present this as Bb Locrian, which derives from the Cb major scale, while also noting its enharmonic relationship to A# Locrian from B major. Clarifying this helps since both keys have their distinctions, but I'll stick with Bb Locrian as the mode of Cb major. I’ll also map out the chords for better clarity!**Determining the key and mode**

I’ve concluded that the parent key is Cb major, which is enharmonically equivalent to B major. The mode is Bb Locrian, with the tonal center on Bb. For clarity, I'll state it succinctly: "Bb Locrian (mode of Cb major/B major)." I can mention that the chord progression revolves around Bb in the bass and incorporates diatonic chords related to Cb major, ending on Bbdim, which strongly indicates the Locrian mode. I want to ensure my answer is clear and concise!

Bb Locrian (parent major: Cb major, enharmonic to B major)

- Bbdim = i°
- Gb/Bb = bVI over 1
- Dbm/Ab = bIII over bVII
- B/Bb = bII (Cb) over 1
- Emaj7/Ab = Fbmaj7 over bVII

The harmony is diatonic to Cb major with Bb as the tonal center, hence Bb Locrian.
