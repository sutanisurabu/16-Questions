**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B**

Let’s analyze this chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### Given Chord Progression:
**Bbdim - Bbdim - Gb/Bb - Gb/Bb - Bbdim - Bbdim - Dbm/Ab - B/Bb - Bbdim - Bbdim - Gb/Bb - Gb/Bb - Bbdim - Bbdim - Emaj7/Ab - Bbdim**

We’ll simplify and interpret:

We see a lot of **Bbdim** (B♭ diminished), **Gb/Bb** (G♭ major with B♭ in the bass), **Dbm/Ab** (D♭ minor with A♭ in the bass), **B/Bb** (B major with B♭ in the bass), and **Emaj7/Ab** (E major 7 with A♭ in the bass).

---

### Step 1: List the unique chords and their components

1. **Bbdim** = B♭ - D♭ - F♭ (enharmonic to E)  
   → Notes: **B♭, D♭, F♭** (F♭ = E)

2. **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major triad with B♭ in bass → G♭ - B♭ - D♭  
   → Notes: **G♭, B♭, D♭** → This is the **B♭ minor 7 flat 5** (B♭ half-diminished) harmony without the 7th — but it’s voiced as a G♭ major triad over B♭.  
   → Functionally: G♭/B♭ = **B♭ minor 7 flat 5** without the 7th → **Bø7** (but we’ll see)

   But wait — G♭ major triad over B♭ bass → notes: **B♭, G♭, B♭, D♭** → So the full set is **B♭, D♭, G♭** — that’s the **B♭ half-diminished** chord!  
   → So **Gb/Bb = Bø7** (B♭ half-diminished)

3. **Dbm/Ab** = D♭ minor triad over A♭ bass → D♭ - F♭ - A♭ → Notes: **A♭, D♭, F♭**  
   → That’s an **A♭ minor chord** → **Abm**

4. **B/Bb** = B major triad over B♭ bass → B - D♯ - F♯ over B♭  
   → Notes: **B♭, B, D♯, F♯**  
   → This is very unusual! It’s a **clashing root** — B major and B♭ bass — creating a **B major with a ♭9 (B♭)** — like a **B7(♭9)** without 7th? But no 7th is present.  
   → Actually, this is a **non-diatonic, chromatic passing or deceptive chord** — B major over B♭ bass creates a **B△/B♭** — not diatonic to any standard key.  
   → Sounds like **B△/B♭ = B major over B♭ bass** — intervallically:  
     - B♭ (bass)  
     - B (root of chord) → ♭9 relative to B♭  
     - D♯ (3rd)  
     - F♯ (5th)  
   → So this is a **B major triad = E major scale** — very far from B♭.

5. **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 chord over A♭ bass → E - G♯ - B - D♯ over A♭  
   → Notes: **A♭, E, G♯, B, D♯**  
   → But A♭ and E are a tritone apart; G♯ and B are in E major 7, D♯ is the 7th.

   So: **A♭, E, G♯, B, D♯**  
   → Let's see if this can be considered as a F#7#5 or something? Not easily.  
   → This is **extremely chromatic**.

Wait — **do we see any diatonic center?**

---

### Step 2: Look for common tonal center

We see **Bbdim** repeated a lot — that’s the **B♭ diminished chord**, often a passing chord or destabilizing.

But then we get **Gb/Bb = Bø7**, which **is** the iiø7 chord in **A minor**!

Let’s check:

In **A minor (natural)**:  
- i: Am  
- iiø7: Bø7 = B-D-F-A → but we have **B♭-D♭-F♭** — that’s **B♭ half-diminished**

Ah! So if we have **B♭ø7**, that’s the **iiø7** in **A♭ major** (or A♭ minor).

Let’s test **A♭ major as key**:

**A♭ Major scale**:  
A♭ - B♭ - C - D♭ - E♭ - F - G

Chords:  
- i: A♭  
- ii: B♭m  
- iii: Cm  
- iv: D♭  
- v: E♭  
- vi: Fm  
- vii°: G°

Wait — the vii° is **G diminished**, not B♭dim.

B♭dim = B♭-D♭-F♭ — what chord is that in A♭ major?

B♭-D♭-F♭ = **B♭ half-diminished**? No — half-diminished is B♭-D♭-F♭-A♭ — so that’s **B♭ø7**

In A♭ major, the ii chord is B♭m7 (B♭-D♭-F-A♭)

But our chord is **B♭dim** = B♭-D♭-F♭ → missing the 7th.

**F♭ = E** — so B♭-D♭-E — that’s not the diatonic chord.

Wait — F♭ is enharmonic to E natural — but in A♭ major, F naval is F natural? No — A♭ major has **F natural?**  
A♭ major: A-B♭-C-D♭-E♭-F-G — so **F natural**.

So B♭-D♭-F♭ = B♭-D♭-E — E is the **leading tone**, not in A♭ major — **it’s not diatonic**.

So perhaps we’re in **F minor**?

F minor scale: F-G♭-A♭-B♭-C-Db-E♭

Chords:  
- i: Fm  
- ii°: G♭dim = G♭-B♭-D♭ → YES!  
- iii: A♭  
- iv: B♭m  
- v: Cm  
- vi: D♭  
- vii: E♭

Wait — we have **B♭dim** — which is B♭-D♭-F♭

In F minor:  
- ii° chord = **G♭ dim** = G♭-B♭-D♭  
- So **B♭dim** = **B♭-D♭-E** — again, E is not in F minor.  
F minor has E♭, not E.

We're getting **F♭ (E)** everywhere. So this implies we're in **E major** or something? But then the bass is all flats.

Let’s reconsider.

---

### Step 3: Look at bass notes — strong clues

Bass notes:  
1. B♭ (Bbdim)  
2. B♭ (Bbdim)  
3. B♭ (Gb/Bb)  
4. B♭ (Gb/Bb)  
5. B♭ (Bbdim)  
6. B♭ (Bbdim)  
7. A♭ (Dbm/Ab)  
8. B♭ (B/Bb) ← B major, B♭ bass  
9. B♭ (Bbdim)  
10. B♭ (Bbdim)  
11. B♭ (Gb/Bb)  
12. B♭ (Gb/Bb)  
13. B♭ (Bbdim)  
14. B♭ (Bbdim)  
15. A♭ (Emaj7/Ab)  
16. B♭ (Bbdim)

So the bass is mostly **B♭**, with occasional **A♭**.

That makes **B♭** the **strong tonal center**.

So we’re likely in **B♭ major** or **B♭ minor**.

Let’s test **B♭ minor** as key:

**B♭ minor scale**:  
B♭ - C - D♭ - E♭ - F - G♭ - A♭

Chords:  
- i: B♭m  
- ii°: C° = C-E♭-G  
- iii: D♭  
- iv: E♭m  
- v: Fm  
- VI: G♭  
- VII: A♭

We have **B♭dim** — B♭-D♭-F♭  
But in B♭ minor, the i chord is B♭-D♭-F — not F♭.  
F♭ = E — so B♭-D♭-E → That’s **B♭ diminished** — a **non-diatonic altered chord**.

But we also have **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major over B♭ bass → G♭-B♭-D♭ — which IS the **VI chord** in B♭ minor!

Yes! In B♭ minor, the **VI chord is G♭ major** — and we’re seeing **Gb/Bb**, which is G♭ maj triad on B♭ bass.

That sounds like a **bVI chord** (uppercase because it's major in minor key), and it’s in **first inversion**.

Then we have **Dbm/Ab** — D♭ minor over A♭ bass → D♭-F♭-A♭ → **A♭ minor chord**, which is **vii°** in B♭ minor?  
Wait — in B♭ minor, vii° is A♭ diminished = A♭-C-E♭ — not minor.

D♭m = D♭-F♭-A♭ — that’s **iv** in G minor?  
Or — **A♭ minor** is the **vii chord** in B major? Still off.

Wait — **A♭ minor = vii° in B major?** No, vii° in B major is A#°.

In **B♭ minor**, **F♭ = E** — so D♭m = D♭-E-A♭ — but E is not in B♭ minor — B♭ minor has E♭, so E is **chromatic**.

But E is the leading tone of F! So this suggests **E is a leading tone to F**, F is the IV in B♭ minor.

This is getting complex.

Let’s look at **Emaj7/Ab** = E-G♯-B-D♯ over A♭

So: A♭-E-G♯-B-D♯

Let’s look at **E major** = E-G♯-B-D♯

So this is **E major 7 with A♭ bass** — that’s **E△7 / A♭**

A♭ and E are **tritone apart** — that’s a classic **substitution** — **tritone substitution**!

In jazz, a dominant 7th chord can be replaced by another 7th chord a tritone away.

So E△7 is a major 7th, not 7th — but E7 would be E-G♯-B-D — here we have D♯, so it's major 7.

Still, **A♭ bass with E major 7** is a very common jazz color — it implies **A♭7#11** or something? Actually, **E△7 / A♭** sounds like **A♭7#11**? Let's check:

- A♭ root
- E = ♯11? 11th above A♭ is D♭, ♯11 = D
- But E is not D... E is ♯5? A♭ to E = augmented 5th!

A♭ to E = **augmented 5th (or diminished 6th)**.

So E△7 / A♭ = A♭ with 3rd? 5th? 7th? Missing.

It’s an **E major 7 chord superimposed on A♭ bass** — very **non-diatonic chromatic color**.

So we must consider **modal interchange** or **jazz harmony**.

---

### Step 4: Reconcile all chords — look for key with minor 7 flat 5 (B♭ø7) and bVI major

We keep seeing:
- B♭dim → sounds like **vii°** or **i°** in some key
- Gb/Bb → **bVI** in B♭ minor

Let’s assume: **B♭ minor**

Scale: B♭ - C - D♭ - E♭ - F - G♭ - A♭

Chords:
- i: B♭m  
- ii°: C° (C-E♭-G)  
- iii: D♭ (D♭-F-A♭) — **major triad**  
- iv: E♭m (E♭-G♭-B♭)  
- v: Fm (F-A♭-C)  
- VI: G♭ (G♭-B♭-D♭) — ✅ we see **Gb/Bb = G♭ major on B♭ bass** — so bVI  
- vii°: A♭° (A♭-C-E♭) — we see **Dbm/Ab = D♭m over A♭ bass** → D♭-F♭-A♭ = **A♭ minor**? Wait, F♭ = E

BUT: In B♭ minor, D♭ is the **iii chord** — and it’s **D♭ major** (D♭-F-A♭)

We’re getting **D♭m = D♭-F♭-A♭**

So F♭ = E — which is **not in B♭ minor** — B♭ minor has **F natural**?, no — B♭ minor: F is natural.

Wait — B♭ minor scale: **B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭**

So F is natural.

So D♭m = D♭-F♭-A♭ = D♭-E-A♭ — F♭ = E — that’s **E natural**, which is **not in the scale**. So this doesn't fit.

So perhaps we’re in **B♭ Dorian**? Or **F Dorian**? Let’s try.

### Step 5: Try **F minor** — because of G♭ major and B♭dim?

F minor: **F-G♭-A♭-B♭-C-D♭-E♭**

Chords:
- i: Fm
- ii°: G♭° = G♭-B♭-D♭ → YES! That’s our **Gb/Bb chord?** G♭° is G♭-B♭-D♭ — same as the Gb/Bb chord! But we’re calling it **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major triad over B♭ bass — but here **G♭°** is diminished, not major.

But we have **Gb/Bb = G♭ major** — not diminished.

So that doesn't work.

Wait — perhaps the chord **Gb/Bb** is **not G♭ diminished**, but **G♭ major** — so we're using **G♭ major** as the **bVI** — which only makes sense in **minor mode**.

So let’s go back to **A♭ major**? Let's try **A♭ major** as key.

A♭ major scale: **A♭ B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G**

Chords:
- I: A♭
- ii: B♭m
- iii: Cm
- IV: D♭
- V: E♭
- vi: Fm
- vii°: G°

B♭dim = B♭-D♭-F♭ — in A♭ major, F is natural — F♭ = E — **not in scale**.

But we have **Gb/Bb = G♭-B♭-D♭** — G♭ is not in A♭ major scale! Scale has G natural, not G♭.

A♭ major has G natural — so G♭ = ♭VII — chromatic.

So implying **A♭ Mixolydian**? No — Mixolydian would have G natural — but we want G♭.

This is not working.

---

### Breakthrough: B♭ diminished = B♭-D♭-F♭ = B♭-D♭-E

F♭ = E — so now we know: this scale contains **E natural**.

So the **leading tone** is E — which resolves to F.

So maybe the tonic is **F**?

Let’s test **F melodic minor (ascending)**

F melodic minor: F-G-A♭-B♭-C-D-E → this has **E natural**!

Chords:
- i: Fm
- ii: G° (G-B♭-D) — wait, 2nd: G-B♭-D = G° — yes
- III+: A♭-C-E — A♭ major (♯3, so augmented)
- IV: B♭-D-F — B♭ major
- V: C-E-G♯ — wait, 5th: C-E-G♯? But we have D in scale? In melodic minor, 6th and 7th are raised.

But we’re seeing B♭dim — which is B♭-D♭-E

In F melodic minor, we have: B♭, D♭, E — yes! All present!

B♭ is the 4th degree  
D♭ is the 3rd  
E is the 7th

So **B♭-D♭-E** = B♭dim = **chord built from the 4th degree** = **iv°**

In F melodic minor, the **iv chord is B♭ minor?** B♭-D♭-F — but we have B♭-D♭-E — that's **diminished**, not minor.

So B♭dim = **iv°** — which is **non-diatonic** (because iv is naturally minor, not dim).

But B♭-D♭-E can be heard as a **B♭ half-diminished** without the 7th? But E is not the 7th of B♭ — 7th would be A♭.

So perhaps it’s a **upper structure**?

Alternatively — perhaps **B♭dim is the ii° of A♭?**

Wait — in **E major**? Too many sharps.

Let’s look at entire scale implied by all chords:

We have:  
- B♭, D♭, F♭ (=E) — from Bbdim  
- G♭, B♭, D♭ — from Gb/Bb  
- D♭, F♭, A♭ — from Dbm/Ab → D♭-E-A♭  
- B, D♯, F♯ — from B/Bb  
- E, G♯, B, D♯ — from Emaj7/Ab

So the notes used:  
B♭, D♭, E, G♭, A♭, B, D♯, F♯, G♯, D♯

Let’s list all unique notes:

- B♭  
- C? Not present  
- D♭  
- D♯  
- E  
- F♯  
- G♭  
- G♯  
- A♭  
- B  
- F? No  
- C? No  
- E♭? No  

So: **A♭, B♭, C? No, D♭, D♯, E, F♯, G♭, G♯, B**

We’re missing C, E♭, F, A, etc.

This seems **atonal or highly chromatic**.

But **G♭ and F♯** are enharmonic — same note  
**D♯ and E♭** are enharmonic  
**B and C♭** — but C♭ not used

So pitches used:  
- **B♭**  
- **C**? — no  
- **D♭**  
- **D♯/E♭**  
- **E/F♭**  
- **F♯/G♭**  
- **G♯**  
- **A♭**  
- **B**

So: **B♭, D♭, E, D♯, F♯, G♯, A♭, B**

That’s **10 tones** — very chromatic.

But notice: **F♯ = G♭**, so F♯/G♭  
**D♯ = E♭**

So list: B♭, D♭, E, E♭, F♯, G♯, A♭, B

That’s:  
- B, B♭  
- E, E♭  
- F♯ (G♭)  
- G♯  
- A♭  
- D♭

This sounds like a **chromatic cluster** — no clear key.

---

### However… the only chord that repeats many times is **Bbdim**

And the bass is **B♭** most of the time.

And **Gb/Bb** (G♭ major over B♭) is the **bVI** chord — hallmark of **B♭ minor** in minor-key harmony.

In B♭ minor, the **bVI chord is G♭ major**, so we’re seeing it a lot.

And **Bbdim** — B♭ dim — is **non-diatonic** in minor, but could be **supertonic or altered i**.

Also — **Dbm/Ab** — D♭ minor with A♭ bass = A♭ minor chord — in B♭ minor, the **vii° chord is A♭ diminished** — not minor.

But **A♭ minor** = A♭-C-E♭ — but we have **D♭-F♭-A♭** = D♭-E-A♭ — so **E** is not in B♭ minor.

**Unless** we are in **B♭ harmonic minor**!

### Try: **B♭ harmonic minor**

Scale: **B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A** (7th raised)

Chords:
- i: B♭m (B♭-D♭-F)
- ii°: C° (C-E♭-G)
- III+: D♭ aug? D♭-F-A — but 3rd is F? And 5th is raised? Harmonic minor has raised 7th — **A natural**, so F is natural.

Wait — B♭ harmonic minor: **B♭ - C - D♭ - E♭ - F - G♭ - A**

So:

- i: B♭m = B♭-D♭-F  
- ii°: C° = C-E♭-G — but G is not in scale — scale has G♭. Wait — C-E♭-G: G is #5? Not in scale.

We need chords built on scale degrees:

Triads:
- i: B♭-D♭-F → minor  
- ii°: C-E♭-G — but G is **not in scale**, scale has G♭ — so should be C-E♭-G♭? Then it’s C-E♭-G♭ = C diminished → **C°**

Yes! So:
- ii°: C° (C, E♭, G♭)
- III: D♭-F-A — **D♭ major** — because A is natural (raised 7th!)
- iv: E♭-G♭-B♭ → E♭ minor  
- v: F-A-C → F major — because A is natural (this is the key of harmonic minor: minor v becomes major V)
- VI: G♭-B♭-D — G♭ major? But D is not in scale — scale has D♭, not D.  
Scale: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A — no D!

So VI would be G♭-B♭-D♭ → which is **G♭ minor** — but we're seeing **Gb/Bb = G♭ major** — so not matching.

Wait — G♭ major would require **B major?** No — G♭-B♭-D♭ = G♭ minor?

G♭-B♭-D♭: G♭ to B♭ = major third → so G♭ major? No — G♭ to B♭ is major third, yes → so **G♭ major** = G♭-B♭-D♭

But in B♭ harmonic minor, is D♭ present? Yes — D♭ is ♭3.

G♭-B♭-D♭ = G♭ major? But the 5th is D♭ — which is ♭5 of G♭? G♭ to D♭ is a perfect 5th — yes.

So yes — G♭ major = G♭-B♭-D♭ — and D♭ is in scale — YES!

So in **B♭ harmonic minor**:  
- VI chord = G♭ major = G♭-B♭-D♭ — ✅ Perfect, matches **Gb/Bb**  
- vii° = A° = A-C-E — which is **A diminished** — but we’re seeing **Bbdim** = B♭-D♭-E — E is not in scale — scale has A natural.

B♭dim = B♭-D♭-E — E is **not** in scale — so again, **outside**.

But **E** is **the 7th of the F major chord**?

Wait — we have **Emaj7/Ab** = E-G♯-B-D♯ over A♭ — so E and G♯ are present.

In B♭ harmonic minor — do we have E? No — we have E♭.

We have A natural.

So E and G♯ are **alien** — not in B♭ harmonic minor.

This implies **B♭ minor** with **accidentals** — or **B♭ Dorian with #7**? Too many.

---

### Final Insight: **Key is B♭ minor**, **mode is harmonic minor** — and we're using **chromatic alterations**.

- Bbdim: B♭-D♭-E — **E is raised 7th**, not in natural minor — so we’re using **harmonic minor** (A natural), but E natural is **chromatic passing note** — perhaps as leading tone to F.

- Gb/Bb = bVI of B♭ minor — **standard**

- Dbm/Ab = D♭m over A♭ — D♭-E-A♭ — again, E natural — suggesting imminent resolution to F or B♭?

- B/Bb = B major over B♭ — **chromatic movement** — B is leading tone of C — so perhaps resolving to C? Not clear.

- Emaj7/Ab = E major 7 over A♭ — tritone sub for dominant — **E major 7 = tritone substitution of B7** — B7 is V of E — not here.

But A♭7 would be the sub for D7 — D7 is V of G — no clear dom.

This is jazz harmony — **the key is B♭ minor**, **mode is natural minor** with **chromatic passing chords**, **tritone substitutions**, and **modal mixture**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**:

> **Key: B♭ minor**  
> **Mode: Natural Minor (Aeolian)** with heavy **chromaticism**, **modal mixture**, and jazz-inspired **chromatic chords** (especially the **bVI = G♭ major** and **tritone substitution Emaj7/A♭**).

The progression is **not in a pure diatonic mode** — it’s a **minor-key jazz/pop progression** using:

- **B♭minor** as tonic  
- **G♭ major** as **bVI** (very characteristic of minor keys)  
- **B♭dim** as an altered version of i or iv  
- **Dbm/Ab = A♭ minor** = v°? Not diatonic — here as chromatic pedal/moving bass  
- **B/Bb** = #9 color against B♭  
- **Emaj7/Ab** = tritone substitution for dominant, suggesting a D7 or A7 tonal pull — but not resolving

Thus, the **tonal center is B♭**, and the **mode is primarily B♭ Aeolian (natural minor)** with **chromatic alterations** — so we can call it:

> 🎵 **Key: B♭ minor (Aeolian)**  
> 🎵 **Mode: Aeolian with chromatic alterations and modal mixture**

It’s a **jazz-influenced minor key progression**, likely in a **B♭ minor** context, where chords are chosen for color and voice-leading rather than strict diatonic function.

You can think of it as **"B♭ minor with extended chromaticism"** — not a pure classical mode, but still centered in B♭ minor.
