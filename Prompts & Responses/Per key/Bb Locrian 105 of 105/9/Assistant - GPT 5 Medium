### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord structures**

I'm breaking down the Db minor triad (Db Fb Ab) over an Ab bass. This should be classified as iv6 in Ab minor since Db minor is indeed the iv chord there. With Ab in the bass, it turns into a second inversion (iv6/4). 

Then I look at the B major triad (B D# F#), which isn't diatonic. However, if I respell it as Cb major (Cb Eb Gb) over Bb, it could be a bVII. I’m wondering about the scale degrees in Ab minor.**Clarifying chord roles**

I'm determining that the VI chord in Ab minor is Fb major (Fb Ab Cb), not Cb. Cb would actually be bII, and it looks like Cb is bIII, but bIII should be Cb major. So in Ab natural minor, Cb major acts as the III chord since it's the relative major. 

When I consider B major as Cb major enharmonically, I find that B/Bb equals Cb/Bb. I’m questioning if this could be seen as a 11-type chord over a Bb bass.**Analyzing chord structure over bass**

I'm examining the Cb major triad over a Bb bass, which consists of Cb (B), Eb (D#), and Gb (F#). So the pitch set would have Bb, Cb, Eb, and Gb.

When I respell it to fit Ab minor, the scale degrees reflect 2, 3, 5, and b7. In Ab minor, the chord tones are Bb (2), Cb (b3), Eb (5), and Gb (b7), resembling a Bb half-diminished seventh, although that would actually be Bb Db Fb Ab. Interestingly, this set could form a dominant 7 chord on Gb or indicate a Gb major tonal center.**Constructing triads**

I’m building triads in Gb major: I is Gb, ii is Abm, iii is Bbm, IV is Cb, V is Db, vi is Ebm, and vii° is Fdim (F A Cb). I find that Bbdim (Bb Db Fb) isn't diatonic because Bb minor (Bbm) fits but would need Fb, which doesn't exist in Gb major. However, Bbdim works in Ab minor. 

Then, I've got Emaj7 over Ab bass, which converts to Fbmaj7 over Ab. In Ab natural minor, Fb is the b6, making Fbmaj7/Ab the VImaj7 chord.**Establishing key and chords**

I’m analyzing the VI chord in natural minor, which is Fb major. With Ab in the bass, it forms a major seventh chord and is likely VImaj7 in first inversion. This ties in well with Emaj7 over Ab, also fitting as VImaj7 in Ab minor. The only unusual chord is B/Bb, interpreted as Cb/Bb, possibly a passing chord. 

When I rearrange the progression for Ab minor, everything aligns, reinforcing that the harmonic center is Ab minor in Aeolian mode, with Bbdim functioning as the ii° chord. The key is clearly Ab minor, and the relative major is Cb major.**Analyzing key and mode**

I’m considering enharmonics: Ab minor and G# minor are equivalent, but the chords, like Gb and Dbm, suggest Ab minor due to their flat spelling. In this context, I'm noting that it’s likely Aeolian since there’s no leading tone present. The Bbdim and Gb/Bb chords seem to function as passing neighbors with similarities in notes but differing in just a semitone. 

After mapping the roman numerals, it's clear: Bbdim is ii°, Gb/Bb is VII6, and Dbm/Ab is iv6/4. I should also consider Bb Locrian, as Bbdim serves as tonic. Both modes share the same note collection, but the tonal center depends on which root note is more emphasized, Bb or Ab. The progression's focus on Bb suggests that Bb Locrian might be the better fit in this case.**Determining key and mode**

I notice the bass is usually Bb, suggesting Bb is the tonal center rather than Ab. The recurring Bbdim chord seems to indicate a Locrian mode since a tonic diminished chord typically points to that. This progression aligns with the Cb major scale, as the presence of flats suggests its parent scale. The challenge is that without clear melodic cues, choosing between Bb Locrian and Ab minor is tricky. However, given the importance of the Bbdim chord and the overall structure, I lean toward recognizing the progression in Bb Locrian.**Analyzing tonal center and mode**

I’m considering that the progression might be centered in Cb major, especially since I'm seeing that the V chord (Gb) is repeated. The bass often sits on Bb, which is the leading tone, but I realize I have to clarify the chord's inversion. Gb/Bb is indeed represented as V6 in this context. Reflecting on these elements leads me to conclude that the key is Cb major and the mode is Ionian. The chords confirm that understanding reveals consistency in the theory behind them, supporting my analysis.**Clarifying key and mode**

Many guitarists often favor keys like Gb major or F# major, but I realize that Db minor isn't diatonic to Gb major. So, it's definitely not Gb major. This leads me to conclude it's Cb major (Ionian). I can also mention Ab Aeolian as the relative minor, since the Bb bass emphasizes a dominant pedal feel. To summarize concisely: the diatonic collection is Cb major/Ab natural minor, with Cb major as the functional center.

Cb major (Ionian). 

All chords are diatonic to Cb major:
- Bbdim = vii°
- Gb/Bb = V6
- Dbm/Ab = ii6/4
- (B/Bb) enharmonically Cb/Bb = I over 7
- Emaj7/Ab enharmonically Fbmaj7/Ab = IVmaj7 in first inversion

Equivalent relative minor: Ab natural minor (Aeolian). The repeated Bbdim ↔ Gb/Bb motion is a classic vii° → V6 dominant area, reinforcing Cb major as the center.
