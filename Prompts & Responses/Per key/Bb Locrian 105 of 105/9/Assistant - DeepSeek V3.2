Let’s break this down step by step.

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

- **Bbdim** = Bb Db E G (fully diminished 7th chord)  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb Bb Db (Gb major triad, first inversion)  
- **Dbm/Ab** = Ab Db E (Dbm triad, first inversion: Db E Ab — but E is not in Dbm; Dbm = Db E Ab is actually Db minor? Wait, Db minor = Db Fb Ab, so E natural is not in Db minor. Let’s check: Db E Ab — E natural is enharmonic to Fb? No, E natural is a major third above Db? That’s actually a **Db major** chord: Db F Ab. So Dbm/Ab is wrong label? Let’s check: Dbm = Db Fb Ab. Inversion on Ab = Ab Db Fb. But they wrote Dbm/Ab = Ab Db E. E natural = Fb? No, E natural is not Fb. So this is not Dbm, it’s **Db major** in first inversion: Db F Ab over Ab = Ab Db F. But they wrote Dbm/Ab — maybe a typo in the question? Or maybe they mean Dbm = Db Fb Ab, but they wrote E instead of Fb? Possibly they used E natural meaning Fb enharmonically, but unlikely. Let’s check the next chord: B/Bb = B D# F# over Bb — that’s a polychord. B major over Bb bass.

Actually, let’s treat the given notes literally:  
Dbm/Ab = notes: Ab + Db + E? That’s Ab Db E — E is the major 3rd of Db? That’s Db major: Db F Ab. So F natural, not E. So maybe they wrote E meaning F? Possibly a typo in the problem? Or maybe they meant **Dbm** as in Db minor = Db Fb Ab, but Fb = E natural enharmonically? Yes! That’s it: in equal temperament, E = Fb. So Dbm = Db Fb Ab, and Fb is E on piano. So Dbm/Ab = Ab Db E (Fb). Yes, that works.

So Dbm/Ab = Ab Db Fb (E).

- **B/Bb** = B major triad (B D# F#) over Bb bass. So notes: Bb B D# F#. That’s a B major with a Bb in the bass — a bit dissonant.

- **Emaj7/Ab** = Emaj7 = E G# B D#, with Ab in the bass. Ab = G#, so actually the bass is the same as the maj7 of the chord? Wait, Emaj7/Ab means bass note Ab, chord Emaj7. But Ab = G#, so the bass is the major 7th of the E chord. So it’s an **inversion** where the bass is the maj7 note.

---

## **2. Look for a key**

Bbdim is a symmetrical chord, but it can be one of four possible diminished chords:  
Bbdim7 = Bb Db E G.  
That’s also C#dim7, Edim7, Gdim7.

In a key, the diminished chord is usually vii°7 in minor or vii°7 in major (or common-tone diminished).

Gb major = Gb Bb Db. That’s bVI in Bb minor? Or IV in Db major? Let’s check:

If key = Db major:  
- Gb = IV  
- Bbdim = ? In Db major, vii° = Cdim7 (C Eb Gb A) — not Bbdim.  
So Bbdim doesn’t fit Db major diatonically.

If key = Gb major:  
- Gb = I  
- Bbdim = not diatonic.

Bbdim often works as a passing chord between chords a semitone apart.

---

## **3. Check the last unusual chord: Emaj7/Ab**

Emaj7 = E G# B D#.  
Ab bass = G# bass, so actually the bass is the same as the chord’s maj7. So it’s an **Emaj7** in first inversion? No, first inversion of Emaj7 is G# B D# E. That’s exactly Emaj7/Ab if Ab=G#. So yes, it’s just Emaj7 with the 3rd in bass.

So the progression goes: Bbdim … Gb … Dbm … B/Bb … Gb … Emaj7 … Bbdim.

---

## **4. Try to find tonal center**

Let’s map possible functions:  
Bbdim could be common-tone diminished of Bb minor.  
Gb major in Bb minor is bVI — common in minor key.  
Dbm = iv in Ab minor? But we’re in Bb minor? Dbm is ii in B major? No.

Let’s test Bb minor:  
- Bb minor: Gb = bVI, Dbm = iv (borrowed from Bb phrygian?), B/Bb = foreign chord (maybe V/V?), Emaj7 = unrelated.

But Emaj7/Ab = G# bass E maj7. In Bb minor, E major is V of vi (Gm)? Not really.

---

## **5. Another approach: Gb major as tonic**

If Gb major is key:  
Bbdim = not diatonic.  
Dbm = ii (Dbm is ii in Gb major? No, Dbm is not in Gb major; Db major is V).  
So not Gb major.

---

## **6. Check chromatic mediant relations**

Emaj7 to Bbdim: E to Bb = tritone.  
Bbdim to Gb: Bb to Gb major = minor 6th apart.  
Bbdim often functions as G#dim7 (leading tone diminished of A minor) or Edim7 (leading tone of F minor), etc.

If Bbdim = G#dim7, then it’s vii°7 of A minor. But we don’t see A minor chords.

If Bbdim = Edim7, then it’s vii°7 of F minor. F minor: Gb = Neapolitan? Gb in F minor is bII (N). Yes! That fits:  
Key F minor:  
- Gb = bII (Neapolitan)  
- Bbdim = not diatonic but could be chromatic passing.  
- Dbm = bIV (common in some rock/minor tunes)  
- B/Bb = B major over Bb = no function.  
- Emaj7 = V of vi (A minor) — borrowed.

But not convincing.

---

## **7. Try Bb minor key**

In Bb minor:  
- Gb = bVI  
- Dbm = iv (borrowed from Bb phrygian) — common in metal/rock  
- B/Bb = B major = V of Emaj7? Possibly a chromatic transition: B → Emaj7.  
- Emaj7 = unrelated to Bb minor but could be a borrowed V of something (maybe V/vi of Gm? But Gm not present).  
- Bbdim = common-tone diminished of Bb minor tonic.

This progression seems to be **Bb minor** with modal mixture and chromatic chords, possibly:  
Bbdim (ct°) — Gb (bVI) — Dbm (iv) — B (V/V of E) — Emaj7 (borrowed from E major) — back to Bbdim (ct°).

But Emaj7 doesn’t resolve to Bb minor; it’s a non-functional color chord.

---

## **8. Final determination**

Given the strong presence of Gb major (bVI) and Dbm (iv) in the context of Bb minor, and Bbdim as a common-tone diminished of Bbm, the key is most likely **Bb minor**.

Mode: natural minor / Aeolian, with borrowed chords from Phrygian (Dbm = iv) and other unrelated chromatic chords (Emaj7).
