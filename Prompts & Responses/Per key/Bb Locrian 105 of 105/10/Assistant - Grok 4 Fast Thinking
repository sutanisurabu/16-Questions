**Key: Bb minor**  
**Mode: Minor (Aeolian)**  

### Analysis Summary
- **Tonal center**: The progression is built around a strong pedal point on Bb (the bass note for most chords), establishing Bb as the root/tonic. The structure revolves around tension and release over this pedal, typical of minor-key harmony with chromatic elements.
- **Mode confirmation**: The use of Bbdim (i° in Bb minor, creating a half-diminished or fully diminished sound on the tonic) and Dbm (iii° in Bb minor) points to a minor mode. The overall dark, tense quality, with diminished and minor chords dominating, aligns with Aeolian (natural minor). Chromatic touches (e.g., the E natural in Bbdim7 and Dbm, or the major qualities in B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab) suggest harmonic minor influences for leading tones but don't shift the fundamental mode.
- **Supporting details**:
  - Bb minor scale: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab.
  - Fits well: Gb/Bb functions as VI (Gb major triad over tonic bass, common in minor keys for color); Ab bass points (Dbm/Ab, Emaj7/Ab) act as temporary IV-area shifts or subdominant color, resolving back to Bb.
  - Chromaticism: Chords like B/Bb (augmented tension) and Emaj7/Ab (V7-like leading to potential resolution) add jazz/classical flavor but reinforce the Bb minor orbit without resolving elsewhere.
  - Structure: Repetitive AABA-like form (two similar 8-chord sections) supports a stable minor-key loop, possibly from a jazz standard, ballad, or etude.

If this is from a specific song/piece or you have more context (e.g., melody notes or full chart), I can refine this!
