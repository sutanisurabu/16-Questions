Alright, let's tackle this chord progression to determine the key and mode. Here's the given sequence:

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

### Step 1: Understand the Chords
First, let's list out the chords and their constituent notes to see if there are any patterns or shared tones.

1. **Bbdim**: Bb, Db, Fb (E)
2. **Gb/Bb**: Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. Notes: Gb, Bb, Db
3. **Dbm/Ab**: Dbm chord with Ab in the bass. Notes: Db, Fb (E), Ab
4. **B/Bb**: B major chord with Bb in the bass. This is unusual because B and Bb are a minor second apart, suggesting a clash. The notes would be B, D#, F# with Bb as the bass. This might imply a polychord or a mislabeling, but we'll proceed as is.
5. **Emaj7/Ab**: Emaj7 with Ab in the bass. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#; with Ab (same as G# enharmonically) in the bass, it's essentially Emaj7 in first inversion, but Ab is the same as G#, so this could just be Emaj7/G#.

However, the notation "Emaj7/Ab" is a bit confusing because Ab is enharmonic to G#, which is already in the Emaj7 chord. So, it's likely Emaj7 in first inversion (G# in the bass), but written as Ab for some reason (possibly to imply a descending bass line).

### Step 2: Identify the Root Movement
Let's look at the bass notes since the chords have specified bass notes:

Bass notes: Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb

Mostly Bb with a couple of Ab's. This suggests Bb is a central tone.

### Step 3: Analyze the Chords in Relation to Bb
Let's see how these chords relate to Bb:

- **Bbdim**: Bb, Db, E (Fb). This is a diminished triad built on Bb.
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb major with Bb bass. Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. Over Bb, it's the same notes, so it's like a Gb chord in first inversion.
- **Dbm/Ab**: Dbm is Db, E, Ab. Over Ab, it's Dbm in second inversion.
- **B/Bb**: B major is B, D#, F#. Over Bb, this is highly chromatic and dissonant.
- **Emaj7/Ab**: Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. Over Ab (G#), it's first inversion.

### Step 4: Look for Key Centers
Given the heavy use of Bbdim and chords over Bb, let's consider Bb as a potential tonic. However, Bbdim is not a diatonic chord in major or minor keys based on Bb because:

- Bb major: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A
  - Bbdim would require Fb (E) which is not in Bb major.
  
- Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab
  - Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb (E). E is not in Bb natural minor (it's Eb).

This suggests we're not in a straightforward Bb major or minor.

### Step 5: Consider Diminished and Chromatic Movement
The prevalence of Bbdim and the movement to Gb/Bb (which shares two notes with Bbdim: Bb and Db) suggests a chromatic or passing diminished function.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab shares Ab and Db with the key's surroundings.

### Step 6: Check for Modal or Altered Scales
Given the chromatic nature, let's see if any mode or altered scale fits:

- **Locrian mode**: Built on the 7th degree of a major scale. For Bb Locrian, the parent major would be Bb as the 7th, so Cb major (enharmonic B major), but this seems convoluted.
  
- **Diminished scale**: The octatonic diminished scale alternates whole and half steps. Bb diminished scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, F#, G, A. This includes Bb, Db, E (from Bbdim), and Gb (from Gb/Bb), but not all chords fit neatly.

### Step 7: Re-examine Chord Functions
Let's think functionally:

- Bbdim often acts as a passing or leading chord. It can be seen as:
  - vii° of Cb (but Cb is B, so vii° of B is A#, not Bb).
  - Or as a substitution for a dominant, like a rootless G7b9 (G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab, which without G is B, D, F, Ab - close to Bbdim: Bb, Db, E).

Given that, Bbdim could imply a secondary dominant or a passing chord leading somewhere.

### Step 8: Look at the Final Chord
The progression ends on Bbdim after Emaj7/Ab. Emaj7 is distant from Bb, but E is the tritone of Bb, suggesting a possible resolution or chromatic movement.

### Step 9: Consider Bb as a Tonic with Inflections
Despite the chromaticism, the bass centering on Bb and the recurring Bbdim suggest Bb is the tonal center, but the mode is altered.

Given the notes present:

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E
From Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db
From Dbm/Ab: Db, E, Ab
From B/Bb: B, D#, F#, Bb
From Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D#, Ab

Collecting all unique tones: Bb, B, C, Db, D#, E, F#, Gb, G#, Ab, A (implied)

This is highly chromatic, but the core seems to revolve around Bb with diminished and major inflections.

### Step 10: Determine the Closest Mode
Given the lack of a standard diatonic fit, the most plausible interpretation is:

**Key: Bb**
**Mode: Diminished tonic or chromatic with Bb as the center**

However, since modes are typically diatonic or based on recognizable scales, and this is highly chromatic, we might say it's:

**Bb with diminished and chromatic alterations**, implying no standard mode but a chromatic passage centered on Bb.

But if we must assign a mode, considering the diminished chord's nature, it's akin to:

**Bb Locrian** (though Locrian has a minor triad on the tonic, not diminished), but this is stretching.

Upon closer inspection, Bb Locrian would have:

Bb, Cb, Db, Ebb (D), Fb (E), Gb, Ab, Bb

But Bbdim is Bb, Db, Fb (E), which matches Locrian's 1, b3, b5, making the tonic chord diminished, which is characteristic of Locrian.

Thus, despite the other chords, the foundational use of Bbdim and the bass centering on Bb suggest:

**Key: Bb**
**Mode: Locrian**

The other chords are chromatic elaborations or passing chords within this framework.

### Final Answer:
**Key: Bb**
**Mode: Locrian**
