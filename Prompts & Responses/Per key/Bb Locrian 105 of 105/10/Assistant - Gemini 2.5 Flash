The chord progression you provided is:
$$Bbdim \text{ } Bbdim \text{ } Gb/Bb \text{ } Gb/Bb \text{ } Bbdim \text{ } Bbdim \text{ } Dbm/Ab \text{ } B/Bb \text{ } Bbdim \text{ } Bbdim \text{ } Gb/Bb \text{ } Gb/Bb \text{ } Bbdim \text{ } Bbdim \text{ } Emaj7/Ab \text{ } Bbdim$$

This chord progression is highly chromatic and heavily features the **B-flat diminished (Bbdim)** chord.

Let's analyze the chords and their relations to potential keys:

* **Bbdim:** (Bb, Db, E, G) - This chord is common in minor keys (used as $\text{vii}^\circ$) and can also function as a passing or altered chord in major keys (often borrowed).
* **Gb/Bb:** (Bb, Db, Gb) - This is an inversion of Gb major. In the context of a key centered around Bb, this chord is quite flat.
* **Dbm/Ab:** (Ab, Db, Fb) - This is an inversion of Db minor. This chord is very rare in common diatonic harmony. The presence of Fb (E natural) is crucial.
* **B/Bb:** (Bb, D#, F#) - This is an inversion of B major. This chord is also quite distant from Bb-centric harmony, featuring notes (D#, F#) that are not in the natural minor or major scale of Bb.
* **Emaj7/Ab:** (Ab, E, G#, B) - This is an inversion of E Major 7. This chord is also quite exotic in this context.

### Analysis of Diminished Chords in Key Determination

The persistent use of $\text{Bbdim}$ suggests either:

1. **A key where Bbdim is the $\text{vii}^\circ$ chord:**
   Bbdim = (Bb, Db, Fb, G) [Using Fb for the diminished 7th for clarity]
   If this is $\text{vii}^\circ$, the root of the tonic must be a half step up: **B minor** or **B major**.
   The notes of Bbdim (Bb-Db-Fb-G) correspond to $\text{vii}^\circ$ in **C-flat Major / A-flat minor** (where $\text{vii}^\circ$ is $\text{Bbdim}^7$) or **B minor** (where $\text{vii}^\circ$ is $\text{A#dim}^7$, enharmonically $\text{Bbdim}^7$). Given the frequent use of Gb and Db, B minor or a related mode seems more plausible than Cb Major.

2. **A key centered on Bb, where the diminished chord is borrowed or used chromatically:**
   If the tonic is **Bb minor**: The functional diminished chord is $\text{Adim}$ or $\text{A dim}^7$. Using $\text{Bbdim}$ here would be a chromatic passing chord (e.g., V to I with chromatic movement).

3. **A key centered on Eb, where Bbdim functions as a related chord:**
   In $\text{Eb}$ minor, $\text{vii}^\circ$ is $\text{D dim}^7$.

### Rethinking the Context: Non-Diatonic Harmony

The combination of Bbdim, Gb, Db minor, and Emaj7 strongly suggests that this music does **not** adhere strictly to diatonic harmony.

Let's look at the notes used in the primary chords:
* Bbdim: Bb, Db, E (or Fb), G
* Gb: Gb, Bb, Db
* Dbm: Db, Fb (E), Ab
* Emaj7: E, G#, B, D#

The key elements are:
* The tritone relationship implied by the Bbdim chord (Bb to E, or Db to G, etc.).
* The strong presence of flat notes (Db, Gb) and natural/sharp notes (E, G#, D#).

This harmony is much more symptomatic of a **chromatic, post-Romantic style** (like Scriabin or Wagner) or highly specific jazz-related harmony, often utilizing **octatonicism** or **diminished chord cycles**.

#### Octatonic Scale Possibility

The **symmetric diminished scale** (octatonic scale) perfectly fits the $\text{Bbdim}$ chord.
There are two common forms of this scale:

1. **Half-Whole (Bb - Cb - Db - D - E - F - G - Ab)**
2. **Whole-Half (Bb - C - Db - Eb - E - F# - G - A)**

Let's see which external chords fit:
* **Gb major (Gb, Bb, Db):** Fits in **Scale 2**.
* **Dbm (Db, E, Ab):** Fits in **Scale 1** (Db, E, Ab) or **Scale 2** (Db, E).
* **Emaj7 (E, G#, B, D#):** Only E fits well. G#, B, and D# are highly dissonant with the overall diminished framework implied by the common scale use.

The presence of $\text{Emaj7}$ and $\text{B}$ major significantly complicates fitting this into a symmetrical scale.

### Conclusion on Key and Mode

Given the extremely high frequency of the **Bb diminished chord** and the lack of a clear functional dominant or tonic resolution (the progression tends to return to Bbdim), the harmony is likely centered on the sound world of Bbdim.

**Probable Key/Center:** **Bb Diminished or Highly Chromatic**

**Probable Mode/Scale:** **Highly Chromatic, potentially based on a non-traditional scale or a shifting tonal center that continually exploits the Bb-Db-E-G core.**

However, if we must select the most plausible **tonal center** that might briefly host these chords, we look for the chord that is most common (Bbdim) or the root most emphasized.

Since the progression always returns to **Bbdim**:

* **Tonal Center:** **Bb (but not functioning as a tonic in a diatonic sense).**

* **Mode:** **Highly Chromatic/Atonal, employing the Diminished Sonority and chromatic shifts.**

Often, in such a case, performers will perceive the piece as being in the "Key of the Diminished Chord," meaning its tonal universe exists within the symmetry of the diminished and related chords. If this progression comes from a piece of music, the intended key or mode would be derived from the surrounding context, not just this isolated set of chords.

**The most technically accurate answer, based *only* on this progression, is that the harmony is non-functional and is centered on the sound of the B-flat diminished chord.**

***

**If forced to name a diatonic/modal key this *borrows* from (and often deviates instantly):** The frequent use of $\text{Gb}$ and $\text{Db}$ and the $\text{Bbdim}$ ($vii^\circ$ of B minor) suggests a fleeting connection to the key of **B minor** or possibly a highly flattened mode like **Bb Phrygian**, though neither wholly accounts for the full progression. **The best answer is centered on the diminished chord itself.**
