**Exploring D♭ minor chords**

I’m looking into the notes of D♭ minor: Db, Fb, and Ab. Interestingly, there’s a B major triad played over Bb, which feels like an altered chord. Then there's Emaj7 over Ab, mixing flats and sharps with B natural and E major. I’m curious if the overall key is Gb major, since it has a specific set of notes and triads. Bbdim doesn't fit in Gb major, as the leading-tone diminished is actually Fdim.**Analyzing Gb major scale**

In the Gb major scale, I see notes like Bb, Db, and Fb (which is actually E natural). It's tricky because while Fb reads as E natural, it doesn't fit in Gb major since the key signature has 6 flats: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, and F. I realize that Fb acts as a flattened version of F, functioning as a chromatic lower neighbor, but Bbdim isn't diatonic to Gb major because of that Fb. Meanwhile, Gb/Bb is indeed diatonic.**Exploring Dbm and Emaj7 chords**

Looking at Dbm/Ab, I see the D♭ minor triad uses Fb, which goes outside the diatonic realm. In this case, a Db major chord in Gb major would typically have Db, F, and Ab, but here, it's Db minor with Fb instead of F. Then, Emaj7/Ab introduces G# and D#, which are enharmonically A♭ and E♭. It gets even crazier when I think of Emaj7 as enharmonic to F♭maj7/A♭! So ultimately, Emaj7/Ab is like F♭maj7 over A♭, which is an interesting borrowed chord. B/Bb works similarly with C♭ major over B♭ enharmonically.**Examining C♭ major in Gb**

C♭ major serves as the IV chord in Gb major. When I look at B♭, it’s the 3rd degree in Gb major, making C♭/B♭ a IV/iii bass chord, which seems logical. However, I notice the triad actually consists of B major (B, D#, F#), and it can be viewed enharmonically as C♭ major (C♭, E♭, G♭). So, B/B♭ equals C♭/B♭, which is diatonic in Gb major. Here, C♭ major is played over B♭ bass, and it’s a polychord. Similarly, Emaj7/Ab corresponds to Fbmaj7/Ab, indicating a tonal center of Gb.**Determining key and mode**

I’m analyzing chords like Gb/Bb (I6) and Bbdim, and I'm wondering about Bbdim's function—could it be vii° in B major? Notably, Bbdim is enharmonically A#dim, making it diatonic to B major. I’m also considering Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab; if Dbm is C#m, then it's a ii chord in first inversion. Overall, I realize these chords fit into a B major framework, using a mix of flats and sharps, leading me to conclude the key is B major in the Ionian mode.**Determining key and mode**

The repeated Gb/Bb functions as V6 in B major, not I6 as in Gb major. The Bbdim chord fits best as vii° in B major. I see Emaj7/Ab as corresponding to Fbmaj7 in Gb, acting as flat-VII. Finally, Dbm is a borrowed minor chord. Thus, I conclude the key is B major, in the Ionian mode. I can present a mapping showing the diatonic functions: Key: B major, Mode: Ionian (major). All chords respell consistently within this framework.

B major (Ionian)

Reason: Enharmonically respelled, the chords are diatonic to B major:
- Bbdim = A#dim (vii°)
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# (V6)
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# (ii6/4)
- B/Bb = B/A# (I over 7)
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# (IVmaj7/3)
