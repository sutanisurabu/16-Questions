Let’s analyze the chord progression you provided:

**Progression:**
> Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

### Step 1: Identify what chords are present
- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–E (or Fb); functions as a vii° of C or as a ii° of Ab minor, depending on context.  
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major in 2nd inversion (notes Bb–Db–Gb).  
- **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor in 1st inversion (Ab–Db–Fb).  
- **B/Bb** = B major triad over Bb in the bass (Bb–B–D#–F#): quite dissonant — could imply a chromatic approach or borrowed sonority.
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major seventh over Ab (Ab–E–G#–B–D#).

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal centers
The consistent presence of **Gb-based chords (Gb/Bb)** and **Bbdim** suggests we might be somewhere around **Gb major** or **Db major** as a tonal area.

- In **Gb major**, the notes are Gb–Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F.
  - **Bbdim** fits as vii° of Cb major (or leading-tone chord to Cb, the IV of Gb).  
  - **Gb/Bb** is clearly tonic in inversion.

The move to **Dbm/Ab** introduces a minor iv in Gb — a common *modal mixture / borrowed* chord from Gb minor.

The **Emaj7/Ab** can be heard as a chromatic mediant (E major is a ♭VI in relation to Gb), again echoing modal interchange.

---

### Step 3: Functional summary
If we simplify functionally:
- **Bbdim** → leading-tone or approach function.
- **Gb/Bb** → tonic.
- **Dbm/Ab** → iv of Gb minor (borrowed).
- **B/Bb** → chromatic passing/altered chord.
- **Emaj7/Ab** → ♭VImaj7 in Gb major context.

---

### ✅ **Key and Mode**
- **Key:** **Gb major**
- **Mode:** **Ionian (major)**, but with **borrowed chords** from the **parallel minor** (notably Dbm/Ab and possibly Emaj7/Ab).

---

**Summary:**
> The progression centers around **Gb major** as the tonal home, with a lot of chromatic and borrowed minor colorations.  
> **Key: Gb major (Ionian)**  
> **Modal mixture: touches of Gb minor**
