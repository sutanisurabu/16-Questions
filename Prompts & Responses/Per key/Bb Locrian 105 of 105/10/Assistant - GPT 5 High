### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequence**

I'm working on figuring out the key and mode from the chord sequence: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim". 

First, I see Bbdim as a diminished triad, possibly a Bb diminished (Bb, Db, Fb) or a Bb diminished seventh if it were written as Bbdim7. Then, there's the Gb/Bb chord, indicating a Gb major triad with Bb in the bass, suggesting a first inversion. I need to keep examining these relationships to conclude the key and mode properly.**Understanding chord relationships**

The Gb/Bb chord is indicating a Gb major in first inversion. It's interesting because while a Bbm triad has Bb, Db, and F, the notes for Gb/Bb are Gb, Bb, and Db, confirming it's a Gb major chord. However, Gb/Bb also suggests a passing chord to I6 in the key of Db major. In this key, the VI chord is Bb minor and IV is Gb, making Gb/Bb IV6. 

Looking at the Dbm/Ab chord, Db minor isn't diatonic to Gb major since its notes don't match the scale. This makes me think about the enharmonic relationship of Db minor to C# minor and how that fits in.**Breaking down the chord structure**

I've got a chord here with Ab in the bass and a Db minor triad on top, which gives us the notes Db, Fb, and Ab. The enharmonic equivalent of this is C#, E, and G# over Ab, which creates a suspended sound—maybe an Ab7sus4(9).

Now, regarding the intervals, I realize that Fb is enharmonically E natural. In the context of the Ab scale, E would suggest a major third relationship and could represent a b13. 

I need to clarify the intervals better: Ab to E is a minor sixth, or potentially viewed as augmented. The distinctions are getting intricate!**Analyzing chord relationships**

I've concluded that the Ab chord with an E natural gives us a #5/b13, leading to an Ab7(b13, sus4). This isn't a typical sound. Then, I see B/Bb appearing, which indicates a B major triad over a Bb bass—so Bb, B, D#, and F#. This semitone clash is striking!

Using B in a flat-key context feels odd; maybe it should be Cb/Bb instead. If we consider Gb major, the leading-tone chord should be A, but that doesn't fit.

The sequence also includes Emaj7/Ab, meaning E major 7 over an Ab bass, which again brings up semitone clashes. It seems like we're looking at a chromatic approach with upper structure triads over a pedal bass!**Exploring chord functions and key**

I’m noticing that many chords share bass notes—like Gb/Bb, B/Bb, Emaj7/Ab, and Dbm/Ab—suggesting a pedal tone alternating between Ab and Bb. The Bbdim chord seems to serve as a leading tone, possibly indicating the key could be Ab minor or Bb minor. 

If we consider Ab minor, the Bbdim becomes diatonic as a half-diminished triad. But examining the potential of Gb major or Bb minor reveals inconsistencies with chord tones.

Switching to E major seems promising, as the presence of Emaj7/Ab fits nicely within that key. Chords like Gb and B/Bb play interesting roles as we explore their enharmonic counterparts, implying many of these chords are in service to that E major framework!**Analyzing key and mode**

I see that Bbdim works as an enharmonic spelling of A#dim, which serves as a leading tone to B major in E major. Continuing, I find Gb/Bb indicates V/V in first inversion and Dbm/Ab acts as C#m/G#, functioning as vi in second inversion. The progressions suggest a strong footing in E major, specifically using secondary leading-tone chords.

The presence of A# and the role of F# major indicate a potential alignment with E Lydian, as A# slips nicely into this structure. The chords support this idea well, fitting consistently within the Lydian framework. So, I’m leaning towards declaring E Lydian as the mode!**Determining key and mode**

I’ve confirmed that all the chords fit nicely within E Lydian, so the key center is E with the mode being Lydian. Although many notations use flats, they enhance the sharp keys related to E. I can clarify: Bbdim acts as A#dim (iv°), Gb/Bb functions as F#/A# (II6), Dbm/Ab aligns with C#m/G# (vi64), and B/Bb is effectively B/A# (V over #4). 

So, in a nutshell, the answer is E Lydian. Key center E, mode Lydian!

E Lydian

Reason: Enharmonically, the chords fit E Lydian diatonically (e.g., Bbdim = A#° = iv°; Gb/Bb = F#/A# = II6; Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# = vi64; B/Bb = B/A# = V over #4; Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# = I6).
