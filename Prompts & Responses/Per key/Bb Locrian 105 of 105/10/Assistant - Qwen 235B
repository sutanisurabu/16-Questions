Let's analyze the chord progression you provided:

```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

### Step 1: Understand the Chords

Let’s interpret each chord and its function.

- **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–Fb (which is enharmonic to E). A diminished triad built on Bb.
  - This is the vii° chord in Cb major, but more likely functioning as a leading tone chord in C minor or C major?
  - However, Bbdim is not diatonic to C major (which has Bdim), nor to C minor (which has B° if harmonic). But Bbdim suggests root Bb, which is more common in keys like **Bb minor** or **Cb major**, etc.

Let’s look at the other chords:

- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major with Bb in the bass → that's Gb major chord (Gb–Bb–Db), first inversion.
  - Gb major is the **bVI** chord in Bb minor.
  - Bb natural minor: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab → so Gb is the 6th scale degree → **Gb** is the **bVI**.
  - So Gb major is a characteristic **borrowed chord** from Bb **Phrygian** or Bb minor with modal mixture.

- **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor with Ab in the bass → so Db–Fb–Ab, Ab in bass → first inversion? Wait: Ab is the 5th of Dbm → so Dbm/Ab is Dbm in second inversion.
  - Dbm is the **iv** chord in Bb minor.
  - Bb minor: iv = Ebm, not Dbm.
  - Wait — Dbm? That doesn't fit Bb natural minor.

Wait — let's check key possibilities.

Hold on: **Dbm** has notes: **Db–Fb–Ab**

Compare to Bb harmonic minor: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–A → iv would be Ebm, and bII would be Cb, not Dbm.

Hmm. Perhaps we're in **Ab minor**?

Try **Ab minor**:

- Ab natural minor: Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb
- Ab harmonic minor: Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–G

Now:
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb → that's **ii°** in Ab minor.
- Gb/Bb = Gb major in 1st inversion → Gb is ♭VI in Ab minor.
- Dbm/Ab = Db minor with Ab in bass → Dbm is **iv**, and Ab is the tonic → so iv6 (second inversion)
- B/Bb = B major chord with Bb in bass? Wait — **B major** is B–D#–F# — that’s very chromatic.
  - But we're writing **B/Bb**, so B chord over Bb bass.

Wait — **B major** (B–D#–F#) over **Bb**? That’s extremely dissonant.

But **B** vs **Bb** — only a half step apart.

Wait — is it possible this is a typo? Or is it **Bdim** instead of **B**?

Because we had many **Bbdim**, and suddenly **B/Bb**? That’s possible, but let’s see.

Wait — **B/Bb** — maybe it’s **Bdim/Bb** or **B°/Bb**?

But the notation says **B/Bb**, meaning B major chord with Bb in bass.

But B major is **B–D#–F#**, and Bb is **Bb** — so the chord would have Bb and B together — minor second — very dissonant.

Alternatively, could it be a **misspelling**? Like **A#/Bb**? Or maybe **Bb°/Bb**?

But it’s written as **B/Bb**, after Bbdim.

Wait — **Emaj7/Ab**?

That’s E major 7 over Ab in bass: Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D#, and bass Ab → so Ab–E–G#–B–D#? That’s wild.

That’s not diatonic anywhere.

This suggests we may have enharmonic reinterpretations.

Let’s **enharmonically respell** the chords to make sense.

### Step 2: Enharmonic Equivalents

Try to respell all in terms of flats vs sharps.

Current chords:

- Bbdim → Bb–Db–Fb (Fb = E)
- Gb/Bb → Gb–Bb–Db over Bb → Gb major first inversion
- Dbm/Ab → Db–Fb–Ab over Ab → Db minor second inversion
- B/Bb → B–D#–F# over Bb → very odd
- Emaj7/Ab → E–G#–B–D# over Ab

Wait — these sharps are problematic. Let’s try enharmonics.

Possibility: **This is in Cb major or Bb minor?**

But B/B seems too chromatic.

Alternative idea: **Is this in B minor or Bb minor?**

Wait — what if "B" is a typo for **Bb**?

But it says **B/Bb**, not **Bb/Bb**.

Alternatively, **B** could be **Bdim**? Because earlier we had Bbdim repeating.

Wait — look at the progression:

```
Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb
Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb
Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb
Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim
```

Note symmetry: 16 chords, possibly 2 x 8-chord phrases.

But the chords:
1. Bbdim
2. Bbdim
3. Gb/Bb
4. Gb/Bb
5. Bbdim
6. Bbdim
7. Dbm/Ab
8. B/Bb
9. Bbdim
10. Bbdim
11. Gb/Bb
12. Gb/Bb
13. Bbdim
14. Bbdim
15. Emaj7/Ab
16. Bbdim

So positions 7 and 8: Dbm/Ab → B/Bb  
Then 15: Emaj7/Ab

Both with Ab in bass. And **Ab** keeps appearing (in Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab).

So Ab is probably the **tonic**.

Let’s assume the key is **Ab minor**.

### Key: Ab Minor

Ab natural minor: Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb

But we have:

- Bbdim = Bb–D–F (if D = Eb? No — dim = minor third + diminished fifth)

Wait — Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb (since Fb is enharmonic to E, but in theory, it’s Fb).

In Ab minor:
- Bb is the 2nd scale degree.
- ii° chord in Ab minor is **Bbdim** → yes! **Bbdim is ii°** in Ab minor.

So Bbdim = **ii°** — common in minor keys.

Next: Gb/Bb → Gb major over Bb → Gb is the ♭VI chord in Ab minor.

- In Ab minor: ♭VI = Gb major → yes, a common modal mixture chord (borrowed from Phrygian or major).
- So Gb = **bVI**, diatonic in minor keys for color.

Then: Dbm/Ab → Db minor with Ab in bass → Ab is root, so **i64**? Wait — Dbm over Ab.

Dbm = iv chord in Ab minor.

- iv = Db–Fb–Ab → yes.
- So Dbm/Ab → iv in second inversion (iv6/4) → very common.

So far: ii° – ii° – bVI – bVI – ii° – ii° – iv6/4 – ????

Now chord 8: **B/Bb**

But "B" is B natural: B–D#–F#

But Ab minor has no B natural — it has Bb and Cb.

Unless this is **a passing chord** or **enharmonic**.

Wait — could **B/Bb** be meant to be **Bdim/Bb**?

Bdim = B–D–F — but B is still not in Ab minor.

Alternatively — enharmonic spelling:

**B** = enharmonic to **Cb**

But **B major** = B–D#–F# → enharmonically, that’s Cb–E–Gb

But Cb–E–Gb = Cb–E–Gb → E is not in Ab minor (Ab minor has Eb)

Wait, no.

Alternatively, is **B** meant to be **Bb**?

But it says **B/Bb**, not Bb.

Alternatively, **B** could be a symbol for **B diminished**, but usually "B" means B major.

Wait — what if "B" is **A#?**

A# major = A#–C##–E# = A#–D–F##

Too weird.

Alternatively, **B chord with Bb bass** — could be a polychord or passing.

But now look at chord 15: **Emaj7/Ab**

E major 7 = E–G#–B–D#

With Ab in bass.

Ab = G#

So **G# = Ab**, so **Emaj7/Ab** = **Emaj7/G#** — meaning Emaj7 with G# in bass — which is the **7th** of Emaj7.

So Emaj7/G# = Emaj7 in **third inversion** — and G# is the 7th.

But why Ab? Because Ab = G#.

So chord is **Emaj7/G#**, which is **E–G#–B–D#** with **G#** in bass.

But E major 7 is not in Ab minor.

However — E is the **leading tone** of **F**, but not directly related.

But **E major** is the **V** of **Am**, not Ab.

Wait — **E is the V of Am**, not Ab.

But if we think **E is V of Am**, and **Am is iv in Ab major**?

No.

Alternative idea: Could this progression be using **chromatic mediants** or **augmented sixth chords**?

Wait — **Emaj7/G#** — G# = Ab.

Emaj7: E–G#–B–D#

Over Ab (G#), so effectively the chord is Ab–E–B–D#? Very dissonant.

But E and Ab are a diminished fourth apart — tritone.

But let’s look at function.

Another thought: **Emaj7/G#** = **E–G#–B–D#** over G# → but G# is chromatic.

But in **Cb major**, we have:

Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab–Bb–Cb

So Ab is scale degree 6, Gb is 5, Bb is 7.

But E = not in Cb major — it's D#.

Wait — D# = enharmonic to Eb.

But G# = Ab, D# = Eb.

So maybe this **Emaj7** is really **Ebmaj7**?

But written as Emaj7. Unlikely.

Alternatively, Emaj7 could be a **secondary dominant**.

E major = V of A — but A is not in Ab minor.

But if we go to **A°7**, which is common in Ab minor, we have **G#°7**, which is spelled G#–B–D–F.

But here we have **E–G#–B–D#** — that's **E dominant 7?** No — D# is natural 7, not flat.

E–G#–B–D# = Emaj7, not E7.

So E7 would be E–G#–B–D — that's V7/vi in Ab major? Vi is F minor.

Not close.

Wait — could **Emaj7/Ab** be functioning as a **German augmented sixth chord**?

German Aug6: has Ab–C–Eb–F## (F## = G), but with bass Ab, it resolves to I or V.

But E–G#–B–D# doesn't match.

Wait — what if **Emaj7/Ab** is an **enharmonic respelling** of a **German augmented sixth**?

Standard German +6 in Ab: Ab–C–Eb–F# (enharmonic to Gb)

F# = Gb.

But here we have E–G#–B–D# over Ab.

E = Fb?
G# = Ab
B = Cb?
D# = Eb?

So Ab–Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb

Wait — possible.

If we **enharmonically respell Emaj7/Ab**:

- Ab = Ab
- E = Fb
- G# = Ab (already)
- B = Cb
- D# = Eb

So chord: Ab–Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb

So pitches: Ab, B, Cb, Eb, Fb, Ab

Wait — that’s Ab–Cb–Eb–Fb

Fb = E
Cb = B

So: Ab–B–Eb–E — very odd.

No, this doesn't help.

Alternative idea:

Perhaps **"B/Bb" and "Emaj7/Ab" are both altered dominants targeting Ab**?

Let’s look at **B/Bb** = B major over Bb bass → chord: Bb–B–D#–F#

That has Bb and B → minor second clash.
And D# and F# — very sharp.

But if we hear this as a **chromatic approach** to Cb (B), maybe?

Wait — what if the final tonic is **Cb**?

Let’s try **Cb major**.

Cb major: Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab–Bb–Cb

Now:
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb → Bb is 7th scale degree → Bbdim = **vii°** → common leading tone chord → resolves to Cb.
- Gb/Bb = Gb major over Bb → Gb is V in Cb major → so **V/VII**, or more directly — in Cb, Gb is the **V** chord — but only if it’s Gb7.
  - But it’s Gb major — could still function as **dominant of Cb**.
- Dbm/Ab = Dbm over Ab → Dbm is ii, Ab is not in root — Ab is vi. Not clear.
- B/Bb — B is not in Cb. B = Cb? Almost — enharmonic.

But B major = B–D#–F# — which is enharmonic to Cb–Eb–Gb — which is **Cb major chord**!

Oh! That's it!

**B major = enharmonic to Cb major**

- B = Cb
- D# = Eb
- F# = Gb

So **B major chord** = **Cb–Eb–Gb** = **Cb major**!

And **B/Bb** = **Cb major over Bb** → so the bass is Bb, chord is Cb.

So this is **I in Cb major, with Bb (scale degree 7) in bass** → so **I/7** — first inversion relative? No — 7th degree as bass under tonic.

So **Cb major chord in second inversion?** No — Cb major is Cb–Eb–Gb, so with Bb in bass, it's not standard.

But Bb is the **leading tone**, and Cb is tonic.

So **Cb major over Bb** = a **cadential six-four**? But six-four is I6/4 or V6/4.

Wait — not quite.

But chord is **I with 7th in bass** — unstable.

Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab**

E major 7: E–G#–B–D#

Enharmonic:

- E = Fb
- G# = Ab
- B = Cb
- D# = Eb

So Emaj7 = Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = **Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb** = **Fb minor seventh**? Wait — Fb–Ab is major third, Ab–Cb = minor third, Cb–Eb = major third → so Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = Fb–A–C–E → wait enharmonics:

Fb = E
Ab = Ab
Cb = B
Eb = D#

Messy.

Wait — Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = **Fb dominant 7**? Fb–Ab–Cb–Ebb?

No — Eb is not Ebb.

Wait: Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb → intervals:

- Fb–Ab = major third
- Ab–Cb = major third (since Cb = B)
- Cb–Eb = minor third (B–D = minor third)
So Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = Fb–A–C–E = Fb–A–C–E → that's an **augmented triad with major 7** — not useful.

But Fb–Ab–Cb = Fb augmented.

Not helping.

Alternative idea:

**Emaj7/Ab** — E–G#–B–D# over Ab

G# = Ab → so chord has Ab and G# = same note? No — Ab and G# are enharmonic.

So in practice, it's Ab–E–B–D#.

So pitches: Ab, B, D#, E — very sharp.

But if we hear this as a **dominant chord**, possibly **V7/vi** or something.

But let's step back.

Given that:
- Bbdim appears often → leading tone chord
- Gb/Bb = Gb over Bb → Gb is V of Cb → Gb is **V** in **Cb major**
- Bbdim = **vii°7** in Cb major
- Then **B/Bb** = **Cb major** chord (B = Cb) with **Bb** (7th degree) in bass → so it's like **I with leading tone in bass** — a strong dominant preparation
- Then **Emaj7/Ab** — what if **E** is **Fb**? Then **Fbmaj7** = Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb
  - In Cb major: Fb = 4, Ab = 6, Cb = 1, Eb = 3 — so Fbmaj7 = **IVmaj7 in Cb major**

Yes!

So **Emaj7** is likely a typo or enharmonic for **Fbmaj7**, but why write E?

Because on some instruments or charts, E is used instead of Fb.

But Fb is enharmonic to E.

So **Fbmaj7/Ab** = Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb over Ab → so Ab is the 6th scale degree in Cb major.

Fbmaj7 = **IV** chord in Cb major.

With Ab in bass → so **IV6/5**? Third inversion.

Yes — IV7 with 6th in bass (third inversion).

So chord = IV7 in third inversion.

Then resolves to Bbdim = vii° → then to I?

But last chord is Bbdim — so ends on dominant? Unresolved.

But the progression ends on Bbdim, which is **vii°** in Cb — wants to resolve to Cb.

So possibly the progression is **in Cb major**, and ends on the leading tone chord, implying resolution.

Now let’s reinterpret the whole progression with **enharmonic spellings**.

Original:
```
Bbdim       Bbdim       Gb/Bb       Gb/Bb
Bbdim       Bbdim       Dbm/Ab      B/Bb
Bbdim       Bbdim       Gb/Bb       Gb/Bb
Bbdim       Bbdim       Emaj7/Ab    Bbdim
```

Now convert:

- Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb → same
- Gb = Gb major → V in Cb
- Dbm/Ab = Db–Fb–Ab over Ab → in Cb: Db = ii, Ab = vi, Fb = IV → so Dbm = **iiø7? No — Dbm is not in Cb major (Dbo is ii°)**
  - Cb major: ii = Dbo
  - Dbm is minor, not diminished — so not diatonic.

Problem.

Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab

Cb major has: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb

So triad on Db: Db–Fb–Ab → that's **Db–Fb–Ab** = **minor**? Fb–Ab is minor third (Fb–G–A–Ab? No)

Fb to Ab:
- Fb to Gb = major second
- Fb to A = major third? A is not in key.

Note: Fb = E, Ab = G#

E to G# = major third → so Fb–Ab = major third.

So Db–Fb–Ab = **Db major** — so in Cb major, **Db–Fb–Ab = II** chord? No — in Cb, Db is 2nd, so chord is **Dbo** if diatonic.

Actually, in Cb major:
- Dbo = Db–Fb–Abb (G)
But we have Db–Fb–Ab — Ab is not Abb (G) — it's Ab, which is a semitone higher.

So Db–Fb–Ab = **Db augmented**? No, Db–Fb–Ab = Db major.

Fb to Ab is major third (4 semitones), Db to Fb is major third? Db to Fb is 4 semitones — yes — so Db–Fb–Ab = **Db major** — which is not in Cb major.

So Dbm is **not Db major**, it's minor.

"Dbm" means Db–Fb–Ab with **minor third**, so Db–Fb is minor third.

But Db to Fb is 4 semitones = major third.

So there's an issue.

**"Dbm" must be a typo or misnomer.**

Because Db to Fb is 4 semitones = major third.

So a **Db minor** chord would be Db–**E**–Ab, but E is not Fb.

Fb = E.

So Db–Fb = Db–E = augmented second? No.

Pitches:
- Db = C#
- Fb = E
- C# to E = minor third (3 semitones) — C#, D, D#, E — no: C# to D = 1, D to D# = 2, D# to E = 3 — C# to E = 3 semitones = minor third.

Yes!

C#–E = minor third.

And E = Fb = enharmonic.

So Db–Fb–Ab = Db–E–Ab.

E is Fb, but also enharmonic to E.

So Db–E–Ab = Db–E–Ab.

But in equal temperament, Db–E–Ab is a valid minor chord: root, minor third, perfect fifth.

Ab is 7 semitone from Db.

So yes, Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab = Db–E–Ab.

But in **Cb major**, the ii chord is Dbo = Db–Fb–Abb (G), but here we have Ab, not G.

So it's not diatonic.

Unless this is in **Ab minor** or **Db minor**.

### Reconsider: Ab minor (G# minor)

Assume the key is **Ab minor**.

Ab minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab

So:
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb = **ii°** — yes, diatonic
- Gb/Bb = Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db) over Bb → Gb is **bVI** — common in minor
- Dbm/Ab = Db–Fb–Ab over Ab → Dbm is **iv** chord in Ab minor — yes! iv = Db minor
  - and Ab is the tonic — so this is iv6/4 — second inversion iv — very common
- B/Bb = B major over Bb → now B = enharmonic to Cb
  - Cb is the **b3** of Ab
  - B major = Cb–Eb–Gb = Cb major
  - Cb major is **III** in Ab minor — which is a common borrowed chord (from Phrygian or major)
  - So Cb major over Bb → III with 2nd in bass — so III/ii

Yes! So **B/Bb = Cb major chord with Bb (ii) in bass** = **III/ii** in first inversion? No — chord is Cb, bass is Bb.

So Cb major with Bb = chordal third? Cb–Eb–Gb, Bb is not in chord.

Bb is the 9th below.

Wait, Bb is the bass, not in the chord.

But if it's Cb major: Cb–Eb–Gb
Over Bb — which is not in the chord.

So not a standard inversion.

But perhaps it's a **bIII** chord in Ab minor — Cb major, yes.

And the bass Bb (2nd degree) could be for voice leading.

Then finally: Emaj7/Ab

E = Fb
G# = Ab
B = Cb
D# = Eb

So Emaj7 = Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb

Now in Ab minor:
- Fb = b6
- Ab = 1
- Cb = b3
- Eb = 5

So Ab is in the chord! So **Emaj7/Ab** = chord: Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb with Ab in bass.

So pitches: Ab, Cb, Eb, Fb — which is **Ab minor major 7** chord with b13?

Ab–Cb–Eb–Fb → that's **Abm(maj7) add b6**

Which is not a standard chord.

But Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = **Fb major 7** chord: Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb — yes! Fb–Ab is major third, Ab–Cb major, Cb–Eb major — wait, no:

- Fb–Ab = major third (4 semitones)
- Ab–Cb = major third (4 semitones) — Cb = B
- Cb–Eb = minor third (3 semitones) — so Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = Fb–A–C–E → that's Fb–A–C–E — A to C is minor third, so it's Fb–A–C–E = Fb–A–C–E = Fb7 (dominant 7) if E is Eb, but here D# = Eb.

D# = Eb.

So Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = **Fb7 chord**?

Fb–Ab–Cb–Ebb = Fb7, but Ebb = D, not Eb.

Eb is not the minor 7th of Fb.

Fb minor 7 = Fb–Ab–Cb–Ebb = Fb–A–C–D

But we have Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = Fb–A–C–E → that's Fb–A–C–E = **Fb major 7** only if E is natural, but in Ab minor, E is Eb (flat).

So not diatonic.

But Fb–Ab–Cb–Eb = **Fb major 7** = IV major in Cb, but in Ab minor, it's bVI major 7.

So very chromatic.

However, the most consistent key is **Ab minor**, with modal mixture.

### Final Decision:

Given:
- Bbdim = ii°
- Gb/Bb = bVI
- Dbm/Ab = iv
- B/Bb = bIII (Cb major) with ii in bass — bIII/ii
- Emaj7/Ab = Fbmaj7 (bVI major 7) with tonic in bass

All these chords (bVI, iv, bIII, bVImaj7) are possible in **Ab minor** with chromaticism and modal mixture.

The prevailing key is **Ab minor**, and the mode is **Aeolian**, but with extensive use of chromatic chords.

### ✅ Conclusion:

**Key: Ab minor**  
**Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)** with chromatic and modal mixture (borrowed chords from parallel major, Phrygian, etc.)

The progression uses:
- ii° (Bbdim)
- bVI (Gb)
- iv (Dbm)
- bIII (Cb, spelled as B)
- bVIMaj7 (Fb, spelled as E)

Common in jazz and Romantic-era harmony.

So final answer:
> **Key: Ab minor**  
> **Mode: Aeolian**
