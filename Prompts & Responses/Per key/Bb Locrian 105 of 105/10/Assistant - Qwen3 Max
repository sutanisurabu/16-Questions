Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**
- Bbdim  
- Bbdim  
- Gb/Bb  
- Gb/Bb  
- Bbdim  
- Bbdim  
- Dbm/Ab  
- B/Bb  
- Bbdim  
- Bbdim  
- Gb/Bb  
- Gb/Bb  
- Bbdim  
- Bbdim  
- Emaj7/Ab  
- Bbdim

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center

The progression is heavily centered around **Bb**:
- Most chords are either **Bbdim**, or **Gb/Bb** (Gb major with Bb in the bass), or other chords with **Bb in the bass** (e.g., B/Bb).
- Bb appears consistently as the bass note, suggesting **Bb is the tonal center**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the chords relative to Bb

Let’s interpret each chord in the key of **Bb**:

#### 1. **Bbdim (Bb–D♭–E–G♭)**
- Fully diminished 7th chord: Bb–Db–E–G = notes of **G diminished 7**, **Bb diminished 7**, **Db dim7**, **E dim7** – all enharmonic.
- In functional harmony, diminished chords often function as **leading-tone chords** (vii°) or as passing chords.

#### 2. **Gb/Bb**
- Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db
- So Gb/Bb = Bb–Db–Gb
- This is **Bb minor 7♭5** (Bb–Db–Gb–Ab) without the 7th → essentially a **Bb half-diminished** sound (viiø7 in Cb major or iiø7 in Ab minor).

Wait: Let’s consider **Gb major** as tonic? But bass is always Bb... so maybe better to think modally.

#### 3. **Dbm/Ab**
- Db minor = Db–Fb–Ab → Db–E–Ab
- Over Ab bass = Ab–Db–E
- This is **Ab7♭9** (Ab–C–Eb–Gb–Bbb ≈ Ab–C–Eb–Gb–E) → but we have E natural, not Gb.
Wait: E natural is same as F♭? No — E natural is **not** in Db minor (which has F♭ = E♭). So this chord contains **E natural**, which is **enharmonic to F♭? No, F♭ = E** — actually yes! Wait: F♭ = E **enharmonically**, but in Db minor, the third is F♭, which is **E**, yes.

Hold on:  
- Db minor scale: Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab–Bbb–Cb  
- So Fb = E, Bbb = A, Cb = B  
So Db minor chord = Db–Fb–Ab = Db–E–Ab

So **Dbm/Ab = Ab–Db–E** = notes of **Ab–Db–E**, which is **Ab7♭5?** Not quite.

But notice: **Ab–Db–E** = same as **Ab–Db–(F♭)** = a minor chord with a flattened third → standard.

So this is just a **first inversion of Db minor**, nothing exotic.

#### 4. **B/Bb**
- B major = B–D#–F#
- Over Bb bass = Bb–B–D#–F#
- Contains **B natural and Bb together** → highly dissonant, chromatic.
- This is likely a **passing chord** or a **chromatic mediant**.
- B major is **enharmonic to C♭ major**, which is the **bII** in Bb? Not exactly.

But consider: **B major = C♭ major**, which is **Neapolitan of Bb minor?** In Bb minor, Neapolitan is **Cb major**, yes! So B/Cb major is the **Neapolitan chord** in **Bb minor**.

So B/Bb = Cb/Bb = **bII in Bb minor**.

#### 5. **Emaj7/Ab**
- E major 7 = E–G#–B–D#
- Over Ab bass = Ab–E–G#–B–D#
- Notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#
- E = Fb, G# = Ab, so we have **Ab, Fb, Ab, B, D#**
- This is very chromatic.

But consider enharmonically:  
- E = F♭  
- G# = A♭  
- B = C♭  
- D# = E♭

So chord = F♭–A♭–C♭–E♭ over A♭ = **Ab major 7♭5?** Wait: F♭–A♭–C♭–E♭ = **F minor/major 7?** Not helpful.

Alternative: Think of **Emaj7** as **V of A**, but over Ab bass... maybe it's a **tritone substitution**?

Emaj7 contains notes that belong to **C# minor** or **E major**, neither of which are close to Bb.

But note: **Emaj7** shares notes with **Ab melodic minor?**

Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F–G  
→ G = F##? No.

Alternatively, consider **Ab as root**, then chord is **Ab–E–G#–B–D#** = **Ab with major 7th, sharp 9, sharp 11?** Very altered.

But perhaps the most revealing note is **G#**, which is **enharmonic to Ab**, so the chord contains **Ab and G# = same pitch**, so maybe it's just a **textural cluster**.

However, **Emaj7** contains **D#**, which is **enharmonic to Eb** — that’s in Bb minor!  
- Bb natural minor: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab  
- Bb harmonic minor: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–A  
- Bb melodic minor: Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G–A

So **A natural** (not Ab) appears in Bb harmonic/melodic minor.

But **Emaj7** has **G#**, which is **A♭**, not A♮.

Wait! **G# = A♭**, which is in **Bb natural minor** (A♭), yes!

So Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D# = E–A♭–B–E♭

Now check:  
- A♭ = in Bb minor  
- E♭ = in Bb minor  
- B = C♭ = in Bb minor (C♭ = B)  
- E = F♭ = in Bb minor

So **all notes of Emaj7 are in Bb natural minor**, enharmonically!

- E = F♭  
- G# = A♭  
- B = C♭  
- D# = E♭

So **Emaj7 = F♭–A♭–C♭–E♭** = **F♭maj7**, which is **bVI in Bb minor**

Because in Bb minor:  
- bVI = Gb major → but F♭ = E, so F♭ major = E major enharmonically.

Wait: In Bb minor, the **bVI chord is Gb major** (Gb–Bb–Db)

But **F♭ major = E major = E–G#–B**, which is **not Gb major** (Gb–Bb–Db)

But **F♭ = E**, and Gb = F#, so not the same.

Actually, **bVI in Bb minor is Gb major**, not E major.

So Emaj7 is **not diatonic** to Bb minor.

But note: **Emaj7/Ab** = Ab in bass, and chord is E major 7.

So possible interpretation: **Ab is the root**, and E major 7 is an upper structure.

Ab with E major 7 = Ab–E–G#–B–D#

This is equivalent to **Ab7#9#5** or something? Let's build Ab7#5#9:

- Ab7 = Ab–C–Eb–Gb  
- #5 = E (since 5 = Eb, #5 = E)  
- #9 = B (since 9 = Bb, #9 = B)

So Ab7#5#9 = Ab–C–E–G–B → but we have **G# (Ab)**, not G, and no C.

So not quite.

Alternatively, maybe this is a **modal interchange** or **chromatic passing chord**.

---

### Step 3: Consider modes of Bb

Given the heavy use of **diminished chords** and minor/flat color, likely **Bb minor** (Aeolian or other minor modes).

Check if chords fit **Bb Locrian**? Unlikely (Locrian is unstable).

**Bb Phrygian?** Bb Phrygian = Bb–C♭–Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab → very flat, includes Db, Gb, Ab — matches many chords.

- Bbdim = Bb–Db–E–Gb → E = F♭, so fits (♭2 = C♭, but we have E = F♭ = ♭6? Wait)

Bb Phrygian notes: Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

So chord tones:
- Bbdim: Bb–Db–E–Gb → E = not in Phrygian (Phrygian has Cb, not E/Fb as chord tone). But E = F♭, which is **not** in Bb Phrygian (which has C♭, not F♭).

F♭ would be the **♭6**, but Bb Phrygian has **F (natural)** as the 5th.

So E (F♭) is **♭6**, which is not in Phrygian.

But **Bb harmonic minor** = Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–Gb–A

Contains A (not Ab), so G# appears as leading tone.

But our chords use **Ab (Gb)** and **G**? Not A.

In progression, we have **Gb, Db, Ab** — all from **Bb natural minor**.

Also **Bbdim** contains **E (F♭)**, which is **enharmonic to the diminished fifth**, but in Bb, the diminished chord on Bb is **not diatonic**.

However, **Bbdim** can be seen as **vii°7 of Cb**, but Cb = B, which is the **B/Bb** chord — possible!

So maybe it’s **Bb as a pedal tone**, with chromatic upper structures — common in **jazz, film, or experimental music**.

---

### Step 4: Consider octatonic scale

The repeated **Bbdim** and movement to **Gb**, **Dbm**, **Emaj7** suggests use of the **diminished (octatonic) scale**.

Bb diminished scale (half-whole): Bb–B–Db–D–E–F–G–Ab

Notes: Bb, B, Db, D, E, F, G, Ab

Check chords:
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–E–G → all in octatonic ✓
- Gb = F# → not in this scale? Wait, Gb = F#, not present. But **Gb = enharmonic to F#**, not in Bb half-whole.

But **whole-half diminished starting on Bb**: Bb–C–Db–Eb–E–F#–G–A

Then Gb (F#) is present.

So **Bb whole-half diminished scale**: Bb–C–Db–Eb–E–F#–G–A

Now check:
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–E–G ✓
- Gb = F#–A–C = F#, A, C → F# and A are in scale, C is not (we have C? No, scale has C? No, Bb whole-half: Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, F#, G, A → C is present! Yes, second note.

So Gb = F#–A–C → all in scale ✓

- Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab = Db–E–Ab → Db, E, Ab = Db, E, Ab → all in scale? Db = yes, E = yes, Ab = A♭ = not in this scale (scale has A natural). Hmm.

But Ab is not in Bb whole-half — it has A natural.

However, if we consider **B half-whole diminished** (since B/Bb appears), that scale is B–C–D–Eb–F–Gb–Ab–A

Which includes Ab, Gb, etc.

Maybe the piece **alternates between two diminished scales** or uses **Bb as a pedal with chromatic upper structures**.

---

### Step 5: Most plausible key and mode

Given:
- Tonic pedal on **Bb**
- Chords are mostly **diminished, minor, flat-side**
- No strong dominant (no F7 or F major)
- Use of **Gb (b5)**, **Db (b2)**, **Ab (b7)**, **E (♭6/enharm.)**

This strongly suggests **Bb minor**, specifically **Bb Aeolian (natural minor)** with heavy use of **diminished passing chords** and **modal interchange**.

The **Bbdim** chords function as **passing chords** or **#i dim** (common in minor keys to add color).

The **Gb/Bb** = **bV/bII in Bb minor** – bV is unusual, but **Gb = bV** in Bb minor (since V = F, bV = Eb? Wait, no).

Actually in Bb minor:
- i = Bbm
- bII = Cb
- bIII = Db
- iv = Ebm
- v = Fm
- bVI = Gb
- vii° = Adim

So **Gb = bVI**, so **Gb/Bb** = **bVI with tonic pedal** → common in minor keys.

**Dbm = bIII**, so **Dbm/Ab** = bIII in first inversion.

**B/Bb = Cb/Bb = bII** – Neapolitan chord in Bb minor.

**Emaj7/Ab** = possibly **V of bVI**? V of Gb is Db, not E.

But **Emaj7** = **V of Amaj**, not helpful.

However, **Emaj7** contains **D# = Eb**, **G# = Ab**, so over Ab bass, it creates an **Ab Phrygian #3** or **Ab Lydian augmented** sound, but likely just a **color chord**.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: B♭ minor  
- **Mode**: Aeolian (natural minor), with extensive chromaticism and use of diminished passing chords  
- The progression avoids traditional functional harmony, instead using **Bb pedal** with **modal interchange** from Bb natural minor and **symmetrical (diminished) harmony**

✅ **Final answer**: **B♭ minor (Aeolian mode)**
