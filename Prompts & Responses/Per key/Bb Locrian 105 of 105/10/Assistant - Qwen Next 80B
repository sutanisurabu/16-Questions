Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**

> Bbdim — Bbdim — Gb/Bb — Gb/Bb — Bbdim — Bbdim — Dbm/Ab — B/Bb — Bbdim — Bbdim — Gb/Bb — Gb/Bb — Bbdim — Bbdim — Emaj7/Ab — Bbdim

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords

Let’s write out each chord fully and understand its function.

1. **Bbdim** = B♭ diminished (B♭ – D♭ – F♭)
2. **Gb/Bb** = Gb major triad with Bb in the bass → Gb – Bb – Db, root = Gb, bass = Bb → this is a **Gb major in first inversion**
3. **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor triad with Ab in the bass → Db – Fb – Ab, root = Db, bass = Ab → **Db minor in first inversion**
4. **B/Bb** = B major triad with Bb in the bass → B – D# – F# with Bb bass → this is **B major over Bb bass**, a **polytonal or chromatic bass movement**
5. **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th with Ab in the bass → E – G# – B – D# with Ab bass → **E major 7th over Ab**

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal center / key

Notice that **Bb diminished** appears **8 times** — it's the most frequent chord. That's a strong hint.

Bb diminished is built on B♭, and is often used as a **passing diminished chord** or as a **voice-leading device** between chords.

But let’s look at the *other* chords:

- Gb major → enharmonically = F# major
- Db minor → enharmonically = C# minor
- B major
- Emaj7

Wait — these don’t seem to belong to a diatonic scale.

But look at **Gb/Bb** — Gb is the *tritone* substitute for C major or C7.

Also, Bb diminished has the notes: **B♭ – D♭ – F♭** (which is E)

That’s the same as **D♭ diminished** (D♭ – F♭ – A𝄫) — but maybe more importantly, Bb diminished is the **leading tone chord** in C minor or the **vii°7** in C minor.

Wait — let’s try C **minor**.

In **C minor**:

- vii°7 = B°7 = B – D – F – A♭ → but we have **B♭dim**, which is **B♭ – D♭ – F♭**

That’s **not** B°7. So not C minor.

Wait — **B♭dim** = B♭ – D♭ – F♭

That’s the same as **D♭dim**, **F♭dim**, etc. — it’s symmetrical.

Let’s try **Gb major** as the key? But we have **Dbm/Ab**, which is the **vi chord** in Gb major?

Gb major scale: Gb – Ab – Bb – Cb – Db – Eb – F

So chords:

- i: Gb
- ii: Abm
- iii: Bbm
- iv: Cb
- v: Dbm ← YES! Db minor is the **v chord** in Gb major
- vi: Ebm
- vii°: F°

We have **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor, which is the **v chord** in Gb major.

We also have **Gb/Bb** — Gb major in first inversion → could be **I chord**

And **Bbdim** — Bb diminished → in Gb major, the vii° chord is **F°**, not Bb°.

So Bbdim is **not** diatonic to Gb major.

But wait — what if Gb is the key, and Bbdim is a **chromatic passing chord**?

Alternatively...

Let’s look at **B/Bb** — B major over Bb. This is a **chromatic mediant bass movement**.

And **Emaj7/Ab** — E major 7 over Ab. Ab to E is a **tritone apart**.

This is a lot of tritone relationships.

Some of the bass notes: **Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb**

So the bass is mostly **Bb**, with two **Ab**’s.

That suggests **Bb** is the tonal center.

Bass = Bb for 14 of 16 chords → strong tonic candidate.

So what key has **Bb** as tonic?

Possibly **Bb major**, or **Bb minor**.

In **Bb major**: scale = Bb – C – D – Eb – F – G – A

Chords:
- i: Bbm (we don’t have this)
- vii°: A° — but we have **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–Fb — that’s the **iii°**? No, in Bb major, iii is Dm.

Wait — **Bbdim** = Bb–Db–Fb — this is not diatonic to Bb major.

In **Bb minor** (natural):

Scale: Bb – Cb – Db – Eb – Fb – Gb – Ab

Chords:
- i: Bbm
- ii°: Cb°
- iii: Db
- iv: Ebm
- v: Fbm
- vi: Gbm
- vii°: Ab°

**Bbdim** = Bb–Db–Fb

That’s **Bb – Db – Fb** → Bb is tonic, Db is ♭3, Fb is ♭5 — PERFECTLY fits **Bb diminished** as the **i° chord**.

In **Bb natural minor**, the i chord is Bbm, not Bb° — but there is **no** diatonic diminished chord on the tonic in natural minor.

BUT — in **harmonic minor**, the vii° chord is built on the 7th scale degree, not the tonic.

In **Bb harmonic minor**: Bb – Cb – Db – Eb – Fb – Gb – A

Then:

- i: Bbm
- ii°: Cb°
- iii+: Db
- iv: Ebm
- v: Fb
- VI: Gb
- vii°: A°

Still — **Bbdim** is *not* diatonic here.

Wait a second.

**Bb dim = Bb – Db – Fb**

Now look at **Gb major** = Gb – Ab – Bb – Cb – Db – Eb – F

So Fb is the *same* as E — so **Fb = E**

So Bb – Db – Fb = Bb – Db – E — that’s actually the same as **Bb dim7** if we add Gbb? Probably not.

Wait — what if Bb dim is a **borrowed** or **chromatic** chord?

Let’s refocus.

The presence of **Gb major** and **Db minor** strongly suggests a **Gb major** context.

But Gb major and Db minor — Db is the **v** chord in Gb major, as we said.

Now, **Bb** is the **iii** chord in Gb major → Bb major.

But we have **Bb diminished**, not Bb major.

Let’s check: in Gb major, the iii chord is **Bb major**: Bb – D – F

We have **Bb dim**: Bb – Db – Fb — that’s **Bb with ♭3 and ♭5** → it’s a chromatic alteration of the iii chord.

In fact, this is a **common modulation trick**: using a diminished chord to lead to another key.

Here’s a breakthrough: consider **Gb major** as the home key.

Then:

- **Gb/Bb** = Gb (I) in first inversion
- **Dbm/Ab** = Dbm (v) in first inversion
- **Bb dim** = enharmonic = A# dim — which could be **vii°7 of Gb?** No, vii° in Gb major is F°.

Wait — what’s the diminished chord that resolves to Gb?

The **leading tone chord** is F°7 → F–A♭–C♭–E♭

That’s not Bb°.

Wait — what if **Bbdim** is functioning as the **vii°7 of C major**? Then C major’s vii° is Bdim — not Bb.

But here’s an alternative idea: **Bb dim = same as D dim = F dim = A dim** due to symmetry.

So Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb = Db–Fb–Abb (also Dbdim)

But Fb is E, Abb is G — so this is also **E diminished**: E–G–B♭ — Bbdim is **Edim** written from Bb!

Bb–Db–Fb = Bb–Db–E — and E–G–Bb is a diminished triad.

So **Bbdim = E dim**

And **E major 7th over Ab** = Emaj7/Ab = Ab–B–D#–F#–E? Wait no — chord is E–G#–B–D# with Ab in bass.

So the bass is Ab — and the chords above are E major 7th.

So now we have: **E major 7th** — which is not diatonic to Gb major or Bb minor.

But E major 7th and Gb major are **tritone apart** (Gb and E are 6 semitones apart).

And earlier we had **B/Bb** — B over Bb.

B and Gb are tritones apart — B = F##, Gb is the same note → yes, B and Gb are enharmonic tritones.

So the whole progression seems to be circling around **tritone substitution** and **chromatic mediants**.

Let me group the chords by function.

Look:

- Bb dim (repeated)
- Gb/Bb → Gb major with Bb bass
- Dbm/Ab → Db minor with Ab bass
- B/Bb → B major with Bb bass
- Emaj7/Ab → E major 7 with Ab bass

**What if the key center is Bb, but we’re using chromatic chords to create tension?**

Bb diminished — could be a "hovering" sound that destabilizes.

Bb diminished = Bb–Db–Fb (E)

Dbm/Ab = Db–Fb–Ab → Fb = E, so Db–E–Ab — which is **Eb minor?** Wait no — Db–Fb–Ab = Db–E–Ab — that’s **Db minor**, since Db minor is Db–Fb–Ab.

Ab bass — Ab is the 6th of Db minor.

B/Bb = B–D#–F# with Bb bass → so superimposition. The bass moves chromatically from Ab to Bb to B — suggesting a chromatic bass line: **Ab – Bb – B**

And Emaj7/Ab = E–G#–B–D# with Ab bass → so Emaj7 over Ab — Ab is the ♭6 of E.

So: chromatic bass: **Bb → Ab → Bb**

So maybe the tonal center is **Bb**, and we’re using **chromatic mediants** (Ab, Db, etc.) as color chords.

In fact, the progression:

- Bb° — Bb°
- Gb (I in Gb, but Bb bass → how is Gb related to Bb?)
- Dbm (v in Gb) with Ab bass
- B major over Bb bass
- Emaj7 over Ab bass
- back to Bb°

Wait — **Gb, Dbm, B, Emaj7** — these are all **three semitones apart** from Bb:

- Bb to Gb = ♭5 or tritone
- Bb to Db = minor 3rd down
- Bb to B = 1 semitone up
- Bb to E = ♯5 or tritone up

But B is only 1 semitone above Bb, so not.

Let’s map it as **chromatic passing**.

Perhaps this is **Bb minor key**, using harmonic minor or melodic minor inflections.

Try **Bb harmonic minor**: Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–A

Then:

- i: Bbm
- iii: Db (major — we have Dbm? No, we have Dbm — minor, which is not diatonic)
- v: Fb (Fb major? But we have Dbm — the v chord should be Fb, not Dbm)

Not working.

Another idea: **Bb %2minor 7th**? We’re in **Bb minor**, and using the **diminished chord on the tonic** as a hover.

This is very common in jazz and modern progressions: **i° chord as tonic substitute** to imply ambiguity.

Then the other chords:

- Gb — is the **♭VI** in Bb minor → Bb minor: Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab

So: ♭VI = Gb → YES!

♭VII = Ab

v = Fb

VI = Gb major is the ♭VI chord — that’s **very common in minor keys** (e.g., “Nothing Else Matters” by Metallica).

So in **Bb minor**:

- i = Bbm
- ♭VI = Gb major
- ♭VII = Ab major
- v = Fb (major) or Fbm
- vii° = A°

But we have:

- Bbdim → this is **not** the i chord, but perhaps a substitution or a **tritone substitution** for the dominant?

In minor keys, sometimes **vii°7 of the relative major** is used — that’s A°7 in Bb minor (relative major = Db major).

But here’s the clincher.

We have **Gb/Bb** → Gb major with Bb in bass. In Bb minor, Gb is ♭VI.

Bb in bass over Gb → this is Gb maj / Bb = **Gb6** or **Gb major with 6th**? Gb major = Gb–Bb–Db → so **Gb/Bb = Bb–Gb–Db** → yes, that’s Gb major in first inversion — standard.

We have **Dbm/Ab** — Db minor with Ab bass → Dbm = Db–Fb–Ab → that’s **Db minor chord**.

In Bb minor, Db minor is the **iii chord** → diatonic!

Because Bb minor scale: Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab → so iii = Db minor → YES!

We have **B/Bb** — B major over Bb.

B = F##, which is enharmonic to Cb.

Cb is the 2nd scale degree of Bb minor.

But B major = B–D#–F# — not in the scale.

So this is a **borrowed** or **chromatic** chord.

We have **Emaj7/Ab** — E major 7 with Ab bass = notes: Ab–E–G#–B–D#

Ab is the ♭VII of Bb minor — diatonic.

E major 7 — E = 4 semitones above Ab? Ab–B–C–D–E = 6 semitones — so E is ♯5 above Ab? Not diatonic.

But E is the **leading tone** of F# — not directly related.

Wait — **E = ♯6 of Bb minor?**

Bb minor: Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab → the 6th is Gb

E is not in scale. But E = ♭6 + 1.5 chromatic? Not clean.

Let’s look at **Emaj7/Ab** — Ab major = Ab–C–Eb

But we have Emaj7/Ab — so the roots are E and Ab — tritone apart.

This is a **tritone substitution** for a dominant chord.

In functional harmony, a dominant 7th chord is often substituted by the chord a tritone away.

What dominant chord would Emaj7/Ab substitute?

Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D# — that’s a major 7th, not dominant 7th.

But if we think of **B7** — dominant 7th of E — then the tritone sub of B7 is F#7.

But we have **E major 7** over Ab — this seems to be a **quartal** or **color chord**.

Perhaps this is not functional tonal music, but **modal with chromatic color**.

Final break: **Bb minute** is the key.

Let’s list chords in Bb minor key context:

| Chord | Function in Bb minor | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Bbdim | ✔ Tonic substitution / chromatic neighbor | Bb–Db–Fb |
| Gb/Bb | ✔ ♭VI (tonicized, 1st inv) | Gb–Bb–Db |
| Dbm/Ab | ✔ iii (minor triad) | Db–Fb–Ab |
| B/Bb | ✘ Chromatic: ♭II? or tritone? | B–D#–F# over Bb — sounds like **Bb into Bb#  or** chromatic passing from Ab to B |
| Emaj7/Ab | ✘ Color chord: Ab (♭VII) + Emaj7 (Augmented 6th idea?) | Possibly an **Italian augmented 6th** in key of Gb? But we’re in Bb minor? Not clear |

Wait — **B/Bb** and **Emaj7/Ab** — both have **#11 or ♭9** quality? Let’s see:

B/Bb: bass Bb, upper B major → B major = B–D#–F#; Bb is ♭9 from B? No — B–Bb is a minor 2nd, not 9th.

But **B and Bb** form a **minor 2nd** — this is a **clash** — typical of a **passing tone** in bass.

Similarly, **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7 = E–G#–B–D#; Ab — A♭ is ♭6, ♭3, ♭1? It’s the bass.

This sounds like a **Neapolitan** or **Augmented 6th** chord? Not really.

Let’s notice this:

**Gb**, **Dbm**, **Emaj7** — all have the **notes Gb, Db, E** — each is 3 semitones apart?

Gb = Gb, Db = Db, E = E — Gb to Db is 6 semitones, Db to E is also 6 semitones. So they form a **symmetrical diminished** pattern.

Gb, Db, E — plus Bb — Bb is 3 semitones below Db → so **Bb, Db, E, Gb**

That’s 4 notes: Bb, Db, E, Gb

Let’s arrange them in semitones:

- Bb
- Db (3 semitones up)
- E (6 semitones up from Bb, 3 from Db)
- Gb (9 semitones from Bb)

So: Bb – Db – E – Gb = an **articulation of a diminished 7th scale**: intervals of 3 semitones

That’s the entire **diminished scale** bastardized.

Bb dim = Bb, Db, Fb

Fb = E

So Bb° = Bb, Db, E — exactly the **three notes of the diminished triad**

Then Gb is a half step above F (from Db–E–Gb: E to Gb is 3 semitones — E–F–F#–Gb)

So Gb is the **next note** in the diminished scale.

So this progression is built on the **whole-half diminished scale** centered on Bb:

**Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–E–F#–G#–A–Bb**

Wait — Bb half-whole dim: Bb Cb Db Eb E F# G# A

We have chords on: Bb, Db, E, Gb — all fit as chord roots in this scale.

So perhaps the key is **Bb minor**, but the harmony is constructed from **the Bb half-whole diminished scale** — allowing all these chromatic chords.

And **B/Bb** = B is **not in the Bb half-whole dim scale** — which has A, but not B.

B is **half step above A**, but our scale has G#–A–Bb — so B is outside.

Hmm.

But **B major over Bb bass** — that sounds like a **tritone adjacency chord** to indicate a secondary function.

Time for the verdict.

---

### 🎯 FINAL DETERMINATION:

The **tonic center** is **Bb**, as it appears in the bass in 14/16 chords, and the diminished chord is Bbdim — a very strong symbolic anchor.

The progression uses **chromaticism**, **tritone substitutions**, and **borrowed chords** from the **Bb minor harmonic** and **diminished scales**.

The **v-chord** Db minor appears, and ♭VI = Gb major — **both diatonic to Bb minor**.

The **B/Bb** and **Emaj7/Ab** are **chromatic color chords**, creating tension and motion.

- B/Bb → can be heard as a **chromatic approach to Bb**, or a deceptive cadence to B major implying a new tonal area
- Emaj7/Ab → Ab is ♭VII in Bb minor, and Emaj7 is the **major 7th chord a tritone away**, possibly implying **F#7#9 or tritone substitute of C7**

But **no dominant** in the sense of F7 or F7.

So even though the harmony is chromatic, the **tonal center is clearly Bb**.

And the **mode** — since we have a **minor third (Db)** and **minor 6th (Gb)** — it’s **minor**, and very likely **Bb natural minor** with the addition of **Gb major (♭VI)** — **very common in minor keys**, and **Bbdim** used as a tonic substitute.

The **Emaj7/Ab** is likely a **"colored" ♭VI** (Ab is ♭VII) or deceptive chromatic passage.

---

## ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: Bb minor**  
> **Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)** with heavy use of chromatic alterations, especially the **♭VI (Gb)** and **♭VII (Ab)** chords, along with **diminished chords** for tension.

**Bbdim functions as a tonic substitute or chromatic neighbor**, and the progression is a **chromatically inflected minor-key vamp**, common in jazz, film scores, or progressive rock.

The presence of **Dbm** (iii), **Gb** (♭VI) confirms the key is **Bb minor** — even if some chords are chromatic for color.

The **Emaj7/Ab** and **B/Bb** are **chromatic color chords** that do not change the key — they are **outside extensions** typical in **mood-based** modern harmony.
