**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are many diminished chords, it might be in a minor key or using some modal interchange. Diminished chords often function as leading tones or passing chords.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb (which is Gb major with Bb in the bass)

- Gb/Bb

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Dbm/Ab (Dbm with Ab in the bass)

- B/Bb (B major with Bb in the bass? That seems odd because B major has B, D#, F#, and Bb is not in that chord. Maybe it's a typo or something else.)

B/Bb might mean B major over Bb bass, which would be a polychord or something. But let's see the context.

Also, Emaj7/Ab is E major 7th with Ab in the bass.

And lots of Bbdim chords.

Bbdim is a diminished chord. Let's recall what notes are in Bbdim. A diminished chord is made of minor thirds, so Bbdim would be Bb, Db, E, G. But in terms of spelling, sometimes it's written as Bdim meaning B-D-F-Ab, but here it's Bbdim, so Bb-Db-E-G? Actually, standard diminished chord is root, minor third, diminished fifth, so for Bb: Bb, Db, E, G? No, diminished fifth from Bb is E? Let's calculate: Bb to Db is minor third, Db to E is minor third? E is actually Fb? This is confusing.

In music theory, a diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth. So for Bb: Bb, Db, Fb. But Fb is enharmonic to E, but in chord symbols, we usually use the correct spelling. So Bbdim triad would be Bb, Db, Fb. But often, diminished chords are seventh chords, so Bbdim7 would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb (which is G). But in chord symbols, "dim" usually implies a diminished seventh chord, which is fully diminished: root, minor third, diminished fifth, diminished seventh. So Bbdim7 would be Bb, Db, Fb, Abb (G).

But in the progression, it's written as Bbdim, which might mean just the diminished triad or the seventh chord? In context, since it's repeated, it might be the seventh chord.

Similarly, Gb/Bb is Gb major chord with Bb bass. Gb major chord is Gb, Bb, Db. So with Bb in bass, it's first inversion? But Bb is the third of Gb, so Gb/Bb is Gb major in first inversion.

Dbm/Ab: Dbm is Db minor chord: Db, Fb, Ab. With Ab in bass, so first inversion.

B/Bb: B major chord is B, D#, F#. With Bb in bass? That doesn't make sense because Bb is not in the B major chord. This might be a mistake, or it might be B minor or something? But it's written as B/Bb. Perhaps it's B major over Bb, which would create a conflict. Maybe it's Bb with B major? I need to think differently.

Emaj7/Ab: Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab in bass? Ab is enharmonic to G#, but Ab is not the same as G# in terms of spelling. So Emaj7/Ab might mean Emaj7 with Ab in bass, but Ab is the same as G#, so it could be Emaj7 in first inversion? But G# is the third of E, so Emaj7/G# would be first inversion, but here it's written as Ab, which is flat, so perhaps it's in a different key.

This seems messy. Let me list all the chords with their possible notes.

First, Bbdim: assuming it's diminished seventh chord, notes: Bb, Db, E (Fb), G (Abb). But to avoid confusion, I'll use enharmonic equivalents where necessary. Since we're dealing with keys, I should think in terms of scale degrees.

Let me consider the key based on the chords.

There are Gb major chords, which is F# major, and Dbm which is C# minor, and Emaj7 which is E major 7th.

Also, B/Bb is puzzling.

Perhaps B/Bb is meant to be Bb major? But it's written as B/Bb. Maybe it's a typo and it's Bb major chord? But why would it be written as B/Bb? In some notations, /Bb means bass note, so B/Bb would be B chord with Bb bass, but B and Bb are a half-step apart, so it might be a chromatic passing chord.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, which is chromatic to E major.

Let me look at the progression in sections.

The progression starts with Bbdim repeated, then Gb/Bb repeated, then Bbdim repeated, then Dbm/Ab, then B/Bb, then Bbdim repeated, then Gb/Bb repeated, then Bbdim repeated, then Emaj7/Ab, then Bbdim.

So Bbdim appears very frequently, suggesting it might be a pivot chord or a common tone diminished chord.

Gb/Bb is Gb major with Bb bass, so effectively, it's a Gb major chord in first inversion.

Dbm/Ab is Dbm minor in first inversion.

B/Bb is confusing.

Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7 with Ab bass, which is enharmonic to G#, so it's Emaj7 in first inversion if we consider G#, but since it's written as Ab, it might be in a flat key.

Now, let's think about what key has Bbdim. Bbdim is a diminished chord that can be derived from several scales.

In major keys, the diminished chord on the leading tone is common. For example, in C major, the leading tone diminished is Bdim: B-D-F-A. But here it's Bbdim, so if Bb is the leading tone, then the key would be B major? But B major has B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#? Leading tone diminished would be A#dim, which is A#, C#, E, G? But A#dim is enharmonic to Bbdim? A#dim would be A#, C#, E, G, and Bbdim would be Bb, Db, E, G? So they are enharmonic if we ignore spelling, but A#dim and Bbdim are the same set of notes: A#/Bb, C#/Db, E, G.

So Bbdim is equivalent to A#dim.

In major keys, the leading tone diminished is based on the seventh scale degree. So if A#dim is the leading tone diminished, then the key would be B major? But let's see the other chords.

We have Gb major, which is F# major, and Dbm which is C# minor, and Emaj7.

B major has chords like B, C#m, D#m, E, F#, G#m, A#dim.

So in B major, A#dim is the diminished chord, which is enharmonic to Bbdim. So that fits.

But we have Gb major, which is F# major, and in B major, F# is the V chord, so F# major is V of B major.

We have Dbm, which is C# minor, and in B major, C#m is the ii chord.

We have Emaj7, which is I chord in E major, but in B major, E is the IV chord? Emaj7 would be IVmaj7 in B major.

And we have B/Bb, which might be a chromatic chord.

But let's see the bass notes. In the progression, we have Gb/Bb, which is F#/A#? In B major, F# major with A# bass? A# is the leading tone, so F#/A# would be V chord with leading tone in bass, which is common.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab is C#m/G#? In B major, C#m is ii, and with G# bass, G# is the sixth scale degree, so ii chord in first inversion.

Then B/Bb: if B is the I chord, but with Bb bass, Bb is not in B major; it's a chromatic note. So perhaps it's a passing tone or a borrowed chord.

Emaj7/Ab is E/Ab, which in B major, E is IV, and Ab is not in the key; Ab is enharmonic to G#, but G# is in B major, so if it's Emaj7/G#, then it's IVmaj7 in first inversion, which is fine. But why written as Ab? Perhaps to emphasize the chromaticism or because of the context.

But in the chord, it's written as Emaj7/Ab, so the bass is Ab, which is G#, but spelled as Ab. This might be in a minor key or with modal mixture.

Another thought: perhaps the key is Gb major or something else.

Let's list the chords in terms of their root and bass.

First, Bbdim: root Bb, bass Bb? Or since it's just Bbdim, bass is probably Bb.

But in the progression, when it's Gb/Bb, bass is Bb, so Bb is a common bass note.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab, bass is Ab.

B/Bb, bass is Bb.

Emaj7/Ab, bass is Ab.

So bass notes are often Bb or Ab.

Bbdim has notes Bb, Db, E (Fb), G. So Bb and Db are common.

Gb/Bb has notes Gb, Bb, Db with bass Bb, so notes Bb, Db, Gb.

Dbm/Ab has notes Db, Fb, Ab with bass Ab, so notes Ab, Db, Fb.

B/Bb has notes B, D#, F# with bass Bb, so notes Bb, B, D#, F#? This is a cluster chord.

Emaj7/Ab has notes E, G#, B, D# with bass Ab, so notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

But Ab and G# are enharmonic, so if we consider Ab as G#, then it's Emaj7/G#.

But in B/Bb, we have B and Bb together, which is a half-step, so it might be a dissonance.

Perhaps B/Bb is meant to be Bb major? But it's written as B/Bb. Maybe it's a typo and it's Bb chord? But Bb chord would be Bb, D, F, which is different from B, D#, F#.

Another idea: perhaps "B/Bb" is a shorthand for Bb7 or something? B over Bb might imply a chord with B and Bb, but that doesn't make sense.

Let's look at the progression: ... Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim ...

Dbm/Ab is Db minor with Ab bass, so chord notes Ab, Db, Fb.

Then B/Bb, if it's B major with Bb bass, then notes Bb, B, D#, F#.

Then Bbdim, notes Bb, Db, E, G.

So from Dbm/Ab to B/Bb, the bass moves from Ab to Bb, which is a whole step, and then to Bb for Bbdim.

The chord notes: from Ab, Db, Fb to Bb, B, D#, F# to Bb, Db, E, G.

There is no obvious connection. Perhaps B/Bb is actually Bb major? But Bb major is Bb, D, F, which would fit better? Let's see.

If B/Bb is Bb major, then notes Bb, D, F.

Then from Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, Fb (which is E) to Bb major: Bb, D, F to Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G.

Now, Fb (E) to D and F to E and G, so some common tones? Fb to D is not common, but Fb is E, so E to D is stepwise, and F to E is stepwise, and Db to Db common? In Dbm/Ab, we have Db and Fb, in Bb major we have Bb, D, F, so Db to D is half-step, Fb to F is half-step? Fb to F is augmented unison? Fb is E, so E to F is half-step? But E to F is half-step, but Fb to F is actually E to F, which is half-step, but in terms of pitch, E to F is half-step, but Fb is lower than F? No, Fb is enharmonic to E, so Fb and E are the same pitch.

So if we have Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, Fb (E) and then Bb major: Bb, D, F, so the notes move: Ab to Bb (whole step), Db to D (half-step), Fb (E) to F (half-step). So it's chromatic movement upwards.

Then to Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G, so from Bb major: Bb common, D to Db (half-step down), F to E (half-step down), and G new. So that makes sense chromatically.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab: if we consider it as Emaj7/G#, then notes G#, E, G#, B, D#? Emaj7 chord is E, G#, B, D#, so with G# bass, it's first inversion, so notes G#, B, D#, E.

But in the progression, it's written as Emaj7/Ab, so bass Ab, which is same as G#.

And before that, we have Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G, and then Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

So notes: from Bb to Ab (half-step), Db to G# (tritone? not direct), E to E common, G to B (third?).

Not very smooth, but possible.

Perhaps the key is E major or something.

Another idea: perhaps the Bbdim is functioning as a common diminished chord in a minor key.

Let's consider the key of Gb major. Gb major has scales Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. Chords: Gb, Abm, Bbm, Cb, Db, Ebm, Fdim.

But we have Bbdim, which is not Fdim? Fdim would be F, Ab, Cb, Dbb? But Bbdim is Bb, Db, Fb, Abb? In Gb major, the diminished chord is on F, which is Fdim: F, Ab, Cb, Dbb? Cb is B, Dbb is C? So Fdim is F, Ab, B, D? But Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G? So not the same.

Bbdim in Gb major would be the ii diminished? But in major key, ii is minor, not diminished.

In minor keys, the ii chord is diminished.

So perhaps the key is Db minor or something.

Db minor has scales: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? Let's use enharmonics.

Db natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb, Ab, Bbb (A), Cb (B)?

But usually, we use harmonic minor, so Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? Bbb is A, and C is B? This is messy.

Db harmonic minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? But Bbb is A, and C is B? No, C is C, and Bbb is A? Let's think in terms of notes.

Db minor: the minor scale based on Db.

Natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? But Bbb is A, and Cb is B? So notes: Db, Eb, E (Fb), Gb, Ab, A (Bbb), B (Cb)? But that has E and B, which are not flats, but in Db minor, we have Fb and Cb, so Fb is E, and Cb is B, so the scale is Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B? But that's not a standard scale because between Eb and E is half-step, and between A and B is whole step, so it's irregular.

In practice, Db harmonic minor would be: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, C? But Bbb is A, and C is C, so notes: Db, Eb, E (Fb), Gb, Ab, A (Bbb), C? So from Ab to A is augmented second, which is characteristic of harmonic minor.

But then the chords: i is Dbm, ii° is Ebdim? But we have Bbdim, which is not in Db minor.

Bbdim would be the diminished chord on Bb? In Db minor, the scale degrees are: 1 Db, 2 Eb, 3 Fb, 4 Gb, 5 Ab, 6 Bbb, 7 C? So chord on 6: Bbb diminished? Bbb dim would be Bbb, Dbb, Fbb? But Bbb is A, Dbb is C, Fbb is Eb? So A dim is A, C, Eb, Gb? But we have Bbdim, which is Bb, Db, E, G? So not the same.

So not Db minor.

Perhaps the key is Ab minor or something.

Let's list all the roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E.

Gb is F#, Db is C#, B is B, E is E.

So roots include Bb, F#, C#, B, E.

Bb and B are close, so perhaps the key is between B and Bb.

Another thought: perhaps the Bbdim is not a chord based on Bb, but rather a passing diminished chord that is the same throughout, meaning it's a common tone diminished chord or a diminished seventh chord that can resolve to multiple keys.

In diminished seventh chords, any note can be the root, and it can resolve to different chords.

For example, Bbdim7 can be seen as Gdim7, Bdim7, Dbdim7, or Edim7 because it's symmetric.

Bbdim7 notes: Bb, Db, E, G.

If we consider E as the root, it would be Edim7: E, G, Bb, Db.

But Edim7 typically resolves to F major or F minor? Or to A minor? etc.

In the progression, we have Gb/Bb, which is Gb major, and Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db, so notes Bb, Db, Gb, which are three notes of Bbdim7? Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G, so if we have Gb major, it has Bb, Db, Gb, so it shares Bb and Db, and Gb is not in Bbdim7, but Bbdim7 has G, which is enharmonic to Gb? G and Gb are not the same; G is a half-step above Gb.

So Bbdim7 has G natural, while Gb major has Gb, so there is a conflict if played together, but in succession, it might be okay.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab, so notes Db, Fb, Ab. Bbdim7 has Db, E, G, Bb. So shared Db, and Fb is E, so E is shared, and Ab is new, Bb is shared? From Bbdim7 to Dbm/Ab, notes Bb, Db, E, G to Ab, Db, E? So Bb to Ab, G to Ab? G to Ab is half-step, so moving.

Then B/Bb: if B major with Bb bass, notes Bb, B, D#, F#. From previous Ab, Db, E to Bb, B, D#, F#. So Ab to Bb, Db to D#? Db to D# is augmented second, E to F#? E to F# is whole step, and new B.

Then to Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G.

So from B/Bb to Bbdim: Bb common, B to Db? B to Db is minor third, D# to E? D# to E is half-step, F# to G? F# to G is half-step.

So some chromatic movement.

Then later Gb/Bb again, then Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab.

From Bbdim to Gb/Bb: Bb, Db, E, G to Bb, Db, Gb? So Bb and Db common, E to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, G to Gb? G to Gb is half-step? But G and Gb are enharmonic? No, G and Gb are different pitches; G is higher than Gb.

So E to Gb is about a minor third, and G to Gb is half-step down, but since the chord changes, it's possible.

Then from Bbdim to Emaj7/Ab: Bb, Db, E, G to Ab, E, G#, B, D#? So E common, Bb to Ab half-step, Db to G# tritone, G to B major third.

So not very smooth.

Perhaps the Bbdim is acting as a secondary diminished chord.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is E major.

In E major, the chords are: E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim.

We have Emaj7, which is I.

We have Gb/Bb, but Gb is F#? Gb is enharmonic to F#, so Gb major is F# major, which is II in E major? But in E major, II is F# minor, not major. So Gb major is not diatonic to E major.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab is C#m/G#? C#m is iii in E major, so with G# bass, it's first inversion, so that fits.

B/Bb: if B is V in E major, but with Bb bass, Bb is not in E major, so it's chromatic.

Bbdim: in E major, the diminished chord is D#dim, which is D#, F#, A, C? But Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G, which is not D#dim. D#dim is D#, F#, A, C, so notes D#, F#, A, C. Bbdim is Bb, Db, E, G. So if we compare, D#dim has D# F# A C, Bbdim has Bb Db E G. So they are different unless we respell Bb as A#, but A#dim would be A# C# E G? Still not D#dim.

So Bbdim is not the diatonic diminished chord in E major.

Perhaps Bbdim is a secondary diminished chord resolving to Gb? But Gb is F#, which is II in E major, but II is minor, not major.

Another idea: perhaps the Gb/Bb is not Gb major, but rather Gb with Bb bass, but in context, it might be a different chord.

Let's look at the bass line. The bass notes from the chords: when Bbdim, bass Bb? Assume bass is root unless specified.

So from the progression:

- Bbdim: bass Bb

- Bbdim: bass Bb

- Gb/Bb: bass Bb

- Gb/Bb: bass Bb

- Bbdim: bass Bb

- Bbdim: bass Bb

- Dbm/Ab: bass Ab

- B/Bb: bass Bb

- Bbdim: bass Bb

- Bbdim: bass Bb

- Gb/Bb: bass Bb

- Gb/Bb: bass Bb

- Bbdim: bass Bb

- Bbdim: bass Bb

- Emaj7/Ab: bass Ab

- Bbdim: bass Bb

So the bass is mostly Bb, with two points where it goes to Ab: once after Dbm/Ab and once before Emaj7/Ab.

So bass emphasis on Bb, with Ab as passing or resolution.

Now, the chords over Bb bass are: Bbdim, Gb/Bb, B/Bb? B/Bb has bass Bb, but chord B major.

So when bass is Bb, the chords are Bbdim, Gb/Bb, or B/Bb.

Bbdim has notes Bb, Db, E, G

Gb/Bb has notes Bb, Db, Gb

B/Bb has notes Bb, B, D#, F#

So over Bb bass, we have different harmonies.

When bass is Ab, we have Dbm/Ab which is Ab, Db, Fb and Emaj7/Ab which is Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

Now, let's consider the key based on the bass note Bb. If bass is Bb, it could be the root of Bb major or Bb minor.

But the chords over Bb are not always Bb chord.

Bbdim is not a tonic chord usually.

Gb/Bb is Gb major over Bb, which is similar to Bb minor with major third? Gb major has Bb, which is the third of Gb, but over Bb bass, it might imply Bb7? But Gb major chord is Gb, Bb, Db, so over Bb bass, it's Bb with Gb and Db, which is Bb7? Bb7 chord is Bb, D, F, Ab? No, Bb7 is Bb, D, F, Ab. But here we have Bb, Gb, Db, which is Bb, Db, Gb, so that's Bb diminished? No, Bb diminished has Db, E, G, but here Gb instead of G, so Bb, Db, Gb is not a standard chord. Bb, Db, Gb is Bb diminished with flattened seventh? Let's see intervals: from Bb to Db is minor third, Db to Gb is perfect fourth? So it's not a triad because Gb is not a third from Db? Db to F would be minor third, but Db to Gb is fourth, so it's a suspended sound? Or it could be Gb major in first inversion, so it's a Gb chord with Bb bass, so the chord is Gb major, not Bb chord.

So over Bb bass, we have Gb major chord, which means the harmony is Gb major, but the bass is Bb, so it's first inversion of Gb major.

Similarly, when we have B/Bb, over Bb bass, we have B major chord, so it's B major with Bb bass, which is a polychord or slash chord indicating a specific voicing.

So for analysis, we should consider the chord itself rather than the bass for harmonic function, but the bass does affect the inversion.

So let's list the chords based on their root and quality:

- Bbdim (root Bb, diminished seventh)

- Gb major (root Gb, major triad)

- Dbm (root Db, minor triad)

- B major (root B, major triad)

- Emaj7 (root E, major seventh chord)

And all except Bbdim are major or minor triads, with Emaj7 as major seventh.

Now, Bbdim appears frequently, so it might be a common diminished chord used as a passing chord or as a substitute for dominant.

Notice that Gb major and B major are both present, and they are tritone apart? Gb and B are tritone apart.

In fact, Gb major chord is Gb, Bb, Db and B major chord is B, D#, F#, so they share no common tones.

But in the progression, they are both played over Bb bass? No, Gb/Bb has bass Bb, but B/Bb has bass Bb, so when B/Bb is played, the chord is B major, but the bass is Bb, so the overall sound is B major over Bb, which creates a dissonance because B and Bb are minor ninth apart.

So this might be a chromatic effect.

Perhaps in context, B/Bb is meant to be Bb7#9 or something? Bb7#9 chord is Bb, D, F, Ab, C#? But here we have B major chord, which is B, D#, F#, so if over Bb bass, it would be Bb, B, D#, F#, which is similar to Bb7#9 if D# is Eb? Bb7#9 is Bb, D, F, Ab, C#. So notes Bb, D, F, Ab, C#. But in B/Bb, we have Bb, B, D#, F#. So if we consider B as the #9, but B is natural, and #9 should be C# for Bb7, so B is not C#; B is the major seventh? But Bb7 has dominant seventh, so seventh is Ab, but here we have F# which is not Ab, and D# which is not D.

So not Bb7#9.

Another possibility: B/Bb might be a notation for B minor over Bb? But it's written as B/Bb, which typically means B major chord with Bb bass.

Perhaps it's a typo and it's Bb/B, but that would be Bb major with B bass, which is similar.

But let's assume that B/Bb is B major with Bb bass for now.

Now, let's consider the overall progression.

The progression has Bbdim repeated, then Gb/Bb repeated, then Bbdim repeated, then Dbm/Ab, then B/Bb, then Bbdim repeated, then Gb/Bb repeated, then Bbdim repeated, then Emaj7/Ab, then Bbdim.

So it seems like Bbdim is used as a separator or transition between other chords.

The other chords are Gb/Bb, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Emaj7/Ab.

Notice that Gb/Bb and Emaj7/Ab have bass Bb and Ab respectively, but Gb/Bb is first inversion, Emaj7/Ab is first inversion if we consider Ab as G#.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab is first inversion.

So all these chords are in first inversion: Gb major first inversion, Dbm first inversion, Emaj7 first inversion? But Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, and Ab is enharmonic to G#, so yes, Emaj7 first inversion.

And B/Bb is B major with Bb bass, which is not first inversion; first inversion of B major would be B/D#? So B/Bb is not a standard inversion; it's a different bass.

So perhaps B/Bb is an exception.

Now, let's list the roots of these chords: Gb, Db, B, E.

If we consider the keys, Gb, Db, B, E are all related? Gb is F#, Db is C#, so F#, C#, B, E. These are all notes from the whole tone scale or something? F#, C#, B, E – let's see intervals: F# to C# is fifth, C# to B is minor seventh, B to E is fourth, so not symmetric.

Perhaps they are from a pentatonic scale or something.

Another thought: perhaps the key is Bb minor or major.

In Bb minor, the chords include Bbm, Cdim, Db major, Eb minor, F minor, Gb major, Ab major? Let's see Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Chords: i Bbm, ii° Cdim, III Db major, iv Ebm, v Fm, VI Gb major, VII Ab major.

So in Bb minor, we have Gb major which is VI, and Dbm? Db major is III, but here we have Dbm, which is minor, so not III. So if Dbm, it would be borrowed from parallel major? In Bb major, the iii chord is Dm, but here Db minor, so not.

In Bb major, chords: Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F, Gm, Adim.

So Gb major is not diatonic; it's bVI from parallel minor.

Similarly, Emaj7 is not diatonic.

So perhaps there is modal mixture from Bb minor and Bb major.

But we have B major chord, which is not related to Bb.

B major is chromatic to Bb.

Let's consider the diminished chord. Bbdim7 can be used as a dominant substitute or as a common tone diminished.

Notice that Bbdim7 shares notes with G7? G7 is G, B, D, F? Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? So shared G? But Bb and Db are not in G7.

Bbdim7 is the same as Gdim7? Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E? Yes! Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E, which is the same as Bbdim7 since diminished seventh chords are symmetric. So Bbdim7 = Gdim7 = Bdim7 = Dbdim7 = Edim7? Let's see: Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G

Gdim7: G, Bb, Db, E — same notes.

Bdim7: B, D, F, Ab — different notes.

Dbdim7: Db, E, G, Bb — same as Bbdim7.

Edim7: E, G, Bb, Db — same as Bbdim7.

So Bbdim7 is equivalent to Gdim7, Dbdim7, and Edim7.

So in the progression, Bbdim can be interpreted as any of these diminished chords.

Now, let's see how it connects to the other chords.

We have Gb/Bb: Gb major chord. Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db.

Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G.

So if we consider Bbdim7 as Gdim7, then Gdim7 resolves to Gb major? Gdim7 to Gb major? Gdim7 has G, Bb, Db, E and Gb major has Gb, Bb, Db, so shared Bb and Db, and G to Gb is half-step, E to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, but not typical resolution.

Typically, diminished seventh chords resolve to a chord that has the note a half-step above one of the notes of the diminished chord.

For example, if Bbdim7 resolves to A major or A minor, then Bb moves to A, Db moves to C, E moves to F, G moves to F# or G? But here it resolves to Gb major, so Bb to Bb? Db to Db? E to Gb? G to Gb? So E to Gb is not half-step; E to F is half-step, so E to Gb is whole step? E to F is half-step, E to Gb is augmented second? So not typical.

If Bbdim7 resolves to Bb major, then Bb to Bb, Db to D? But Db to D is half-step, E to F? But E is not in Bb major, so E would need to move to F, which is half-step, and G to G? But G is not in Bb major, so G to F or G to G? So if Bb major, notes Bb, D, F, so Db to D half-step, E to F half-step, G to F half-step? But G to F is whole step? G to F is major second? So not smooth.

Similarly, if Bbdim7 resolves to Gb major, as in the progression, then Bb to Bb, Db to Db, E to Gb? E to Gb is minor third, G to Gb? G to Gb is half-step? But G to Gb is half-step down, so if G resolves to Gb, that's half-step, but usually diminished chords resolve with leading tone movement, so notes should move up by half-step to the tonic notes.

So for Gb major, the tonic notes are Gb, Bb, Db. So if Bbdim7 resolves to Gb major, then we want notes to move to Gb, Bb, Db. So from Bb, Db, E, G, we have Bb to Bb? No change, Db to Db? No change, E to Gb? E to Gb is not half-step; E to F is half-step, so E should move to F, but Gb is F#? So E to F# is whole step, not half-step. G to Gb? G to Gb is half-step down, but usually leading tones move up, so G should move to Ab? But Ab is not in Gb major.

So not typical resolution.

Perhaps Bbdim7 is not resolving to Gb major, but rather Gb major is appearing over the same bass, so it's a change of harmony over sustained bass.

Similarly, when we have B/Bb, over Bb bass, we have B major chord, so perhaps the Bbdim is acting as a passing chord between these harmonies.

Let's list the harmonic rhythm over the bass Bb.

When bass is Bb, the chords are: Bbdim, then Gb/Bb, then Bbdim, then B/Bb, then Bbdim, then Gb/Bb, then Bbdim.

So the harmony over Bb changes from Bbdim to Gb major to Bbdim to B major to Bbdim to Gb major to Bbdim.

So Bbdim seems to be the default harmony over Bb, and it alternates with Gb major and B major.

Then when bass moves to Ab, we have Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab.

Dbm/Ab is Db minor over Ab bass, so first inversion of Db minor.

Emaj7/Ab is E major seventh over Ab bass, so first inversion of E major seventh.

Now, Db minor and E major are not closely related.

Db minor has key signature of 6 flats? Db minor is relative to Fb major? But let's use enharmonics.

Db minor is the same as C# minor, which has 4 sharps.

E major has 4 sharps.

So both have 4 sharps? C# minor has 4 sharps, E major has 4 sharps, so they are related? C# minor is the relative minor of E major? Yes! C# minor is the relative minor of E major.

So Dbm is enharmonic to C#m? Db minor and C# minor are the same key? In theory, C# minor and Db minor are enharmonic, but in practice, C# minor is used with sharps, Db minor with flats, but they sound the same.

So Dbm is C#m.

And Emaj7 is the I chord of E major.

So in the progression, when bass is Ab, we have Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab.

But Dbm/Ab is C#m/G#? because Ab is enharmonic to G#.

So C#m/G# is the first inversion of C#m, which is the relative minor of E major.

And Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7/G#? which is first inversion of Emaj7.

So in the context of E major, C#m is the vi chord, and Emaj7 is the I chord.

So over Ab bass (which is G#), we have C#m and Emaj7, both in first inversion, which is common in E major.

So this suggests that the key might be E major.

Now, what about the chords over Bb bass? In E major, Bb is not diatonic. Bb is the flattened fifth? E major has B natural as V chord.

But here we have Bb bass, and harmonies Bbdim, Gb major, B major.

B major is the V chord in E major, so if we have B major chord, but with Bb bass, that is unusual because the bass should be B for V chord, but here it's Bb, so it's like V chord with flattened root? Or it could be a passing tone.

Gb major is not diatonic in E major; Gb is F#, and in E major, F# is the ii chord, but ii is minor, not major. So Gb major is II major, which is not diatonic.

Bbdim is not diatonic.

So over Bb bass, we have non-diatonic chords relative to E major.

But since the bass Bb is persistent, it might be that the key is actually E major, but with a pedal point on Bb? But Bb is not in E major; it's chromatic.

In E major, the notes are E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So Bb is not present; Bb is A#? A# is not in the scale; the seventh is D#.

So Bb is a foreign note.

Perhaps the key is E minor? But Emaj7 suggests major tonic.

Another idea: perhaps the Bb bass is a sustained note, and the harmonies are changing, and the key is E major, but with chromaticism from the relative minor.

But let's see the progression towards the end: after Bbdim, we have Emaj7/Ab, which is Emaj7 with G# bass, so in E major, this is a common chord.

And then finally Bbdim, which might be a passing chord to something else.

Perhaps the Bbdim is acting as a substitute for the dominant of E major? The dominant of E major is B major, but Bbdim is not B major.

Bbdim7 can be used as a substitute for B7? B7 is B, D#, F#, A. Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G. So no common tones.

But if we consider Bbdim7 as G#dim7? G#dim7 is G#, B, D, F? But Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G, which is not G#dim7.

G#dim7 would be G#, B, D, F, so notes G#, B, D, F.

Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G.

So if we want G#dim7, it would be G#, B, D, F, which is different from Bbdim7.

So Bbdim7 is not the leading tone diminished of E major.

The leading tone diminished of E major is D#dim7: D#, F#, A, C.

So not Bbdim7.

Therefore, Bbdim7 is not directly related to E major.

But from the chords on Ab bass, we have C#m and Emaj7, which are from E major, so perhaps the key is E major, and the Bb bass section is a prolonged chromatic passage.

Perhaps the Bbdim is actually functioning as an altered dominant in E major.

Let's consider the notes in Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G.

In E major, E is the tonic, so having E in the chord might make it sound like a tonic expansion, but Bb and Db are foreign.

If we think of Bbdim7 as an augmented sixth chord? Augmented sixth chords resolve to the dominant.

In E major, the augmented sixth chord could be on C? For example, Italian augmented sixth: C, E, G#? But here we have Bb, Db, E, G.

If we spell Bb as A#, then A# dim7? A# dim7 is A#, C#, E, G? But we have Db instead of C#? So if we spell it as A#, C#, E, G, then it's A#dim7, which is the leading tone diminished of B major? But in E major, if we want to resolve to B major, A#dim7 could be used as vii°7 of B, so it resolves to B major.

In E major, the dominant is B major, so vii°7 of B is A#dim7, which resolves to B major.

And A#dim7 is enharmonic to Bbdim7? A#dim7 is A#, C#, E, G? and Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? So if we consider A#dim7, then C# is Db? So yes, A#dim7 and Bbdim7 are the same if we ignore spelling.

So Bbdim7 can be interpreted as A#dim7, which is the leading tone diminished chord of B major.

And in E major, B major is the dominant chord.

So in the progression, when we have Bbdim, it can be seen as A#dim7, which resolves to B major.

And in the progression, after some Bbdim, we have B/Bb, which is B major with Bb bass? But if Bbdim is A#dim7, it should resolve to B major, but here the resolution is to B major, but with Bb bass, so the bass is A# instead of B? So it's like the diminished chord resolving to the dominant, but the bass stays on A# instead of moving to B? That would be a deferred resolution or something.

But in traditional resolution, the leading tone should rise to the tonic, so A# should rise to B. But here, when chord changes to B major, the bass is still Bb (A#), so the bass note doesn't resolve upwards; it stays the same, but the chord changes from diminished to major, so the dissonance is resolved, but the bass remains, so it might be acceptable in modern music.

Similarly, when we have Gb/Bb, what is Gb major? In E major, Gb is F#, and if F# major, it could be the II chord, but II is usually minor, so major II might be from Lydian mode or something.

But let's see the context.

In the progression, after Bbdim to B/Bb, we have Bbdim again, so it doesn't stay on B major.

Then later, after Gb/Bb and Bbdim, we have Emaj7/Ab, which is I chord in E major.

So perhaps the overall key is E major.

And the Bb bass section is using the diminished chord as A#dim7 to lead to B major, but with bass pedal, and also using Gb major as a chromatic chord.

Gb major can be seen as the neapolitan chord in E major? The neapolitan chord in E major would be F major, but here Gb is F#, so F# major would be II, not neapolitan. Neapolitan is bII, which in E major would be F major, not F#.

So Gb is not neapolitan.

Another possibility: Gb major might be a substitute for the dominant? Gb major is tritone from B major, so it could be a tritone substitute for B7? But B7 is dominant, and tritone substitute would be F7? But Gb is F#? Tritone substitute of B7 is F7, since B and F are tritone apart. But F7 is F, A, C, Eb, and Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db, so not the same.

Gb major could be the relative major of Db minor, but we have Db minor in the progression.

Let's list the chords in relation to E major.

- Bbdim = A#dim7 = vii°7 of B

- Gb/Bb = F# major with A# bass? But F# major is not diatonic; it could be V/vi or something? In E major, V/vi would be B major, not F#.

F# major could be II from Lydian, but let's see.

- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# = vi in first inversion

- B/Bb = B major with A# bass? So B major with leading tone in bass? So it's V chord with leading tone in bass, which is common in first inversion? But first inversion of B major is B/D#, not B/A#. So it's not standard.

- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# = I in first inversion

So from this, the chords Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab are clearly in E major.

The chord B/Bb can be seen as B major with A# bass, which might be used for voice leading, where the A# is held from the previous A#dim7? So from A#dim7 to B major, if the bass holds A#, then it becomes B/A#, which is a dissonance, but if the other voices resolve, it might be okay.

Similarly, Gb/Bb might be F# major with A# bass, which is also dissonant because A# is not in F# major; F# major has F#, A#, C#? So A# is the third, so if bass is A#, it's first inversion, so F#/A# is first inversion of F# major, which is fine. But in E major, F# major is not diatonic, so it might be a borrowed chord from E minor? In E minor, the natural minor has F# minor, but harmonic minor has F# diminished? So not F# major.

Perhaps F# major is the V of B minor? But B minor is not established.

Another idea: perhaps the Gb/Bb is actually a misspelling of something else.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is B major.

In B major, we have:
- Bbdim = A#dim7 = vii°7 of B, so it resolves to B major. So that fits.
- Gb/Bb = F# major with A# bass? In B major, F# major is V chord, so V chord with leading tone in bass? So F#/A# is V in first inversion, which is common.
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G#? In B major, C#m is ii chord, so ii in first inversion, which is common.
- B/Bb = B major with A# bass? So I chord with leading tone in bass? That is unusual, but possible if the leading tone is sustained.
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G#? In B major, E major is IV chord, so IVmaj7 in first inversion, which is common.

So in B major, all chords can be explained:
- Bbdim = A#dim7 = vii°7 of B
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# = V in first inversion
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# = ii in first inversion
- B/Bb = B/A# = I with leading tone in bass? But I with leading tone bass is not standard, but since it follows vii°7, it might be that the bass doesn't resolve.
- Emaj7/Ab = E/G# = IV in first inversion

So the progression in B major would be: vii°7, V6, vii°7, ii6, I64? But I with A# bass is not I64; I64 would be B/E? So here B/A# is not a standard inversion.

In traditional harmony, I64 is usually with fifth in bass, but here bass is A# which is the leading tone, so it would be I with leading tone in bass, which is rare.

But in popular music, it might be used.

Moreover, the progression ends with Emaj7/Ab which is IV in first inversion, and then Bbdim, which is vii°7, so it might loop back to B major.

So this seems plausible.

In the progression, we have multiple Bbdim, which are vii°7, and it alternates with V6 and ii6 and I with unusual bass.

So the key is likely B major.

And the mode is major.

So for the question "Determine key and mode", I would say key of B major.

But let's confirm the chords in B major.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#

Chords:
- I: B major
- ii: C# minor
- iii: D# minor
- IV: E major
- V: F# major
- vi: G# minor
- vii°: A# diminished

Now, in the progression:
- Bbdim = A# diminished? A# diminished is A#, C#, E, G? But A# diminished should be A#, C#, E, G? But in terms of spelling, A# dim should have A#, C#, E, G? But G is not G#? So A# dim7 is A#, C#, E, G? But in B major, the vii°7 should be A#, C#, E, G#? No, in major key, the vii°7 is based on the leading tone, and it is a fully diminished seventh chord, so it should have minor third, diminished fifth, and diminished seventh from the root.

So from A#: minor third is C#, diminished fifth is E, diminished seventh is G? But G is not G#? diminished seventh from A# is G natural? Let's calculate: A# to C# is minor third, C# to E is minor third, E to G is minor third, so A# dim7 is A#, C#, E, G.

But in B major, the seventh scale degree is A#, and the diminished seventh chord should have A#, C#, E, G? But G is not in the B major scale; B major scale has G#. So why is it G natural?

In traditional harmony, the vii°7 chord in major keys uses the diminished seventh interval from the root, which is a minor third above the fifth, so for A# dim7, the seventh is G natural, which is the subtonic? But in B major, the seventh note is A#, so the chord should use notes from the scale? In major keys, the vii°7 chord is made from the scale degrees 7, 2, 4, 6? In B major, scale degrees: 7=A#, 2=C#, 4=E, 6=G#? So vii°7 should be A#, C#, E, G#? But that is not a diminished seventh chord because A# to G# is a major seventh? Let's see intervals: from A# to C# is minor third, from C# to E is minor third, from E to G# is minor third? E to G# is major third? No, E to G# is major third? E to G is minor third, E to G# is major third.

So for a diminished seventh chord, we need minor thirds throughout. So from A#, minor third to C#, minor third to E, minor third to G? So A#, C#, E, G.

But in the major scale, the seventh chord on scale degree 7 is a half-diminished chord? Let's clarify.

In major keys, the seventh chord on the leading tone is a diminished triad with a minor seventh? No, in major keys, the vii chord is a diminished triad, and if we add a seventh, it becomes a half-diminished seventh chord? Let's recall.

In major scale, the chords are:
- I maj7
- ii min7
- iii min7
- IV maj7
- V dom7
- vi min7
- vii half-dim7

So on scale degree 7, the chord is a half-diminished seventh chord, which is a diminished triad with minor seventh? No, half-diminished seventh chord is a minor seventh chord with flattened fifth? Let's define.

A half-diminished seventh chord is: root, minor third, diminished fifth, minor seventh.

So for vii in major key: root is scale degree 7, minor third is scale degree 2, diminished fifth is scale degree 4, minor seventh is scale degree 6.

In B major: scale degree 7=A#, 2=C#, 4=E, 6=G#. So vii half-dim7 is A#, C#, E, G#. And this chord has minor third A#-C#, diminished fifth A#-E? A# to E is diminished fifth? A# to E is a fifth? A# to E is 6 half-steps? A# to F is 6 half-steps? A# to E is 5 half-steps? Let's calculate: A# to B is 1, B to C is 2, C to C# is 3, C# to D is 4, D to D# is 5, D# to E is 6? So A# to E is 6 half-steps, which is a diminished fifth? Perfect fifth from A# would be E#? So A# to E is diminished fifth, yes. And minor seventh from A# is G#? A# to G# is 10 half-steps? A# to A is 11 half-steps? A# to G# is 10 half-steps, which is a minor seventh? Yes, because major seventh would be A# to A##? So A# to G# is minor seventh.

So vii half-dim7 in B major is A#, C#, E, G#.

But in the progression, we have Bbdim, which is Bb, Db, E, G. If we enharmonically equate, Bb = A#, Db = C#, E = E, G = G? But G is not G#; G is G natural, which is half-step below G#.

So Bbdim7 is A#, C#, E, G, which is not the half-diminished seventh of B major; it is fully diminished seventh chord? But in major key, the diatonic chord is half-diminished, not fully diminished.

So for Bbdim7 to be the vii°7 of B major, it would need to be fully diminished, but diatonic vii is half-diminished.

However, in practice, often the fully diminished seventh chord is used as a secondary dominant or as a chromatic chord.

So in this case, Bbdim7 is being used as a fully diminished seventh chord on A#, which is not diatonic to B major, but it is commonly used as the leading tone diminished chord in minor keys or as a secondary diminished.

In B major, if we use A# fully diminished seventh, it would be A#, C#, E, G, and it resolves to B major, with A# rising to B, C# rising to D? But in B major, the B chord has B, D#, F#, so C# should rise to D#? But C# to D# is whole step, not half-step. So for proper resolution, in a fully diminished seventh chord, each note should resolve by half-step to the notes of the tonic chord.

For A#dim7 resolving to B major: A# to B (half-step), C# to D#? but C# to D# is whole step, so not ideal. E to D#? E to D# is half-step? E to D# is half-step down? But usually leading tones rise, so E should rise to F? But B major has F#? So E to F# is whole step. G to F#? G to F# is half-step? So if we have A#dim7: A#->B, C#->? if we want half-step, C# should go to C? but B major has C#? So not possible to have all notes resolve by half-step to B major notes.

Typically, a fully diminished seventh chord resolves to a chord with a root a half-step above one of the notes. For example, A#dim7 resolves to B minor or B major? But for B major, the notes are B, D#, F#, so from A#dim7: A#->B, C#->D#? but C# to D# is whole step, so it doesn't resolve smoothly. So often, fully diminished seventh chords are used as secondary chords or for chromatic movement.

In this progression, since we have B/Bb, which is B major with A# bass, it might be that the A# is not resolving, so it's acceptable.

So for practical purposes, we can consider the key as B major.

Thus, key: B major

Mode: major

So for the answer, I'll go with B major.

The chord progression features Bbdim chords, which can be enharmonically interpreted as A#dim7, functioning as the leading tone diminished seventh chord in B major. The other chords—Gb/Bb (F#/A#), Dbm/Ab (C#m/G#), B/Bb (B/A#), and Emaj7/Ab (E/G#)—align with diatonic chords in B major when considering their inversions and enharmonic equivalents:

- Gb/Bb is F#/A#, the V chord (F# major) in first inversion.
- Dbm/Ab is C#m/G#, the ii chord (C# minor) in first inversion.
- B/Bb is B/A#, the I chord (B major) with the leading tone (A#) in the bass, creating a chromatic effect.
- Emaj7/Ab is E/G#, the IV chord (E major) in first inversion.

The persistent use of Bbdim (A#dim7) as a leading tone chord reinforces the key of B major, despite some chromaticism and non-standard bass movements. The mode is major, as indicated by the presence of major chords (B, E, F#) and the overall harmonic context.

**Key:** B major  
**Mode:** Major
