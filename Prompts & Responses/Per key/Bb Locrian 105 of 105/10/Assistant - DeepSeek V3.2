Let’s break this down step by step.

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:

1. **Bbdim**  
2. **Bbdim**  
3. **Gb/Bb**  
4. **Gb/Bb**  
5. **Bbdim**  
6. **Bbdim**  
7. **Dbm/Ab**  
8. **B/Bb**  
9. **Bbdim**  
10. **Bbdim**  
11. **Gb/Bb**  
12. **Gb/Bb**  
13. **Bbdim**  
14. **Bbdim**  
15. **Emaj7/Ab**  
16. **Bbdim**

---

## **2. Simplify chord names**

- **Bbdim** = Bb diminished triad (Bb Db E) or Bb°7 (Bb Db E G) — likely full diminished 7th chord Bb°7 = Bb Db E G.
- **Gb/Bb** = Gb major with Bb in bass → Gb (Gb Bb Db) / Bb. So it’s first inversion.
- **Dbm/Ab** = Dbm (Db E Gb) with Ab in bass → second inversion of Dbm.
- **B/Bb** = B major (B D# F#) with Bb in bass → a polychord or slash chord, B major over Bb bass. That’s a very dissonant sound.
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 (E G# B D#) with Ab in bass. Ab is the same as G#, so this is actually Emaj7 in first inversion (Emaj7/G#), not Ab bass unless they’re treating Ab and G# as enharmonically different for some reason — but in equal temperament, they’re the same pitch. So this is just **Emaj7/G#**.

---

## **3. Look for a tonal center**

Bbdim is symmetrical: Bb°7 = Bb Db E G.  
Diminished 7th chords can function in multiple keys.  
Bbdim7 occurs in:

- C harmonic minor (as vii°7)
- C# harmonic minor (as vii°7)
- E harmonic minor (as vii°7)
- G harmonic minor (as vii°7)

Also, in major keys:  
Bbdim7 = vii°7 of C major? No, C major’s vii° is Bdim7 (B D F Ab). So not that.  
Actually, in major keys, the vii°7 is from harmonic minor usage, so let's check:  
Bbdim7 notes: Bb Db E G.  
If we respell E as Fb and G as Abb — too messy. Let’s respell enharmonically:  
Bbdim7 = Bb Db E G = same as A#dim7? A# C# E G — but that’s not standard either. Let's find possible keys:

Bbdim7 = leading-tone diminished 7th of B major or B minor?  
vii°7 of Cb major? Cb major scale: Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb — no, Bbdim7 has E natural, not Eb. So not Cb major.

Better approach: Bbdim7 belongs to **C harmonic minor** (Bdim7 would be B D F Ab — no, that’s not Bbdim7). Let’s map:

Bbdim7 notes: Bb Db E G.  
If we raise Bb to B natural? No. Let’s find a scale containing all these notes:

Whole-half scale: Bb Cb Db D E F# G A Bb — that’s the diminished scale. But in terms of traditional function:

Bbdim7 is vii°7 of C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B C — B is B natural? No, B natural is in C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B C.  
B°7 = B D F Ab — not Bbdim7. So not C harmonic minor.

Let’s try: Bbdim7 = same as Gdim7? G Bb Db E — yes, same notes. So it’s symmetric; any of its notes can be the root.

So functionally, Bbdim7 could be vii°7 of Cb major? No, Cb major’s vii°7 is A diminished (A C Eb Gb) — enharmonic to Bbdim7? Let’s check: A°7 = A C Eb Gb. Bb°7 = Bb Db E G. Are they same? Compare:  
A°7: A C Eb Gb  
Bbdim7: Bb Db E G  
Eb vs E — different. So not same.

So Bbdim7 is a unique set: Bb Db E G.  
Possible harmonic minor:  
Db harmonic minor: Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bbb C Db — Bbb = A, not Bb. No.  
E harmonic minor: E F# G A B C D# E — chord: D#°7 = D# F# A C = enharmonic to Eb°7? No, Bbdim7 is Bb Db E G. Compare D#°7: D# F# A C. Bb= A#? Yes, A# Cx E# G#? Too messy. Let’s match:  
D#°7 = D# F# A C  
Bbdim7 = Bb Db E G  
If D# = Eb, then Eb°7 = Eb Gb A C — not same as Bbdim7.

So maybe it’s from **Ab harmonic minor**: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G Ab — G is in Bbdim7? Bbdim7 has G natural, Ab harmonic minor has G natural? Yes: Fb = E natural, G natural? Ab harmonic minor: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G Ab — yes, G natural. So Bb Db E G all in Ab harmonic minor: Bb=scale degree 2, Db=4, E=Fb=6, G=7. So Bbdim7 is not the vii°7 (which would be G°7 = G Bb Db E — wait, that’s exactly Bbdim7! Yes! G°7 = G Bb Db E = same notes as Bbdim7. So Bbdim7 is G°7, which is vii°7 of Ab harmonic minor.

So **Bbdim7 = vii°7 of Ab (harmonic) minor**.

## **4. Check other chords in Ab minor**

Ab natural minor: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb  
Ab harmonic minor: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G  

Gb major (Gb Bb Db) is the bVI in Ab minor (natural minor).  
Dbm (Db E Gb) is iv in Ab natural minor.  
Emaj7/Ab (E G# B D# / Ab) — E major is totally foreign to Ab minor — it’s V of A minor or something. Enharmonically, E G# B D# with Ab bass = Ab + E major = Abm(maj7#11) kind of sound? Or maybe it’s a borrowed chord from elsewhere — possibly a tritone substitution of V of Ab? In Ab minor, V is Eb major. Tritone sub of Eb is A major, not E major. E major would be tritone sub of Bb7 (V of Eb). Hmm.

But B/Bb (B D# F# / Bb) is also very outside — maybe these are chromatic passing chords.

## **5. Consider overall key**

The most stable key suggested by Gb major and Dbm and Bbdim7 function is **Ab minor** (natural/harmonic).  
Gb is bVI, Dbm is iv, Bbdim7 is vii°7 from harmonic minor.

The E major and B major chords might be borrowed from Ab minor’s parallel major (Ab major) — but E major isn’t in Ab major either. They could be applied dominants or just non-functional color chords.

Given the prevalence of Bbdim7 and Gb major, and Dbm, the key is most likely **Ab minor**.

Mode: **Natural/Harmonic minor mixture** (since Gb is from natural minor, Bbdim7 from harmonic minor).

---

## **6. Conclusion**

**Key:** **Ab minor**  
**Mode:** Natural minor with harmonic minor elements (especially the diminished chord).

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Ab\ minor}
\]
