Let's analyze the chord progression:

```
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim
```

---

### Step 1: Understand the chords

We'll interpret each chord in its most straightforward form:

#### 1. **Bbdim** = B♭ diminished = B♭–D♭–F♭ (or E)
- This is a half-diminished or fully diminished triad. Context suggests **fully diminished** (B♭–D♭–F♭)

#### 2. **Gb/Bb** = Gb major triad with Bb in bass
- Gb major = G♭–B♭–D♭
- So Gb/Bb = B♭–D♭–G♭ — this is **inverted Gb major**, but bass note is B♭
- This is **not** a Gb7 or anything else — just Gb major with B♭ in the bass

#### 3. **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor with Ab in bass
- Db minor = D♭–F♭–A♭
- So Dbm/Ab = A♭–D♭–F♭ — bass note is Ab

#### 4. **B/Bb** = B major with Bb in bass
- B major = B–D♯–F♯
- So B/Bb = B♭–B–D♯–F♯ — this is an **extremely unusual** voicing.
- This looks like a **chromatic bass movement** — B♭ moving to B — likely a **passing chord** or **chromatic bass line** effect.

#### 5. **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 with Ab in bass
- Emaj7 = E–G♯–B–D♯
- Emaj7/Ab = A♭–E–G♯–B–D♯ — this is a clash-heavy chord (Ab and G# are enharmonic, but functionally different)

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal center — What key are we in?

Let’s look at the **notes** involved:

Chords use notes from:

- **B♭dim**: B♭, D♭, F♭ (E)
- **Gb major**: G♭, B♭, D♭
- **Dbm**: D♭, F♭, A♭
- **B major**: B, D♯, F♯
- **Emaj7**: E, G♯, B, D♯

So we’re seeing:

- B♭, D♭, F♭ (E)
- G♭, D♭, B♭
- A♭
- B, D♯, F♯
- E, G♯, D♯

That’s a **huge chromatic spread** — B♭, G♭, D♭, A♭ (flat side) + B, D♯, F♯, E, G♯ (sharp side)

This suggests **no traditional diatonic key**. Instead, it’s likely **chromatic/segmental**, possibly **tonal center = B♭**, with chromatic passing and modal mixture.

But let’s test **B♭ minor** as a possible tonal center.

### Step 3: Is it in B♭ minor?

B♭ minor scale:  
**B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭**

Now look at the chords:

- **B♭dim** — fits (B♭–D♭–F♭) → vii° chord in B♭ minor?  
  In B♭ minor, vii° = A♭–C–E♭ (not B♭dim).  
  B♭dim = B♭–D♭–F♭ — this is actually the **i° chord** if we consider a diminished tonic (rare).

Wait — what if we think in **B♭ Phrygian?**

B♭ Phrygian:  
**B♭ – C♭ – D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭**  
= same as B♭ minor with ♭2 (C♭ instead of C)

Still, we have **Gb major**, which is not in B♭ minor or Phrygian.

But **Gb = F#** — so Gb major = **F# major**, which is the **♯V** in B♭ minor.

So:  
- B♭ minor tonic  
- Gb (F#) major = ♯V  
- Dbm = ♭III  
- Emaj7 = ♯VI (if we think of E = ♯6 in B♭ minor) — E is note #6 in B♭ minor?  
  B♭ minor = B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭  
  So: 6th degree = G♭. E is **not** in B♭ minor — it’s **♯6**, which would be a borrowed tone.

This suggests we're in **B♭ minor**, borrowing **♯V (Gb)** and **♯VI (E)** from parallel major or harmonic minor.

Indeed:

### B♭ natural minor:  
B♭ – C♭ – D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭

### B♭ harmonic minor:  
B♭ – C♭ – D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – **A** → BUT we don’t have A, we have **E and G♯**

Wait — **Emaj7** contains **G♯**, which is **♯5** of B♭?  
B♭ → G♯ is a **diminished 6th** — not a standard scale tone.

Alternatively...

### Think of this as a **B♭ harmonic minor** with chromatic embellishments:

B♭ harmonic minor:  
**B♭ – C♭ – D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A**

Still no G♯ or E.

But if we think **E major** (which is G♯ major) as a **tritone substitution**?

E major = G♯ major = tritone from B♭?  
B♭ to E is a **tritone**!  
Yes: B♭–E is 3 whole tones = 6 semitones = tritone.

So **Emaj7/Ab** may be a **tritone substitution** for a dominant chord leading to B♭.

Let’s try this interpretation:

---

### 🔑 **Hypothesis: Tonal Center = B♭ minor, with extensive chromaticism and tritone substitutions**

Let’s re-frame the progression with functional interpretation:

1. **Bbdim** – tonic diminished? Or ii° in minor? Actually, in B♭ minor, vii° is A♭dim, so maybe this is **B♭dim** as a **rooted chromatic pedal**?  
   Perhaps this is just a **pendulum** between B♭dim and Gb.

2. **Gb/Bb** — Gb is tritone away from **C**, not B♭.  
   Wait — Gb is **tritone** from **C**, but **B♭ to Gb** is also a tritone!  
   So Gb major is **tritone substitute** for **C dominant** (G7 would normally resolve to C, but substitute with Gb7 → C).  
   But we’re in B♭.

**B♭ and Gb** are a tritone apart → **tritone substitution relationship**

So Gb major is a substitute for **C# major** or **Db major**? No — it’s being used as a **substitute** for the dominant **of B♭**?

Let’s test:

What’s the dominant of B♭? → F7

Tritone substitution of F7 is **B7** (because F–B is a tritone)

But here we have **Gb**, which is **same as F#** → so F#7 is tritone substitute for B7? No…

Wait: the tritone substitution for **F7** is **B7**

But our chord is Gb — which is enharmonic to F#.

F# major triad = F#–A#–C#  
F7 = F–A–C–E♭

Tr tone: A–E♭ → if we substitute with a chord whose 3rd and 7th are tritone of those → so tritone of A and E♭ is **E and B** → B7 = B–D♯–F♯–A

So tritone substitution of F7 is **B7**

So why are we seeing **Gb major**?

Gb major = G♭–B♭–D♭ — that’s same as F♯ major = F♯–A♯–C♯?  
No — F♯ major is **F♯, A♯, C♯**  
Gb major is **G♭, B♭, D♭**

So they are **different chords** — even though Gb is enharmonic to F#, their **notes and functions differ** unless we’re en-harmonically respelling.

But B♭–G♭ is a tritone! So if B♭ is tonic, then G♭ is the **tritone substitution of the dominant** (F7).

But G♭ major is not a dominant 7 chord — it’s just major triad.

Wait — here's a breakthrough:

In jazz and modern harmony, **you can substitute a dominant 7 chord with a major triad a tritone away**, even without the 7th.

So:  
- Dominant chord to B♭ = **F7**  
- Tritone sub = **B7**  
- **But G♭** is enharmonic to **F#** — which is B’s sub? No.

Wait — tritone of F is C# — so F7 tritone sub = C#7

B♭ tritone = E

So **what is the tritone of B♭?** → E

So if tonic is **B♭**, then the tritone sub of the **dominant** F would be **B7**

But we see **Gb major**, not B.

Unless…

What if **Gb** is being used **not** as tritone sub for F7, but as **substitute for the i chord**?

B♭dim + Gb/Bb — that’s B♭dim being followed by Gb major over B♭ bass…

Let's map the **bass notes**:

Bass line:

1. B♭  
2. B♭  
3. B♭ (Gb/Bb means bass is B♭)  
4. B♭  
5. B♭  
6. B♭  
7. A♭ (Dbm/Ab)  
8. B♭ (B/Bb) → yes, bass is B♭  
9. B♭  
10. B♭  
11. B♭  
12. B♭  
13. B♭  
14. B♭  
15. A♭ (Emaj7/Ab)  
16. B♭

So the **bass line** is mostly **B♭**, with **A♭** appearing twice — and one **B** (chromatic passing tone) in bar 8: **B/Bb** → bass moves from A♭ → B♭ → (B on bass is just a passing note, likely chromatic neighbor)

**Bass** is mostly:  
**B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — A♭ — B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — B♭ — A♭ — B♭**

So:  
- Strong **B♭** pedal  
- **A♭** (submediant) pops up twice  
- Chromatic passing tone **B** on bass — very brief

So the **key center is strongly B♭**

Now the chords:

- B♭dim → could be tonic diminished (rare, but in jazz/serialism, tonic can be diminished)
- Gb/Bb — Gb major triad over B♭ bass → this forms the **Gb, B♭, D♭** → this is **B♭7** without the 3rd and 7th? B♭7 = B♭–D–F–A♭ — no.

Actually: **Gb/Bb = B♭–D♭–G♭**

That’s the notes of **B♭ diminished** with an extra G♭?  
B♭dim = B♭–D♭–F♭  
We have B♭–D♭–G♭ → so replacing F♭ with G♭ — that’s **enharmonic change**, but G♭ is the **♭5** of B♭? No.

Wait — **B♭–D♭–G♭** is also the notes of:

➡️ **F# major 7 sus**? No.

Actually, this chord **B♭–D♭–G♭** = is **G♭ major triad in 1st inversion** — so it's just **Gb major**.

But if we stack it with B♭ bass: **B♭-D♭-G♭**

This is the **same as D♭ minor 7 flat 5**?  
D♭m7♭5 = D♭–F♭–A♭–C♭ — no.

Let’s try:  
**B♭–D♭–G♭** → this chord is **B♭ half-diminished 7th without the 7th?**  
Bm7♭5 = B–D–F–A — not matching.

Wait — another way:  
**B♭–D♭–G♭** = **G♭7** without 3rd and 7th? G♭7 = G♭–B♭–D♭–F♭ → ah! Wait — **Gb major triad is G♭–B♭–D♭**

**So Gb/Bb = B♭–D♭–G♭ = Gb major triad** — so we’re hearing Gb major triad in root position? Since bass is B♭, and Gb triad is G♭–B♭–D♭ → so the chord is **Gb major triad with 3rd in bass**?  
Wait: Gb major triad = G♭–B♭–D♭

So if bass is B♭ — that’s the 3rd — this is **Gb major in 1st inversion** = **Gb/B♭**

So that’s correct.

So we're playing **Gb major triad** with bass on 3rd — so it sounds like **B♭–D♭–G♭**

Now — what is **B♭–D♭–G♭**?  
It’s a **tritone** between B♭ and G♭ — this is a very unstable, tense chord.

This is often used as **a diminished harmony**.

But **B♭–D♭–G♭** = **diminished 7th chord missing one note** — because B♭dim7 = B♭–D♭–F♭–A♭ — so this is **B♭–D♭–G♭**, which is **B♭dim7 but with ♯5**? G♭ is ♯5 of B♭?  
B♭ to G♭ = diminished 6th — same as augmented 5th? B♭ to G = perfect 5th → G♭ = ♭5 — so:

**B♭ with ♭5 = B♭dim** — but we're adding G♭, which is the **♭5** — so B♭–D♭–G♭ is a **B♭ diminished triad with the 5th?** Wait, the 5th of B♭dim is F♭ — but we have G♭ instead.

G♭ = **F♯**, which is **♯11** from B♭? Not really.

This is getting messy.

Let’s try a **modern jazz analysis**, assuming this is a **tonic = B♭** progression with chromatic passing chords.

Famous pattern: **Tonic → tritone sub → tonic**

B♭dim — Gb/Bb — B♭dim — Gb/Bb — etc.

Then suddenly: **Dbm/Ab** — which is **Ab–D♭–F♭**

= A♭ minor triad (D♭m = D♭–F♭–A♭ → invert to Ab bass = Ab–D♭–F♭)

Now — Ab is the **♭VI** of B♭ minor → very common in minor keys.

Then **B/Bb** — **B major over B♭** bass → this is **B–D♯–F♯** over B♭ → so B♭–B–D♯–F♯ → **B♭ B D♯ F♯**

This is a **chromatic bass motion**: A♭ → B♭ → B → back to B♭

And then **Emaj7/Ab** = Ab–E–G♯–B–D♯

This adds **E, G♯, D♯, B** — the notes of **E major 7**

So E major 7 over Ab = **Ab–E–G♯–B–D♯**

This is **E major 7 with Ab bass**

What is that chord? It’s **Ab – B – D♯ – G♯ – E**

That’s equivalent to **B7#5#9**? Possibly — but more likely it’s a **slash chord used for linear bass motion**.

Notice: **Ab** → **B♭** (bass moves up half step)

Also: The E major 7 contains **G♯ and D♯** → which are **sharp 6th and sharp 2nd** in B♭? **G♯ = ♯6, D♯ = ♯2**

So this is **highly chromatic, modal interchange**.

### ✅ Final Analysis & Answer:

#### 🔑 **Key**: **B♭ minor**

#### 📌 **Mode**: **B♭ minor (Aeolian)** with **heavy chromaticism**, **modal mixture**, and **tritone substitutions**

### Why?

- Tonal center is **B♭** — all chords revolve around it
- Bass is almost entirely **B♭**, with **A♭** (♭VI) and **B** (chromatic passing tone) as accents
- **B♭dim** = tonic diminished chord — used as a static pedal
- **Gb/Bb** = tritone sub of **dominant chord of B♭** (which is **F7**) — Gb is tritone from F → so Gb triad functions as a substitute dominant
- **Dbm/Ab** = ♭III chord in B♭ minor → common in minor keys
- **B/Bb** = chromatic passing bass (half-step above tonic) — no harmonic function, just motion
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 over Ab — Emaj7 = ♯6 chord in B♭ minor — it’s a borrowed chord from **B♭ major**? No, E major is enharmonically distant. But in function: **it contains G♯**, which is the **leading tone to A**, and **A is the ♭7 of B♭** → this suggests a **cadence to A**, but we return to B♭

So overall:  
> This is a **chromatic, jazz-influenced progression in B♭ minor**, using tritone substitutions and passing chords to create tension and unresolved motion. It’s **not diatonic** — it leans heavily on **borrowed chords** and **bass motion** as the organizing principle.

### 💡 Final Answer:

> **Key: B♭ minor (Aeolian)**  
> **Mode: B♭ Aeolian with chromatic embellishments and modal mixture**

The progression uses **B♭ minor** as the tonal center, with chromaticism and tritone substitutions (especially Gb/Bb acting as a dominant substitute), creating a dark, tense, jazz-modern harmonic flavor. The **Emaj7/Ab** and **B/Bb** are chromatic passing devices, not diatonic, reinforcing the **minor mode** as home.
