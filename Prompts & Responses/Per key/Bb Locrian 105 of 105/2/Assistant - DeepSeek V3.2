Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:

1. **Bbdim**  
2. **Bbdim**  
3. **Gb/Bb**  
4. **Gb/Bb**  
5. **Bbdim**  
6. **Bbdim**  
7. **Dbm/Ab**  
8. **B/Bb**  
9. **Bbdim**  
10. **Bbdim**  
11. **Gb/Bb**  
12. **Gb/Bb**  
13. **Bbdim**  
14. **Bbdim**  
15. **Emaj7/Ab**  
16. **Bbdim**

---

## **2. Simplify chord names**

- **Bbdim** = Bb diminished triad (B♭ D♭ E) or Bbdim7 (B♭ D♭ E G) — likely functioning as a vii° or common-tone diminished.
- **Gb/Bb** = G♭ major with B♭ in bass → G♭ (G♭ B♭ D♭) / B♭. That’s first inversion.
- **Dbm/Ab** = D♭ minor (D♭ F♭(E) A♭) with A♭ in bass → second inversion.
- **B/Bb** = B major (B D♯ F♯) with B♭ in bass — a polychord, but could be analyzed as a B major triad over B♭ bass, creating a B♭7#9#5 or B♭7alt sound if rearranged: B♭ + B major = B♭ D♭(C♯) F♯ A♭(G♯) — enharmonically B♭7#9#5.
- **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7th (E G♯ B D♯) with A♭ in bass. A♭ = G♯, so this is actually Emaj7 in first inversion (E G♯ B D♯ / G♯).

---

## **3. Look for a tonal center**

The progression is mostly **Bbdim** and **Gb/Bb** alternating, with a few unusual chords in between.

Bbdim could be vii° of Cb major (B major enharmonic) or could be a common-tone diminished of B♭ minor/major.  
But Gb major is the bVI of B♭ minor.

Let’s check B♭ minor (B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭):  
- G♭ major = bVI  
- Bbdim = vii° of Cb major (not in B♭ minor naturally — B♭ minor’s vii° is A dim (A C E♭)), so Bbdim is **not** diatonic to B♭ minor.  
Bbdim = B♭ D♭ E (F♭) G — that’s like a B♭°7, which could be a common-tone diminished of B♭ major/minor, or could be functioning as G°7 (since G°7 = G B♭ D♭ E), which is vii°7 of A♭ minor.

But G°7 = Bbdim7 enharmonically (B♭ D♭ E G).  
G°7 → A♭m. But we don’t see A♭m chords here.

---

## **4. Check Gb major key**

Gb major scale: G♭ A♭ B♭ C♭(B) D♭ E♭ F  
Bbdim7 is not in Gb major — the vii°7 in Gb major is Fdim7 (F A♭ C♭ E♭♭(D♭)) — no.

---

## **5. Diminished chord as passing / voice-leading**

Bbdim7 shares notes with:  
- Gdim7 (G B♭ D♭ E)  
- E dim7 (E G B♭ D♭)  
- C#dim7 (C♯ E G B♭)  
All are the same set enharmonically: B♭ D♭ E G.

This is a common-tone diminished of B♭, or could resolve to B♭m, G♭, etc.

Look at the progression:  
Bbdim → Gb/Bb is common in B♭ minor (Bbdim as chromatic approach chord from B♭m).  
But here B♭m never appears.

---

## **6. Check the odd chords**

Dbm/Ab = D♭ F♭ A♭ / A♭ — so D♭ minor chord.  
Key? Dbm is ii in Cb major, or iv in A♭ minor.

B/Bb — that’s very chromatic. B = B D♯ F♯, plus B♭ in bass = B♭ + B major.  
If we combine: B♭ + B D♯ F♯ → B♭ D♯(E♭) F♯ — that’s B♭ E♭ F♯ — not a simple tertian chord, but could be B♭7#9#5 (B♭ D F♯ A♭ C♯(D♭)) — yes: B♭ D F♯ A♭ D♯(E♭) — actually B♭7alt.

Emaj7/Ab = E G♯ B D♯ / G♯ — so E major 7th in first inversion.

---

## **7. Possible key: E major / C# minor**

If Emaj7/Ab is actually in first inversion and feels like a tonic, maybe the key is E major.

In E major:  
- Bbdim7 is not diatonic. But Bbdim7 = C#dim7 enharmonically (C♯ E G B♭) — but B♭ is not in E major (B♭ = A♯ in E major? No, A♯ is not in E major scale). So Bbdim7 is foreign.

But Bbdim7 could be G#dim7 (G♯ B D F) if we respell? No, that’s different set.

Actually, Bbdim7 = D♭dim7? Let’s check: D♭dim7 = D♭ E G B♭ — yes! That’s the same as Bbdim7 (B♭ D♭ E G).  
So Bbdim7 = C#dim7 = Edim7 = Gdim7 — all same notes enharmonically.

In E major, vii°7 is D♯dim7 (D♯ F♯ A C) — different.

So Bbdim7 is not the vii° of E major.

---

## **8. Try C# minor**

C# minor harmonic: C♯ D♯ E F♯ G♯ A B♯(C)  
B♭ is not in C# minor.

---

## **9. Look at Gb/Bb as bVI in B♭ minor**

B♭ minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭  
Gb = bVI  
Dbm = ii° (D♭ F♭ A♭) — yes, Dbm is the supertonic triad in Cb major (B major), but in B♭ minor it’s borrowed? No, Dbm is not in B♭ minor (B♭ minor’s ii is Cdim).

So Dbm is from B♭ Phrygian (B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭) — yes! Dbm is the ii in B♭ Phrygian.

B/Bb — in B♭ Phrygian, B natural is ♯4 — that’s Lydian #2? No, B is ♯4 relative to B♭ Phrygian’s E♭ — so B/Bb is like a tritone sub? Possibly V of ?  
Emaj7/Ab — E G♯ B D♯ / G♯ — in B♭ Phrygian, E is ♯4, G♯ is ♯6, B is ♯1 — very chromatic.

---

## **10. Likely conclusion**

The recurring Bbdim and Gb/Bb suggest **B♭ Phrygian** (B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭) as the main mode:  
- Gb major = bVI in B♭ minor, but here it’s just VI in B♭ Phrygian (since G♭ is in the scale).  
- Dbm is diatonic to B♭ Phrygian (ii chord).  
- Bbdim is not in the scale but acts as a common-tone diminished of B♭.  
- B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab are non-diatonic chromatic chords.

Given the strong emphasis on B♭ and G♭, and the Phrygian ii chord (Dbm), the key is:

**B♭ Phrygian** (mode of G♭ major, but tonal center B♭).

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{Bb\ \text{Phrygian}}
\]
