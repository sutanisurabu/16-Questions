To determine the key and mode of the given chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**
Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Dbm/Ab – B/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Gb/Bb – Gb/Bb – Bbdim – Bbdim – Emaj7/Ab – Bbdim

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Chords

Let’s rewrite the chords using enharmonic equivalents where helpful and identify their notes:

1. **Bbdim** = Bb – Db – E – G (fully diminished 7th: Bb°7 = Bb–Db–E–G)
2. **Gb/Bb** = Gb major (Gb–Bb–Db) over Bb → notes: Bb, Db, Gb
3. **Dbm/Ab** = Db minor (Db–E–Ab) over Ab → notes: Ab, Db, E
4. **B/Bb** = B major (B–D#–F#) over Bb → notes: Bb, B, D#, F#
   - This is a highly dissonant polychord or slash chord—more on this later.
5. **Emaj7/Ab** = E major 7 (E–G#–B–D#) over Ab → notes: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

---

### Step 2: Look for a Tonal Center

The **Bbdim chord appears very frequently**—almost every other chord—suggesting it may function as a **passing chord** or a **structural harmony**.

In classical and jazz harmony, **diminished chords often function as dominant substitutes** or **leading-tone chords**. A diminished chord built on the **root of the key** is rare unless in a modal or atonal context.

But note: **Bbdim7 = Bb–Db–E–G**  
This is **enharmonically equivalent to**:
- **E°7** (E–G–Bb–Db)
- **G°7** (G–Bb–Db–E)
- **Db°7** (Db–E–G–Bb)

These are all **inversions of the same fully diminished 7th chord**.

This chord is **symmetrical** (stacked minor thirds), so it can function as a dominant to **four different keys**:
- E°7 → resolves to F
- G°7 → resolves to Ab
- Bb°7 → resolves to B (or Cb)
- Db°7 → resolves to E

But in our progression, it **doesn't clearly resolve** to any of these. Instead, it’s **repeated** and interwoven with chords like **Gb**, **Dbm**, and **Emaj7/Ab**.

---

### Step 3: Consider Possible Keys

Let’s look at the **most stable-sounding chords**:

- **Gb major** appears several times → Gb, Bb, Db
- **Db minor** → Db, E (enharmonic Fb), Ab
- **Emaj7** → E, G#, B, D#

Now, notice that **Gb major and Db minor** both belong to the key of **Gb major** or its relative minor **Eb minor**.

But **Emaj7** is **foreign** to Gb major (which has Bbb, not G#). However, **Emaj7/G#** is the **V of Ab major** (E7 is dominant of A, but Emaj7 is unusual).

But **Emaj7/Ab** uses **Ab as bass**, and includes **G#**—which is **enharmonic to Ab**. Wait: G# = Ab, so we have **Ab in bass + G# in chord** → **extreme dissonance (minor 2nd)**.

This suggests **chromaticism** or **polytonality**.

---

### Step 4: Reinterpret Emaj7/Ab

Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D#  
Bass = Ab

But **G# = Ab**, so the chord has **Ab (bass) and G# (chord)** → same pitch class, just spelled differently → **not dissonant** if we accept enharmonic equivalence.

So **Emaj7/Ab = Ab in bass, chord = E–Ab–B–D#**

Now, consider **what key has E, Ab, B, D#?**

- This looks like **E major chord over Ab** → possibly a **tritone substitution** or a **modal interchange**.

Alternatively, consider that **Emaj7** is the **Napolitan chord in D major/minor?** No.

But note: **Emaj7 is the bIII chord in C# minor**, or **VI in G# minor**, but that seems unrelated.

---

### Step 5: Look at the Bass Line

Bass notes (from slash chords and roots):
- Bb (Bbdim)
- Bb (Gb/Bb)
- Ab (Dbm/Ab)
- Bb (B/Bb)
- Ab (Emaj7/Ab)

So bass moves: **Bb – Bb – Ab – Bb – Ab – Bb**

Suggests **alternation between Bb and Ab**, possibly implying **Ab as tonic**?

If **Ab is tonic**, then:
- **Gb major** = **bVII chord** in Ab major/minor
- **Db minor** = **iv chord** in Ab major (but Db minor is diatonic to Ab **minor**, not major)
- **Bbdim** = could be **ii° chord in Ab minor** (Bb–Db–E = Bb°, which is vii° of Cb, but in Ab natural minor: Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F–G → no E natural)

But **Bbdim contains E natural**, which is **not in Ab natural minor** (which has Eb, not E).

However, **Ab harmonic minor** = Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F–G#  
→ Still no **E natural**.

**Ab melodic minor (ascending)** = Ab–Bb–Cb–Db–Eb–F–G  
→ Still no E.

So **E natural is foreign to Ab minor/major**.

But recall: **Bbdim = E°7**, which is **vii°7 of F**.

If the key were **F minor**, then:
- F harmonic minor = F–G–Ab–Bb–C–Db–E
- E°7 = E–G–Bb–Db → **vii°7 of F minor** → very common!

Now check other chords:
- **Gb/Bb** → Gb = **bII chord in F minor** (Neapolitan!) → Gb major is classic N6 in F minor
- **Dbm/Ab** → Db minor = **iv chord in F minor** → yes! (F minor: F–G–Ab–Bb–C–Db–E)
- **B/Bb** → B major over Bb → B = **V of E**, but in F minor, **B major = V of vi (D major)**? Not obvious. However, **B = E#**, and **E is leading tone**, so maybe **B = augmented sixth?**

Wait: **B major = B–D#–F#**
In F minor, **D# = Eb (enharmonic)**, **F# = Gb**

So B major = B–Eb–Gb → which is **German augmented sixth chord in F minor!**

German +6 in F minor: Ab–B–Eb–Gb → resolves to C (V)

But here it's **B/Bb**, so bass = Bb, chord = B–D#–F# → still contains augmented 6th interval (Ab to F#) if Ab is in context.

But maybe **B/Bb is a misnotation**, or used for color.

Finally, **Emaj7/Ab**:
- Emaj7 = E–G#–B–D#
- In F minor, **E = leading tone**, **G# = raised 6th (from harmonic minor)**, **D# = raised 7th? No, 7th is E. D# is major 7th of E.**
- But **Emaj7 is not diatonic to F minor**. However, **E7 (dominant)** is common. **Emaj7** is less common but can appear as **V7 with major 7th** (lydian dominant?) or via **modal interchange**.

But note: **Emaj7/Ab** = bass Ab, chord E–G#–B–D#
- In F minor, Ab is **b3**, so this could be a **polychord**: Ab minor (Ab–Cb–Eb) + Emaj7 → but Cb and G# clash.

Alternatively, consider **Emaj7 as bIIImaj7 in C minor?** Not helping.

But here's a key insight:

> The **recurring Bbdim chord is E°7**, which strongly **implies F minor** as tonic.

Other chords support this:
- **Gb = Neapolitan (bII) in F minor**
- **Dbm = iv in F minor**
- **B = Ger+6 (enharmonic)** in F minor
- **Emaj7** = unusual, but E is the **leading tone**, and **Emaj7 could be a chromatic embellishment** of the dominant function (E°7 → Emaj7 as altered V?)

Thus, **F minor** is the most plausible key.

### Step 6: Determine Mode

Since we’re in **F minor**, and using:
- Natural minor (Ab, Bb, Db)
- Harmonic minor (E natural)
- Neapolitan (Gb)
- Possibly melodic minor (D natural? Not seen)

This is **tonal minor** (F minor), not a strict mode like Dorian or Phrygian.

But if forced to assign a **mode**, it's **Aeolian (natural minor)** with **harmonic/melodic minor alterations**—standard in tonal minor keys.

However, the **prominent use of diminished and chromatic chords** suggests **F minor (tonic)** with **chromatic harmony**, not a diatonic mode.

---

### Final Answer:

**Key: F minor**  
**Mode: Minor (Aeolian with harmonic/melodic inflections)**

The progression centers around **F minor**, using its **leading-tone diminished chord (E°7 = Bbdim)**, **Neapolitan (Gb)**, **subdominant minor (Dbm)**, and chromatic embellishments (Emaj7/Ab, B/Bb). The frequent Bbdim functions as the **vii°7 of F minor**, reinforcing F as tonic.
