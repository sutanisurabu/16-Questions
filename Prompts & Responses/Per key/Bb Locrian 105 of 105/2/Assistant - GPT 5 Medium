### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequence**

I’m working through a chord sequence: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim." It seems like I'm looking at Roman numerals.

Bbdim appears to be a leading-tone chord related to the key. Gb/Bb suggests a G-flat major chord with Bb in the bass, indicating first inversion. This aligns with Db major as IV6. I think Bbdim serves as a leading-tone triad to Cb.**Clarifying chord relationships**

I'm realizing that in Db major, Bbdim is not diatonic since Bbdim would be the vii° of Cb. Looking at the Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, I check the chords: I is Db, ii is Ebm, iii is Fm, IV is Gb, V is Ab, vi is Bbm, and vii° is Cdim. 

Bbdim has notes Bb, Db, and Fb (which is E natural), but E natural doesn't fit into the Db major scale with 5 flats. It looks like Bbdim is chromatic, so I wonder if Gb major is the key?**Examining chord functions**

I'm analyzing several chords in Gb major: I is Gb, ii is Abm, iii is Bbm, IV is Cb, V is Db, vi is Ebm, and vii° is Fdim. I notice that Bbdim built on Bb is not diatonic to this scale since ii is actually Ab minor. The chord B/Bb represents B major over Bb in the bass, which also feels non-diatonic. 

Then I look closely at Dbm/Ab, a Db minor chord over Ab in the bass, which aligns with a borrowed V minor. I also note Emaj7/Ab, featuring a major 7 chord over Ab. Overall, the bass notes primarily revolve around Bb and Ab.**Exploring key centers**

I'm thinking the key center might be around Ab, especially since the bass alternates between Bb and Ab. I also wonder if the chord sequence operates in B major or G# minor. The Emaj7/Ab chord gives an interesting perspective since it's a major 7 over Ab, which can relate to the key of C# minor.

When I look at Gb/Bb, it could enhance my view if I interpret this as F#/Bb, which feels unusual. I’m considering whether Bbdim acts as a tonic substitute in Bb Locrian since it’s the home chord here. The repeat of Bbdim hints at a tonic role, aligning with the Bb Locrian scale.**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing chord functions and considering Dbm/Ab, which is enharmonically C#m/G#. B/Bb could represent I over flat 7, hinting at a chromatic approach. The presence of Emaj7/Ab suggests we're in B major, as IVmaj7 matches with Ab as the bass note. 

However, I notice the chords could also fit G# minor. Bbdim (A#dim) serves as a crucial chord indicating tonic context. The repetition of Bbdim, along with heavy use of first-inversion F# chords, suggests we might have a dominant function leading to a tonic. 

While elements of both B major and G# minor match, the overall structure leans towards B major. I think the piece is in B major (Ionian), given that most chords align with this key. Still, I’ll consider the alternative of Ab minor (Aeolian) due to the repeating motifs. It's a close call, but B major seems more probable based on the context!**Finalizing key and mode identification**

I’ve determined that the diatonic chords in B major are B, C#m (or Dbm), D#m, E, F#, G#m, and A#dim. Since we have chords like Bbdim (A#dim), Gb (F#), Dbm (C#m), and Emaj7, it confirms that everything fits within the B major framework.

This means the key is B major, and the mode is Ionian (major). The presence of Emaj7/Ab suggests it functions as IV6 in B major. My concise answer could be: "Key: B major; Mode: Ionian." I could mention the relative minor, G# Aeolian, but B major seems to be the primary focus.

B major (Ionian).

Notes:
- Bbdim = A#dim (vii° in B)
- Gb/Bb = F#/A# (V6)
- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# (ii6/4)
- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# (IVmaj7/3)
- B/Bb = I with a chromatic bass passing tone

All are diatonic/enharmonic to B major; the relative minor would be G# Aeolian.
