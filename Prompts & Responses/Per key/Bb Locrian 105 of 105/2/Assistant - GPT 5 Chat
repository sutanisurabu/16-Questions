Let's take a close look at the chords youâ€™ve listed:

**Progression:**
```
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Dbm/Ab  B/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Gb/Bb  Gb/Bb  
Bbdim  Bbdim  Emaj7/Ab  Bbdim
```

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center candidates
We see frequent appearance of **Bbdim**, used as a kind of drone or pivot chord.

Other chords:
- **Gb/Bb (Gb major with Bb in the bass)**
- **Dbm/Ab (Db minor with Ab in the bass)**
- **B/Bb (B major with Bb in the bass)**
- **Emaj7/Ab (E major 7 with Ab in the bass)**

Thereâ€™s a lot of flat (â™­) usage â€” Gb, Db, Bb â€” which suggests a **flat key region**, possibly something around **Gb major** or **Db major**, or their relative minors (Eb minor / Bb minor).

### Step 2: Examine relationships

| Chord        | Spelling         | Notes                            |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Bbdim**     | Bbâ€“Dbâ€“E (a.k.a. Fb enharmonically) | Functions as viiÂ° of Cb major / Gb major |
| **Gb/Bb**     | Bbâ€“Dbâ€“Gb         | First inversion of Gb major chord |
| **Dbm/Ab**    | Abâ€“Dbâ€“Fb (E)     | First inversion of Db minor chord |
| **B/Bb**      | Bbâ€“Bâ€“D#â€“F# (?) â€” quite unusual enharmonically; likely chromatic passing tone or tension chord |
| **Emaj7/Ab**  | Abâ€“Bâ€“Eâ€“G# (enharmonically Abâ€“Câ™­â€“Eâ€“G#) â€” could be an **Abm7(b5)** reinterpreted |

### Step 3: Functional hints

**Bbdim â†’ Gb/Bb**  
- In **Gb major**, Bbdim is **viiÂ°/I** (leading-tone chord), and Gb is **I**.  
This is a very classical resolution: viiÂ° â†’ I.

**Dbm/Ab** in relation to Gb major:
- In Gb major, Db is the dominant (V). Dbm would then be a **borrowed chord from the parallel minor (Gb minor)** â€” a modal mixture.  
Dbm/Ab (first inversion) gives a smooth chromatic bass descent (Bb â†’ Ab).  

**Emaj7/Ab**: relative to Gb major, this chord introduces G#, B, E â€” enharmonically: Ab, Cb, Fbâ™­, E â€” quite chromatic, but could function as a color chord leading back to Bbdim.

### Step 4: Check for a plausible key center
The strong gravitational pull here is **Gb major**, due to:
- repeated **Bbdim â†’ Gb/Bb** motion (viiÂ° â†’ I).
- use of **Dbm** as a borrowed iv chord.

---

âœ… **Most likely key:** **Gb major**

**Mode:** **Ionian (major)**, with **modal mixture** (borrowed iv chord â†’ Dbm/Ab).

### Step 5: Summary

| Element | Function (in Gb major) |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Bbdim | viiÂ° of Gb |
| Gb/Bb | I (in first inversion) |
| Dbm/Ab | iv (borrowed from parallel minor) |
| B/Bb | chromatic/non-diatonic color/passing chord |
| Emaj7/Ab | potentially a chromatic subdominant color chord |

### ðŸŽµ **Final answer:**
**Key:** Gb major  
**Mode:** Ionian (major) with modal mixture (borrowed iv from Gb minor)
