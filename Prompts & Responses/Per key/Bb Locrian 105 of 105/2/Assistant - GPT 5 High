### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequences**

I’m determining the key and mode from this chord sequence: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim."

Starting with Bbdim, I see it as a diminished triad made up of Bb, Db, and E (or Fb). Then there's Gb/Bb, which is a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass—a first inversion. As for Dbm/Ab, I’m recalling that D flat minor is similar to C# minor. This is quite the puzzle!**Examining chord structure**

I’m looking into the Db minor triad, which consists of Db, Fb (which is E), and Ab. So, the Dbm/Ab chord has the Db minor over an Ab bass, indicating it's in the second inversion. This means the fifth is in the bass.

Next, I see B/Bb as a B major chord with Bb in the bass, making it a non-diatonic slash chord. Finally, Emaj7/Ab features E major 7 over Ab in the bass, creating a unique sound. The progression often uses Bb as a pedal bass.**Exploring key centers and chords**

I'm noticing that many of the slash chords have Bb or Ab in the bass, which might suggest the key center is Bb. The chords include Gb major over Bb; Gb’s scale degrees relative to Bb show that Bb is the third note. This means the chord contains Bb, Db, and Gb. 

With Bbdim sharing notes, there's a voice-leading movement between Fb and Gb. The Dbm/Ab chord has Ab in the bass, but it seems I’m miscalculating its relationship to Ab7b9. I might need to rethink if E major could be the actual key instead.**Analyzing chord compatibility**

I’m diving into the appearance of Emaj7/Ab, considering the E major scale, which has specific chords like Emaj7, F#m7, and others. However, these aren’t matching my analysis. Then I think about the Gb major key, which has six flats: I see chords like Gb, Abm, Bbm, and more. 

Bbdim isn’t diatonic to Gb major, but I realize Bbdim could be the vii° of C. In the scale, Bb is actually the third degree, but that means Bbdim isn't technically diatonic since Bbm would be the triad instead.**Determining key and mode**

I’m analyzing the chords and concluding that the Dbm/Ab is diatonic as the ii chord in Cb major, while B/Bb is an example of a Cb major chord with Bb in the bass, fitting into the scale. Emaj7/Ab can be viewed as Fbmaj7/Ab, which is also diatonic. This leads me to believe that the key center is Cb major, enhancing the likelihood that the mode is Bb Locrian. 

So, I’d say the key center is Cb major (or enharmonically B major) and the mode is Bb Locrian.

Bb Locrian (7th mode), with Cb major as the parent key (enharmonic to B major).

Reason: All chords respell to the Cb major collection over a Bb/Ab pedal:
- Bbdim = Bb–Db–Fb (i° in Bb Locrian)
- Gb/Bb (V of Cb over Bb)
- Dbm/Ab (ii over vi)
- B/Bb → enharmonically Cb/Bb (I over vii)
- Emaj7/Ab → enharmonically Fbmaj7/Ab (IVmaj7 over vi)

The repeated Bbdim and Bb bass establish Bb as tonal center, and the diminished tonic triad indicates Locrian.
