### 1. Understanding the Chords
First, let's list out the chords and their notes to understand them better. We'll interpret the slashes as inversions or bass notes.

- **Bbdim**: Bb, Db, Fb (Fb is enharmonic to E, but we'll keep it as Fb for now)
- **Gb/Bb**: Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So, Gb/Bb is Gb, Bb, Db (same as Gb major since Bb is already in it).
- **Dbm/Ab**: D minor chord with Ab in bass. Wait, D minor is D, F, A. Ab isn't in D minor, so this is likely Dbm (D flat minor): Db, Fb, Ab. So, Dbm/Ab is Db, Fb, Ab (same as Dbm since Ab is in it).
- **B/Bb**: B major chord with Bb in bass. B major is B, D#, F#. Bb is not in B major, so this is a B major chord with an added Bb bass, which is unusual but can be seen as a chromatic passage or a passing tone.
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7 with Ab in bass. Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#. Ab is G#, so this is E, G#, B, D#, with G# in bass, which is just Emaj7 in root position since G# is the 3rd.

Wait, actually, Emaj7/Ab is E major 7 with Ab (G#) in bass, which is the same as Emaj7 since G# is already in the chord. So it's Emaj7.

But let me re-examine the notation. Sometimes slashes indicate polychords or specific voicings, but here it's likely bass notes.

### 2. Listing the Chords with Notes
Let's write the notes for each chord:

1. Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb
2. Gb/Bb: Gb, Bb, Db
3. Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb, Ab
4. B/Bb: B, D#, F#, Bb
5. Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D#, Ab (but Ab is G#, so E, G#, B, D#)

Hmm, B/Bb is B major with Bb bass: B, D#, F#, Bb. That's B major with an added Bb, which is a minor 2nd above A, but not sure how it functions yet.

### 3. Identifying Key Centers
Let's see if we can find a key that fits these chords. We'll look for diatonic chords and see if they fit a scale.

First, let's list the roots and see if they suggest a key:

Roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E

These are: Bb, Gb (F#), Db (C#), B, E

Not immediately obvious. Let's see the notes in all chords:

Notes appearing:
Bb, Db, Fb (E), Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#

So notes: Bb, B, Db, D#, E (Fb), F#, Gb, Ab

This spans several keys. Maybe we can find a scale that fits.

### 4. Looking for Diminished Chords
Bbdim appears frequently. Diminished chords often function as leading tone chords or passing chords.

In major keys, diminished is vii°. In minor, ii°.

Let's see what key has Bb as vii° or ii°.

If Bb is vii°, then the tonic is B (since vii° is a half step below tonic).
So key of B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#

Notes in Bbdim: Bb, Db, Fb (but in B major, Bb is A#, Db is C#, Fb is E)
So A#, C#, E - which is vii° in B major (A#°, C#, E, G - but we have A#, C#, E, missing G, but dim is A#, C#, E, G, so this is A#dim7 without the 7th, just A#dim).

But our chord is Bbdim, which is same as A#dim enharmonically.

So Bbdim could be vii° in B major.

But then other chords: Gb major is not in B major (Gb is F#, which is IV in B major, but Gb/Bb is F#/A#, which is IV with 3rd in bass, possible).

Dbm: Db is C#, minor is C#m, which is iii in B major, but we have Dbm, which is C#m enharmonic, but Ab is G#, which is in B major, so Dbm/Ab is C#m/G#, which is iii in B major, fine.

B/Bb: B major is I in B major, with Bb is A#, so I with 7th in bass? Not standard, but could be a passing thing.

Emaj7: E is V in B major, Vmaj7 is not diatonic (V is E, G#, B, D nat), but here it's E, G#, B, D#, which is E major 7, but in B major, V is dominant 7 (E, G#, B, D nat), so Emaj7 is not diatonic to B major (it's from B lydian or other modes).

Wait, V in major is dominant 7, not major 7. So Emaj7 is not in B major. So maybe not B major.

Alternative: if Bbdim is ii° in minor key.

In minor, ii° is built on 2nd scale degree. So if Bb is ii°, then tonic is Ab (since Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G; minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb)

Ab minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb

ii° is Bb, Db, Fb - which is Bbdim, matches.

So key of Ab minor: Bbdim is ii°.

Now check other chords in Ab minor:

Gb major: Gb is VII in Ab minor (major on b7 is common in minor), so Gb major is diatonic.

Dbm: Db is iv in Ab minor, but minor iv is diatonic (Db, Fb, Ab), so Dbm is diatonic.

B/Bb: B is not in Ab minor (Ab minor has Bb, Cb, so B is raised, not diatonic), but could be chromatic.

Emaj7: E is not in Ab minor, but E is V in A major, but we're in Ab minor, so this is foreign.

But the first few chords fit Ab minor: Bbdim (ii°), Gb (VII), Dbm (iv), then B/Bb and Emaj7 are chromatic or modulations.

But the sequence keeps returning to Bbdim, suggesting Ab minor is home.

Alternatively, maybe it's a mode or another key.

### 5. Checking Other Keys
Let's try starting from Emaj7, since it's a maj7, could be I or IV.

If Emaj7 is I, then key is E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#

Then Bbdim: Bb is not in E major (Bb is A#), Db is C#, Fb is E, so A#, C#, E - which is vii° in E major (D#°, but A# is not the leading tone, leading tone is D#), so no, Bbdim is not vii° in E major.

Alternatively, Emaj7 is IV in B major, but we saw B major didn't fit well.

### 6. Reaffirming Ab Minor
Most chords fit Ab minor, with some chromaticism:

- Bbdim: ii° (diatonic)
- Gb/Bb: VII (diatonic)
- Dbm/Ab: iv (diatonic)
- B/Bb: B is chromatic, could be passing
- Emaj7: E is chromatic, maybe V of A, but briefly

The progression keeps returning to Bbdim, suggesting Ab minor is the tonic.

### 7. Mode Consideration
Since it's minor with some major chords (like VII), it's natural minor (aeolian), not harmonic or melodic minor (which would have major V).

### 8. Final Determination
Despite some chromatic chords, the core key is Ab minor (aeolian mode), with brief chromatic passages that don't establish another key.

### Answer:
**Key: Ab minor (Aeolian mode)**
