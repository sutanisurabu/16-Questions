### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I’m noting that Bbdim (Bb Db E) typically represents a vii° chord, possibly leading to B. Since the diminished triad built on the leading tone of B is A# (A# C# E), I realize that Bbdim equals A#dim. This means B could be either major or minor. Now, with the next chord, Gb/Bb, I see it as a Gb major chord with Bb in the bass. In B major, this means it's F# major, but that feels a bit odd since the bass is A#, the seventh scale degree.**Clarifying harmonic functions**

I’m realizing that F#/A# is indeed V6 in B major. The Gb/Bb chord equals F#/A#, which makes sense. So the progression from Bbdim to Gb/Bb translates to A#dim to F#/A#. Typically, vii° to V6 is common. In B major, the leading-tone diminished triad on A# (A# C# E) resolves to B or V. However, E natural isn't diatonic in B major, where it should actually be E#. The correct diatonic leading-tone triad consists of A# C# E#.**Examining diminished triads**

The diatonic fully diminished triad would be A# C# E#, but when I see "Bbdim," it typically denotes a diminished triad with E natural, which isn't diatonic. In pop and jazz, these chord symbols often overlook the correct enharmonic spelling, so the difference between E and E# can be missed. In B major, the vii° is A#dim (A# C# E#). If using harmonic minor, it becomes clearer that A#° has E natural fitting the scale of B harmonic minor, which includes E natural.**Understanding chord progressions**

I see that A# C# E is indeed the vii° in B harmonic minor, which matches with Bbdim being equivalent to A#dim. Then, Gb/Bb becomes F#/A#, so in B minor, we have the V major chord, F# major, used in harmonic minor. The bass A# (or Bb) pedal is common, acting as a chromatic lower neighbor. The progression alternates between A#° and F#/A#, each sharing A#/Bb in the bass, effectively creating a Bb pedal. It’s a typical sound in B minor. Now, moving to Dbm/Ab, which is Db minor over Ab.**Determining key and mode**

In analyzing the chords, I've realized that C# minor is ii in B major, while C# diminished is ii° in B minor. The chord C#m/G# functions as a V of V, fitting well with the progression. The other chords, like B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab, indicate that the key center leans towards B major. After reviewing enharmonic relationships and chord functions, the conclusion is clear: the key is B major, and the mode is Ionian.

B major (Ionian).
