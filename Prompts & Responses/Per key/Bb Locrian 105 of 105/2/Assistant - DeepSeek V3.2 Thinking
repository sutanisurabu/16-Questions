**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are many diminished chords, it might be in a minor key or using some modal interchange. Diminished chords often function as leading tones or passing chords.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb (which is Gb major with Bb in the bass)

- Gb/Bb

- Bbdim

- Bbdim

- Dbm/Ab (Dbm with Ab in the bass)

- B/Bb (B major with Bb in the bass? That seems odd because B major has notes B, D#, F#, and Bb is not in that chord. Maybe it's a typo or something else.)

B/Bb might mean B major over Bb bass, but that would be a polychord or something. Let me think. In chord notation, "/" usually means a slash chord, so B/Bb would be a B major chord with Bb as the bass note. But B major and Bb don't share notes, so it could be a dissonant chord. Perhaps it's B diminished? But it says B/Bb, which is confusing.

Maybe it's B over Bb, but B is the note, not the chord? No, in context, it's probably chords. Let me look back: "B/Bb" – in music notation, B could be B major, but with Bb bass, it might be a different chord. Perhaps it's a typo and it's supposed to be Bb something else.

Another thought: in some notations, "B" might mean B major, but B/Bb might indicate a chord where the root is B but the bass is Bb, which is unusual. Let me consider the context. The previous chord is Dbm/Ab, which is Dbm with Ab bass, so Dbm is Db minor, which has Db, Fb (E), Ab, so with Ab bass, it's like a first inversion or something.

Then B/Bb – if B is B major, it has B, D#, F#, and Bb bass, so the notes would be Bb, B, D#, F#. That sounds like a B major chord over a Bb pedal or something. But let's see the key.

Perhaps "B" is not B major but B diminished? But B diminished is usually written as Bdim. In the progression, Bbdim is written out, so B probably means B major.

I should look at the entire progression and find common tones or possible key centers.

Let me list all the chords with their full names:

- Bbdim: Bb diminished triad or seventh? Diminished usually implies a diminished triad, but in context, it might be a diminished seventh chord. Typically, "dim" means diminished triad, but in jazz or modern music, it might imply full diminished. But let's assume it's a diminished triad for now.

Bbdim triad: Bb, Db, Fb (which is E natural)

But in music, diminished chords are often used as vii° chords or passing chords.

Now Gb/Bb: Gb major chord with Bb bass. Gb major has Gb, Bb, Db, so with Bb bass, it's actually the same as Gb major in root position? No, if the chord is Gb major and bass is Bb, that means the third is in the bass, so it's first inversion of Gb major. So Gb/Bb is Gb major first inversion.

Similarly, Dbm/Ab: Dbm is Db minor, which has Db, Fb (E), Ab, so with Ab bass, that's first inversion of Dbm.

Now B/Bb: if B is B major, notes B, D#, F#, with Bb bass, so notes Bb, B, D#, F#. This is a very dissonant chord. B and Bb are a minor second apart, so it might be used for tension.

But let's see if there's a pattern or key.

Perhaps "B" is a typo and it's supposed to be Bb something. But it's written as B/Bb, which might be B major over Bb.

Another idea: in some notations, "B" might mean B minor, but B minor is Bm, so probably not.

Let's look at the last chord: Emaj7/Ab – E major 7th with Ab bass? E major 7th has E, G#, B, D#, and with Ab bass, so notes Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Ab and G# are the same note, so it's like Ab with E major? But Ab and E are a tritone apart, so it's dissonant.

This is confusing. Perhaps I need to think in terms of enharmonic equivalents or find a key where these chords make sense.

Let me list all the bass notes from the slash chords to see the bass movement.

The chords are:

- Bbdim (root Bb)

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb (bass Bb)

- Gb/Bb (bass Bb)

- Bbdim (bass Bb)

- Bbdim

- Dbm/Ab (bass Ab)

- B/Bb (bass Bb)

- Bbdim (bass Bb)

- Bbdim

- Gb/Bb (bass Bb)

- Gb/Bb

- Bbdim (bass Bb)

- Bbdim

- Emaj7/Ab (bass Ab)

- Bbdim (bass Bb)

So the bass notes are mostly Bb, with some Ab. So the bass is emphasizing Bb and Ab.

Now, let's consider the chords themselves.

Bbdim: notes Bb, Db, E (Fb)

Gb/Bb: which is Gb major with Bb bass, so notes Bb, Gb, Db — wait, Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db, so with Bb bass, it's the same notes, so it's a Gb major chord in first inversion.

Dbm/Ab: Dbm is Db, Fb (E), Ab, so with Ab bass, it's Db minor in first inversion, notes Ab, Db, E.

B/Bb: notes Bb, B, D#, F# — this is odd.

Emaj7/Ab: notes Ab, E, G#, B, D# — so Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

Now, let's see if there's a common key. Bb diminished chord is often found in keys like C minor, where it is the vii° chord, or in other keys as a common-tone diminished chord.

But let's list the notes involved: from Bbdim: Bb, Db, E

From Gb/Bb: Bb, Db, Gb

From Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E

From B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

From Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Notice that E natural appears in Bbdim and Dbm/Ab, and also in Emaj7/Ab as E natural? Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D#, so E is the root, so E natural.

In B/Bb, we have D# and F#, which are not in the other chords.

Perhaps the key is Bb minor? But Bb minor has Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, so notes Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

In Bb minor, the diminished chord on Bb would be Bb diminished? In Bb minor, the vii° chord is A diminished, not Bb diminished. Bb diminished would be from outside the key.

Bb diminished triad has Bb, Db, E natural, but in Bb minor, the E is Eb, so E natural is not in the key. So Bbdim has an E natural, which is not in Bb natural minor.

In Bb harmonic minor, the seventh degree is A natural, so the vii° chord is A diminished, which is A, C, Eb, so still not Bb diminished.

Bb diminished would require a diminished fifth from Bb, which is Fb (E), and in Bb minor, the fifth is F, not Fb, so Bbdim is not diatonically in Bb minor.

Similarly, Gb major is not in Bb minor because Bb minor has Gb (as the sixth degree), but Gb major chord has Gb, Bb, Db, and in Bb minor, the Bb is the tonic, Db is the minor third, but Gb is the sixth, so Gb major chord would require a major third from Gb, which is Bb, but in Bb minor, the note from Gb is Gb, so the chord Gb major has Bb which is the tonic, and Db which is the minor third, so actually, in Bb minor, the chord on Gb is Gb major because the scale has Bb and Db? Let's see the chords in Bb natural minor:

Bb minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

So chords:

i: Bb minor

ii: C diminished

III: Db major

iv: Eb minor

v: F minor

VI: Gb major

VII: Ab major

So in Bb natural minor, we have Gb major chord, which is the VI chord.

We also have Dbm chord? Dbm is Db minor, which would be Db, Fb, Ab, but in Bb natural minor, the Db chord is major because the third is F natural? No, in Bb natural minor, the note on Db is Db, and the third above Db is F, but F is natural in Bb minor? Bb minor scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab, so from Db, the third is F, which is major third? Db to F is a minor third? Db to F is three half steps? Db to D is one, D to E is two, E to F is three? No, intervals: from Db to F is Db, D, E, F? Let's calculate semitones.

From Db to F: Db to D is 1 semitone, D to D# is 2, D# to E is 3, E to F is 4? No, from Db to F: Db to D is 1 half step, D to Eb is 2, Eb to E is 3, E to F is 4? But Db to F is actually 3 half steps? Let's think: Db to D is 1 half step, but Db to D is a minor second, so from Db to D is 1 half step, from Db to Eb is 2 half steps, from Db to E is 3 half steps, from Db to F is 4 half steps? No, from C to E is 4 half steps for major third, so from Db to F should be 4 half steps? Db to D is 1, D to D# is 2, D# to E is 3, E to F is 4? But E to F is 1 half step, so from Db to F: Db to D is 1, D to Eb is 2, Eb to E is 3, E to F is 4? But Eb to E is 1 half step, so from Db to E is 3 half steps, and E to F is 1 half step, so from Db to F is 4 half steps, which is a major third? But Db to F is a minor third? I'm confused.

Let's use piano keys: Db is the black key between C and D. F is the white key. From Db to F: Db to D is one semitone, D to D# is two, D# to E is three, E to F is four semitones. So four semitones is a major third? But from C to E is four semitones, major third. From Db to F should be from Db to F, which is the same as C# to F? C# to F is three semitones? C# to D is one, D to D# is two, D# to E is three, E to F is four? No, C# to D is one half step, D to D# is two, D# to E is three, but E to F is four? But from C# to F is actually three half steps because C# to D is 1, D to Eb is 2, Eb to E is 3, and E to F is 4, but from C# to F is not E to F; from C# to F is C#-D-D#-E-F, that's four half steps? Let's list: C# to D: 1 half step, D to D#: 2 half steps, D# to E: 3 half steps, E to F: 4 half steps. So yes, from C# to F is 4 half steps, which is a major third? But C# to F is a diminished fourth? This is messy.

Standard interval: from C to E is major third, 4 half steps. From C# to F is also 4 half steps, but since C# to F is not a third, it's a fourth? C# to F is a diminished fourth, which is enharmonic to major third? No, C# to F is a diminished fourth, and since major third is 4 half steps, diminished fourth is also 4 half steps, so yes, it sounds the same. But in terms of chord spelling, for Db major chord, we have Db, F, Ab, so Db to F is a major third? Db to F is 4 half steps, so yes, major third. But Db to F is actually a minor third in equal temperament? No, in equal temperament, the interval from Db to F is 4 half steps, which is a major third? But from D to F is a minor third, 3 half steps. So from Db to F is larger than from D to F? From D to F is 3 half steps, minor third. From Db to F is Db to D is 1, D to D# is 2, D# to E is 3, E to F is 4, so 4 half steps, which is a major third. But Db to F is spelled as a major third? In music theory, Db to F is not a major third; it is a diminished fourth? Let's think in terms of scale degrees.

In the key of Bb minor, the note Db is the minor third of the scale, so from Db to F: F is the fifth degree of Bb minor? Bb minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. So from Db to F: Db is the third note, F is the fifth note. The interval from Db to F is a third? From Db to Eb is a second, to F is a third? So Db to F is a minor third? But how many semitones? From Db to Eb is 2 semitones? Db to D is 1, D to Eb is 2? No, Db to Eb is one whole step? Db to D is one half step, but Db to Eb is two half steps? Let's calculate: from Db to Eb: Db to D is 1 half step, but D to Eb is another half step, so from Db to Eb is 2 half steps? But Db and Eb are adjacent notes? On piano, Db is the black key left of D, Eb is the black key left of E? No, Db is the black key between C and D, and Eb is the black key between D and E. So from Db to Eb: from Db to D is one half step, from D to Eb is one half step, so total two half steps, which is a whole step. So from Db to Eb is a major second? But in terms of thirds, from Db to F: Db to Eb is major second, Eb to F is minor second? So from Db to F is a minor third? Let's see the number of half steps: from Db to D is 1, D to Eb is 2, Eb to E is 3, E to F is 4? But Eb to E is one half step, so from Db to E is 3 half steps? Db to D:1, D to Eb:2, Eb to E:3, so from Db to E is 3 half steps, which is a minor third? But E is not F? From Db to F: after E, E to F is one half step, so from Db to F is 4 half steps? But from Db to E is 3 half steps, and E to F is 1, so Db to F is 4 half steps. But from Db to E is 3 half steps, which is a minor third, and from Db to F is 4 half steps, which is a major third? But in the scale, Db to F should be a minor third because from the third to the fifth in a minor scale is a minor third? In Bb minor, from Db to F: Db is the third, F is the fifth, and in a minor scale, the interval between the third and fifth is a major third? No, in a minor chord, the interval from the root to the third is minor third, from root to fifth is perfect fifth, so from third to fifth is a minor third? Let's take Bb minor chord: Bb, Db, F. Bb to Db is minor third (3 half steps), Db to F is major third (4 half steps)? But Bb to F is perfect fifth (7 half steps). So in a minor chord, the interval between the third and fifth is a major third? But from Db to F in Bb minor chord: Db to F is 4 half steps, which is a major third. But in the scale, from Db to F, Db is the minor third of Bb, and F is the fifth, so the interval Db to F is a major third? But that seems counterintuitive because the scale has minor third from Bb to Db, but from Db to F, it's a major third? Let's list the notes: Bb to Db: Bb to B is 1, B to C is 2, C to Db is 3? Bb to B is 1 half step, B to C is 2, C to C# is 3, C# to D is 4, but Db is the same as C#? No, in Bb minor, Db is Db, not C#. From Bb to Db: Bb to B is 1, B to C is 2, C to Db is 3 half steps? So yes, 3 half steps, minor third. From Db to F: Db to D is 1, D to Eb is 2, Eb to E is 3, E to F is 4? But Eb to E is 1 half step, so from Db to E is 3 half steps, and E to F is 1, so from Db to F is 4 half steps, major third. So yes, in Bb minor chord, Db to F is a major third.

So back to chords in Bb natural minor: the chord on Db is Db major because Db to F is major third, and F to Ab is minor third, so Db major chord? Db, F, Ab is Db major chord? But Db is the third degree of Bb minor, and in natural minor, the third degree chord is major? Yes, in natural minor, the iii chord is major? Let's see: in minor key, the chords are i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII. So III is major, so Db major chord in Bb minor.

But in the progression, we have Dbm/Ab, which is Db minor chord, so Dbm is Db minor, which has Db, Fb, Ab. So Fb is E natural. So Dbm has E natural, which is not in Bb natural minor. In Bb harmonic minor, the seventh degree is A natural, but here we have E natural, which is the raised fourth? So not in Bb harmonic minor either.

So perhaps the key is not Bb minor.

Let's consider the possibility that the key is Gb major. Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. So chords: I Gb major, ii Ab minor, iii Bb minor, IV Cb major, V Db major, vi Eb minor, vii F diminished.

In this scale, Bbdim is not diatomic because Bb minor has Bb, Db, F, but Bbdim has Bb, Db, E, which is Fb, so E is not in Gb major; Gb major has Cb which is B, and F natural, so no E natural.

So not Gb major.

Another idea: perhaps the diminished chords are used as secondary diminished chords or as passing chords to other keys.

Let's look at the chord progression pattern. The progression has Bbdim repeated, then Gb/Bb, then Bbdim, then Dbm/Ab, then B/Bb, then Bbdim, then Gb/Bb, then Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab, then Bbdim.

So the Bbdim appears frequently, and Gb/Bb appears, and Dbm/Ab and B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab.

Notice that Gb/Bb has the same bass as Bbdim, so perhaps Bbdim is acting as a leading chord to Gb? But Gb/Bb is already played.

B/Bb is interesting. B/Bb might be interpreted as a chord with B and Bb, which could be part of a whole tone scale or something.

Perhaps B/Bb is a typo and it's supposed to be Bb something else, like Bb7 or something.

Another thought: in some jazz progressions, diminished chords are used as substitutes for dominant chords. For example, Bbdim might be acting as a dominant of something.

Bbdim7 chord would be Bb, Db, Fb, Gbb (A) but usually diminished seventh chords are symmetric.

Let's assume that Bbdim is a diminished seventh chord for simplicity. Bbdim7 notes: Bb, Db, Fb, Gbb which is A double flat, but enharmonically, Bb, Db, E, G? Let's use enharmonic spelling: Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G? But E and G are from the diminished seventh.

In standard, a diminished seventh chord has minor thirds between each note, so Bb to Db is minor third, Db to E is minor third? Db to E is augmented second? Db to E is two whole steps? Db to D is half, D to E is whole, so Db to E is one and a half steps, which is a minor third? Yes, because minor third is three half steps, and Db to E is three half steps? Db to D is one, D to D# is two, D# to E is three, yes three half steps. Then E to G is three half steps? E to F is one, F to F# is two, F# to G is three, yes. So Bbdim7: Bb, Db, E, G.

Similarly, Gb/Bb is Gb major, notes Bb, Gb, Db.

Dbm/Ab is Db minor, notes Ab, Db, Fb (E)

B/Bb: if B major, notes B, D#, F#, with Bb bass, so Bb, B, D#, F#

Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D# with Ab bass, so Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Now, let's see common notes or resolutions.

Notice that Bbdim7 has notes Bb, Db, E, G

Gb major has Bb, Db, Gb — so shared Bb and Db, and Gb is close to G? G natural vs Gb, so half step difference.

Dbm has Db, Fb (E), Ab — so shared Db and E with Bbdim? Bbdim has E, Dbm has Fb which is E, so same note.

B/Bb has Bb, B, D#, F# — so B and Bb conflict, and D# and F#.

Emaj7/Ab has Ab, E, G#, B, D# — so E, B, D#, G#.

Now, from B/Bb to Bbdim, we have Bb to Bb, but B to ? perhaps B resolves to Bb or something.

Perhaps the key is E major or something? But Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, which is odd.

Another idea: perhaps the B/Bb is actually B diminished over Bb, but B diminished would be B, D, F, with Bb bass, so Bb, B, D, F. But that doesn't help.

Let's list the chords in terms of their root movements.

The roots are: Bb for Bbdim, Gb for Gb/Bb, Db for Dbm/Ab, B for B/Bb, E for Emaj7/Ab.

So roots: Bb, Gb, Db, B, E.

This looks like a cycle of fifths or something? Bb to Gb is down a major third? Bb to Gb is down a minor sixth? Let's see intervals: Bb to Gb is down a perfect fifth? Bb to F is fifth, to Gb is sixth? Bb to Gb is minor sixth? Gb to Db is down a perfect fifth? Db to B is down a major third? B to E is up a perfect fourth? Not consistent.

Perhaps the bass movement is important: bass is mostly Bb, with Ab on Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab.

So bass Bb and Ab.

Ab is the minor seventh of Bb? So perhaps key of Bb major or Bb minor.

In Bb major, the notes are Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A.

Chords: I Bb, ii Cm, iii Dm, IV Eb, V F, vi Gm, vii° Adim.

So Bbdim is not diatomic, Gb major is not diatomic, Dbm is not, B major is not, Emaj7 is not.

So not Bb major.

In Bb minor, as before, we have Gb major as VI, but Dbm is not diatomic, and B major is not, Emaj7 is not.

So perhaps it's in a mode of Bb.

Another thought: the diminished chord might be acting as a common-tone diminished chord for Gb major. For example, in many songs, a diminished chord is used before a major chord with the same bass note. Here, Bbdim before Gb/Bb, both with Bb bass. So Bbdim is the common-tone diminished for Gb major.

Similarly, before Dbm/Ab, there is Bbdim, but Bbdim has bass Bb, while Dbm/Ab has bass Ab, so not common-tone.

Before B/Bb, there is Bbdim, then B/Bb with bass Bb, so common-tone diminished for B/Bb? But B/Bb is strange.

Before Emaj7/Ab, there is Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab with bass Ab.

So perhaps for the chords with Bb bass, Bbdim is used as a approach chord, and for chords with Ab bass, it might be different.

But B/Bb has Bb bass, so Bbdim before it.

Now, what is B/Bb? If we consider B/Bb as a B major chord, it might be acting as a dominant of E, since B major is the dominant of E major. And indeed, after B/Bb, we have Bbdim and then Gb/Bb, but later we have Emaj7/Ab.

So after B/Bb, eventually we have Emaj7/Ab, so perhaps B/Bb is the dominant of E, and Emaj7/Ab is the tonic but with Ab bass, which is unusual.

But Emaj7/Ab has Ab bass, which is the minor sixth of E, so perhaps it's an inversion or something.

In E major, the V chord is B major, so B/Bb might be a altered dominant with a b9 or something? B major with Bb bass could be seen as B7b9 or something? B7 has B, D#, F#, A, so with Bb bass, it might imply B7b9 with the b9 in the bass, so notes Bb, B, D#, F#, A? But here it's B/Bb, which doesn't include A, so it's just B major with Bb bass, so it has no seventh, so not dominant seventh.

But in context, it might be implying B7.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab might be Emaj7 with Ab bass, which could be seen as E major with a flat sixth in the bass, but in E major, the sixth is C#, so Ab is not in the key.

Perhaps the key is Cb major or something.

Let's list the notes from all chords to find a common scale.

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G (if dim7)

From Gb/Bb: Bb, Gb, Db

From Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E

From B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

From Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

So all notes together: Bb, Db, E, G, Gb, Ab, B, D#, F#, G#.

Let's list unique notes: A#/Bb, B, C#/Db, D#, E, F#, G, G#, Ab.

So notes: Bb, B, Db, D#, E, F#, G, G#, Ab.

This looks like a chromatic scale almost, but missing C, C#, D, Eb, F, A.

So it's not a standard scale.

Perhaps the key is Db major or something.

Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

Chords: I Db, ii Ebmin, iii Fmin, IV Gb, V Ab, vi Bbmin, vii Cdim.

So Bbdim is not diatomic, Gb major is IV, so that fits, but Dbm is not diatomic, B major is not, Emaj7 is not.

So not Db major.

Another idea: perhaps the mode is Phrygian or something.

Let's consider the first and last chords. The progression starts with Bbdim and ends with Bbdim, so perhaps Bb is the tonic? But diminished chords are not usually tonic chords unless in rare cases.

Perhaps Bb is the root, but the mode is diminished scale or something.

Perhaps this is from a piece that uses whole tone or diminished scales.

Let's look at the chord sequence: Bbdim to Gb/Bb. If Bbdim is seen as Gb7b9 without root or something. Gb7 has Gb, Bb, Db, Fb, so Gb7b9 would have Gb, Bb, Db, Fb, Abb (G) so notes Gb, Bb, Db, E, G? So Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G, which is the same as Gb7b9 without the root Gb. So Bbdim7 is equivalent to Gb7b9 omit root. So when we go to Gb/Bb, which is Gb major, it's like resolving to Gb major. So Bbdim is acting as a dominant of Gb.

Similarly, later we have Bbdim to Gb/Bb again, so same thing.

Now, then we have Bbdim to Dbm/Ab. Dbm/Ab is Db minor with Ab bass. If Bbdim is acting as a dominant, what is it dominant of? Bbdim7 could be seen as A7b9 without root? A7 has A, C#, E, G, so A7b9 has A, C#, E, G, Bb? So Bbdim7 has Bb, Db, E, G, which is not A7b9. Bbdim7 has Db instead of C#, so it's different.

Bbdim7 notes: Bb, Db, E, G. This can be seen as Bbdim7, or as Dbdim7, or as Edim7, or as Gdim7, because diminished chords are symmetric.

So Bbdim7 is also Dbdim7, Edim7, Gdim7.

So if Bbdim7 is Edim7, then it could be dominant of F? But we have Dbm/Ab, which is Db minor, not F.

If Bbdim7 is Gdim7, then it could be dominant of Ab? And Dbm/Ab has Ab bass, so perhaps it is resolving to Ab? But Dbm/Ab is Db minor chord with Ab bass, so it's like Ab with Db minor? But Db minor and Ab are related? Ab is the fifth of Db minor, so Dbm/Ab is first inversion of Db minor, so it's like the ii chord in something? If Ab is the tonic, then Db minor is the iv chord? In Ab major, iv is Db minor? Ab major has chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim. So Db minor is not diatomic; Db major is IV. So in Ab minor, i Abm, ii° Bbdim, III B, iv Cm, v Dm, VI Eb, VII F, so Db minor is not there.

So not Ab.

From Bbdim to Dbm/Ab, if Bbdim is seen as a diminished chord, it might be used as a passing chord to Dbm.

Then we have B/Bb. If B/Bb is B major with Bb bass, it might be acting as a dominant of E. And indeed, later we have Emaj7/Ab.

So B/Bb is V of E, and Emaj7/Ab is I of E but with Ab bass.

So why Ab bass? Perhaps Ab is a pedal point or something.

Notice that in Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, the bass is Ab, so Ab is a common bass note for these chords.

So perhaps the key is E major, but with Ab bass? That doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the key is C minor or something.

Let's consider the possibility that "B/Bb" is a typo and it's supposed to be "Bb/Bb" or something else. Perhaps it's "Bbdim/Bb" but it's already Bbdim.

Another idea: in some notations, "B" might mean Bb, but then B/Bb would be Bb/Bb, which is redundant. So probably not.

Perhaps "B" is the chord and "/Bb" means with Bb bass, so it's a polychord.

But let's listen to the progression in my mind. Bbdim to Gb/Bb sounds like a resolution to Gb major. Bbdim to Dbm/Ab might sound like a move to Db minor. Then B/Bb might be a surprise chord, leading to Emaj7/Ab.

So perhaps the overall key is Gb major, but with excursions to E major.

But Gb major and E major are not closely related; they are a minor third apart? Gb to E is major sixth? Gb to E is large interval.

Gb major and E major have no common chords.

Perhaps the key is Bb minor, and the chords are borrowed from other keys.

In Bb minor, the VI chord is Gb major, so that fits. The iv chord is Eb minor, but here we have Dbm/Ab, which is Db minor, so perhaps borrowed from Bb major? In Bb major, the iv chord is Eb minor, not Db minor.

Db minor would be the iii chord in Bb major? Bb major has iii Cm, so not.

Another thought: perhaps the diminished chord is used as a pivot chord.

Let's list the chords in terms of functional harmony.

Suppose we consider Gb as the tonic. Then Bbdim is the vii°7 of Gb? In Gb major, the vii°7 is Fdim7, which is F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? But Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, Fb, Gbb, so not the same.

In Gb major, the leading tone is F, so vii°7 is F, Ab, Cb, Ebb? Cb is B, Ebb is D, so F, Ab, B, D? So Fdim7: F, Ab, B, D.

But Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G, so different.

So not vii°7 of Gb.

If Gb is tonic, then Bbdim7 could be the secondary dominant of something? Bbdim7 as vii°7 of Cb? Cb is B, so vii°7 of B major? But B major is not in Gb major.

This is not working.

Let's consider the last chord Emaj7/Ab. If we ignore the bass for a moment, Emaj7 is a major seventh chord, which is often tonic. So perhaps E major is the tonic key.

But then how do we get there? We have B/Bb, which is B major with Bb bass, so if B major is the dominant of E, then it should resolve to E major, but here it resolves to Bbdim and then to Gb/Bb, which is not E major. After B/Bb, we have Bbdim, then Gb/Bb, then Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab. So after B/Bb, we have two measures of Bbdim and Gb/Bb before Emaj7/Ab, so it's not direct resolution.

So perhaps B/Bb is not the dominant of E, but rather, Emaj7/Ab is not the tonic.

Perhaps Emaj7/Ab is itself a dominant chord? Emaj7 is not typically dominant; dominant chords are usually seventh chords, not major seventh.

Emaj7 could be the I chord in E major.

Let's look at the sequence before Emaj7/Ab: we have Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab. So Bbdim to Emaj7/Ab. Bbdim7 has notes Bb, Db, E, G. Emaj7 has E, G#, B, D#. So common note E? But Bb to E is a fifth apart, so perhaps Bbdim is acting as a substitute for something.

Bbdim7 shares E with Emaj7, but Emaj7 has G# while Bbdim has G, so G to G# is half step resolution, which is good. Bbdim has Db, while Emaj7 has D#, so Db to D# is half step resolution? But Db to D# is augmented second, but in equal temperament, it's the same as minor third, but here it's moving from Db to D#, so half step up? Db to D is half step, D to D# is half step, so Db to D# is two half steps, so whole step? No, Db to D#: from Db to D is one half step, from D to D# is another half step, so two half steps, which is a whole step. So Db to D# is a whole step, not half step. So not direct resolution.

Bbdim has Bb, while Emaj7 has B, so Bb to B is half step, so that resolves well. Bb to B is half step up.

So from Bbdim to Emaj7, we have Bb to B (half step up), Db to D# (whole step up), E to E (common), G to G# (half step up). So two half step resolutions and one whole step, and one common tone. So it's possible that Bbdim is acting as a leading chord to Emaj7, with Bb leading to B, G leading to G#, and Db leading to D#? But Db to D# is whole step, so not leading tone resolution.

In traditional harmony, leading tone resolution is half step. So Bb to B is good, G to G# is good, but Db to D# is not half step.

So perhaps Bbdim is not the direct leading chord to Emaj7.

Perhaps Bbdim is the diminished chord from the key of E minor or something.

In E harmonic minor, the vii°7 is D#dim7, which is D#, F#, A, C? But Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G, which is not D#dim7.

So not.

Another idea: perhaps the key is Db minor? Let's try Db minor.

Db natural minor: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? But usually written as Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? Bbb is A, Cb is B? So Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B? So notes Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B.

Chords: i Dbm, ii° Ebdim, III E major? III would be Fb major? Fb is E, so III is E major? Yes, in minor key, the III chord is major. So in Db minor, III is E major? But E major has E, G#, B, but in Db natural minor, the third degree is Fb, which is E, but the chord on Fb would be Fb major? Fb major has Fb, Ab, Cb, so E, G, B? So E, G, B is E minor, not E major. So in natural minor, the III chord is minor? Let's clarify.

In natural minor scale, the chords are i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII. So III is the chord on the third degree, which in natural minor is minor? For example, in C minor, scale C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, so chord on Eb is Eb, G, Bb, which is Eb major? Eb, G, Bb is Eb major chord? But G is the third of Eb, and from Eb to G is major third, so yes, Eb major chord. So in natural minor, the III chord is major? In C minor, III is Eb major? But Eb major has Eb, G, Bb, and in C minor, the notes are Eb, G, Bb, so yes, major chord. So in Db natural minor, the scale is Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? So notes Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B? So chord on Fb (E) would be E, Gb, B? E, Gb, B is E diminished? Because E to Gb is minor third, Gb to B is major third? So augmented? No, E to Gb is minor third, Gb to B is augmented third? Gb to B is three half steps? Gb to G is one, G to G# is two, G# to A is three, A to A# is four, A# to B is five? Let's calculate: from Gb to B: Gb to G is 1 half step, G to Ab is 2, Ab to A is 3, A to Bb is 4, Bb to B is 5? So from Gb to B is 5 half steps, which is a perfect fourth? But for chords, from Gb to B is a major third? No, from Gb to B is Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb, B? So from Gb to B is 5 half steps, which is a perfect fourth? But in terms of chord intervals, from root to third, for E chord, the third should be G# for major, but here we have Gb, which is not G#. So in Db natural minor, the note on the third degree is Fb, which is E, and the third above E for the chord would be G if we build a triad? So from E to G is minor third, so the chord is E minor? But E minor has E, G, B, and from E to G is minor third, G to B is major third, so E minor chord. But in Db natural minor, the note from E to G? But in Db natural minor, after E, we have Gb? So the scale is Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb? So the notes are Db, Eb, E, Gb, Ab, A, B? So when building chord on E, we use the notes from the scale: E, Gb, B? So E, Gb, B? E to Gb is minor third? E to F is one half step, E to F# is two, E to Gb is two? E to F is one, E to F# is two, but Gb is the same as F#, so E to Gb is two half steps? But two half steps are a whole step, which is a major second? For a third, we need two scale steps? From E to Gb: in the scale, from Fb to Gb is two steps? No, from E to the next note is Gb? So the interval from E to Gb is a second, not a third. So to build a triad on E, we take E, then the third above E is G, but G is not in the scale; the scale has Gb, so we use Gb? So the chord is E, Gb, B? But E to Gb is a minor third? E to G is major third? E to Gb is two half steps, which is a major second? No, let's clarify intervals: from E to G is three half steps? E to F is one, F to F# is two, F# to G is three? So E to G is three half steps, which is a minor third. So from E to G is minor third. From E to Gb is two half steps? E to F is one, F to Gb is two? So two half steps, which is a major second? But in terms of chord, when we build a triad, we take every other note from the scale. So from Db natural minor scale: notes: 1 Db, 2 Eb, 3 Fb, 4 Gb, 5 Ab, 6 Bbb, 7 Cb. So on scale degree 3, we have Fb, and the triad would be Fb, Ab, Cb? So Fb, Ab, Cb which is E, G, B? So E, G, B is E minor chord? But E, G, B is E minor? E to G is minor third, G to B is major third, so yes, E minor chord. So in Db natural minor, the III chord is E minor, not E major.

So in the progression, we have Emaj7/Ab, which is E major seventh, so not E minor.

So not Db natural minor.

In Db harmonic minor, the seventh degree is C natural, so the V chord is Ab major, and the vii° chord is Cdim, so still not Emaj7.

So not Db minor.

I recall that in some progressions, diminished chords are used as passing chords between chords a minor third apart. Here, Bbdim to Gb/Bb, and Bb to Gb are a minor third apart? Bb to Gb is major sixth? Bb to G is major sixth, to Gb is minor sixth? So not minor third.

Bb to Gb is down a minor sixth, which is equivalent to up a major third? So not.

Perhaps I need to accept that B/Bb is B major with Bb bass, and it might be used as a tension chord before resolving to Bbdim? But then to Gb/Bb.

Let's consider the overall structure. The progression has a repeating pattern: Bbdim twice, then Gb/Bb twice, then Bbdim twice, then Dbm/Ab and B/Bb, then Bbdim twice, then Gb/Bb twice, then Bbdim twice, then Emaj7/Ab and Bbdim.

So the Dbm/Ab and B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab might be a middle section.

Perhaps the key is Bb, and the chords are all based on Bb with chromaticism.

But let's listen to the chords in terms of sound. Bbdim is unstable, Gb/Bb is stable? Gb/Bb has Bb in bass, so it might sound like Bb with Gb major, so perhaps like Bb7#9 or something? Bb7#9 has Bb, D, F, Ab, C#? Not sure.

Another idea: perhaps "B/Bb" is meant to be "Bb/D" or something, but that seems unlikely.

Perhaps "B" is a typo and it's "Db" or "Gb" but then it would be Db/Bb, which is already similar to Gb/Bb.

Let's look at the original string: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim"

Perhaps "B/Bb" is "Bm/Bb" but it's written as B/Bb.

In some fonts, "B" might be "Bb" but then it would be Bb/Bb, which is just Bb chord.

But then the progression would be: ... Dbm/Ab Bb/Bb ... which is Bb chord with Bb bass, so just Bb chord. Then later Emaj7/Ab.

So if B/Bb is Bb chord, then the progression has Bb chord after Dbm/Ab, then Bbdim, etc.

But Bb chord after Dbm/Ab might make sense if key is Bb, but then Emaj7/Ab doesn't fit.

So let's assume that "B/Bb" is a mistake and it's "Bb" chord. So the progression is: ... Dbm/Ab Bb Bbdim ... so Dbm/Ab to Bb to Bbdim.

Then later Emaj7/Ab to Bbdim.

So if key is Bb, then Bb is tonic, but Bbdim is not tonic, so it's unstable.

But let's see if that works.

If key is Bb major, then Bb is I, Gb major is not diatomic, but could be borrowed from minor? In Bb minor, VI is Gb major, so that fits. Dbm/Ab is Db minor with Ab bass, so in Bb major, Db minor is not diatomic, but in Bb minor, ii° is Cdim, so not Db minor. Db minor could be borrowed from Bb major? No.

In Bb major, the chord on Db is Ddim because scale has D natural? Bb major has D natural, so chord on D is D minor? No, Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A, so chord on D is D, F, A, which is D minor? So ii chord is Cm, iii chord is Dm, so not Ddim.

So Db minor is not in Bb major or minor.

So still not.

Perhaps the key is Gb major, and we have borrowed chords.

I think I need to consider the possibility that the mode is based on a scale that includes the notes from the chords.

Let's list the notes from the chords without B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab for a moment.

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, E, G

From Gb/Bb: Bb, Gb, Db

From Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E

So common notes: Bb, Db, E, G, Gb, Ab.

So notes: Gb, G, Ab, Bb, Db, E

So this is a six-note scale: Gb, G, Ab, Bb, Db, E

This looks like the whole tone scale missing one note? Whole tone scale has Gb, Ab, Bb, C, D, E? So here we have Gb, Ab, Bb, Db, E, and G? So instead of C and D, we have Db and G? So not whole tone.

It could be a mode of the harmonic minor or something.

From these notes, if we take Gb as tonic, then we have Gb, G, Ab, Bb, Db, E. So intervals: root, minor second, minor third, perfect fourth, minor sixth, major seventh? So not standard.

If we take Bb as tonic, then Bb, Db, E, Gb, G, Ab. So Bb, Db (minor third), E ( augmented fourth?), Gb ( diminished sixth?), G ( minor seventh?), Ab ( seventh?)? So Bb, Db, E, Gb, G, Ab. This has both Gb and G, so it's chromatic.

Perhaps it's the Bb half-whole diminished scale? Bb half-whole diminished scale: Bb, Cb, Db, D, E, F, G, Ab? So notes Bb, B, Db, D, E, F, G, Ab? So close to what we have? We have Bb, Db, E, G, Gb, Ab. So we have Gb instead of F? So not exactly.

We have E, which is in the scale, but we have Gb and G, so both? So it's not.

Let's include B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab.

If B/Bb is B major with Bb bass, notes Bb, B, D#, F#

And Emaj7/Ab has Ab, E, G#, B, D#

So additional notes: B, D#, F#, G#

So all notes: from earlier: Gb, G, Ab, Bb, Db, E, and then B, D#, F#, G#

So now we have: Gb, G, Ab, A#/Bb, B, C#/Db, D#, E, F#, G#? So from Gb to G#: Gb, G, Ab, A#/Bb, B, C#/Db, D#, E, F#, G#. So almost all notes except C and D and F? So we have C#/Db, so C# is there, and D# is there, so no C natural and no D natural and no F natural? So it's a chromatic scale from Gb to G# with missing C and D and F? But we have Db which is C#, so C# is there, and D# is there, so no D natural, and no F natural.

So the scale has Gb, G, Ab, Bb, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#. So this is the E major scale? E major scale has E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So we have E, F#, G#, B, C#, D# from Emaj7, and from other chords we have Gb, G, Ab, Bb. So Gb is F#, so F# is already there, G is not in E major, Ab is not, Bb is not. So the additional notes G, Ab, Bb are outside E major.

So if E major is the key, then G, Ab, Bb are chromatic notes.

So perhaps the key is E major, and the chords with Bbdim and Gb/Bb are using chromaticism.

But then how does Bb fit in E major? Bb is the flat fifth of E, so it could be used in altered dominants.

In E major, the V chord is B major, so B/Bb could be B major with Bb bass, which is like B7b9 without the seventh, so it might be used as a dominant with b9.

Then Emaj7/Ab is the I chord with Ab bass, which is the flat sixth, so it might be a borrowed chord from E minor or something.

But then Bbdim to Gb/Bb: what are they in E major? Bbdim could be a passing diminished chord, and Gb/Bb could be a Neapolitan chord or something? Gb major in E major would be the flat II chord, which is Neapolitan chord. In E major, the Neapolitan chord is F major, but here it's Gb major, which is the same as F# major? F# major is the II chord in E major? In E major, II is F# minor, so F# major would be borrowed from somewhere? But Gb is enharmonic to F#, so Gb major is F# major, which is not diatomic in E major; II is F# minor, so F# major is the major II, which is sometimes used in popular music.

So perhaps in E major, Gb/Bb is actually F#/A#? But F#/A# would be F# major with A# bass, but here it's Gb/Bb, which is Gb major with Bb bass, and Bb is A#, so yes, F# major with A# bass. So in E major, F# major with A# bass? But A# is the leading tone in E major, so having F# major with A# bass might be unusual, but it could be used as a secondary dominant or something.

F# major chord in E major could be the V of B, since B is the dominant of E, so F# major could be the V of V? But V of B is F# major? In B major, the V chord is F# major? No, in B major, the V chord is F# major? B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, so V chord is F# major? F# major has F#, A#, C#, so yes, F# major is the V chord of B major? But B major is the V of E, so F# major is the V of V, so it should resolve to B major. And in the progression, after Gb/Bb (F#/A#), we have Bbdim, which might be passing, then later we have B/Bb, which is B major with Bb bass, so B major is the dominant of E, so it fits: F# major to B major to E major.

But in the progression, after Gb/Bb, we have Bbdim, then later B/Bb, then later Emaj7/Ab.

So let's see the sequence: after Gb/Bb, we have Bbdim, then Dbm/Ab, then B/Bb, then Bbdim, then Gb/Bb, then Bbdim, then Emaj7/Ab.

So after first Gb/Bb, we have Bbdim and then Dbm/Ab, then B/Bb.

So if Gb/Bb is F#/A#, and it should resolve to B major, but instead it goes to Bbdim and Dbm/Ab.

So not direct.

But later, after B/Bb, we have Bbdim and Gb/Bb again, then Emaj7/Ab.

So perhaps when we have B/Bb, it resolves to Emaj7/Ab? But between B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab, there are Bbdim and Gb/Bb, so it's delayed.

So in overall, the key might be E major, and the chords are used in a way that eventually resolves to E major.

So let's assume key of E major.

In E major, the chords are:

- Emaj7/Ab: this is the I chord with Ab bass? But Ab is not in E major; Ab is G#? Ab is the same as G#? No, Ab is G#? In equal temperament, Ab and G# are the same note, but in spelling, Ab is not G#. But in chords, sometimes enharmonic equivalence is used. So Emaj7/Ab could be seen as Emaj7 with G# bass? But Emaj7 has G# as the third, so with G# bass, it would be first inversion? Emaj7 first inversion is G#m7b5? No, Emaj7 first inversion is G#m7? Let's see: Emaj7 notes: E, G#, B, D#. First inversion would have G# in bass, so G#, B, D#, E, which is G#m7? G#m7 would have G#, B, D#, F#? So instead of D#, it has F#? So not G#m7. So Emaj7/G# is not a standard chord; it's still Emaj7 with third in bass.

So in E major, Emaj7/Ab is Emaj7 with Ab bass, but Ab is not G#; if we use enharmonic, Ab is G#, so it's Emaj7/G#, which is fine.

Similarly, Gb/Bb is F#/A#, which is F# major with A# bass, and A# is the leading tone of E major, so it might be used as a dominant substitute.

B/Bb is B major with Bb bass, and Bb is A#, so B/A#? So B major with A# bass? But B major has A#? B major chord has B, D#, F#, so with A# bass, it would be B major with the seventh in bass? But B major doesn't have seventh; if it had seventh, it would be B7, which has A natural? So B/A# would be B major with A# bass, which is like B major with a major seventh in bass? But B major seventh has A#? Bmaj7 has B, D#, F#, A#? So B/A# is actually Bmaj7 without the third and fifth? So it's ambiguous.

In context, B/Bb might be intended as B7b9 or something.

So for simplicity, let's assume key of E major.

Then the chords can be interpreted as:

- Bbdim: this could be a diminished chord from the key? In E major, the vii°7 is D#dim7, which is D#, F#, A, C? But Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G? which is not D#dim7. But Bbdim7 can be enharmonic to A#dim7? A#dim7 is A#, C#, E, G? So Bb, Db, E, G is the same as A#, C#, E, G? But A#dim7 should have A#, C#, E, G? Yes, because A# to C# is minor third, C# to E is minor third, E to G is minor third. So Bbdim7 is enharmonic to A#dim7? Bb is A#, Db is C#, so yes, Bbdim7 = A#dim7.

And in E major, the vii°7 is D#dim7, which is D#, F#, A, C? So A#dim7 is not the vii°7 of E major; vii°7 is on D#.

But A#dim7 could be used as a secondary diminished chord. For example, A#dim7 is the vii°7 of B major? In B major, vii°7 is A#dim7? In B major, the leading tone is A#, so vii°7 is A#dim7, which is A#, C#, E, G? So yes, A#dim7 is the vii°7 of B major.

And since B major is the V of E, so A#dim7 is the vii°7 of V, which is common.

So in the progression, Bbdim (A#dim7) is the vii°7 of B major, so it should resolve to B major.

And indeed, after Bbdim, we sometimes have Gb/Bb, which is F#/A#, and F# major is the V of B? So F# major to B major? But F# major is not the V of B; in B major, the V chord is F# major? Let's see: in B major, the V chord is F# major? B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, so V chord is F# major? F# major has F#, A#, C#, so yes, F# major is the V chord of B major? But typically, the V chord is dominant seventh, but here it's major triad, so it can work.

So A#dim7 (Bbdim) can resolve to F# major or to B major.

In the progression, after Bbdim, we have Gb/Bb (F#/A#), which is F# major with A# bass, so it's like F# major in first inversion? But A# is the leading tone of B, so it might emphasize the resolution to B.

Then later, we have B/Bb, which is B major with A# bass, so it's B major with the leading tone in bass, so it might be a strong dominant chord.

Then eventually, we have Emaj7/Ab, which is Emaj7 with G# bass, so tonic with third in bass.

So in this interpretation, the key is E major, and the chords are functioning around the dominant B major.

Now, what about Dbm/Ab? Dbm/Ab is Db minor with Ab bass. In E major, what is Db minor? Db minor has Db, Fb, Ab. Db is C#? C# is the second degree of E major? So Db minor could be seen as C# minor? C# minor is the ii chord in E major? In E major, ii chord is F# minor, so C# minor is not diatomic. C# minor would be the vi chord in E major? No, in E major, vi chord is C# minor? E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, so vi chord is C# minor? C# minor has C#, E, G#? But here Db minor has Db, Fb, Ab, which is C#, E, G#? So yes, Db minor is enharmonic to C# minor? C# minor has C#, E, G#, so Db minor has Db, Fb, Ab, and since Db=C#, Fb=E, Ab=G#, so yes, Db minor = C# minor.

So Dbm/Ab is C#m/Ab? But Ab is G#, so C#m/G#? which is first inversion of C# minor? C# minor first inversion has E in bass? C# minor chord: C#, E, G#. First inversion has E in bass? So C#m/E? But here we have C#m/G#? which would be second inversion? C# minor second inversion has G# in bass? So yes, Dbm/Ab is C#m/G#? which is C# minor second inversion.

And in E major, C# minor is the vi chord? In E major, the vi chord is C# minor? Yes, because from E major scale, the sixth degree is C#, and chord is C# minor.

So Dbm/Ab is the vi chord in second inversion.

So now the progression makes sense in E major.

Let's rewrite the progression in E major enharmonic equivalents:

- Bbdim = A#dim7 (vii°7 of B)

- Gb/Bb = F#/A# (F# major with A# bass) which is V of B with leading tone in bass

- Dbm/Ab = C#m/G# (vi chord in second inversion)

- B/Bb = B/A# (B major with A# bass) which is V chord with leading tone in bass

- Emaj7/Ab = Emaj7/G# (I chord with third in bass)

So the progression in E major:

A#dim7 twice, then F#/A# twice, then A#dim7 twice, then C#m/G# and B/A#, then A#dim7 twice, then F#/A# twice, then A#dim7 twice, then Emaj7/G# and A#dim7.

So functionally, we have vii°7/V and V/V resolving to V, then vi and V, then vii°7/V and V/V, then I.

So the key is E major.

And the mode is Ionian, but since it's major, mode is major.

So key: E major

Mode: major

But to confirm, the first chord is A#dim7, which is not tonic, but it's leading to V/V, and the last chord is A#dim7, which might be a passing chord, but the resolution is to Emaj7 before it, so it ends with A#dim7, which is unstable, but in context, it might be fine.

So I think this is the best interpretation.

Therefore, the key is E major.

The chord progression provided is best interpreted in the key of E major. The diminished chords (Bbdim) function as A#dim7 when considering enharmonic equivalence, which is the vii°7 of the dominant (B major). The chords Gb/Bb and B/Bb are enharmonically equivalent to F#/A# and B/A# respectively, acting as the V/V and V chords with the leading tone (A#) in the bass. The chord Dbm/Ab is enharmonically equivalent to C#m/G#, which is the vi chord in second inversion. The final chord Emaj7/Ab is the I chord (Emaj7) with the third (G#) in the bass.

Thus, the overall harmonic movement revolves around the dominant (B major) resolving to the tonic (E major), confirming the key as E major and the mode as major (Ionian).
