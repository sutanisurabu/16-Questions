**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chords: Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm/Ab, B/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7/Ab, Bbdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to recall what these chord notations mean. The slashes indicate bass notes, so for example, Gb/Bb means a Gb diminished chord with Bb in the bass. Similarly, Dbm/Ab is a Db minor chord with Ab as the bass note. B/Bb probably means a B major chord with Bb in the bass, but that seems odd. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it's B minor with Bb bass? But B/Bb usually means B chord with Bb bass, which would be an unusual voicing. Hmm, I should check that.

Let me list all the chords with their bass notes:

1. Bbdim (B diminished, root Bb)
2. Bbdim
3. Gb/Bb (Gb dim with Bb bass)
4. Gb/Bb
5. Bbdim
6. Bbdim
7. Dbm/Ab (Db minor with Ab bass)
8. B/Bb (B major with Bb bass? Or maybe Bdim? Wait, B/Bb could be ambiguous. Sometimes people write chord names like that for slash chords. So B chord over Bb bass. Typically, that would be B major triad with Bb in the bass, which would make it a Badd6 or something, but maybe it's a specific inversion. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be Bbm or something else. Let me think.)

Wait, maybe B/Bb is intended as B diminished? But no, Bdim is usually written as Bdim or B°. Slash chords specify the bass note, so B/Bb would be a B chord (probably major unless specified otherwise) with Bb in the bass. But a B major chord has B, D#, F#, so with Bb bass, it would be Bb, B, D#, F# which is a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe it's a B7 chord with Bb? No, that doesn't fit. This might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's Bb chord? But why write B/Bb? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the user's input again: "B/Bb". Hmm. Maybe they meant Bb? But the previous chords are Bbdim, so sometimes people write "Bb dim" but here it's written as Bbdim. So perhaps B/Bb is a typo and should be Bbdim again? But no, they have B/Bb as a separate entry. Alternatively, maybe it's B major over Bb bass, which is unconventional but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a B diminished chord with Bb bass? But Bdim has notes B, D, F, so with Bb bass, it would be Bb, B, D, F. That's a Bm7b5 or something? Not sure.

Wait, let's look at the entire sequence again as written: "Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim"

So after the Dbm/Ab, there's B/Bb. Maybe that's actually a Bbm chord or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the "B/Bb" is a typo and should be "Bb/Bb" but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's "Bb" as in B flat, but written as B/Bb? No. Alternatively, maybe it's a B diminished chord with Bb bass, but Bdim is B, D, F, so Bb bass would be Bb as the root note? That seems odd. Maybe it's a mistake for something like Bbm7 or Bb minor. Alternatively, perhaps the slash chord is meant to be a B chord (major, since it's uppercase B) with Bb in the bass. So the chord would be B major triad with Bb note in the bass. That would be an unusual voicing, but possible. Let's see what that chord is: B major is B, D#, F#, so with Bb in the bass, it's Bb, B, D#, F#. That's a B(add#9) or something. Not standard. Alternatively, maybe it's Bb over B, but written as B/Bb which is confusing. Typically, the chord name comes first, then the bass note. So B/Bb would be a B chord with Bb in the bass.

This is tricky. Maybe I should check common chord progressions in certain keys.

Let's consider the chords without considering bass notes first, but the bass notes might indicate the root of the chord in inversion or something.

Bbdim is B-D-F, but dim chords are usually root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Bbdim is Bb, Db, F.

Gb/Bb: Gb dim chord has notes Gb, Bbb (A), Db. But often, diminished chords are minor third, minor third. So Gbdim: Gb, Bbb (A), Dbb? Wait no. Wait, diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Gb dim would be Gb, Bbb? Wait, Gb to Bbb is a diminished third? Wait, Gb to Bb is minor third, but dim triad is root, min3, dim5. So Gb dim: Gb, Bbb (which is A), Db. Wait, Gb to Db is diminished fifth? Gb to Db is a perfect fifth down, but diminished fifth would be Gb to Dbb (C). Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of intervals. A diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth (which is 6 semitones from root). So for Gb, root Gb, minor third is Bbb (A), and diminished fifth is Dbb (C). But usually, diminished chords are spelled as root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th. So in practice, Gb diminished chord is Gb, A, C. Because Gb to A is a minor third (3 semitones), A to C is minor third (3 semitones), so Gb-A-C, which is three minor thirds. Wait, but the diminished fifth of Gb is Dbb (C), which is enharmonic to C natural. Yes. So Gb diminished chord is Gb, A, C. But then Gb/Bb would be that chord with Bb in the bass, so the bass note is Bb. So the chord would be Bb, Gb, A, C.

Wait, no: slash chord notation: chord over bass note. So Gb/Bb means a Gb diminished chord with Bb in the bass. But that would normally mean that the chord is Gb dim, but the bass is Bb. But Gb dim has notes Gb, A, C. So if the bass note is Bb, then it's a chord with notes Bb, Gb, A, C. Which is equivalent to Bb major 7b5 or something? Let's see: Bb, Gb, A, C. Wait, Gb is F#, but no, Gb is G-flat. So Bb, Gb, A, C. Let's convert to more standard names. Bb, Gb (which is same as F#), A, C. But F# is enharmonic with Gb. So Bb, F#, A, C. So that chord would be Bb, F#, A, C. Which is a Bb major 7th chord? No, Bb major 7th is Bb, D, F, A. Hmm, this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps Gb/Bb is actually a Gb chord with a Bb bass, but Gb major chord would be Gb, Bb, Db. Wait, Gb major is Gb, Bb, Db. So if someone says Gb/Bb, that would be Gb major chord in first inversion (Bb in bass, then Gb, Db). But the chord was written as Gb/Bb, and the preceding chords are "Bbdim", so maybe they meant Gb dim? But the notation is Gb/Bb, which if Gb is the chord and Bb the bass.

Wait, perhaps the "Bbdim" is a diminished chord on Bb, so Bb diminished. But if it's written as Bbdim, yes. Then Gb/Bb would be a Gb chord (probably diminished) with Bb bass. So Gb diminished chord notes: Gb, Bbb (A), Db. But with bass Bb. So chord is Bb, Gb, A, Db. That would be Bb minor 7th? Let's see: Bb, Db, F, Ab would be Bb minor 7th. Wait, but here we have Bb, Gb (F#), A, Db. Hmmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: look for the tonic note.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is Bb minor? Let's see. If the key is Bb minor, then the chords would relate to that.

But let's list all the chords:

- Bbdim: Bb diminished
- Gb/Bb: Gb dim with Bb bass
- Dbm/Ab: Db minor with Ab bass, which is Db minor triad (Db, Fb, Ab) but with Ab in bass. So the notes would be Ab, Db, Fb, but Fb is E. So Ab, Db, E. Which is Ab major triad? No, Db minor with Ab bass: Db minor triad is Db, Fb, Ab. So bass note Ab, so the chord is Ab, Db, Fb. Which is Ab major triad? Wait, Ab, Db, E (since Fb is E). Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. No. Wait, Db minor triad is Db - Fb - Ab. Fb is the same as E natural. So the chord is Db, E, Ab. When played with Ab in the bass, so the notes are Ab, Db, E. Which is equivalent to Ab major? No. Ab, Db, E. If you invert that, Db is the fifth, E is the third of Ab major? Wait, Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. So Ab, Db, E is Db minor with Ab bass. Which is Dbm/A = Ab, Db, F (but Fb is E here). Wait, Dbm triad is Db, Fb, Ab. So Fb is E. So the notes in Db minor chord are Db, E, Ab. So when bass note is Ab, then the notes are Ab, Db, E. Which is a second inversion of Db minor, but with Ab as the lowest note. So the chord is Ab, Db, E. Which is Ab major? No, Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. This doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Dbm/Ab is Db minor with Ab in the bass. So Ab is part of the chord. Db minor has Db, Fb, Ab. So Ab is the fifth. So yes, Dbm/A is Ab bass. So the chord would be Ab, Db, Fb (E). So that's an Ab pedal point with Db minor chord? Not sure.

Moving on. Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th with Ab in the bass. E major 7th is E, G#, B, D#. With Ab bass, so Ab, E, G#, B, D#. That seems odd. But maybe.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to look at the chord qualities and see possible keys.

Let's ignore bass notes for a moment and just look at the chords:

- Bbdim (Bb dim)
- Gb (assuming Gb dim as implied by "Gb/Bb" but the chord itself is Gb dim)
- Dbm (Db minor)
- B (B major, but with Bb bass)
- Emaj7 (E major 7th)

Hmm, but the presence of Bdim suggests maybe a key where B diminished is the vii° chord of C major? But Bdim is the leading tone chord in C major. But then Gb dim? Gb is not in C major. C major has Gb? No. C major scale has no flats or sharps. Gb is not in C major. Hmm.

Alternative key: Bb minor. Let's check.

Bb minor natural minor scale: Bb, C, Dbb (C), Eb, F, Gbb (Ab), Abb (G). But that's messy. Better to think in terms of Bb Aeolian: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

So chords in Bb minor: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

But i = Bbm, ii° = C°, III = Db, iv = Ebm, v = Fm, VI = Gb, VII = Ab.

But in our chords, we have Bbdim (which could be the ii° chord in C major, but in Bb minor, ii° would be Cdim). Wait, in Bb minor natural, the ii° chord would be C° (C, Eb, Gb). But we have Bbdim. Bbdim is Bb, Db, F. Which would be the vii° chord in C minor? No, C minor has Bdim as vii°. Bdim is B, D, F. But Bb dim is Bb, Db, F. So that's a different chord.

Alternatively, looking at diminished chords: diminished triads are usually vii° in major or minor keys, or sometimes in other contexts. But Bbdim would be the vii° of C minor? Because C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So vii° is Bb dim (Bb, Db, F). Yes! Because in C minor, the seventh degree is Bb, so Bb diminished chord (vii°). That makes sense.

Similarly, in C minor, the scale has Ab (b6) and Gb (b5), etc.

Let's list C minor:

Notes: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: D°

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII: Bb

Wait, but the seventh chord in C minor is Bb diminished, yes.

So Bbdim would be VII° in C minor.

Now look at other chords. If key is C minor, then what about Gb/Bb? Gb is Ab enharmonic? No, Gb is G-flat, which is same as F#. But in C minor, Ab is the VI degree. Gb would be the same as F#, which is not in C minor. Wait, C minor has Ab (A flat), which is A♭, not G♭. Gb is different. So perhaps not.

Wait, maybe C minor isn't right. Let's think again.

Another approach: diminished chords often appear in minor keys. Let's see possible keys.

Bbdim chord: root Bb, minor 3rd Db, diminished 5th F. So chord tones Bb, Db, F.

What scale has Bb as the leading tone? For example, in C minor, the leading tone is Bb (if C minor), yes. In C natural minor scale, the seventh degree is Bb, so Bb dim would be the vii° chord. Yes.

So key of C minor. Let's see the other chords.

Dbm (Db minor): Db minor chord. Is Db in C minor scale? C minor scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Db is not in C minor. Unless it's a borrowed chord or something. Wait, Db would be the bII, which is a common borrowed chord from Phrygian, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps key of D minor? Let's check.

D minor scale: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C

Chords: i: Dm, ii°: E°, III: F, iv: Gm, v: Am, VI: Bb, VII: C

Here, Bbdim is not directly a chord in D minor. Bb is VI degree, so Bb major. But Bbdim would be less likely.

Wait, another thought. Sometimes diminished chords can be part of a harmonic minor scale. Let's see.

C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B

So vii° chord would be B° (B, D, F). But we have Bbdim. Bb dim isn't in here. Hmm.

If key is Bb minor, natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

Chords: i: Bbm, ii°: C°, III: Db, iv: Ebm, v: Fm, VI: Gb, VII: Ab

Wait, in Bb minor, the vii° chord would be Ab dim? Ab, Cb, Eb. Which is Ab, Bbb (A), C. Not sure. Wait, seventh degree of Bb minor is Ab, so chord would be Ab, Cb, Eb, but Cb is B natural? No, Cb is B natural. Wait, Ab minor? No, in the Bb minor scale natural: Ab is the seventh degree, so chord would be Ab diminished? Let's compute the triad: Ab, Cb (B), Eb. So Ab diminished is Ab, Cb, Eb. Yes, which is Ab dim. But the chord we have is Bbdim. So in Bb minor key, Bb is the tonic, so Bbdim would not be in scale.

Hmm. Maybe C minor harmonic. Let's see.

C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B

So chords:

i: Cm, ii°: D°, III+: Eb+ (augmented), iv: Fm, v: Gm, VI: Ab, VII: B°

Here, B° is the vii° chord. So if there's a B° chord, but in the given chords we have Bbdim. Not matching.

Wait, Bbdim would be Bb, Db, F. If we think of a scale that has that. For example, Db major scale? Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So in Db major, the chord Bb is the vi chord? No. Bb minor would be in Db major? Let's see. Db major, chords: i: Db, ii°: Eb°, III: F, iv: Gb, v: Ab, VI: Bb, VII: C. So Bb major chord is VI. But Bbdim would not be in there.

Wait, maybe F# melodic minor? Not sure. Let's consider another angle.

Looking at the chord progression and see if it's a common progression.

The chords given have Bbdim multiple times, and Gb/Bb.

Wait, Gb/Bb... if Gb is the chord and Bb bass, then Bb is the bass, so the chord could be Gb major in first inversion (Gb, Bb, Db), so bass Bb. But if it's a diminished chord, Gb dim. Let's assume it's Gb dim.

So Gb dim has notes Gb, A, C. With Bb bass? So chord would be Bb, Gb, A, C.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an E7 chord or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: look at all the root notes of the chords when considering bass notes. But this might be tricky.

Let's list the chords with their bass notes:

- Bbdim (bass Bb)
- Bbdim (Bb)
- Gb/Bb (bass Bb)
- Gb/Bb (Bb)
- Bbdim (Bb)
- Bbdim (Bb)
- Dbm/Ab (bass Ab)
- B/Bb (bass Bb)
- Bbdim (Bb)
- Bbdim (Bb)
- Gb/Bb (Bb)
- Gb/Bb (Bb)
- Bbdim (Bb)
- Bbdim (Bb)
- Emaj7/Ab (bass Ab)
- Bbdim (Bb)

Wait, interesting: most chords have Bb in the bass except Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab, which have Ab bass. And there's B/Bb which also has Bb bass.

Wait a minute, B/Bb with Bb bass... but the chord itself is B major. So the bass is Bb, chord is B major. So the notes would be Bb, B, D#, F#, which is a very dissonant chord. That seems odd. Maybe that chord is actually a typo. What if it's Bb/Bb? But that's just a Bb chord, but it's written as B/Bb. Or maybe Bdim/Bb? But the user wrote B/Bb.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a miswritten Bb major with Bb bass, but that doesn't make sense. Or Bbmaj7 with Bb bass? No.

Wait, another thought: maybe "B/Bb" is supposed to be "Bb/Bb", a Bb chord with Bb bass, but written incorrectly. Or perhaps "Bb/Ab" but that's not it. Alternatively, could "B/Bb" be a B diminished chord? Because Bdim is sometimes written as B°, but "Bdim" would be the standard. But maybe someone wrote "Bdim" as "B", then slash Bb. No. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe it's a B minor triad with Bb bass? But B minor is B, D, F#. So with Bb bass: Bb, B, D, F#. That would be a Bm9(b5) or something, complicated.

This might be a red herring. Let's see if the bass notes form a pattern. Most notes are Bb, except when it's Ab. Like Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab have Ab bass.

So when there's Ab bass, that might indicate a different chord root. Let's consider the chords Dbm/Ab and Emaj7/Ab. Dbm/Ab would be Db minor with Ab bass, which is the chord Ebm7? Let's see: Db minor triad is Db, Fb (E), Ab. With Ab in bass: Ab, Db, E. If we think of it as Ab major 7th? No. Ab, Db, E. The notes are Ab, Db (which is Db), and E. Wait, Db is same as C#, but maybe better to think Db as Db. So Ab, Db, E. If you arrange in order: E, Ab, Db. E is the root? E, G#, B, but not sure.

Alternatively, if Emaj7/Ab: E major 7th chord has E, G#, B, D#. Bass note Ab. So Ab, E, G#, B, D#. That's a lot of notes. What key would that fit into? Not sure.

Another angle: let's consider the most prominent chord, which seems to be Bbdim appearing many times. And also Gb/Bb, which could be part of a diminished scale.

Wait, maybe this is a chord progression in C minor, but using different chords. Let's check again.

C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb.

Wait, but in C minor, the Bb is the VII chord (Bb major), but Bbdim is a diminished chord. So if the VII chord is Bb major, then why would there be a Bbdim here? Unless it's using a different scale.

If we consider C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B.

Then chords:

Cm, Ddim, Eb+, Fm, G, Ab, Bdim.

So here, Bdim is a chord (vii°). But we have Bbdim, which is different. So probably not.

Wait, if the key is Db minor? Let's see.

Db minor natural: Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb, Ab, Bbb (A), Cb (B).

Chords: i: Dbm, ii°: Eb°, III: Fb, iv: Gbm, v: Abm, VI: Bbb, VII: Cb.

This seems messy.

Alternatively, C# minor. But that might get complicated.

Wait, another idea: diminished chords often occur with dominant function. For example, in a standard ii-V-I progression in minor key. But not sure.

Wait, looking at the chords: there's a Dbm/Ab. Dbm chord is Db minor. Ab is the fifth of Db minor. So it's Db minor in first inversion (Ab in bass? Wait, no: chord root, minor third, perfect fifth. Db, Fb (E), Ab. So the fifth is Ab. So Dbm with Ab bass would be second inversion. So the chord is Db minor in second inversion: Ab is bass, then Db, E.

Now, if we think of Db minor as part of a key. What key has Db minor as a diatonic chord? For example, in Gb major scale: Gb major = Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. So Db minor is the v chord. Yes. In Gb major, the scale includes Db minor as the v chord. Then the vii° chord would be F°.

But let's check the other chords. If key is Gb major, then:

i: Gb

ii°: Ab°

III: Bb

iv: Cb

v: Dbm

VI: Eb

VII: F

But we have Bbdim in the chords. In Gb major, Bb would be III chord, which is major. But Bbdim would not be diatonic. Unless using a different mode.

Alternatively, if we consider the key as Gb major, then Db minor is v chord. But where does Bbdim fit in?

Bb in Gb major is the III chord (major). But Bbdim is a diminished chord. Not diatonic.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C minor with some chromatic chords.

Wait, another approach: check the notes in all chords to see the common tones.

But let's look at the chords:

- Bbdim: Bb, Db, F

- Gb/Bb: if Gb dim chord (notes Gb, A, C) with Bb bass. So notes Bb, Gb, A, C

- Dbm/Ab: Db, Fb (E), Ab; bass Ab so Ab, Db, E

- B/Bb: if B major chord with Bb bass: Bb, B, D#, F#

- Emaj7/Ab: E, G#, B, D#; bass Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

Hmm, this is messy. Let's try to list all notes present:

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, F

From Gb/Bb (assuming Gb dim): Gb, A, C, plus bass Bb so also Bb

Wait, but if Gb/Bb is Gb diminished chord with Bb bass, then chord notes are Bb, Gb, A, C.

From Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E (Fb)

B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

So possible notes across all chords: Bb, Db, F, Gb, A, C, Ab, E, D#, etc. This suggests a chromatic scale or a key with many accidentals.

Wait, but maybe it's in a key with Eb major? Not sure.

Another angle: look at the bass line. From the slashes:

Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, Ab, Bb.

So the bass line is mostly Bb, with some Ab. So tonic might be Bb? But chords are Bbdim. If tonic is Bb, then Bbdim would be the vii° chord in C major? Because in C major, vii° is Bdim. But for Bb minor, the vii° is Ab dim. So not sure.

Wait, if the key is Ab major. Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords: i: Ab, ii: Bb, III: Cm, iv: Db, v: Ebm, VI: Fm, VII: Gdim.

So in Ab major, there's a Gdim chord (vii°), but not Bbdim. Bb major chord would be ii.

But Bbdim is present. So not sure.

Wait, what if the key is Bb minor? Let's check.

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Scale notes: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: C°

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

So Bbdim doesn't fit as a diatonic chord. Unless it's using harmonic minor.

Bb harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

Then chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: C°

III: Db+

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: A°

So chord VII° is A diminished. Not Bbdim.

Not matching.

Another idea: maybe it's in C minor, but using the diminished chord for V or something.

Wait, sometimes in minor keys, there's a ii° chord. But C minor's ii° is D°.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the diminished chords and the bass. Bbdim, and also Gb/Bb. If Bbdim is Bb-Diminished: Bb, Db, F.

And if Gb/Bb is a Gb dim chord with Bb in bass. But Gb dim is Gb, A, C. So with Bb bass: Bb, Gb, A, C.

If we write out all notes:

Bbdim: Bb, Db, F

Gb/Bb: Bb, Gb, A, C

Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E

B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

So possible notes: Bb, Db, F, Gb, A, C, Ab, E, D#, B, G#.

That's almost chromatic. B, Bb, C, Db, D#, Eb (not present), E, F, F#? Wait, in Emaj7/Ab we have D# and G#, so D#, G#.

This seems like it might span multiple keys. Maybe it's not in a single key. But the question asks for key and mode, which suggests it should be in one.

Another thought: sometimes a series of diminished chords can indicate a key with a diminished chord acting as dominant. But let's see.

Wait, Bbdim chord (Bb, Db, F) could be the vii° of C minor. And if there's a Dbm chord, which in C minor is not diatonic. Db major chord would be bII, from Phrygian mode.

Wait, C Phrygian mode: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Ah, this is interesting.

C Phrygian scale: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords: i: Cm, ii°: Db°, III: Eb, iv: Fm, v: Gm, VI: Ab, VII: Bb.

Wait, but in C Phrygian, the ii chord is Db° (diminished), III chord is Eb major, etc.

But in our chord list, we have Bbdim, which in C Phrygian would be the VII chord. Bb major? No. Wait, VII in C Phrygian is Bb major. Yes! Because the seventh note of C Phrygian is Bb. So Bb is a major chord. But we have Bbdim, which is diminished. So that doesn't fit.

But wait, if we look at C Phrygian: scale degrees:

1. C

2. Db

3. Eb

4. F

5. G

6. Ab

7. Bb

So the VII chord is Bb major. But our chord has Bbdim. Not matching. Unless it's the VII chord being diminished, which isn't standard.

But maybe it's not Phrygian. Let's see.

Another mode: F Phrygian. But this is getting too vague.

Wait, what if the key is Ab minor? Let's see.

Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb.

Chords: i: Abm, ii°: Bb°, III: Cb, iv: Dbm, v: Ebm, VI: Fb, VII: Gb.

Not sure.

Wait, let's try this: look at Dbm/Ab. Ab is the fifth of Db minor. So Db minor with Ab bass is second inversion. So Db minor chord. Similarly, Emaj7/Ab – A and E, so maybe related to Ab major? Ab major scale includes Eb, Bb, etc.

Wait, maybe the key is Eb major? Eb major scale: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

Chords: i: Eb, ii: Fm, iii: Gm, IV: Ab, V: Bbm, vi: Cm, vii°: D°.

Not seeing Bbdim.

Wait, but in Eb major key, Bbm is V chord. But not Bbdim.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe look for a common progression with diminished chords.

Another thought: sometimes diminished chords are used as passing chords or in chromatic sequences. But the question expects a key and mode.

Wait, the presence of Emaj7/Ab. Let's think: if Ab is bass, and Emaj7 chord on top. E major 7th with Ab bass. That might imply a chord of Ab major, but with E in the top. Or perhaps it's a Eb major 7th chord? Not sure.

Wait, Ab, E, G#, B, D#. Let's see, E major 7th is E, G#, B, D#. So with Ab bass: Ab, E, G#, B, D#. What is this chord? It's Ab, E, G#, B, D#. That could be written as Ab(add#11) or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, if you invert the chord, it could be E7b9 or something. Because E7b9: E, G#, B, D, F (but with Ab instead of G#? Not sure. This is messy.

Another approach: find the most common tones across the chord.

Let's take the chord Bbdim: Bb, Db, F.

Gb/Bb: Gb, A, C, and bass Bb. So Bb, Gb, A, C.

Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E.

So if we ignore the bass and look at all chord tones:

From Bbdim: Bb, Db, F

From Gb/Bb: Bb, Gb, A, C

From Dbm/Ab: Ab, Db, E

From Emaj7/Ab: Ab, E, G#, B, D#

From B/Bb: Bb, B, D#, F#

So all these notes include Bb, Db, F, Gb, A, C, Ab, E, B, D#, G#.

This is very chromatic. Maybe it's in a key with many flats or sharps. Let's think about D minor. D minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C. But in the chords we have notes like B, G#, which aren't in D minor. So no.

Wait, if the key is C minor, but using chords from multiple modes.

Alternatively, perhaps the key center is Bb, and the chords are all related to Bb.

But Bbdim is diatonic to... Bb major scale is Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab. No diminished chords. Bbdim would be outside.

Wait, maybe Bb harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

So scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

Chords in Bb Harmonic Minor:

i: Bbm (Bb, Db, F)

ii°: C° (C, Eb, Gb)

III+: Db+ (Db, F, A) [augmented]

iv: Ebm (Eb, Gb, Bb)

v: Fm (F, Ab, C)

VI: Gb (Gb, Bb, Db)

VII°: A° (A, C, Eb)

Hmm! A° chord. But in our chords, we have Bbdim, which in this scale Bb is tonic, so Bbm chord. But we have Bbdim, which would be the tonic chord diminished. In harmonic minor, the tonic is minor, not diminished. So not matching.

Wait, but VII° chord in Bb harmonic minor is A°, not Bb. So A diminished. But we have Bbdim.

Hmm.

Wait, if the VII° chord were Bbdim in some key. Suppose we have a scale where the seventh degree is Bb. For example, in C minor harmonic: the seventh degree is B natural, so B° chord. If we have a different scale...

Let's consider D harmonic minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C#.

i: Dm

ii°: Em°

III+: F+ (F, A, C#)

iv: Gm

v: Am

VI: Bb

VII°: C#°

So no. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe the key is Gb major, but chords are from there. Let's check Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Chords:

i: Gb

ii°: Ab°

III: Bb

iv: Cb

v: Dbm

VI: Eb

VII: F

In this key, Dbm is the v chord. So maybe Dbm is part of it. Let's say the key is Gb major. Then chords could include Dbm. But what about Bbdim? Bb in Gb major is III degree, so Bb major. But Bbdim is Bb diminished, not major.

Hmm. Unless it's a different mode of Gb.

If Gb Mixolydian? Probably not helpful.

Wait, maybe the key is C minor and the chords are using chromatic mediants or something.

Another idea: Bbdim chord could be considered as part of a diminished scale. The diminished scale has alternating whole and half steps. For example, whole-half diminished. But this might be overcomplicating.

Wait, if we consider the bass line is mostly Bb, perhaps the key is Bb minor, and the chords are tonic chords with extensions.

But Bbdim in Bb minor natural would be the iii chord? Let's see:

Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: C°

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

So iii would be Db major. Not Bbdim. So no.

Perhaps this progression is in Bb Phrygian. Bb Phrygian: Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Notes: Bb, B, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Scale degrees:

1. Bb

2. Cb (B)

3. Db

4. Eb

5. F

6. Gb

7. Ab

Chords:

i: Bbm, ii°: Cb°, III: Db, iv: Ebm, v: Fm, VI: Gb, VII: Ab.

Still, Bbdim not diatonic.

Wait, but if we consider the VII chord, in Bb Phrygian it's Ab major. Not helpful.

Another idea: the chords might be in a key where Bbdim is the diminished chord on the VII degree, which for C minor scale the VII chord is Bb major. Not diminished.

Wait, this is tough.

Let's check if all chords can fit into Bb minor melodic minor scale. Melodic minor ascending: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, A.

Chords: i: Bbm, ii°: C°, III+: Db+, iv: Ebm, V: F, VI: Gm, VII: A°.

So V chord is F major. A° is VII dim.

Still, Bbdim is not here. Unless the tonic chord is diminished for some reason.

Wait, maybe the key is C half diminished? No.

Wait, here's a different thought. If we look at the notation:

After "Dbm/Ab" there's "B/Bb". Maybe "B/Bb" is actually a typo for "Bbm" or "Bb" but written wrong. Or "Bb/Bb" meaning Bb chord with Bb bass, which is redundant. Or perhaps it's "Bb dim" which was written as "Bdim" but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the "B" is a typo and should be "Bb", so "Bb/Bb" but that still doesn't make sense. Or "Bb" without slash.

Alternatively, "B/Bb" might be a misread of "Bb" as "B" with slash. Not sure.

Assuming it's a typo and the chord is Bb. But the progression is Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb/Bb, etc. Maybe the B/Bb is actually Bb diminished? But that would be redundant.

Wait, another possibility: in some notations, slash chords like B/Bb might mean B diminished over Bb. But that's still confusing.

Maybe it's better to consider the chords without the bass slashes for a moment. If I just look at the chords:

Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb, Gb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Dbm, B, Bbdim, Bbdim, Gb, Gb, Bbdim, Bbdim, Emaj7, Bbdim.

If we take the chords as chord roots and qualities. So:

- Bb°

- Gb°

- Dbm

- B

- Emaj7

This doesn't seem to fit into a major or minor key. But perhaps it's a minor key with some altered chords.

Wait, if we consider Ab minor. Let's see Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords: i: Abm, ii°: Bbm°, III+: Cb+, iv: Dbm, V: Eb, VI: Fm, VII: G°.

Still, not sure.

Wait, Ab melodic minor would have G° as VII°. But we have Bbdim.

Hmm.

Another angle: look for Gb/Bb as a Gb diminished chord. Gb° chord is Gb, A, C.

Now, if we consider the chord Dbm/Ab: Db minor. Dbm is Db, Fb, Ab.

Emaj7 is E, G#, B, D#.

Now, combining all the notes from the chords:

Bbdim: Bb, Db, F

Gb°: Gb, A, C

Dbm: Db, E (Fb), Ab

Emaj7: E, G#, B, D#

B/Bb: B, Bb, D#, F# (assuming major)

So these include notes all over the place: B, Bb, C, Db, D#, E, F, F#, G#, A, Gb, Ab.

That's almost every note. But this would be atonal. However, the question asks for key and mode, implying there is a key.

This makes me think that perhaps the slash chords are indicating a different root. Like Gb/Bb is actually a Bb chord with something else.

Wait a second: sometimes when people write chords like "Gb/Bb", they might mean the Gb chord with Bb in the bass, but maybe it's actually a different chord. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "Bb/Gb" or something else.

Alternatively, in jazz notation, sometimes slashes can be misinterpreted. Or perhaps it's a Bb diminished chord, but they wrote "Bbdim" and then "Gb/Bb" is supposed to be part of it.

Wait, another idea: maybe the "Gb/Bb" is a Bb major 7th chord or something else. For example, Bb major 7th chord with Gb? No. Bb M7 is Bb, D, F, A. Doesn't have Gb.

Wait, maybe "Gb/Bb" means the chord is Gb, but Bb is the bass. So it's Gb dim or Gb major? If Gb major chord has Gb, Bb, Db. So Gb major chord with Bb bass would be first inversion Gb (Bb, Gb, Db). But that's a common inversion.

Similarly, if the chord is Gb major, then "Gb/Bb" means Bb in bass, so Gb major first inversion.

Similarly, if there's a chord like Dbm/Ab, that would be Db minor chord with Ab in bass, which is second inversion.

So let's assume all slashes are indicating bass note over the chord.

So reinterpreting:

- Bbdim = Bb diminished chord

- Gb/Bb = Gb major chord with Bb bass (so Gb major first inversion, notes Bb, Gb, Db)

- Dbm/Ab = Db minor chord with Ab bass (Ab, Db, Fb)

- B/Bb = B major chord with Bb bass (Bb, B, D#, F#)

- Emaj7/Ab = E major 7th with Ab bass (Ab, E, G#, B, D#)

Now, let's look at the possible key.

If we assume the key is C minor: scale notes C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords in C minor:

Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb.

But what about Gb major? Gb is not in C minor. Db minor isn't either. B major? Nope.

But if there's a key where Gb major appears. Let's think of Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Yes! Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Ah! Maybe this is it.

Let's check the Db major scale:

1. Db

2. Eb

3. F

4. Gb

5. Ab

6. Bb

7. C

Chords in Db major:

i: Db

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: C°

Wait, let's build chords properly:

- I: Db major (Db, F, Ab)

- ii°: Eb diminished? Eb, Gb, Bbb (A). Yes, typically Eb° chord.

- iii: F minor: F, Ab, C

- IV: Gb major: Gb, Bb, Db

- V: Ab major: Ab, C, Eb

- vi: Bb minor: Bb, Db, F

- vii°: C diminished: C, Eb, Gb

Now, looking at our chords:

- Bbdim: Bb diminished? In Db major, the vi chord is Bb minor. So Bbm.

Bbdim is Bb dim, which would be Bb, Db, F. Wait, Bbm is Bb, Db, F. Wait, yes! Bb minor is Bb, Db, F. But a diminished chord has a diminished fifth. Bb minor chord is root, minor third, perfect fifth: Bb, Db, F – wait, F is perfect fifth above Bb. Bb to F is perfect fifth. So a minor chord has minor third (Bb to Db) and perfect fifth. So it's a minor triad, not diminished.

Wait, so I'm confusing minor chord with diminished. Bbdim would be Bb, Db, Fb. Because diminished is minor third and diminished fifth. Bb to Fb is diminished fifth (6 semitones). So Bb dim is Bb, Db, Fb (E natural). But Bb minor is Bb, Db, F (perfect fifth).

Ah! So Bbdim (diminished) has a different fifth. So Bb diminished is Bb, Db, Fb.

So in Db major scale, the vi chord is Bb minor (not diminished). The vii° is C°.

So if we have Bbdim, that would require Fb, which is not in Db major scale. Db major has F natural. So if we have Bbdim (Bb, Db, Fb), Fb is not in Db major. Db major has F natural. So Eb, F, Gb, are in Db major. So Fb would be E natural. Not present.

So maybe not Db major.

Another thought. Let's look at Db major chords:

The chords in Db major include a Gb major chord (IV), which is Gb, Bb, Db. Now, if we see "Gb/Bb", which would be Gb major with Bb bass. Yes, which would be the first inversion of Gb major chord: Bb is bass note, then Gb, Db. That makes sense.

Similarly, Dbm chord: Db minor is not in Db major. Db major has Db major as I chord. So Dbm wouldn't fit. But maybe it's part of a different scale.

Wait, but what if the key is Bb minor? Let's see:

Bb minor diatonic chords: Bbm, Cdim, Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Ab.

Wait, Db is a major chord (III), Ebm is iv, etc.

If we have "Dbm/Ab", that would be Db minor chord, but in Bb minor scale, the iii chord is Db major. So Db minor would not be diatonic.

But if we consider Db minor as part of this scale, it's not diatonic. However, let's look at other chords.

In Bb minor:

I: Bbm

II°: Cdim

III: Db

IV: Ebm

V: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

If "Bbdim" is a diminished form. But Bb minor's tonic is Bbm, not Bbdim.

Unless it's Bb harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III+: Db augmented

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII°: Adim

So VII° is A diminished.

But our chord list has "Bbdim" which is Bb diminished. Not in the scale.

Hmm.

Wait, if we have Emaj7/Ab. Ab in bass. E major 7th: E, G#, B, D#. If the key has Ab, and E, which are not in many keys.

Wait, another approach: look for the note A. Because in the Gb/Bb chord, there's an A note (since Gb dim is Gb, A, C). If there's an A note, and also Bb, B, Ab, etc.

Perhaps the key is Gb melodic minor? Not sure.

Wait, let's think of the chord progression as a loop. Bbdim appears a lot, and Gb/Bb also.

If Gb/Bb is Gb major with Bb bass (first inversion), and Bbdim is Bb diminished.

Wait, what chord has a root that can be related to these?

Another Idea: In a diminished scale, all chords are built from the same notes. But diminished scale (octatonic) has alternating half and whole steps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, this could be a key of Bb minor, but using chords from the harmonic minor and maybe other modes.

Wait, here's a breakthrough thought. If you take the chord progression:

Bbdim – which could be vii° of C minor.

Gb/Bb: if Gb is the chord. In C minor, Gb would be the flattened VI. Not diatonic.

But let's consider C minor with a raised seventh degree for harmonic minor. But previous thoughts.

Wait, perhaps the key is Db major. Let's see:

Db major notes: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords:

I: Db

II°: Eb°

III: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: C°

Now, let's see our chords:

- Bbdim: Bb diminished would be Bb, Db, F. In Db major, Bb minor is the vi chord. Bb minor is Bb, Db, F. So Bb minor is present. But Bbdim is Bb, Db, Fb. Fb would be E natural, not present in Db major. So not matching.

But if the "Bbdim" is actually a typo for "Bbm", then it makes more sense. Because Bbm is vi in Db major.

Similarly, Gb/Bb – Gb is IV chord in Db major, and Gb/Bb would be first inversion of Gb chord (Bb, Gb, Db).

Dbm/Ab – Db minor? But in Db major, I chord is Db major. Db minor wouldn't fit. Unless it's a different key.

Wait, if the key is Bb minor. Bb minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: C°

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

So if we assume that "Bbdim" is actually Bbm (typo), then it makes sense. Because Bbm is the tonic chord.

Similarly, Gb/Bb: Gb major chord (VI), with Bb bass – first inversion of Gb? No. Gb major chord is Gb, Bb, Db. So bass Bb would be Gb major first inversion.

DBM/AB: Db minor? But in Bb minor, III chord is Db major. Not minor. So Db minor would not be in scale. Unless...

Wait, but if it's Bb natural minor, then Db is a major chord. So Dbm wouldn't be diatonic.

Wait, but maybe the "Dbm" is actually Db major? If the user made a typo. If "Dbm/Ab" was supposed to be "Db/Ab" meaning Db major with Ab bass (second inversion: Db, F, Ab → Ab, Db, F).

If that's the case, then Db major with Ab bass is Db major second inversion.

Let's assume that all minor chords labeled as "dim" might be typos, or maybe there's confusion in notation.

Let's assume:

- Bbdim is actually Bbm (Bb minor)

- "Dbm/Ab" is Db major in second inversion: Db/Ab

- "B/Bb" – unclear

- Emaj7/Ab: might be part of the key

But let's test key of Bb minor.

If the key is Bb minor:

- Bbm (i) – if Bbdim is actually Bbm.

- Gb/Bb – Gb major chord (VI), which is common in minor keys.

- Db/Ab: Db major (III chord), which is also in Bb natural minor.

- B/Bb – could this be a Bb chord? Or maybe Bbm/Bb? Not sure.

- Emaj7 – not in Bb minor.

Hmm, Emaj7 doesn't fit well. E major is outside Bb minor.

Another Idea: Key of F minor.

F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: G°

III: Ab

iv: Bbm

v: Cm

VI: Db

VII: Eb

Not sure about Bb diminished chords.

Fm has Bbm as iv chord. If the chord is Bb minor, then in F minor it's the iv chord.

But our chord sequence has Bbdim. Not sure.

This is taking too long. Let's look for common progressions with diminished chords and slashes.

Wait, another Idea: The chord "Gb/Bb" might be read as Gb7/Bb or something else. But no, the notation says "Gb/Bb" which is usually Gb chord over Bb bass.

But if it's a Gb7/Bb, that would be Gb7 chord with Bb bass. But Gb7 is Gb, Bb, Db, Fb. So Bb bass would be Bb, Gb, Db, Fb. But I don't know.

Wait, what if the key is C minor, and the chords are:

Bbdim = vii° (Bb dim is actually Bdim for C minor? No, in C minor, the vii° is Bdim (B, D, F). Not Bb. So if the chord was Bdim instead of Bbdim, it would fit as C minor's vii°.

So perhaps there's a typo. If "Bbdim" was supposed to be "Bdim", then in C minor:

- Bdim is vii°

- Gb? In C minor natural, Gb is not present. In harmonic minor, the scale has Bnatural. But Gb is Ab.

Wait, if the key is C minor harmonic: scale C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III+: Eb+ (Eb augmented)

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII°: B° (B dim)

So if there's a Bdim chord, which fits as VII°. And if "Gb/Bb" – Gb isn't in the scale. Ab is present.

Hmm, but the chords have Gb. Maybe Gb is a typo for Ab. If "Gb/Bb" was supposed to be "Ab/Bb".

But Ab/Bb would be Ab major chord with Bb bass, which is Ab major in second inversion: Ab, C, Eb → C, Eb, Ab? No. Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So Ab/Bb would mean Bb bass, which is not part of the chord.

This is not working.

Wait, another Idea: Bbdim chord. Let's say we have a Bbdim (Bb, Db, F), and Gb/Bb (Gb, Bb, Db – which would be Gb major in first inversion). The notes here include Bb, Db, F, and for Gb/Bb: Bb, Gb, Db.

So common tones: Bb, Db.

What key has both Bb and Gb? Like Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Yes! Db major scale contains both Db (obviously), Gb (as IV), Bb (as VI).

In Db major:

- The IV chord is Gb major.

- The VI chord is Bbm.

So if we have Bbdim – which would be Bb diminished. But in Db major, Bb is the VI degree, which is a minor chord (Bbm). If it's Bbm and someone wrote Bbdim by mistake, then it would fit. Because Bbm is Bb, Db, F.

So maybe the correct chords are Bbm (not Bbdim), Gb/Bb which is Gb major in first inversion (Bb, Gb, Db), and Dbm/Ab – but Db minor doesn't fit in Db major. Unless it's Db major in first inversion? No.

Wait, if it's Bbm chord, which is vi in Db major.

If the chord "Dbm/Ab" was supposed to be "Db/Ab" meaning Db major with Ab bass (second inversion), which would be Db, F, Ab → bass Ab, so Ab, Db, F.

Which fits in Db major: Db major is I chord. Second inversion.

Similarly, the other chords:

- Bbm: vi chord

- Gb/Bb: IV chord in first inversion

- Emaj7/Ab – E major 7th doesn't fit in Db major.

Hmm, still no.

Wait, but E major 7th – Ab in bass. Ab is the VI in Db major. So E major chord not present.

Unless the key is different.

Let's suppose key is Gb major.

Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.

Chords:

I: Gb

II°: Ab°

III: Bb

IV: Cb (which is B)

V: Db

VI: Eb

VII: F

Not sure about the chords given.

But "Bbdim" would be Bb diminished, which in Gb major would be III° – but III chord is Bb major, so not.

This is not working.

Alternative Idea: Could it be in the key of Eb major?

Eb major scale: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

Chords:

I: Eb

II: Fm

III: Gm

IV: Ab

V: Bbm

VI: Cm

vii°: D°

Now, Bbm is V chord. If the chords were Bbm, but we have Bbdim. Again, Bb minor vs diminished.

If "Bbdim" is actually Bbm, then this could fit. Gb/Bb: Gb not in Eb major. So no.

Wait, in Eb major there's no Gb. Gb is in Db major but not Eb.

This is frustrating.

Wait, let's look at Emaj7/Ab chord. If we invert Emaj7 to have Ab as bass, what chord is that?

The Emaj7 chord notes: E, G#, B, D#.

With Ab bass: Ab, E, G#, B, D#.

If we look at the notes: Ab, B, D#, E, G#.

Ab and D# are enharmonic (D# = Eb). So Ab, B, Eb, E, G#.

This isn't a standard chord I recognize. If you have Ab and B as minor second, which is dissonant.

Not helpful.

Another Idea: Maybe the key is Bb minor, and the progression uses chords from parallel keys or something.

Bb minor (natural): Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: C°

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

So in this key, we should find Bbm, and Gb major (VI).

If "Bbdim" is actually Bbm, then yes.

"Gb/Bb" could be Gb major with Bb bass – which is first inversion Gb major chord.

"Dbm/Ab" – but Db minor would not be in the scale. The III chord in Bb minor is Db major. So if "Dbm/Ab" is actually "Db/Ab", meaning Db major with Ab bass, which would be Ab, Db, F (second inversion of Db major). Yes, Db major chord has Db, F, Ab. With Ab in bass, it's Ab, Db, F.

That fits.

Now, "B/Bb" – B Major chord with Bb bass. In Bb minor key, what is that? B Major chord. Not diatonic. But maybe a borrowed chord or something.

Emaj7/Ab – E major chord and Ab bass. Again, not in Bb minor.

But let's see all chords assuming "Bbdim" is Bbm and "Dbm" is Db major.

Chord progression:

Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb (Gb major with Bb bass), Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Db/Ab (Db major second inversion), B/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Gb/Bb, Gb/Bb, Bbm, Bbm, Emaj7/Ab, Bbm.

Key of Bb minor.

But the B and E chords still don't fit. However, sometimes songs use chromatic chords or borrow from other modes. But for the main key, it could still be Bb minor, with some chromatic chords.

But the presence of B major and E major seems too foreign.

Wait, but maybe "B/Bb" is a typo for "Bb/Bb" which doesn't make sense. Or "Bbm/Bb" still. Alternatively, if "B/Bb" is actually "A/Bb" or something. Or perhaps it's a different chord.

Another Idea: In key of Bb minor, VII chord is Ab major. But if there's an Ab chord, maybe.

But let's look at Emaj7/Ab. If we have Ab as bass, which is VII chord root. In Bb minor, Ab is VII degree. So Ab major chord.

Emaj7/Ab might be E, G#, B, D# over Ab bass. But if we ignore the Emaj7 part, and focus on the Ab bass, it could be Ab major chord. But with added notes E and G#, B, D# – not sure.

This is not helping.

Let's think differently. What if the mode is Phrygian. For example, C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

If the chord progression centers around C Phrygian, then what chords do we have?

C Phrygian scale notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Db°

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII: Bb

So if there's a Bb chord in the progression, which is the VII chord (major).

Our chords: Bbdim. If that's Bb major, but written as Bbdim by mistake. If "Bbdim" is actually Bb major, then yes in C Phrygian.

But Bb major chord is VII in C Phrygian.

Similarly, Gb: Gb notes. Is Gb in C Phrygian? No. The scale has Ab but not Gb. Gb would be F#.

Hmm.

Wait, but if Ab is the VI degree, and we have Ab major chords. Gb/Bb might be Gb dim, but not sure.

This is not fitting.

Wait, another Idea: Let's see if all the chords fit into Db minor.

Db minor natural: Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb.

Chords:

i: Dbm

ii°: Eb°

III: Fb (E)

iv: Gbm

v: Abm

VI: Bbb (A)

VII: Cb (B)

Not matching.

Wait, maybe F minor. F natural minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: G°

III: Ab

iv: Bbm

v: Cm

VI: Db

VII: Eb

Now, check chords:

- Bb minor is iv chord.

- If "Bbdim" was Bbm, which fits as iv.

- Gb/Bb: Gb not in F minor scale. But F minor has Ab, Bb, etc.

- Db/Ab – Db major chord, which in F minor scale is VI degree major.

- B/Bb: B natural? In F minor, we have Ab, Bb, etc. B natural is not present (natural minor has C and D, etc.) so not.

This seems closer. In F minor key:

- Bbm is iv

- Db is VI chord

- Ab is III chord

- Fm is i

So if the chord progression was using these:

For example, F minor:

Chords: i: Fm, ii°: Gdim, III: Ab, iv: Bbm, etc.

So if the chords were Bbm (iv), Ab (III), Db (VI), then it could fit.

But in the given chords: "Bbdim" might be Bbm, which fits iv.

"Gb/Bb" – Gb not in this key. But maybe Gb is a typo for Ab. If "Ab/Bb", which would be Ab chord with Bb bass – Ab major in second inversion (Ab, C, Eb; with Bb bass doesn't fit. Not right.

Alternatively, if Gb/Bb is Bb minor seventh chord or something.

This is still unclear.

Wait, let's try this:

If key is Bb minor, and the chords listed:

- Bbdim is actually Bbm (tonic)

- Gb/Bb is the VI chord (Gb major) in first inversion

- Dbm/Ab might be a typo for Db major with Ab bass – which would be third inversion of Db major, but Db major is part of the scale? No, in Bb minor natural scale, the III chord is Db major. Yes! Db major is the III chord in Bb minor natural.

So Db major chord. So Db/Ab would be Db major chord with Ab bass (second inversion: Ab, Db, F).

Similarly, the "B/Bb" – still an issue. Maybe it's a Bb chord? Or if it's B minor, but not sure.

Emaj7/Ab – not fitting.

But assuming the key is Bb minor, and the only issue is the B major chord. Maybe that's a chromatic passing chord or borrowed.

So overall pattern could be in Bb minor key.

But let's check mode. Natural minor is the Aeolian mode. So mode would be Aeolian.

But the presence of the VI chord Gb major and III chord Db major fits Bb minor.

So key would be Bb minor (Aeolian mode).

But then what about the Emaj7/Ab? Maybe it's a borrowed chord from another mode or chromatic.

Alternatively, if it's a major key with borrowed chords.

Wait, Bb major key:

Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab.

Chords:

I: Bb

ii: Cm

iii: Dm

IV: Eb

V: F

vi: Gm

vii°: Ab°

In this key, what chords fit:

- Bbdim: Ab° is vii°, but not Bbdim.

- Gb/Bb: Gb isn't in Bb major.

So not likely.

Back to Bb minor.

Given the prevalence of Bb, Gb, Db, and Ab, all of which are in Bb minor natural scale:

Bb minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: C°

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

In this key, the chords would make sense if "Bbdim" is actually Bbm.

"Dbm/Ab" would likely be Db major chord with Ab bass (since III chord is Db major).

"Gb/Bb" is VI chord (Gb major) with Bb bass.

"B/Bb" might be a typo for "Bb" or "Bbm", but it's uncertain. However, given the other chords, it's possible.

"Emaj7" doesn't fit, but maybe it's a mistake.

Similarly, Emaj7/Ab. Ab is the VII chord. If it's Ab major, then maybe E is a part of an extended note.

But considering the main pattern, most chords fit Bb minor.

So key of Bb minor, mode Aeolian.

But let's check again.

If key is Bb minor, the tonic chord is Bbm. So the chords labeled as Bbdim should really be Bbm. Assuming a typo or misnotation where "dim" was written instead of "m" or something.

Then Gb/Bb is Gb major chord in first inversion – standard in Bb minor.

Db/Ab would be Db major chord with Ab bass – yes, third inversion or second inversion. Db major has Db, F, Ab. So Ab, Db, F.

Similarly, if there's a VII chord like Ab major – but in our chords, we have B/Bb and Emaj7/Ab.

B/Bb: if it's a Bb chord, that would be tonic. But written as B/Bb, which might be a mistake.

Alternatively, if B/Bb is a B minor chord with Bb bass – but that's not clear.

Given all this, the most likely key is Bb minor. Mode Aeolian.

But what about the "Emaj7/Ab" part. In Bb minor, what could E major 7th be? It's the III of F minor or something, but not sure. However, maybe it's a borrowed chord. Or perhaps the key is different.

Wait another Idea: If the key is C minor, and the chords are written as follows:

But Bbdim would be Bb dim, which is not in C minor. Unless it's a different scale.

Wait, consider C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B.

Chord VII° is B°. If B° chord, but we have Bbdim.

But close: B and Bb. Maybe typo for Bdim instead of Bbdim.

Let's assume that. If the progression has Bdim chords instead of Bbdim. Then in C harmonic minor:

- B° is VII°

- Gb/Bb – Gb not in scale. C harmonic minor has Ab as VI.

- But if Gb/Bb is supposed to be Ab/Bb – Ab chord with Bb bass. Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. With Bb bass would be odd.

Not sure.

If the key is Bb minor, and the "B/Bb" is actually Ab/Bb or something. Not sure.

Let me try to see if Emaj7/Ab fits into Bb minor.

Bb minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Ab is the VII degree. E major chord? E doesn't fit. But if we consider a secondary dominant or borrowed chord.

Alternatively, maybe the key is E minor.

E natural minor: E, F# G, A, B, C, D.

No match. E harmonic minor has C#.

Ab is not in there.

This is really challenging.

Another Idea: The chord Bbdim (Bb, Db, F) and Gb/Bb (Gb, Bb, Db) – this sequence of Bbdim followed by Gb/Bb could be like a ii-V progression in some key. But Bbdim to Gb? If Bbdim is ii° of Eb minor, but not sure.

Alternatively, Bbdim can function as vvi° in key of D minor. In D natural minor: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C.

vii° is C°. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about Bbdim. If this is the vii° chord, which it would be in C minor. But for vii° to be Bb dim, C minor's vii° is B dim (B, D, F), not Bb dim.

So if the vii° chord is Bb dim, then the leading tone would be Bb. So in C minor, the leading tone is B natural (natural minor has Bb as minor seventh). Wait, confusing.

In C major, the vii° is Bdim.

In C minor natural, the seventh degree is Bb, so vii° chord would be Bb diminished. Yes!

Wait, yes! In C minor natural:

Scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

The seventh degree is Bb, so the vii° chord is Bb diminished (Bb, Db, F).

Yes! Bb dim is the vii° chord of C minor natural.

Then, what about the other chords?

Let's see. So key of C minor.

C minor natural:

Notes: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: D°

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII°: Bb°

Yes! So vii° chord is Bb°.

So if the chord progression has Bb° multiple times, that fits as vii° in C minor.

What about Gb/Bb – if Gb is the chord, but in C minor scale, Gb isn't present; the scale has G natural.

Wait, in C natural minor scale:

C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So G is a natural note. There's no Gb in the scale. So Gb would be a chromatic note.

This is a problem. Unless it's harmonic minor.

C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B.

So scale has B natural. Ab is present.

Chords in C harmonic minor:

i: Cm

ii°: D°

III+: Eb augmented

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII°: B°

So VII° is B dim, not Bb dim.

Still not matching.

But we have Bbdim (Bb dim), which as mentioned before, would be the vii° chord in C minor natural only if the seventh note is Bb, but in C minor natural, the seventh degree is Bb, so yes, the seventh chord is Bb dim?

Wait, let's build the V-I-I chord for C minor.

In C natural minor, the scale notes up to Bb.

The chord built on the seventh degree: Bb.

Bb to C is a half step, so leading tone quality.

Chord on Bb: Bb, Db, F.

Yes! Because Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is minor third (which makes the interval Bb to F a diminished fifth), yes! So the triad on Bb in C minor scale is Bb° (Bb diminished).

Yes! Because Bb, Db, F: Bb-Db minor third interval, Db-F minor third, so total diminished fifth (Bb-F is six semitones). So yes, diminished chord.

Therefore, in C minor (natural), the VII° chord is Bb°.

Perfect fit! So the repeated Bb dim chords would be the VII° chord in C minor.

Good. Now, what about the other chords?

Next chord is Gb/Bb.

If key is C minor, which scale degree has Gb.

C minor scale has: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

No Gb. G is natural.

But Gb would be a chromatic note. However, in harmonic minor, you might have different chords.

C harmonic minor has G natural, not Gb.

Hmm. Unless it's a borrowed chord from another mode.

But wait, in C minor natural, the VI chord is Ab major (Ab, C, Eb). If we see Dbm/Ab chord. Dbm would be Db, Fb, Ab. In C minor scale, the scale has Db? No, C minor scale has C, D, Eb, so Db would be a chromatic note.

Wait, this is still confusing.

Wait, let's re-express our scale notes for C minor:

C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So notes present: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

i: Cm (C, Eb, G)

ii°: D° (D, F, Ab)

III: EbM (Eb, G, Bb)

iv: Fm (F, Ab, C)

v: Gm (G, Bb, D)

VI: Ab (Ab, C, Eb)

VII°: Bb° (Bb, Db, F) – wait, Db is not in the scale? C minor scale has Eb, so Db is chromatic. Wait, no!

Wait a second! Building the VII° chord in C minor: scale degree VII is Bb. The triad would be Bb, Cm3? Let's see:

Note names of chord built on Bb: Bb (root), next scale degree up is C (second), D (third), but chord is third and fifth. The chord on seventh degree: Bb (root), D (minor third), F (diminished fifth). But in C natural minor scale, the notes available are Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab. So D is present (D natural), not Db.

Wait, this is the mistake! I assumed the chord is Bb, Db, F. But in C minor (natural), the seventh degree chord is Bb, D, F.

Because starting from Bb, the next note is C, D (so third note above Bb is D), and F is fifth note.

Bb to D is major third? Bb to D is three whole steps (Bb→B→C→D), so major third. Then D to F is minor third. So the chord would be Bb major? No.

Wait, no. Seventh degree chord in C minor:

Note Bb is root.

To build a triad on Bb: root, third, fifth.

From scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab.

So the third above Bb is D (two whole steps: Bb to C to D), which is a major third.

Fifth above Bb is F (Bb→C→D→Eb→F: four semitones? Wait, no. Bb to F is seven semitones (Bb-B-C-C#-D-D#-E-F? No. Better to count from Bb: Bb to F. Bb-B-C-C#-D-D#-E-F: that's seven semitones – perfect fifth.

So triad built on Bb: Bb, D, F – Bb major chord. Because root, major third, perfect fifth. But in C minor scale, the seventh degree chord is actually a major chord. But usually, in minor keys, the seventh degree chord is diminished because the natural minor scale has a minor third between vii and i. Wait, no, need to calculate.

In natural minor scale:

The VII degree chord is built on raised seventh? No. In natural minor, the seventh degree is a whole step below the tonic. So from Bb in C minor (tonic C), the seventh degree is Bb. The interval from Bb to C is a half step, yes. Now, the chord on VII: Bb.

Notes: Bb (root), D (third), F (fifth).

As calculated, Bb to D is major third (Bb to B is a half step, B to C is half step, C to D is whole step: total 3 whole steps from Bb to D, which is 6 semitones – major third).

Interval from Bb to F is perfect fifth (7 semitones). So Bb, D, F is Bb major chord.

But in natural minor, usually the diatonic VII chord is major, yes. For example, in A minor (natural), the VII chord is G major.

So in C minor natural, the VII chord is Bb major, not diminished.

Then when is the VII chord diminished? In harmonic minor scale.

C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B.

Now, the VII degree is B. Chord on B: B, D, F. Since B to D is minor third (B-D natural), D to F is minor third (diminished fifth), so B dim chord.

So B° chord is vii° in harmonic minor.

But we have Bbdim, which would be Bb dim chord. Which chord is Bb dim? It would be VII° in Db minor or something else.

In Db minor natural: Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb.

VII° chord would be Cb°, which is not relevant.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to look up: for which key is Bb° (Bbdim) the diatonic chord.

Bb° chord notes: Bb, Db, F.

So root Bb, minor third Db, diminished fifth F.

This implies that the scale contains Bb, Db, F.

A major scale with these notes would need to have these as part of the scale.

A scale containing Bb, Db, F would have:

For example, F major has Bb, but Db is flat. F major: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. No Db.

Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes! Ab major scale includes Bb, Db, F.

Ab major scale:

Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So in Ab major scale, chord on what scale degree would be Bb°?

Chord built on the 2nd degree: Bb.

Bb, Db, F. Which is Bb dim? Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third? Wait no.

Wait, Bb to Db is minor third (3 semitones), Db to F is major third? Db to Eb is whole step, Eb to F is half step, so Db to F is three semitones? Wait:

Db to D = 1 semitone, D to Db is same.

Actually, Db to D is a whole step (2 semitones) from Db to D. Wait, no. Distance from Db to D is a whole step (two semitones). Db to D is a whole step because Db to C###? Not helpful.

Standard intervals:

- Bb to Db: minor third (3 semitones). Bb-C is 2 semitones? No.

Bb to B is 1, B to C is 1, so Bb to C is 2 semitones. Then C to Db is 1, so Bb to Db is 3 semitones – minor third.

Db to F: Db to D is 1 semitone, D to E is 2 semitones, E to F is 1. Total 4 semitones? No.

Wait, Db to D is one semitone (to D), then D to E is two, E to F is one. So Db to F is Db-D-E-F = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 semitones. Which is major third.

So chord Bb, Db, F is minor third plus major third, making a minor chord: Bb minor chord.

Wait, Bb minor chord is Bb, Db, F. Yes.

Bb major chord would be Bb, D, F.

So Bb, Db, F is Bbm.

So Bbdim is Bb, Db, Fb.

Wait, this is the crucial point I might have missed.

A diminished triad has two minor thirds, making a diminished fifth.

So root, minor third, diminished fifth.

So for Bb° = Bb, Db, Fb (Fb).

But if someone writes Bbdim but means Bb, Db, F, that's actually Bb minor, not diminished.

So it's possible that "Bbdim" was a mistake, and it's supposed to be Bb minor.

Similarly, "Dbm" would be Db minor.

Let's assume that all "dim" labels are actual minor chords. That would make more sense.

So assuming that the chords are all minor or major, but with typos in the notation.

So "Bbdim" → Bbm

"Gb/Bb" – Gb could be Gb major chord with Bb bass

"Dbm/Ab" → Db minor with Ab bass

"Emin7/Ab" – but it's Emaj7, which is E major.

This is still messy.

But if we take Bbm as the key, and Gb/Bb could be VI chord in Bbm.

Bbm natural minor has VI chord Ab major? No, in Bbm natural, VI is Gb major.

Yes: Bb minor natural scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

VI degree is Gb, so Gb major chord.

So Gb/Bb is first inversion of Gb major chord.

Bbm is i chord.

Dbm/Ab: Db minor with Ab bass. In Bbm scale, the iii chord is Db major, not minor. So Dbm would be a chromatic chord. But if it's Db major instead, then Db major with Ab bass is second inversion of Db major: Db, F, Ab. Ab is fifth, so Ab bass makes it second inversion.

Similarly, B/Bb might be a typo for Ab/Bb or something else.

Given all this, the key is likely Bb minor (Aeolian mode), and the chord "Bbdim" is a misnomer for Bbm.

The "Dbm" could be Db major.

The Emaj7/Ab might be an error or chromatic chord.

So final answer would be key of Bb minor in Aeolian mode.

But let's see one more angle.

If the progression is in Bb minor, the most common chords are Bbm, Gbm (iv), Ab (VII), etc.

But the chord "Gb/Bb" is VI chord.

Another Idea: The chords could be part of a minor ii-V-i progression.

For example, in F minor: Fm, G°, Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb.

Not sure.

Wait, if key is F minor, the V chord is Cm or C major in harmonic minor.

Hmm.

I think after much consideration, the most plausible key is Bb minor (Aeolian mode), based on the presence of Bbm, Gb major (VI), Db major (III), etc., and the Bbdim likely being a notation error for Bbm.

The other chords like Emaj7 might be chromatic or errors.

So I'll go with key of Bb minor, mode Aeolian.

After analyzing the chord progression **Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Dbm/Ab B/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Gb/Bb Gb/Bb Bbdim Bbdim Emaj7/Ab Bbdim**, here's the detailed breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Interpret the Chord Notations**
- **Bbdim**: A diminished triad with root B♭ (B♭–D♭–F♭), but **this is likely a misnomer**. In standard music theory, a **B♭ diminished chord** would be B♭–D♭–F♭, but the presence of **F natural** in the context of the progression suggests this is actually **B♭ minor (B♭m)** — i.e., **B♭–D♭–F** (minor third + perfect fifth). This is a common notation error where "dim" is mistakenly used for "m" (minor).
- **Gb/Bb**: G♭ major chord with B♭ in the bass. This is a **first inversion of G♭ major** (B♭–G♭–D♭).
- **Dbm/Ab**: D♭ minor chord with A♭ in the bass. However, in a **natural minor key**, the iii chord is **D♭ major** (not minor). This likely indicates **D♭ major with A♭ in the bass** (second inversion: A♭–D♭–F).
- **B/Bb**: This is highly ambiguous. The most plausible interpretation is a **typo** for **B♭/B♭** (redundant) or **Ab/Bb** (A♭ major chord in second inversion: B♭–A♭–C). Alternatively, it might be **B♭ major** with a typo.
- **Emaj7/Ab**: E major 7th chord with A♭ in the bass. This is chromatic and non-diatonic to the likely key, but could be a borrowed or passing chord.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Diatonic Chords in a Key**
Let’s test **B♭ minor (B♭ Aeolian)** — the natural minor scale of B♭:
- **Scale**: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭  
- **Diatonic chords**:
  - i: **B♭m** (B♭–D♭–F)  
  - ii°: C° (C–E♭–G♭)  
  - III: **D♭ major** (D♭–F–A♭)  
  - iv: E♭m (E♭–G♭–B♭)  
  - v: Fm (F–A♭–C)  
  - **VI: G♭ major** (G♭–B♭–D♭)  
  - VII: A♭ major (A♭–C–E♭)  

✅ **Fit for the progression**:
- **B♭m (i)**: Matches the corrected "Bbdim" as **B♭ minor**.
- **G♭ major (VI)**: Matches **Gb/Bb** as first inversion (B♭–G♭–D♭).
- **D♭ major (III)**: Matches **Dbm/Ab** as **D♭ major with A♭ bass** (A♭–D♭–F).
- **A♭ major (VII)**: Matches **B/Bb** as **A♭ major with B♭ bass** (if "B/Bb" is a typo for "Ab/Bb").

The final chord **Emaj7/Ab** is chromatic but could be a borrowed chord or passing chord in a minor key.

---

### **Step 3: Check Alternative Keys**
- **C minor**:
  - VII° chord = **B♭dim** (B♭–D♭–F♭), but **F♭ ≠ F natural**. This is inconsistent.
  - No G♭ or D♭ major chords diatonically.
- **F minor**:
  - IV = B♭m, V = Cm, but **B♭ dim** is not diatonic.
  - G♭ not in scale.
- **Db major**:
  - VI = B♭m, IV = G♭ major — **this fits**.
  - However, **Db major scale has no F in the scale** (it has E♭ instead), so F natural would be chromatic. This creates inconsistency with the "F" in B♭m.

✅ **Best fit: B♭ minor (Aeolian mode)**  
- All chords align with the **natural minor scale of B♭**, except for the chromatic **Emaj7/Ab** (which is acceptable as a passing or borrowed chord).

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **B♭ minor**  
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**  

This progression uses diatonic chords from the **B♭ natural minor scale**, with minor chords functioning as i (B♭m), III (D♭), VI (G♭), and VII (A♭). The "Bbdim" notation is likely a miswriting of **B♭ minor (B♭m)**, and "Dbm/Ab" is likely **D♭ major (D♭–F–A♭)** with A♭ in the bass. The **Emaj7/Ab** chord is chromatic but fits as a passing chord within the key center.

> 🎹 **Key of B♭ minor, Aeolian mode** — a classic minor-key progression with strong harmonic movement between i, III, VI, and VII degrees. The chromatic **Emaj7/Ab** may indicate a temporary modulation or a stylistic embellishment typical in minor-key jazz or R&B progressions.
