Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

> D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – F#m/C# – E7/D – D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – Amaj7/C# – D

### Step 1: Identify the bass notes and implied harmony

Many chords are written with slash notation (e.g., Bm/D), meaning **B minor chord with D in the bass**. This suggests **inversions** or **bass motion**, not necessarily new chords.

Let’s list the **root notes** of each chord (ignoring bass note for now, but noting it for context):

| Chord       | Root | Bass | Function (tentative) |
|-------------|------|------|----------------------|
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| Bm/D        | B    | D    | vi (with inversion)  |
| Bm/D        | B    | D    | vi                   |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| F#m/C#      | F#   | C#   | iii (with inversion) |
| E7/D        | E    | D    | V7 (with suspension/inversion) |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| Bm/D        | B    | D    | vi                   |
| Bm/D        | B    | D    | vi                   |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| Amaj7/C#    | A    | C#   | IVmaj7? (but C# bass) |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |

### Step 2: Look for key center — what is the tonic?

The progression **starts and ends on D**, and **D appears frequently** as the harmonic center.

Also, notice the **B minor** chord — Bm is the **vi chord** in **D major**.

Let’s check what diatonic chords are in **D major**:

**D major scale**: D E F# G A B C#

Diatonic chords:
- I: D
- ii: Em
- iii: F#m
- IV: G
- V: A
- vi: Bm
- vii°: C#°

But we have **E7** and **Amaj7** — neither of these are diatonic to D major.

- **E7** = E G# B D → G# is **not** in D major (D major has G natural)
- **Amaj7** = A C# E G# → C# and G# are **not** in D major

So D major alone **cannot** explain E7 or Amaj7.

→ This suggests **borrowing** or a **modal mixture**, or possibly a **different key**.

---

### Step 3: Consider **D major with chromaticism**, or **D Mixolydian?**

Let’s test **D Mixolydian**: D E F# G A B C (C natural!)

But then E7 = E G# B D — G# is still **not** in D Mixolydian (has G natural). So no.

What about **D major with a borrowed E7**?

E7 is the **dominant of A**, so it could be a **secondary dominant**: **V7/ii**? But ii is Em, not A.

Wait — **E7 → Amaj7**?

E7 is the **V7 of A**, and Amaj7 is **A major 7**, so:

**E7 → Amaj7** = **V7 of IV** in D major?

In D major:

- IV = G
- But we have **Amaj7** — A is the **V** chord in D major. So why is it major 7?

Hold on — **Amaj7** is a **major 7th chord on A**, but in D major, A is the **V chord**, which is normally **A major** (triad), but **A7** (dominant 7) would be expected, not Amaj7.

Amaj7 = A C# E G# — that’s a **bright, colorful** chord — it’s **not** in D major.

But here's a key insight:

### The progression: E7 → Amaj7

- E7 = **E G# B D**
- Amaj7 = **A C# E G#**

They share **E and G#** → so E7 functions as **V7 of A** → tonicizing A.

So **E7 → Amaj7** = **V7/IV → IV**? Wait.

In D major, **IV is G**.

But Amaj7 is not IV — **A is V**.

Wait — **A is V** in D major.

So if we have **E7 → A**, that’s **V7/V → V** (secondary dominant).

Yes! That’s a **classic secondary dominant**:

- **E7 = V7 of A**
- **A = V chord** in D major

So: **V7/V → V**

Then what is **Amaj7**? That’s a **major 7th** on the V chord.

In pop/rock/jazz, it’s common to see **Vmaj7** instead of V7 — especially in ballads or smoother styles. It softens the dominant function.

So **Amaj7** → bending the tradition, but viable as a **colorful V chord**.

Now, **F#m/C#** — F#m = iii chord in D major → C# is the 7th degree, so F#m/C# is **iii6** (first inversion)

Also, **Bm/D** — Bm = vi → D is the 3rd of Bm, so Bm/D = vi6

So all the slash chords are just inversions!

So let’s re-express the progression **without slash notation**, just root movement:

**D – D – Bm – Bm – D – D – F#m – E7 – D – D – Bm – Bm – D – D – Amaj7 – D**

So the chord root progression is:

**D → D → Bm → Bm → D → D → F#m → E7 → D → D → Bm → Bm → D → D → Amaj7 → D**

Now let’s map this in **D major**:

| Chord    | Function in D major |
|----------|---------------------|
| D        | I                   |
| D        | I                   |
| Bm       | vi                  |
| Bm       | vi                  |
| D        | I                   |
| D        | I                   |
| F#m      | iii                 |
| E7       | V7/V (secondary dominant of V) → resolves to |
| D        | I                   |
| D        | I                   |
| Bm       | vi                  |
| Bm       | vi                  |
| D        | I                   |
| D        | I                   |
| **Amaj7**| **Vmaj7** (colorful version of V) |
| D        | I                   |

Wait — **Amaj7** is **A major 7**, which is **not diatonic** to D major, but **A** is diatonic. The **G#** in Amaj7 is the **clue**: D major has **C#**, not **G#**.

D major scale: **D E F# G A B C#**

Amaj7 = A C# E G# → contains **G#**, which is **not** in D major.

G# is the **raised 7th** of F#, or the **major 3rd of E** — but more importantly, **G# is the leading tone of A**, which is the note that Amaj7 is built on.

So Amaj7 is **not** a diatonic chord in D major — it introduces **G#**, which is an **accidental**.

But we already had G# in **E7** (E G# B D) — so the **G# is introduced in E7**, then carried into Amaj7.

So: **E7 has G#** → Amaj7 also has G# → so this is not an accidental — it’s **intentional**.

What key has G# and C#? **D major has C#**, and **E major has G#**, but **D major and E major** are not the same.

Let’s look at the **G#** — it**s** the major 7th in Amaj7 and the major 3rd in E7. So the harmonic area is **centered around A**, perhaps?

But the progression ends on **D**, and D is the most frequent chord.

So perhaps the key is **D major**, but the **V chord is being altered** to **Amaj7** — ie, **borrowed from D major with Lydian or modal mixture?**

Wait — no. A major 7 is not borrowed from D major. It’s borrowing from **A major**, meaning we are **temporarily tonicizing A**.

But the **overall key** is D → because the progression begins and ends in D, and D is home.

Also, Bm (vi) is common.

So:

### Final analysis:

- **Tonic chord**: D (appears 8 times)
- **vi chord**: Bm (appears 4 times) — very common in pop
- **iii chord**: F#m
- **Secondary dominant**: E7 → tonicizing A
- **V chord**: Amaj7 → instead of A or A7, we get Amaj7, which is a **colorful, non-dominant 7th** variant — common in modern pop, R&B, soft rock

The presence of **G#** in E7 and Amaj7 is **borrowed from the key of A major**, but not enough to change the overall key — it's **secondary dominant usage**.

### Is it D major or D minor?

D minor has F natural and C natural — we have F# and C#, so no.

→ Definitely **major tonality**.

### Mode?

The basic harmonic structure suggests **D Ionian (major)**. All chords are either diatonic or secondary dominants.

The **Amaj7** is an **altered V chord**, but it’s doing **tonicizing** work, not changing the mode.

### Conclusion:

> ✅ **Key: D major**  
> ✅ **Mode: Ionian (major)**

The chord progression uses:

- Diatonic chords: D, Bm, F#m
- Secondary dominant: E7 → tonicizing A (V)
- Colorful variant of V: Amaj7 instead of A or A7
- All slash chords are inversions (Bm/D = vi6, F#m/C# = iii6, E7/D = V7/V with bass in root position? Wait — E7/D = E7 with D in bass — which is not standard; E7/D is **E7 in 2nd inversion** if we consider the 3rd (G#) as the root... but this might be a **pedal D** or **bass line motion**.

Wait — **E7/D** = E7 chord with D in the bass. That’s **E7 with a non-chord tone in bass**.

E7 = E G# B D → with D in bass → so bass note D is the **7th of the chord**. So E7/D is **E7 (7th in bass)** — that’s **1st inversion of a dominant 7th chord**, but usually we write dominant 7th chords with root in bass unless specifying voicing.

E7 in 1st inversion is **E7/G#**  
E7 in 2nd inversion is **E7/B**  
E7 in 3rd inversion (7th in bass) is **E7/D**

So E7/D is just a **voicing** — the G# is still the major 3rd — this is fine.

The bass movement: D → D → D → D → D → D → C# → D → D → ... C# → D

This **C#** (in F#m/C# and Amaj7/C#) creates a nice **chromatic bass descent**:  
D → C# → B → A? But we have D → D → D → D → F#m/C# → E7/D → D → D → Amaj7/C# → D

Bass notes:  
D - D - D - D - D - D - **C#** - **D** - D - D - D - D - D - D - **C#** - D

It’s **not a smooth bass line** — but **C#** appears twice as a bass note under F#m and Amaj7.

C# is the **leading tone** to D — so F#m/C# and Amaj7/C# create a **leading-tone motion to D** — very expressive.

This gives the progression emotional color — especially the final Amaj7/C# → D, where C# (leading tone) resolves to D (tonic).

So overall: brilliant use of **color chords** and **leading tone bass motion** within **D major**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: D major**  
> **Mode: Ionian**

The progression is centered in D major, uses diatonic chords, includes secondary dominant (E7) tonicizing the V chord (A), and features expressive non-diatonic color chords (Amaj7, E7) and leading-tone bass motion (C#) to enhance emotional flow — all while remaining firmly in the D major key.
