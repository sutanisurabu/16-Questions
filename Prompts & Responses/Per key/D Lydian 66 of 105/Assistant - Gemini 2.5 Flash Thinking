### Reasoning

**Determining Chord Keys and Modes**

I'm now deep in the analysis, meticulously charting the chord sequence. So far, the repeating D and Bm/D chords are very intriguing. I'm focusing on their relationships to the other chords to ascertain the key and probable mode. I'm paying extra attention to the F#m/C# and E7/D chords, which could offer vital clues.


**Assessing Key Signatures**

Now, I'm examining how each chord functions in relation to D. The frequent appearance of Bm and F#m strongly suggests a D major key. I'm focusing on the Amaj7/C# and E7/D chords as they seem to diverge from a purely diatonic approach. My goal is to determine if we're dealing with D major, or a modal variation thereof.


**Deciphering Scale and Mode**

The presence of G# in Amaj7 and E7 is a key revelation, suggesting alterations to the D major scale. Now, I'm carefully evaluating if this is a modal interchange. The dominant function of E7/D, and the overall progression, leans towards a D key, but with chromaticism.


**Determining Mode Confirmation**

I'm now fully immersed in the Lydian mode, confirming the D Lydian hypothesis by mapping the chord functions. The E7 and Amaj7 chords are clear indicators of this mode. Now, I'm focusing on validating if the progression adheres to this modal characteristic throughout, or if there are unexpected alterations.


**Deciding on Modal Integrity**

I'm now carefully analyzing the harmonic context of each chord within the D Lydian framework. The consistent usage of E7 and Amaj7 firmly establishes the mode, and I'm cross-referencing this to confirm if any unexpected chord alterations exist. This will help confirm the overall structure.


**Concluding Mode and Key**

I'm synthesizing all the analysis, confirming that D is the tonal center, and the persistent G# definitively establishes the Lydian mode. I'm satisfied that I've accurately determined the key and mode of this progression.




This chord progression is defined by its strong D tonic and the specific chromatic harmony used, particularly the characteristic raised 4th degree ($\text{G}\sharp$).

**Analysis:**

1.  **Tonic Identification:** The progression strongly centers on **D Major**. It begins and ends on D, and D is the most frequent chord.
    *   Tonic = D

2.  **Chord Function and Diatonic Scale (D Major: D E F# G A B C#):**
    *   D (I)
    *   Bm (vi)
    *   F#m (iii)
    *   Amaj7, E7

3.  **Crucial Chromatic Notes:** We must examine the chords that fall outside the standard D Major scale:
    *   **E7/D (E G# B D):** The $\text{G}\sharp$ is the defining factor here. In D Major, the 4th degree is G natural. The $\text{G}\sharp$ raises the 4th degree.
    *   **Amaj7/C# (A C# E G#):** Again, the presence of $\text{G}\sharp$ confirms the use of the raised 4th scale degree.

4.  **Mode Determination:** A major scale rooted on D, but featuring the raised 4th degree ($\text{G}\sharp$), is characteristic of the **Lydian Mode**.

    *   **D Lydian Scale:** D – E – F# – $\text{G}\sharp$ – A – B – C#

5.  **Diatonic Chords in D Lydian:**
    *   I = D Major (D F# A)
    *   vi = B minor (B D F#)
    *   iii = F# minor (F# A C#)
    *   V = Amaj7 (A C# E G#) — *Perfect fit for Amaj7*
    *   II dominant (Standard Lydian feature) = E7 (E G# B D) — *Perfect fit for E7*

**Conclusion:**

The tonal center is D, and the use of the $\text{G}\sharp$ requires the raised 4th scale degree, leading unequivocally to the Lydian mode.

**Key and Mode: D Lydian**
