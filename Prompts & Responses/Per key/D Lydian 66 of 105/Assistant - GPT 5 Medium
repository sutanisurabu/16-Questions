### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm trying to determine the key and mode from the chord sequence: "D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D." 

There are many D chords with D in the bass. I've identified the chords: D, Bm/D, F#m/C#, E7/D, and Amaj7/C#. It seems likely to be in D major, but I want to analyze it more closely. 

The chords I see in D major show that G is natural, indicating that A7 fits in the D Mixolydian context too.**Clarifying chord functions**

I’m analyzing the key of D major. I realize that the dominant seventh chord (A7) contains G natural, which is diatonic. The seventh of A is G, fitting within D major. So yes, A7 is diatonic to D major.

I've identified the following chords: D (I), Bm/D (vi over bass), which could be thought of as a first inversion. Additionally, F#m/C# is also in first inversion (iii6), and E7 is made up of E, G#, B, and D. It's interesting how all these interact!**Examining E7 chord function**

Oops, I just realized G# isn’t in D major; instead, it's G natural. E7 actually serves as V/ii, or the dominant of A. So, if E is V of A and A is V of D, E7 becomes the secondary dominant V/V in D major. Since E7 contains G#, it's non-diatonic to D major. 

Also, with E7 over D in the bass, I see it's in third inversion. The bass note D here is the seventh of the E7 chord, which typically resolves to the I6/4 chord.**Exploring Amaj7 and voice leading**

I’m considering standard voice-leading rules where V4/2 typically resolves to I6. However, here, V/V 4/2 resolves to V6 (A/C#), which indeed appears later as Amaj7/C#. 

I see that Amaj7 includes G#, but that note isn’t in D major; it's a chromatic tone. Maybe it's a borrowed chord typical for jazz or pop harmony. It looks like Amaj7/C# means A major 7 with a C# bass, which could fit in D Lydian. In that scale, E major is diatonic and E major (E G# B) fits within this context!**Determining key and mode**

Let’s break this down: E major fits in D Lydian because of the G#. I see the chords: F#m, G# diminished, A major, B minor, and C# minor. E7 includes G#, which is V/V related to A and linked to D Lydian too.

The progression also emphasizes D, and the Amaj7 fits as diatonic in Lydian with G#. Since there's no G natural and Amaj7 indicates G#, it strongly suggests Lydian. Thus, I conclude the key is D Lydian, supported by E7 and Amaj7's presence, confirming the unique cadence.**Finalizing key and mode answer**

The key center is D with the mode being Lydian. I can explain that D is the tonic and the modal color is Lydian, highlighted by chords like Amaj7 and E7, which both contain G# and imply #4 relative to D. 

For a brief Roman numeral mapping, I think I could say: I – vi/I – I – iii6 – II7/7 – I, and note that the E7 to D creates a backdoor plagal cadence typical of Lydian, which is worth mentioning.

D Lydian.

- D is the clear tonal center (constant D bass/returns to D).
- The presence of G# (in E7 and especially Amaj7) gives a raised 4th relative to D, pointing to Lydian rather than Ionian.
- The II→I color (E/E7 to D) and Vmaj7 (Amaj7) are characteristic in D Lydian.
