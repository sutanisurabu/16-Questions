### Analysis of Chord Progression
The given progression is: **D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D**.

This is a repetitive, tonal sequence that emphasizes the root chord (D) heavily, with bass movement staying predominantly on D (with brief dips to C# for tension/release). I'll break down the key determination step by step.

#### Step 1: Core Chords (Ignoring Slashes for Initial Tonal Center)
- Primary chords: **D** (major), **Bm** (minor), **F#m** (minor), **E7** (dominant 7th), **Amaj7** (major 7th).
- These all derive naturally from the **D major scale** (D E F# G A B C#):
  - **D**: I (tonic).
  - **Bm**: vi (submediant).
  - **F#m**: iii (mediant).
  - **E7**: V7 (dominant, with the major 3rd G# adding tension resolving to D).
  - **Amaj7**: IVmaj7 (subdominant, adding color).
- No borrowed chords, accidentals, or chromaticism outside the D major diatonic set. The progression resolves repeatedly to D, confirming it as the tonal center.

#### Step 2: Slash Chords and Bass Movement
Slash chords specify bass notes, which add inversion/flavor but don't alter the key:
- **Bm/D**: Bm triad (B D F#) over D bass → Acts as an inverted vi or a Dsus4-like voicing (emphasizing suspension over the tonic bass). Reinforces D as root.
- **F#m/C#**: F#m triad (F# A C#) over C# bass → Inverted iii; the C# bass (leading tone) creates brief tension pulling back to D.
- **E7/D**: E7 (E G# B D) over D bass → Inverted V7; the D in the chord + bass makes it feel like a suspended dominant resolving to D.
- **Amaj7/C#**: Amaj7 (A C# E G#) over C# bass → Inverted IVmaj7; again, C# bass heightens expectation of resolution to D.
- Bass line: Mostly static on **D**, with two **C#** approaches (half-step below D). This is a classic dominant-to-tonic pull in major keys, not modal ambiguity.

#### Step 3: Overall Structure and Implications
- **Repetition and Cadences**: The progression is D-centric (9 out of 16 chords/bars resolve to or emphasize D). It uses subdominant (IV) and dominant (V7) functions for mild tension, but everything orbits D without modulation.
- **No Minor or Modal Indicators**:
  - No bVII (e.g., C major, which would suggest mixolydian).
  - No bVI or bIII (e.g., for Dorian or Aeolian).
  - E7 has a major 3rd (G#), not minor (G), confirming Ionian (major) over mixolydian.
  - Ends on D after Amaj7/C#, a strong plagal (IV-I) feel in D major.
- This could be from a folk, pop, or worship song (e.g., reminiscent of "How Great Is Our God" or similar D-major progressions), but tonally it's straightforward.

#### Key and Mode
- **Key**: D major.
- **Mode**: Ionian (the standard major mode). No evidence of modal mixture or borrowing—it's purely diatonic major.

If this is from a specific song or you have more context (e.g., melody notes or full arrangement), I can refine this further!
