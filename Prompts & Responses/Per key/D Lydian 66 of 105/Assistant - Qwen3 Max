To determine the **key and mode** of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**  
D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – F#m/C# – E7/D – D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – Amaj7/C# – D

---

### Step 1: List the unique chords (simplify bass notes for analysis)

- **D** (D major)
- **Bm/D** → B minor with D in the bass → essentially **Bm** (vi chord in D major)
- **F#m/C#** → F# minor with C# in the bass → **F#m** (iii chord in D major)
- **E7/D** → E dominant 7 with D in the bass → **E7** (V7 chord in A major, but in D major it’s the **V7 of V**, or secondary dominant)
- **Amaj7/C#** → A major 7 with C# in the bass → **Amaj7** (V chord in D major)

So simplified root chords:  
**D – Bm – F#m – E7 – Amaj7**

---

### Step 2: Analyze diatonic chords in possible keys

#### Try **D major** (key signature: 2 sharps – F#, C#)

Diatonic chords in D major:
- I = D
- ii = Em
- iii = F#m
- IV = G
- V = A (or A7/Amaj7)
- vi = Bm
- vii° = C#dim

Compare to our chords:
- D → I ✅  
- Bm → vi ✅  
- F#m → iii ✅  
- Amaj7 → Vmaj7 (common in pop/folk; V chord in major key is often major or dominant) ✅  
- E7 → **Not diatonic** to D major (E is the ii chord in D, but E7 implies E–G#–B–D; G# is not in D major)

However, **E7** is the **dominant of Amaj7** → it’s a **secondary dominant**: **V7/V** (five of five). This is very common in tonal music and doesn’t change the key—it just leads strongly to the V chord (A).

So:  
- E7 → V7 of A (V)  
- Then resolves to A (or Amaj7)  
- Then back to D (I)

This is a classic **V7–V–I** cadence chain in D major.

The **Amaj7/C#** is just an A major 7 chord with the 3rd (C#) in the bass—a common voicing that smooths voice leading (especially from E7/D: both have D in the bass, then C#).

---

### Step 3: Consider mode

All chords fit **D Ionian (major)** with one secondary dominant (E7). No modal mixture (like B♭, G minor, etc.) or consistent use of non-diatonic notes.

- No Dorian (which would have a B♭ or C natural)
- No Mixolydian (which would have C natural, not C#)
- No other modal inflections

So it’s **not modal**—it’s **tonal** in **D major**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

- **Key:** D major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major) — but more accurately described as **tonal in D major**, not modal

The use of secondary dominants (E7) and extended chords (Amaj7) is common in pop, folk, and singer-songwriter styles, but doesn’t change the underlying key.

**Answer: D major (Ionian mode).**
