### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I have a chord progression that I need to break down: "D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D." 

First, I want to determine the key and mode since these chords often suggest specific harmonic functions. 

D major seems to be the likely key. The chords include a Bm/D, which is B minor in first inversion, and F#m/C#, hinting at its role in the harmonic structure. E7/D functions as a secondary dominant, adding some complexity.**Clarifying chord functions**

I realized that the diatonic ii in D major is actually Em. The typical V/ii is B7, not E7. Oops! So for D major: ii = Em and V/ii is indeed B7. 

Now, E7 corresponds to V/vi, with Bm as the vi in D major. Actually, E7 can be seen as V/V, where V is A, confirming that E7 is valid.

E7/D, which gives D as the bass note, is a 3rd inversion of E7, functioning as a V/V. Lastly, Amaj7/C# includes a G# note that doesn't belong in D major, which helps me understand its role better!**Exploring Amaj7 in D major**

I’m considering the Amaj7 chord, which includes G#. Is that typical in D major? The usual diatonic A chord is either A or A7, and in a major context, it could be A or A7. 

A7 includes G natural, which fits D major's key signature. It’s interesting that A7 as a dominant uses G natural while still being diatonic. However, Amaj7’s G# is outside the key, indicating possible temporary tonicization or modal interchange. It could be that in Amaj7/C#, G# acts like a leading tone to A.**Considering D Lydian effects**

I’m thinking about how the Amaj7 fits into the progression as a color chord. It seems to come from the A major scale but might suggest a nonfunctional use. In pop music, using Amaj7 in a D Lydian context is interesting. Since D Lydian has G# as part of the scale, chords like E major and A major would also include G#.

Looking at the chord structure, D major, Bm, and F#m all fit nicely, while E major incorporates G#, and the addition of D in E7 aligns with Lydian characteristics too.**Determining key and mode**

In D Lydian, I've realized C# is the 6th, and D natural is included, making E7 (E G# B D) diatonic. Nice! Amaj7 also fits, as it contains G#. 

I’ve verified the notes for the chords: D, Bm/D, F#m/C#, E7/D, and Amaj7/C# all align with the D Lydian scale. Therefore, the tonal center is D, and the mode is Lydian. The only notable alteration from D major is G#, which indicates this Lydian character.

So, the answer is: Key center D, mode Lydian!

D is the tonal center, and the repeated use of G# (in E7 and Amaj7) points to a raised 4th scale degree. That makes the mode Lydian.

Answer: D Lydian (D as key center, Lydian mode).

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm trying to determine the key and mode from the chord sequence: "D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D." 

There are many D chords with D in the bass. I've identified the chords: D, Bm/D, F#m/C#, E7/D, and Amaj7/C#. It seems likely to be in D major, but I want to analyze it more closely. 

The chords I see in D major show that G is natural, indicating that A7 fits in the D Mixolydian context too.**Clarifying chord functions**

I’m analyzing the key of D major. I realize that the dominant seventh chord (A7) contains G natural, which is diatonic. The seventh of A is G, fitting within D major. So yes, A7 is diatonic to D major.

I've identified the following chords: D (I), Bm/D (vi over bass), which could be thought of as a first inversion. Additionally, F#m/C# is also in first inversion (iii6), and E7 is made up of E, G#, B, and D. It's interesting how all these interact!**Examining E7 chord function**

Oops, I just realized G# isn’t in D major; instead, it's G natural. E7 actually serves as V/ii, or the dominant of A. So, if E is V of A and A is V of D, E7 becomes the secondary dominant V/V in D major. Since E7 contains G#, it's non-diatonic to D major. 

Also, with E7 over D in the bass, I see it's in third inversion. The bass note D here is the seventh of the E7 chord, which typically resolves to the I6/4 chord.**Exploring Amaj7 and voice leading**

I’m considering standard voice-leading rules where V4/2 typically resolves to I6. However, here, V/V 4/2 resolves to V6 (A/C#), which indeed appears later as Amaj7/C#. 

I see that Amaj7 includes G#, but that note isn’t in D major; it's a chromatic tone. Maybe it's a borrowed chord typical for jazz or pop harmony. It looks like Amaj7/C# means A major 7 with a C# bass, which could fit in D Lydian. In that scale, E major is diatonic and E major (E G# B) fits within this context!**Determining key and mode**

Let’s break this down: E major fits in D Lydian because of the G#. I see the chords: F#m, G# diminished, A major, B minor, and C# minor. E7 includes G#, which is V/V related to A and linked to D Lydian too.

The progression also emphasizes D, and the Amaj7 fits as diatonic in Lydian with G#. Since there's no G natural and Amaj7 indicates G#, it strongly suggests Lydian. Thus, I conclude the key is D Lydian, supported by E7 and Amaj7's presence, confirming the unique cadence.**Finalizing key and mode answer**

The key center is D with the mode being Lydian. I can explain that D is the tonic and the modal color is Lydian, highlighted by chords like Amaj7 and E7, which both contain G# and imply #4 relative to D. 

For a brief Roman numeral mapping, I think I could say: I – vi/I – I – iii6 – II7/7 – I, and note that the E7 to D creates a backdoor plagal cadence typical of Lydian, which is worth mentioning.

D Lydian.

- D is the clear tonal center (constant D bass/returns to D).
- The presence of G# (in E7 and especially Amaj7) gives a raised 4th relative to D, pointing to Lydian rather than Ionian.
- The II→I color (E/E7 to D) and Vmaj7 (Amaj7) are characteristic in D Lydian.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m working to determine the key and mode from the chord progression: "D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D." The sequence features D major chords primarily in the bass. 

I note that Bm/D is a B minor chord in first inversion, F#m/C# is F# minor over C#, and E7/D is an E dominant 7 over D. Amaj7/C# is also present. It seems like the tonality revolves around D, suggesting it could be in D major (Ionian). I should consider if V/V applies here.**Analyzing chord structure**

I’m breaking down the chords in D major. The chords are I = D, ii = Em, iii = F#m, IV = G, V = A, vi = Bm, and vii° = C#dim. 

I see that E7 isn't diatonic to D major—it's a V/V, the dominant of A. Bm is vi, and F#m is iii, which fit. Amaj7, representing Vmaj7, introduces a G# that’s non-diatonic because D major naturally includes G natural. So, Amaj7/C# has notes A, C#, E, and G#, suggesting a Lydian flavor, but Lydian would need G# as #4.**Examining Lydian implications**

I’m considering if the presence of G# suggests D Lydian. The E7 chord contains G# (E, G#, B, D), so there are two chords with G#—E7 and Amaj7. This means the progression includes G#.

D Lydian consists of the notes D, E, F#, G#, A, B, and C#. In analyzing the chords, Bm contains D and F#, but not G. However, F#m fits, and both E7 and Amaj7 align with D Lydian too. So, it seems all the chords could indeed be diatonic to D Lydian.**Checking D Lydian chords**

Let’s break down the D Lydian scale degrees. 

Starting with the I chord, D major (D, F#, A) fits perfectly. The ii chord, E major (E, G#, B), would include D natural as the flat 7, but in D Lydian, D is actually the 1st scale degree. So, E7 (E, G#, B, D) also works. 

The iii chord, F#m (F#, A, C#), fits too. The IV# could be G#dim since, in Lydian, it’s used for the fourth. 

A major (A, C#, E) fits, and Amaj7 introduces G#, which is diatonic to D Lydian. So, Amaj7 is indeed diatonic here!**Determining key and mode**

I’m concluding that the key is D Lydian due to the presence of G#. Amaj7 and E7 accommodate this mode, both being diatonic in D Lydian. 

- Chords include: 
  - I: D
  - II7: E7 (dominant 7)
  - iii: F#m
  - V: Amaj7
  - vi: Bm
  - vii: C#m7
  
The progression sits on a D pedal, aligning with the D Lydian scale—D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#. 

So, the final answer is D Lydian with D as the tonal center, reflecting A major's key signature of three sharps.

D Lydian (tonal center D, using the A major pitch collection: D E F# G# A B C#)

Reason:
- Repeated D pedal and cadencing on D
- Presence of G# in E7 and Amaj7 rules out D major (Ionian) and fits D Lydian, where II7 (E7) and Vmaj7 (Amaj7) are diatonic.

### Key and Mode Analysis

The given chord progression (D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D) is a repetitive sequence with a strong tonal center. Here's a breakdown:

#### Primary Key: **D Major**
- **Tonal Center**: The progression revolves around D major as the home chord (I), with most bass notes anchoring on D (creating a pedal point effect). It resolves repeatedly to D, especially after tension-building chords.
- **Diatonic Fit**:
  - D (I): Root chord, establishes the key.
  - Bm (vi): Common in D major (e.g., Bm/D acts as an inversion or passing chord emphasizing the D bass).
  - F#m (iii): Diatonic to D major.
  - Amaj7 (IV): Diatonic (A major is the subdominant).
- **Non-Diatonic Elements**:
  - E7 (V7 of A major, or secondary dominant V7/IV): Introduces a G# (leading tone to A), adding temporary tension but resolving back to D. The /D bass keeps it grounded in the key.
  - The /C# bass notes (under F#m and Amaj7) suggest brief movement to the leading tone (C# is the #7 scale degree in D major), heightening expectation before returning to D.
- **Overall Structure**: This is a I–vi–iii–V7/IV–I pattern with variations and pedal bass, typical of pop/folk/rock in major keys. No strong pull to another key (e.g., no sustained Bm or F#m as tonic).

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major)**
- The progression uses the natural major scale of D (D E F# G A B C#), with no flattened scale degrees or modal mixture that would suggest Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.
- Harmonic function is tonal and major-oriented: Subdominant (IV) and mediant (iii) provide color, while the secondary dominant (E7) reinforces the major resolution without modal ambiguity.
- If played, it has a bright, uplifting feel consistent with Ionian mode—no minor tonic or flattened 3rd/7th to imply a minor mode.

This progression evokes a classic major-key ballad or folk-rock vibe (reminiscent of songs like "Space Oddity" by David Bowie or similar structures). If this is from a specific song or you have more context/melody, I can refine the analysis!

### Analysis of Chord Progression
The given progression is: **D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D**.

This is a repetitive, tonal sequence that emphasizes the root chord (D) heavily, with bass movement staying predominantly on D (with brief dips to C# for tension/release). I'll break down the key determination step by step.

#### Step 1: Core Chords (Ignoring Slashes for Initial Tonal Center)
- Primary chords: **D** (major), **Bm** (minor), **F#m** (minor), **E7** (dominant 7th), **Amaj7** (major 7th).
- These all derive naturally from the **D major scale** (D E F# G A B C#):
  - **D**: I (tonic).
  - **Bm**: vi (submediant).
  - **F#m**: iii (mediant).
  - **E7**: V7 (dominant, with the major 3rd G# adding tension resolving to D).
  - **Amaj7**: IVmaj7 (subdominant, adding color).
- No borrowed chords, accidentals, or chromaticism outside the D major diatonic set. The progression resolves repeatedly to D, confirming it as the tonal center.

#### Step 2: Slash Chords and Bass Movement
Slash chords specify bass notes, which add inversion/flavor but don't alter the key:
- **Bm/D**: Bm triad (B D F#) over D bass → Acts as an inverted vi or a Dsus4-like voicing (emphasizing suspension over the tonic bass). Reinforces D as root.
- **F#m/C#**: F#m triad (F# A C#) over C# bass → Inverted iii; the C# bass (leading tone) creates brief tension pulling back to D.
- **E7/D**: E7 (E G# B D) over D bass → Inverted V7; the D in the chord + bass makes it feel like a suspended dominant resolving to D.
- **Amaj7/C#**: Amaj7 (A C# E G#) over C# bass → Inverted IVmaj7; again, C# bass heightens expectation of resolution to D.
- Bass line: Mostly static on **D**, with two **C#** approaches (half-step below D). This is a classic dominant-to-tonic pull in major keys, not modal ambiguity.

#### Step 3: Overall Structure and Implications
- **Repetition and Cadences**: The progression is D-centric (9 out of 16 chords/bars resolve to or emphasize D). It uses subdominant (IV) and dominant (V7) functions for mild tension, but everything orbits D without modulation.
- **No Minor or Modal Indicators**:
  - No bVII (e.g., C major, which would suggest mixolydian).
  - No bVI or bIII (e.g., for Dorian or Aeolian).
  - E7 has a major 3rd (G#), not minor (G), confirming Ionian (major) over mixolydian.
  - Ends on D after Amaj7/C#, a strong plagal (IV-I) feel in D major.
- This could be from a folk, pop, or worship song (e.g., reminiscent of "How Great Is Our God" or similar D-major progressions), but tonally it's straightforward.

#### Key and Mode
- **Key**: D major.
- **Mode**: Ionian (the standard major mode). No evidence of modal mixture or borrowing—it's purely diatonic major.

If this is from a specific song or you have more context (e.g., melody notes or full arrangement), I can refine this further!

### Reasoning

**Defining the Core Task**

I'm focused on breaking down the request to truly understand what's being asked. My initial step involves identifying the core input: a specific chord progression. Next, I plan to analyze each chord, and its relation to the preceding and following chords to create a detailed analysis.


**Assessing the Harmony**

I'm now investigating each chord's function within the apparent key of D major. The Bm and F#m chords are clearly diatonic, serving as the vi and iii chords, respectively. The E7, however, is intriguing, functioning as a secondary dominant targeting the A chord, the dominant of D major. This analysis is giving me a better understanding.


**Exploring Bass Lines and Structure**

I'm now zeroing in on the bass line's role in the progression's feel. The D-C#-D-C# pattern acts as a pedal point on D, anchoring the key. Analyzing the slash chords reveals a smooth, descending bass line from D to C#, adding a subtle chromatic touch. The C# is the leading tone, increasing the gravitational pull towards D.


**Refining Key and Function**

The analysis is focusing on how the chords relate to D major. I see Bm, F#m, and A as the key components, confirming the home key. Specifically, the Amaj7 adds a jazzy feel, while the E7 acts as a secondary dominant, further emphasizing the resolution towards A, and the established D major.


**Structuring the Analysis**

I'm now drafting a framework for the analysis. I'll start with the main conclusion, declaring D major as the key. I will then explain the D chord's repeated presence, along with the diatonic chords like Bm and F#m. Following this, I'll analyze the more unique chords.


**Finalizing the Explanation**

I'm now structuring my analysis with a clear conclusion: D major is the key. Then, I'll explain the repeated D chord, the diatonic chords like Bm and F#m, and the role of the E7 and Amaj7. The D pedal in the bass will also be highlighted.




Based on the chord progression provided, the key and mode are:

**Key:** **D Major**
**Mode:** **Major**

---

### **Analysis:**

Here is a breakdown of why this progression is in the key of D Major:

1.  **Tonic Center (Home Base):** The progression begins and ends on a **D major chord**. The D chord also appears more frequently than any other, establishing it as the tonal center or "home" chord (the **I** chord).

2.  **Diatonic Chords:** Most of the chords are diatonic to the key of D Major (the notes are D, E, F♯, G, A, B, C♯).
    *   **D (D-F♯-A):** The **I** chord (Tonic).
    *   **Bm (B-D-F♯):** The **vi** chord (the relative minor). This is a very common and natural-sounding chord in the key of D.
    *   **F♯m (F♯-A-C♯):** The **iii** chord. Another diatonic chord that fits perfectly.

3.  **Dominant Function (The V Chord):** The **Amaj7** chord functions as the dominant (**V**) chord. The V chord's job is to create tension that resolves back to the tonic (I).
    *   The root of the chord is A, which is the 5th degree of the D major scale.
    *   The bass note in the **Amaj7/C♯** is C♯, which is the **leading tone** of D. The C♯ moving up to D is the strongest and most definitive way to establish a key.
    *   While a standard dominant is usually a major or a dominant 7th chord (A or A7), using a **Amaj7** gives the progression a softer, more "Lydian" or "jazzy" sound, but its function remains a V chord pulling back to D.

4.  **Secondary Dominant (The E7 Chord):** The **E7 (E-G♯-B-D)** chord is the one chord that contains a note outside the D major scale (G♯).
    *   This is a classic example of a **secondary dominant**. E7 is the V chord of A (the V7 of V, written as V7/V).
    *   Its purpose is to momentarily "tonicize" the A chord, making the arrival on the Amaj7 feel even more significant before it resolves back to D. This is a very common technique to add harmonic interest.

5.  **The Bass Line and Pedal Tones:** The use of slash chords creates a very strong sense of being in D.
    *   **Bm/D** and **E7/D** both have a **D in the bass**. This is called a **tonic pedal point**. Holding the root of the key in the bass while the chords change above it powerfully reinforces D as the tonal center.
    *   The bass line frequently moves between **D** and **C♯**. As mentioned, this movement between the tonic (D) and the leading tone (C♯) is the defining sound of the D major key.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Amaj7/C# D. They want me to figure out the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to write out all the chords clearly. The progression is: D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, D, F#m/C#, E7/D, D, D, Amaj7/C#, D. Hmm, those chords with slashes like Bm/D probably indicate slash chords where D is the bass note. So Bm/D is B minor with D in the bass, which is actually D major's second inversion since D-F#-A. Wait, no. Bm is B-D-F#, so Bm/D would have D as the bass, making it D-F#-B. That's the same notes as D major (D-F#-A) but with B instead of A. Actually, D-F#-B is the second inversion of B minor, but it's a different set of notes. Maybe I should list all the notes involved.

Let me list each chord's notes to see the overall key. Starting with D major: D-F#-A. Then Bm/D: bass D, then B and F#, so notes D, F#, B. That's actually a D6 chord (D-F#-A-B), but missing the A. Wait, no—Bm/D is specifically B minor triad over D bass, so notes are D (bass), B, D, F#? Typically, it's D (bass), then B and F# in the chord, so the notes present are D, B, F#. But D-B-F# is the same as B minor with D in bass, which is a first inversion Bm chord? Wait, standard inversion: root position Bm is B-D-F#, first inversion is D-F#-B, second inversion F#-B-D. So Bm/D likely means first inversion, so notes D, F#, B. Which is D-F#-B, the same as a D6 chord without the A. But D6 would be D-F#-A-B. Here it's D-F#-B, so it's actually a D major triad missing the A, or a Bsus4? Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as D as bass with Bm chord, so the harmony is B minor but with D bass.

But for key analysis, I should consider the root notes of the chords. The progression seems to be centered around D. Let me list the chord roots ignoring the bass notes for a moment: D, D, Bm (so root B), Bm, D, D, F#m (root F#), E7 (root E), D, D, Amaj7 (root A), D.

So roots: D, D, B, B, D, D, F#, E, D, D, A, D.

Now, dominant function chords often point to the key. Here, E7 is a dominant 7th chord. E7 usually resolves to A major or A minor. But in this progression, E7/D goes to D. Wait, E7/D means E7 chord with D in the bass. So the chord is E7 (E-G#-B-D) but with D as bass note, so it's D-E-G#-B. That's actually a D9 chord (D-F#-A-C#-E) but missing F# and A? Wait, E7 is E-G#-B-D. With D bass, it's D (bass), E, G#, B. So notes D, E, G#, B. That's a D7sus4? Or actually, D-E-G#-B is the same as E7/D, which functions as a secondary dominant. E7 is V7 of A, but here it's going to D, not A. So maybe it's V7/vi or something? Wait, if the key is D major, vi is Bm. E7 is V7 of A, but in D major, A is V. V7 of V is E7, which would resolve to A, but here E7/D goes to D. So E7 to D is a deceptive cadence? Or maybe the key isn't D major.

Perhaps the key is A major? But the progression starts and ends on D, and has a lot of D chords. Let me check the chords again. The progression is mostly D chords with some variations: Bm/D, F#m/C#, E7/D, Amaj7/C#. Let's look at the bass notes because slash chords indicate bass movement. The bass line: D, D, D, D, D, D, C#, D, D, D, C#, D. Wait, no: the chords are D (bass D), D (D), Bm/D (bass D), Bm/D (D), D (D), D (D), F#m/C# (bass C#), E7/D (bass D), D (D), D (D), Amaj7/C# (bass C#), D (D).

So the bass notes: D, D, D, D, D, D, C#, D, D, D, C#, D.

So the bass is mostly D, stepping down to C# occasionally. C# is the leading tone to D. So when bass goes C# to D, it's a cadence. Specifically, in D major, C# is the leading tone, so C#-D in bass is like #vii° to I, but here it's under F#m and Amaj7 chords.

Let's list all chords with their actual notes:

- D: D, F#, A

- Bm/D: D (bass), B, F# → notes D, F#, B

- F#m/C#: C# (bass), F#, A, C → F#m is F#-A-C, so F#m/C# has bass C#, so notes C#, F#, A, C? Wait, F# minor triad is F#-A-C, so F#m/C# would be C# bass with F#m chord, so the notes are C#, F#, A, C. But C natural? That's important.

- E7/D: D bass, E7 chord (E, G#, B, D), so notes D, E, G#, B

- Amaj7/C#: C# bass, A major 7th chord (A, C#, E, G#), so notes C#, A, C#, E, G# → so C#, A, E, G#

- D: D, F#, A

Now, listing all the notes used in the progression:

From D: D, F#, A

Bm/D: D, F#, B

F#m/C#: C#, F#, A, C

E7/D: D, E, G#, B

Amaj7/C#: C#, A, E, G#

D: D, F#, A

So compiling all notes: A, B, C, C#, D, E, F#, G#

Wait, C natural and C# both appear? From F#m/C#, we have C (since F#m is F#-A-C, so C natural). But from Amaj7/C#, we have C# (since A major is A-C#-E). Also, E7/D has G# (E7 is E-G#-B-D). D major has F#, so F# is present.

So notes present: A, B, C, C#, D, E, F#, G#

That's a lot of notes. C and C# are both there, which is unusual for a single key. Also G# and F#.

Let me see: C natural comes from F#m (F# minor key has C natural), but C# comes from A major (A natural key has C#). Similarly, G# is from E7 (E major has G#), which is typical in D major (since E7 is V7/V).

But the presence of C natural (from F#m) suggests a possible modal mixture or a different key.

Perhaps the key is D major, but with some borrowed chords.

Standard D major key: D E F# G A B C#

Chords in D major: I D, ii Em, iii F#m, IV G, V A, vi Bm, vii° C#dim

Now looking at the progression:

- D: I

- Bm/D: Bm is vi, so vi with D bass. So it's vi/I? But bass is D, so it's a first inversion vi chord.

- F#m/C#: F#m is iii in D major. C# is the bass, which is the fifth of F#m (F#m: F#-A-C, fifth is C). So F#m/C# is third inversion F#m7? Wait, F#m is triad, so F#m/C# would be second inversion if it's a triad (since root F#, first inv B, second inv C). But F#m triad second inversion is C-F#-A, so bass C. But here it's written as F#m/C#, which has C# bass, not C. C# vs C.

Problem: F#m chord should have C natural, but here it's written as F#m/C#—C# bass. But F# minor triad is F#-A-C, so the notes are C natural. But C# is a different note. So F#m/C# would imply a chord with root F#, minor triad, but bass C#. However, C# is not part of F# minor triad—it's a semitone above C. This seems like a mistake or misnotation.

Wait, maybe it's F#m7? F#m7 is F#-A-C-E. Then F#m7/C# would have bass C#, and notes C#, F#, A, C, E. But still has C natural.

But in the progression, it's written as F#m/C#, which is unusual because C# is not in F#m triad. Unless it's a different chord altogether.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be F#m7/C# or something else. But given the user wrote F#m/C#, I have to work with that.

Similarly, Amaj7/C#: A major 7 is A-C#-E-G#, so Amaj7/C# has bass C#, which is the third of the chord, so first inversion Amaj7.

E7/D: E7 is E-G#-B-D, bass D, so it's a second inversion E7? Or a D chord with added notes.

Another approach: look at the cadences. The progression ends with ...Amaj7/C# to D. So C# bass to D bass, which is a half-step resolution, typical of a cadence in D major (where C# is leading tone to D).

Similarly, earlier F#m/C# to E7/D to D: C# to D in bass.

So the bass movement C# - D suggests D is the tonic.

Chords that have C# bass are F#m/C# and Amaj7/C#, both resolving to D via C#-D bass.

In D major, the leading tone is C#, so any chord with C# in bass resolving to D would function as a cadential 6/4 or something, but here it's under different chords.

F#m/C#: if key is D major, F#m is iii chord. iii chord in first inversion would be A-F#-C? Wait, no. Inversion: root position iii is F#-A-C, first inversion A-C-F#, second inversion C-F#-A. So bass C for second inversion. But here it's C# bass, not C. So it's not standard.

Unless the chord is not F#m but something else. F#m/C#—if the chord is actually D/F# or something, but the user wrote F#m/C#.

Wait, maybe the "/D" and "/C#" indicate pedal point. Like a D pedal with Bm chord on top, so the harmony is Bm but over D bass, creating a D6 (D-F#-A-B) but without A, so D-F#-B. Similarly, F#m/C# might be C# pedal with F#m, but C# is not in F#m.

This is confusing. Let's try to hear the progression. If I imagine playing D constantly in bass, with chords changing, but the slash notation specifies the bass note.

Assume bass is as written:

Bar 1: D (bass D, chord D)

Bar 2: D

Bar 3: D bass with Bm chord → so notes D (bass), B, D, F# → D-F#-B, which is D6 (if A were present, but it's not). So essentially a D6 chord.

Similarly, F#m/C#: C# bass with F#m → F#m is F#-A-C, so notes C#, F#, A, C. But C natural.

E7/D: D bass with E7 → E7 is E-G#-B-D, so D bass with E,G#,B → D-E-G#-B, which is D7sus4? Or E7/D is a slash chord implying E7 harmony but D in bass.

But in functional harmony, E7/D is often used as a secondary dominant. E7 is V7 of A, so if it's resolving to A, but here it resolves to D. So maybe it's V7/vi resolving to I, but vi is Bm, not D.

Wait, in D major, vi is Bm. V7/vi would be E7, which should resolve to Bm. But here E7/D goes to D, not Bm. So it's a deceptive resolution? E7 to D instead of E7 to A (V to I) or E7 to Bm (V/vi to vi).

But E7 is V of A, so in D major, A is V chord. So E7 would be V7/V, resolving to A (V), but here it resolves to D (I), which is unusual.

Unless the key is A, but progression starts and ends on D.

Another idea: perhaps the key is D Mixolydian. Mixolydian has a b7, so C natural. Let's check.

D Mixolydian: D E F# G A B C

Notes: D, E, F#, G, A, B, C

Now look at the chords:

- D: D-F#-A (I)

- Bm/D: B-D-F# — Bm is vi in major, but in Mixolydian, vi would be B diminished? Wait, D Mixolydian scale: D E F# G A B C

Chords:

I: D-F#-A (major)

ii: E-G-A (E minor? E-G is minor third, but G to A is major second. E-G-A is E minor 7th without 7th? Wait, triads in Mixolydian:

I: D (D-F#-A)

ii: Emin (E-G-A? No: E-G is minor third, E-G-B is Emin, but B is natural in Mixolydian). D Mixolydian notes: D E F# G A B C

So triads:

D: D-F#-A → major

E: E-G-A → wait, E-G is minor third, G-A is major second, so E-G-B? No, let's build thirds.

Scale degrees:

1: D

2: E

3: F#

4: G

5: A

6: B

b7: C

So triads:

I: 1-3-5 = D-F#-A → major

ii: 2-4-6 = E-G-B → E minor (E-G is minor third? E to G is minor third? E-F#-G: E to G is minor third (3 semitones), yes. G to B is major third. So E minor.

iii: 3-5-b7 = F#-A-C → F# diminished? F#-A is minor third, A-C is minor third, so diminished triad.

IV: 4-6-1 = G-B-D → G major

V: 5-b7-2 = A-C-E → A minor

vi: b7-1-3 = C-D-F# → C major? C-D is major second, D-F# major third. C-D-F# is C major add9? Triad would be C-E-G, but here it's C-D-F#. Not a standard triad.

Actually, in modal harmony, chords are built on each degree with diatonic notes.

For D Mixolydian:

Chord on D (I): D-F#-A → D major

Chord on E (ii): E-G-B → Emin (since G natural)

Chord on F# (iii): F#-A-C → F# diminished

Chord on G (IV): G-B-D → G major

Chord on A (V): A-C-E → A minor

Chord on B (vi): B-D-F# → B minor

Chord on C (bVII): C-E-G → C major

In the given progression, we have:

- D major (I in Mixolydian)

- Bm/D: B minor chord, which is vi in Mixolydian. So vi with D bass is first inversion vi.

- F#m/C#: F#m chord. But in Mixolydian, F# chord is diminished (F#-A-C), not minor. So F#m would imply F#-A-C, but it's usually diminished in diatonic. However, sometimes written as minor for simplicity, but technically it's diminished.

- E7/D: E7 is E-G#-B-D. But in D Mixolydian, G is natural, so G# is not diatonic. E7 has G#, which is outside Mixolydian (which has G natural). So E7 suggests harmonic influence, like harmonic minor or major.

- Amaj7/C#: A major 7, which has C# and G#. In Mixolydian, A chord is minor (A-C-E), but here it's major (A-C#-E-G#), so definitely not diatonic to Mixolydian.

So Mixolydian doesn't fit because of G# and C#.

What about Dorian mode? D Dorian: D E F G A B C#

Chords:

i: D minor? Wait, Dorian is minor mode. D Dorian: D E F G A B C# — relative to C major.

Wait, D Dorian has:

1: D

2: E

b3: F

4: G

5: A

6: B

7: C#

So D minor with major 6th.

Chord on D: D-F-A → D minor

But in our progression, the tonic chord is D major (D-F#-A), not minor. So Dorian is out because it's minor.

Phrygian: D E♭ F G A B♭ C — but we have F# and A, so no.

Lydian: D E F# G# A B C# — but we have G natural in some chords? Wait, in the progression, do we have G natural? From F#m/C#, F#m is F#-A-C, so no G. E7 has G#, Amaj7 has G#. D major has no G. So all G's are sharped? Notes used: G# appears in E7 and Amaj7. Is there a G natural? Let's check.

Earlier, I thought F#m/C# has C natural, but does it have G? F#m is F#-A-C, so no G. E7 has G#, D has F# (no G), Amaj7 has G#. So all G notes are G#, no G natural. So possibly a key with G#.

D major has two sharps: F# and C#. So notes D E F# G A B C#.

But in the progression, we have C natural from F#m/C# (since F# minor chord is F#-A-C). So C natural is present, which is not in D major (which has C#).

Similarly, Amaj7 has C# (since A major is A-C#-E), so both C natural and C# are present.

This suggests modal mixture or a different key altogether.

Perhaps the key is A major? A major: A B C# D E F# G#

Chords in A major: I A, ii Bm, iii C#m, IV D, V E, vi F#m, vii° G#dim

Now, progression starts on D, which is IV in A major.

But the progression ends on D, and has a lot of D chords, so maybe not.

Unless it's a IV-I cadence, but typically tonic is where it resolves.

Another idea: maybe it's in D, but with a borrowed chord. The F#m chord is standard in D major (iii), but F#m/C# — C# is the leading tone.

Wait, F#m in D major is F#-A-C, so it has C natural. But in D major, the seventh is C#, so C natural is the minor seventh, borrowed from Dorian or something.

Similarly, E7 is V7 of A, but in D major, A is V, so E7 is V7/V.

The progression has E7/D going to D, which is not the standard V7/V to V, but V7/V to I, which is a deceptive cadence.

But also, Amaj7 is used, which is V major in D minor? Wait, in D harmonic minor, A would be major (V), but here tonic is D major.

This is tricky.

Let's list all chord roots with their functions if in D major:

- D: I

- Bm: vi

- F#m: iii

- E7: V7/V (since V is A, V7 is E7)

- Amaj7: V (A is V in D major)

- Amaj7/C#: same, first inversion V

In the progression, after two D's, it goes to Bm/D (vi), then back to D. Then D, D, then F#m/C# (iii), E7/D (V7/V), D (I), then D, D, Amaj7/C# (V), D (I).

The sequence F#m - E7 - D: iii - V7/V - I. In functional harmony, iii is not usually a dominant function chord. But E7 is V7/V, which should go to A, but it goes to D.

Similarly, later Amaj7 (V) goes to D (I), which is a standard V-I cadence. But in the progression, it's written as Amaj7/C# to D, so first inversion V to I.

Ah! The progression ends with Amaj7/C# to D, which is a V-I cadence. In D major, A is V, so V-I is standard.

But earlier, E7/D goes to D, which would be like a secondary dominant resolving deceptively. E7 is V7 of A (V), so V7/V resolving to I instead of V.

So the key is D major, with a deceptive cadence (E7 to D instead of to A), and the F#m is just the iii chord.

But what about the C natural in F#m? In D major, F#m chord is diatonic (iii), which has C natural, yes. D major key signature has F# and C#, but the iii chord is F#-A-C, so it uses C natural, which is correct because in major keys, the mediant chord is minor and contains the flat seventh scale degree (in D major, C natural is b7).

Yes! In D major:

Scale: D E F# G A B C#

But the iii chord is F#-A-C. C is natural, which is the minor seventh of the scale (since C# is seventh, C natural is b7).

So F#m is standard diatonic chord in D major.

Similarly, Bm is vi chord: B-D-F#, diatonic.

E7 is V7 of A (V chord), so E7 is secondary dominant.

Amaj7 is V chord with added seventh.

Now, the slash chords:

- Bm/D: B minor chord with D bass → this is first inversion Bm, which is common. Notes D, F#, B. Sometimes written as D6 (D-F#-A-B), but missing A, so it's just Bm/D.

- F#m/C#: F# minor chord with C# bass. F#m is F#-A-C, so bass C#? But C# is not in F#m triad. Wait, F#m triad notes: F#, A, C. C natural. C# is different. So F#m/C# would have bass C#, but C# is not part of the chord. That's a problem.

Unless it's a typo and should be F#m7/C#. F#m7 is F#-A-C-E, so C# bass? Still C# not in chord.

Wait, perhaps it's not F#m/C# but F#m7/C#, which would be F#m7 (F#-A-C-E) with C# bass. But C# isn't in F#m7. F#m7 has C natural.

This is confusing. Maybe the bass note is written incorrectly. In many contexts, C# under F#m might imply a different chord.

Another possibility: in guitar tab or some notations, "/C#" might mean something else, but standardly it's bass note.

Wait, F#m/C# — if we take C# as bass, and the chord is F#m, but F#m has C natural, so the note C# in bass clashes with C natural in chord. That would create a minor ninth interval (C# and C natural), which is dissonant.

That seems unlikely in a typical progression. So perhaps it's a misnotation.

Maybe it's F#7/C# or something else. F#7 is F#-A#-C#-E, but then C# bass is root position.

But user wrote F#m/C#.

Alternatively, in the key of D, the chord F#m/C# — C# is the leading tone, so perhaps it's a cadential 6/4 chord. But cadential 6/4 is usually V6/4, which is second inversion dominant.

For example, in D major, A6/4 (A-E-C#) then A (A-C#-E) then D.

But here it's F#m/C#, which is not V.

Unless it's a iv6/4 or something in minor, but we're in major.

Another idea: perhaps the "/C#" is not bass note but part of the chord name. But standard notation is chord/root.

Wait, Amaj7/C# is clearly A major 7 with C# bass, which is first inversion, since C# is third of A chord.

Similarly, E7/D is E7 with D bass.

F#m/C# should be F#m with C# bass.

But F#m has C natural, so bass C# over C natural is a minor second, very dissonant. Unlikely.

Unless in the context, the C# is a passing tone or the chord is actually different.

Wait, maybe it's F#m7(b5)/C# or something, but user said F#m.

Perhaps in the progression, the F#m/C# is actually a D/F# chord? D major with F# bass, which is first inversion D. But user wrote F#m/C#.

This is a problem. Let's assume it's a notation error. Common chords in D major with C# bass: the dominant chord A has C# as third, so A/C# is first inversion A. Or the leading tone chord C#dim, which is C#-E-G, so C#dim would have C# bass.

C#dim is the vii° chord in D major: C#-E-G.

So C#dim is C#-E-G, which is vii°.

Now, F#m/C# — if it's actually C#dim, but written as F#m/C# by mistake? Because C#dim = E-G-C#, which is also Gmaj6/E or something, but not F#m.

C#dim notes: C#, E, G.

F#m notes: F#, A, C.

No overlap.

But E7/D: E7 is E-G#-B-D, bass D. G# is in there.

Amaj7/C#: A-C#-E-G#, bass C#.

Now, the note G# appears in E7 and Amaj7, which are both related to the V chord (A in D major).

In D major, the V chord is A major (A-C#-E), and V7 is A7 (A-C#-E-G). But here we have E7 (which is V7/V) and Amaj7 (which is I7 of V? No, Amaj7 is not standard in major key; V7 is dominant 7th, but Amaj7 would be A-C#-E-G#, which has major seventh, unusual in diatonic harmony but common in jazz/pop.

Similarly, Dmaj7 would be D-F#-A-C#, but here tonic is triad D.

Given that, let's accept the chords as written and see the overall tonality.

The progression emphasizes D as tonic:

- Starts with D

- Has multiple D chords

- Ends with D

- Cadential motion: Amaj7/C# to D (V to I)

- Also, E7/D to D, which might be a deceptive cadence (V7/V to I instead of to V)

The presence of Bm (vi), F#m (iii) are diatonic to D major.

F#m has C natural (b7), which is fine in major key for the iii chord.

Now, the slash chords' bass notes:

- Bm/D: D bass under Bm, so it's a first inversion vi chord, creating a D in bass throughout much of the progression.

- F#m/C#: if F#m is iii, then C# should be the fifth of F#m? F#m triad: F# (root), A (third), C (fifth). So fifth is C natural. But bass is specified as C#, not C. So discrepancy.

Unless it's a typo and should be F#m/C, which would be second inversion F#m (bass C). That makes more sense.

Similarly, Amaj7/C# is correctly C# bass (third of A chord).

E7/D: E7 with D bass, which is the seventh of E7 (E7 is E-G#-B-D), so it's third inversion E7.

But if F#m/C# is a typo for F#m/C, then bass note C natural.

Let's check the bass line assuming that:

Original: D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Amaj7/C# D

If F#m/C# is meant to be F#m/C, then bass: D, D, D, D, D, D, C, D, D, D, C#, D

Now, bass movement: ...D to C to D... and ...D to C# to D.

C to D is whole step, C# to D is half step.

In D major, the cadential bass is often A (V) to D (I), or sometimes with pedal.

But C natural is b7, C# is leading tone.

The sequence F#m/C (bass C) to E7/D to D — bass C to D, which is b7 to 1, common in blues or Mixolydian.

But earlier analysis suggested D major with the iii chord having C natural.

Given that Amaj7/C# to D is a clear V-I cadence (since A is V in D major), that strongly points to D major.

The E7/D to D is a V7/V - I cadence, which is non-standard but can happen as a deceptive resolution.

The F#m/C# is problematic, but if we assume it's a misnotation for F#m/C (bass C natural), then it makes sense as second inversion iii chord.

Similarly, Bm/D is fine as first inversion vi.

So overall, key is D major.

Mode is Ionian, since it's major key.

The presence of C natural in iii chord is diatonic to major key (as b7 scale degree), not a modal mixture.

G# appears in secondary dominants (E7 is V7/V) and in Amaj7 (which could be analyzed as Vmaj7, common in some genres even though diatonic V7 is dominant 7th).

Therefore, the key is D major, mode is Ionian.

Based on the chord progression provided—**D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Amaj7/C# D**—I've analyzed the harmonic structure, bass movement, cadences, and scale degrees to determine the **key** and **mode**. Here's a clear breakdown of the reasoning, followed by the conclusion.

---

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**
#### **1. Tonic Confirmation (Where the Music Resolves)**
- The progression **starts and ends on D**, with D chords dominating (8 out of 12 measures).
- The final two chords (**Amaj7/C# → D**) form a **strong cadence**:
  - **Amaj7/C#** = A major 7th chord with C♯ in the bass (first inversion of A major).
  - **A major is the V chord in D major**, making **A → D a classic V–I cadence** (the most definitive resolution in major keys).
- This confirms **D as the tonic (home chord)**.

#### **2. Diatonic Chords in D Major**
The key of **D major** has the notes: **D E F♯ G A B C♯**  
Common diatonic chords:
- **I = D** (D–F♯–A)
- **vi = Bm** (B–D–F♯)
- **iii = F♯m** (F♯–A–C♮)  
  *(Note: The "C♮" is correct—the iii chord in major keys uses the **♭7 scale degree** (C♮ in D major), not C♯.)*
- **V = A** (A–C♯–E)
- **V7/V = E7** (E–G♯–B–D), the secondary dominant resolving to A (V chord), though here it resolves deceptively to D (more on this below).

All chords in your progression fit **D major**:
- **D** = I (tonic)
- **Bm/D** = vi chord (Bm) with D in bass (first inversion vi)
- **F♯m/C#** = iii chord (F♯m) with **C♯ bass** (more below)
- **E7/D** = V7/V (E7) with D bass (third inversion)
- **Amaj7/C#** = V chord (A major 7th) with C♯ bass (first inversion V)

#### **3. Resolving the Slash Chord Ambiguity**
- **F♯m/C#** is the only chord that appears problematic:
  - F♯ minor (F♯–A–C♮) **does not contain C♯**—it has **C♮** (♭7).
  - C♯ bass + C♮ in the chord creates a dissonant minor 2nd (C♯–C♮), which is atypical.
- **Resolution**: This is likely a **notation shorthand or common mislabeling** in practice. In D major:
  - **F♯m/C#** is almost certainly meant to be **F♯m/C♮** (C♮ bass = second inversion F♯m), as C♮ is diatonic to D major (via the iii chord).
  - The bass movement **C♮ → D** (after "F♯m/C#") is a classic **♭7 → 1 bass line** (e.g., in blues or Mixolydian-influenced progressions), but **still diatonic to D major** (since C♮ is part of the iii chord).
- Similarly, **Amaj7/C#** is correctly labeled (C♯ = 3rd of A major), and **E7/D** (D bass = 7th of E7) fits as a secondary dominant.

#### **4. Cadential Motion & Harmonic Function**
- **Amaj7/C# → D** = **V–I cadence** (resolves strongly to tonic).
- **E7/D → D** = **V7/V → I** (deceptive cadence, as E7 normally resolves to A, not D). This is common in pop/jazz for tension.
- **F♯m → E7 → D** = **iii → V7/V → I**, a less common but valid progression in major keys (reinforces D as tonic via the cadence).
- **Bm/D** = First-inversion vi chord, often used for smooth bass voice-leading (D–F♯–B over D bass).

#### **5. Why Not Another Key or Mode?**
- **Not A major**: A is the V chord, but the progression centers on D and cadences to D.
- **Not D Mixolydian**: Mixolydian has a ♭7 (C♮), but here:
  - **G♯ appears in E7 and Amaj7** (diatonic to D major's secondary dominants/V chord).
  - Mixolydian lacks G♯ and C♯ (it has G♮ and C♮), but your progression uses **G♯** (in E7) and **C♯** (in Amaj7)—core tonal elements of **D major**.
- **Not Dorian/Aeolian**: These are minor modes, but the tonic chord (D) is **major**—not minor.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key: D major**  
- **Mode: Ionian** (the standard major scale)  

#### **Why This Works**
- All chords are **diatonic to D major**, with:
  - **C♮** from the iii chord (F♯m = F♯–A–C♮), 
  - **G♯/C♯** from the V and V7/V chords (A major = A–C♯–E–G♯, E7 = E–G♯–B–D).
- The **V–I cadence (A → D)** is definitive.
- The progression uses **functional harmony** typical of major keys (tonic, dominant, pre-dominant chords), not modal mixture.

#### **Practical Note**
- The **F♯m/C#** notation is likely a shorthand for **F♯m/C♮** (second inversion F♯m) in practice, as C♮ is required for the iii chord in D major. If played as written (C♯ bass), it would clash, but context confirms D major is intended.

This progression is characteristic of **tonal pop/rock music in D major** (e.g., similar to "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses, which uses D major with iii–V–I motion). The mode is **Ionian**—no modal inflection alters the major tonality.

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**
D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – F#m/C# – E7/D – D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – Amaj7/C# – D

Let’s simplify by removing slash chords (which denote inversions) and look at the **root notes** of the chords:

- D
- D
- Bm
- Bm
- D
- D
- F#m
- E7
- D
- D
- Bm
- Bm
- D
- D
- Amaj7
- D

So the **basic chord progression** is:

**D – D – Bm – Bm – D – D – F#m – E7 – D – D – Bm – Bm – D – D – Amaj7 – D**

Now let’s see which **key** this fits into.

### Step 1: Look at the chords and see if they belong to a diatonic scale

List of chords: D, Bm, F#m, E7, Amaj7

Let’s check **D major** key (D E F# G A B C#):

- D (I) – yes
- Bm (vi) – yes
- F#m (iii) – yes
- Amaj7 = A major 7 (IV7) – A is IV in D major, so Amaj7 fits
- E7 – this is **V7 of A**, but in D major, the diatonic chord on V is **Em**, not E major or E7

So E7 is **not diatonic** to D major — it has a **G# and D natural**, which aren’t in D major (D major has C# not C natural). But E7 has **G#**, which **is** in D major (yes, G# is not in D major — wait: D major has notes: D E F# G A B C#. So **G natural**, not G#). So:

- E7 = E, G#, B, D → G# is **NOT** in D major (D major has G natural). So G# is a chromatic note.

Wait — correction:  
D major:  
D  E  F#  G  A  B  C#  
→ no G#, but E7 requires **G#**, so **E7 is not in D major**.

E7 is the **secondary dominant** — specifically **V7/V**, the dominant of A.

So E7 → A is a **V7–I** motion (or V7–IV in D major, since A is IV).

So E7 leads to A (or Amaj7), which fits as a **secondary dominant**.

Amaj7: A C# E G# — again, G# is not in D major. But if the chord is Amaj7, it has a **major 7th (G#)**, which is not diatonic to D major.

Wait — Amaj7: A, C#, E, **G#**  
But D major has **G natural**, so G# is chromatic.

So **Amaj7** is not diatonic to D major.

But **A7** is common as **V7 of D**, but here it's **Amaj7**, which is unusual.

Hmm — that suggests maybe we’re not in D major.

But wait — **Amaj7/C#** — perhaps it's functioning as something else?

Let’s consider **mode**.

Wait — what if we're in **D Lydian**?

Lydian has a raised 4th, so in D Lydian: D E F# **G#** A B C#

Now check:

- D major: I = D
- Bm: vi = Bm
- F#m: iii = F#m
- E7: V7/V = secondary dominant, leads to A
- Amaj7: IV in D Lydian? No — in D Lydian, 4th degree is **G#**, so IV would be **G# minor**, not A.

Wait — mode degrees depend on the root.

Alternatively, maybe the key is **A major**, and D is the IV.

Let’s try **A major**: A B C# D E F# G#

Chords:

- D – IV chord: yes
- Bm – vi chord: yes
- F#m – iii chord: yes
- E7 – V chord: yes (E7 is V in A major)
- Amaj7 – I chord: yes (I7)

But in the progression, the **tonic chord is D**, repeated many times, and the progression ends on D.

It starts with D and ends with D — D feels like **tonic**.

But Amaj7 appears late and then goes back to D, so D is still the home.

So D is tonic.

But D major doesn't have G# or C natural? Wait:

Wait — chords used:

- D: D F# A — fine
- Bm: B D F# — fine
- F#m: F# A C# — fine
- E7: E G# B D — G# is **not in D major**, but is in **D harmonic major or melodic minor**?
- Amaj7: A C# E G# — again, G# is chromatic to D major

But G# appears in both E7 and Amaj7.

So perhaps **G#** is being used as a leading tone.

But in D major, the leading tone is **C#**, not G#.

Unless the harmony is **borrowing** or modulating.

Wait — what if we're in **D Mixolydian**?

D Mixolydian: D E F# G A B C — so **C natural**, no C#

But we have **F#m**, which has **C#**, not C natural. So C# is required.

So C# means we are in a sharp key — likely **D major or D Lydian**.

Wait — another idea: **E7** is **V7 of Am**, and **Amaj7** could be interpreted as a **major I chord in A major**, but if it's **not** functioning as tonic, but as a temporary major IV?

Wait — let’s consider **D major with modal mixture or secondary dominants**.

Back to **D major**: D E F# G A B C#

But E7 and Amaj7 both require **G#**

So **G#** is used — which is raised 4th (since 4th is G natural)

So **raised 4th** = characteristic of **Lydian mode**

So try **D Lydian**:

D E F# **G#** A B C#

Now:

- D: I — yes
- Bm: vi — yes (B D F#)
- F#m: iii — yes (F# A C#) — wait, C# is in D Lydian? D Lydian comes from A major scale, so **C# is present** (since A major has C#)

D Lydian: D E F# G# A B C# — yes, C# is the 7th note.

Perfect — so:

- D: I — D F# A
- Bm: vi — B D F# — yes
- F#m: iii — F# A C# — yes
- E7: E G# B D — G# is in scale, B and D are in scale — E is 2nd degree, but E7 is not a diatonic chord in D Lydian. Diatonic chord on E would be **Emaj** (E G# B), which is I in E Lydian, but here we have E7 = E G# B D — that adds **D**, which is in scale. So E7 has notes: E, G#, B, D — all except the **7th (D)** — actually, in D Lydian, **D is root**, so **D is in scale**.

So E7: E G# B D — all notes are in **D Lydian** scale! Because:

- E = 2nd
- G# = #4 (raised 4th)
- B = 6th
- D = 7th above E, but D is **b7 of E**, so E7 = E G# B D = **dominant 7th chord**

Yes — and since **G#** is diatonic in D Lydian, and D natural is also diatonic, **E7 is diatonic to D Lydian**?

Wait — chord built on E in D Lydian: E F# G# A B C# D — so 1 3 5 b7 = E G# B D → **E7**!

Yes! So in **D Lydian**, the **ii7 chord is E7** — a dominant 7th!

Similarly, Amaj7: A C# E G# — A is 5th degree in D Lydian.

Chord on A: A B C# D E F# G# → 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 — so triad: A C# E = A major, and 7th is G# → **A major 7** → Amaj7!

So in **D Lydian**, the **V chord** is **Amaj7**!

Yes!

Summary in D Lydian:

- D = I
- Bm = vi (B D F#)
- F#m = iii (F# A C#)
- E7 = ii7
- Amaj7 = Vmaj7

All these chords are **diatonic** to **D Lydian**!

So let's confirm:

**D Lydian scale**: D E F# G# A B C#

Chords:

- D: D F# A → I
- Bm: B D F# → vi
- F#m: F# A C# → iii
- E7: E G# B D → ii7 — all notes in scale? E, G#, B, D → yes, all in D Lydian
- Amaj7: A C# E G# → Vmaj7 — yes, all notes in scale

Perfect fit.

Also, the progression **ends on D**, and D is emphasized — feels like tonic.

The use of G# (the #4) is essential and appears in E7 and Amaj7, which are strong chords in the key.

In contrast, in D major, G# would be chromatic, but here it's diatonic.

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: D
- **Mode**: **Lydian**
- **Full answer**: The progression is in **D Lydian mode**

✅ Final Answer: **Key: D, Mode: Lydian**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by analyzing this step by step.

First, I need to list out all the chords in the sequence. Looking at the progression: D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, D, F#m/C#, E7/D, D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, D, Amaj7/C#, D. Wait, some of these have slashes, which indicate bass notes. So Bm/D means B minor chord with D in the bass. Similarly, F#m/C# is F# minor with C# bass, E7/D is E7 with D bass, and Amaj7/C# is A major 7 with C# bass. But for key determination, the bass notes might not be as crucial as the chord qualities themselves. However, the bass notes can sometimes hint at inversions or pedal points, but the main chords are still D, Bm, F#m, E7, Amaj7.

Let me write the chord roots without considering inversions for simplicity: D, D, Bm, Bm, D, D, F#m, E7, D, D, Bm, Bm, D, D, Amaj7, D. So the chord roots are D, B, F#, E, A. Let me list them in order: D, D, B (for Bm), B, D, D, F#, E, D, D, B, B, D, D, A, D.

Now, to figure out the key, I need to see which key these chords belong to. Common chords in a key usually form a diatonic progression. Let's consider possible keys.

First, check key of D major. The diatonic chords in D major are:
I: D, ii: Em, iii: F#m, IV: G, V: A, vi: Bm, vii°: C#°.

Looking at the progression: D (I), Bm (vi), F#m (iii), E7 (which would be the V7 of A, but in D major, the V chord is A, not E. Wait, E7 isn't diatonic to D major. The diatonic V chord is A, and E7 is not part of D major because E7 has G# and D, but D major has G natural, so E7 would be E G# B D – that's a dominant 7th, but in D major, the V7 is A7 (A C# E G), not E7. So E7 isn't diatonic to D major.

Wait, maybe it's in G major? In G major, diatonic chords: G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), F#° (vii°). But here we have chords like Bm (which is iii in G major), D (V), but E7? In G major, E7 would be the VII7 chord, but E7 is E G# B D – G# is not in G major (G major has F# instead of G#). Wait, G major scale is G A B C D E F#, so E7 has G# which is not in the scale. So E7 isn't diatonic to G major.

How about A major? In A major: A (I), Bm (ii), C#m (iii), D (IV), E (V), F#m (vi), G#° (vii°). Check the chords: D (IV), Bm (ii), F#m (vi), E7? In A major, the V chord is E, but E7 is E G# B D – which is diatonic to A major because A major includes G#? A major scale: A B C# D E F# G#. Yes, G# is there. So E7 is the V7 chord in A major. That makes sense. But let's see the other chords. The progression has D (which is IV in A major), Bm (ii), F#m (vi), and E7 (V7). Also, Amaj7 – A major 7 is I maj7 in A major. But wait, the progression has Amaj7/C#. Amaj7 is A C# E G#, so Amaj7/C# would be C# bass, which is the third of the chord. But in A major, that's still a chord from A major.

Wait, let's list out all chords in the progression in terms of A major:

- D: IV (D major)
- Bm: ii (B minor)
- F#m: vi (F# minor)
- E7: V7 (E dominant 7)
- Amaj7: I maj7

Yes, that fits. So in A major, the chords are all diatonic. Let me confirm:

D major is IV, yes. Bm is ii, correct. F#m is vi, yes. E7 is V7 (since V chord in A major is E, and E7 is a common dominant 7th for resolution to A). Amaj7 is just I with a major 7th.

But wait, Amaj7 is I maj7, but typically when people say "key of A major", they might expect simple triads, but maj7 chords are still within the key because A major scale has G# as the 7th, so A C# E G# is diatonic.

Now, checking the chord progression: D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D.

So, in A major:

- D (IV), D (IV), Bm (ii) with D in bass (so D is the third of Bm, but Bm is B-D-F#, so Bm/D is first inversion), similarly F#m/C# is F#-A-C# with C# bass, which is root position for F#m? Wait, F#m is F#-A-C#, so C# is the fifth. So F#m/C# is bass note C#, which is fifth. E7/D: E7 is E-G#-B-D, so D is the seventh, so E7/D is a fourth inversion. Amaj7/C#: Amaj7 is A-C#-E-G#, so C# is the third, so Amaj7/C# is first inversion. D is A major's IV.

But the key here is A major, but let's see if there's another possibility.

Wait, what about D major? Earlier I thought E7 isn't in D major. D major is D-E#-F#-G-A-B-C#? Wait no: D major scale is D E F# G A B C#. So chord E7 would be E-G#-B-D. G# is not in D major (D major has G natural), so E7 is not diatonic to D major. So that's out.

What about E major? E major scale: E F# G# A B C# D#. But the chords here include D as a main chord, which isn't in E major. So probably not.

Wait, maybe it's in D Mixolydian? Mixolydian mode has a flat 7th. So D Mixolydian is D E F# G A B C natural. Then chord E7 would be E-G#-B-D – but G# is not in D Mixolydian (which has G natural), so E7 wouldn't be diatonic there either.

Alternatively, maybe the key is A minor? Let's check. A natural minor scale: A B C D E F G. Chords: i: Am, ii°: B°, III: C, iv: Dm, v: Em, VI: F, VII: G. But the progression has D (which would be iv), but D major is not diatonic; D minor is iv. But here the D chords are major? The progression has D major. Also F#m – in A minor, F#m isn't diatonic unless it's harmonic minor. A harmonic minor has F#? No, A harmonic minor is A B C D E F G#, so F# is not there. A melodic minor ascending has F#, G#.

Wait, but in A natural minor, chords are mostly minor and diminished. But here we have F#m – which is not in A natural minor. So probably not.

Another thought: A major key makes sense. Because:

- D is IV
- Bm is ii
- F#m is vi
- E7 is V7 (which resolves to A, but in the progression, it goes to Amaj7 next? Let's see the order: ... E7/D D D ... So after E7/D, it goes to D. So E7 to D? In A major, E7 is V7, which typically resolves to A (I), but here it goes to D (IV). That's not the typical V-I resolution. So maybe it's a deceptive resolution or part of a different progression.

Alternatively, maybe the key is D major, but E7 is used as a borrowed chord? But in D major, E7 would be from outside.

Wait, but if we consider A major, the E7 is V7, which often resolves to A, but here the progression has E7/D followed by D. So E7 to D. In the key of A major, that's V7 to IV. Which is not the strongest resolution, but it's possible. For example, in a I-IV-V progression, you might have V-IV, but usually IV-V-I. But V-IV is a possible movement. However, in A major, the IV is D major. So E7 to D is V7 to IV. That does happen sometimes, especially in rock or pop.

But let's look at the Amaj7 at the end. Amaj7 is I. Then it ends on D. So the progression ends with Amaj7/C# followed by D. So A maj7 then D. In A major, that's I to IV. Which is common.

Another way: let's list the notes present. If all chords are in A major, then the scale is A B C# D E F# G#.

D major chord: D F# A – all in A major scale (D is 4th degree, F# is 6th? Wait A major scale: A (1), B(2), C#(3), D(4), E(5), F#(6), G#(7). So yes, D major chord is D-F#-A. F# is 6th degree, A is 3rd of D chord. Yes, in scale.

Bm: B-D-F#. B is 2nd, D is 4th, F# is 6th. Yes, all in scale.

F#m: F#-A-C#. Yes, F#(6), A(1), C#(3). In scale.

E7: E-G#-B-D. E(5), G#(7), B(2), D(4). Yes, all in A major scale.

Amaj7: A-C#-E-G#. A(1), C#(3), E(5), G#(7). Perfect.

So all chords are diatonic to A major. So the key is A major.

Now, mode: A major is the Ionian mode. So it's in the key of A major, ionian mode.

But let's check if it's another mode. For example, could it be in D major but using some other mode? But the E7 chord wouldn't fit. Or maybe the progression is actually in D major but with the E7 as a borrowed chord? But why would they say "key and mode" then? If it's all diatonic to A major, then key is A major, mode is Ionian.

But let's see the bass notes. The chords with slashes: Bm/D means the bass is D, which is part of the D major chord. Similarly F#m/C# has bass C#. In A major, C# is the 3rd, which is a diatonic note. E7/D has bass D, which is part of E7 chord (since E7 has D as the 7th), so it's a common inversion. Amaj7/C# has bass C# (which is 3rd of A maj7).

But even considering inversions, all the chords fit in A major.

Another check: what's the tonic? The progression has Amaj7 at the end before final D. But the last chord is D. But in the progression, if it's A major, the tonic is A. However, the progression ends on D, which is IV. That might not be typical, but maybe it's not a complete piece. Maybe it's part of a longer progression. But often the key can be determined by the most stable chords, and chords that resolve.

But let's see the overall structure. The progression has D appearing very frequently. But in A major, the IV chord (D) can be a common chord. Also, Bm, F#m, E7 are all present.

Wait, another thought: sometimes if the progression revolves around a chord other than I, you might be in a different mode. For example, if it's centered on D, but D major scale chords don't include E7.

But let's see. If it were D Mixolydian, which is D E F# G A B C, no G#. But E7 has G# which is not in D Mixolydian. So that doesn't fit.

If in G major: scale G A B C D E F#. Chords: D is V, Bm is iii, F#m is vi? Wait in G major, F#m would be the vi chord? G major scale: G A B C D E F#. So F# is part of it. F#m would be F# A C#. Yes. But E7: E G# B D. G# is not in G major (G major has F#), so no. Therefore, E7 not diatonic here.

So back to A major: all chords fit perfectly. So key is A major, which is the Ionian mode.

But let me check once more. If it's in A major, then common chords are I(A), ii(Bm), iii(C#m), IV(D), V(E), vi(F#m), vii°(G#°). But the progression has E7 (which is V7), F#m (vi), D (IV), Bm (ii), Amaj7 (I). Yes. So all chords are diatonic. So key is A, mode Ionian.

Another angle: the E7 chord. In A major, E7 is definitely the dominant 7th. But when it leads to D (IV), it's a deceptive resolution (usually V7 to vi, but here it's V7 to IV). Still, possible. The Amaj7 is the I maj7. So the key is A major.

Alternatively, could it be in D major with borrowed chords? Like a Bm chord is ii in D major, which is fine. F#m is iii in D major. E7: in D major, E7 would be a borrowed chord from where? Maybe from A major, but that's not standard. But the chords in D major would not have E7 naturally. So that seems less likely.

Hence, after all checks, the key is A major, mode is Ionian.

Wait, but let's see the progression again. The chord after Amaj7/C# is D. So the entire progression is ... Amaj7/C# D. So Amaj7 to D. In A major, I to IV. That's a common cadence (like in I-IV-V-I, but here ending on IV).

But sometimes if the tonic isn't clearly established, you have to look for the chord that feels like home. However, in this progression, the Amaj7 is present, which is I. So probably the tonic is A.

So the key is A major, mode is Ionian.

Yes, that seems right.


The given chord progression is:

**D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D**

### 🔍 **Step-by-Step Analysis**

#### **1. Identify Chords (Roots Only):**
- D (major), D (major), Bm (minor), Bm (minor), D (major), D (major), F#m (minor), E7 (dominant 7th), D (major), D (major), Bm (minor), Bm (minor), D (major), D (major), Amaj7 (major 7th), D (major)

#### **2. Determine Diatonic Key:**
Let’s test **A Major** (Ionian mode) — the most likely key based on common diatonic chords and the presence of **E7** (dominant 7th).

**A Major Scale**:  
A – B – C# – D – E – F# – G#  

Chords in A Major:  
- I = **A**  
- ii = **Bm**  
- iii = **C#m**  
- IV = **D**  
- V = **E**  
- vi = **F#m**  
- vii° = **G#°**  

Now map the progression to A Major:

| Chord       | Function in A Major | Notes in A Major |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| D           | IV                  | D–F#–A ✅        |
| Bm          | ii                  | B–D–F# ✅        |
| F#m         | vi                  | F#–A–C# ✅       |
| E7          | V7 (dominant)       | E–G#–B–D ✅      |
| Amaj7       | I (maj7)            | A–C#–E–G# ✅     |

✅ **All chords are diatonic to A Major** — no chromatic or borrowed chords are needed.

#### **3. Check for Other Possibilities:**
- **D Major**:  
  Scale = D–E–F#–G–A–B–C#  
  E7 = E–G#–B–D ❌ G# is **not** in D Major (D Major has **G natural**).  
  → Not diatonic.

- **G Major**:  
  Scale = G–A–B–C–D–E–F#  
  E7 = E–G#–B–D ❌ G# is **not** in G Major (G Major has **F#**).  
  → Not diatonic.

- **A Minor**:  
  Natural Minor = A–B–C–D–E–F–G  
  E7 = E–G#–B–D ❌ G# is **not** in A Minor.  
  → Not diatonic.

- **Other Modes (e.g., D Mixolydian)**:  
  D Mixolydian = D–E–F#–G–A–B–C  
  E7 = E–G#–B–D ❌ G# is **not** in D Mixolydian (has **C natural**, not G#).  
  → Not diatonic.

✅ **Only A Major fits all chords perfectly.**

#### **4. Inversions & Bass Notes:**
- **Bm/D**: Bm (B–D–F#) with D in bass → first inversion (D is the 3rd of Bm)  
- **F#m/C#**: F#m (F#–A–C#) with C# in bass → first inversion (C# is the 5th)  
- **E7/D**: E7 (E–G#–B–D) with D in bass → seventh (D is the 7th of E7)  
- **Amaj7/C#**: Amaj7 (A–C#–E–G#) with C# in bass → third of the chord  

These are **standard inversions within A Major** and do not suggest a different key.

#### **5. Tonic Stability:**
- **Amaj7** is the **I chord** (tonic) in A Major.  
- The progression ends with **Amaj7/C# → D**, which is **I → IV** — a common resolution in many genres (e.g., pop, rock).  
- While the progression ends on **IV (D)**, the presence of **Amaj7** as the only major 7th chord and the consistent use of A Major scale tones strongly confirms **A** as the tonic.

---

### ✅ **Final Conclusion**

- **Key**: **A Major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (the major scale mode)  

This is a classic **A Major (Ionian)** progression. The chords all align perfectly with the scale, and the tonic is clearly **A**. The E7 chord resolves to D (IV), which is a common substitution for the typical V–I resolution, and the Amaj7 reinforces the major tonality.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

> D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – F#m/C# – E7/D – D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – Amaj7/C# – D

---

### Step 1: Identify the bass notes and implied harmony

Many chords are written with slash notation (e.g., Bm/D), meaning **B minor chord with D in the bass**. This suggests **inversions** or **bass motion**, not necessarily new chords.

Let’s list the **root notes** of each chord (ignoring bass note for now, but noting it for context):

| Chord       | Root | Bass | Function (tentative) |
|-------------|------|------|----------------------|
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| Bm/D        | B    | D    | vi (with inversion)  |
| Bm/D        | B    | D    | vi                   |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| F#m/C#      | F#   | C#   | iii (with inversion) |
| E7/D        | E    | D    | V7 (with suspension/inversion) |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| Bm/D        | B    | D    | vi                   |
| Bm/D        | B    | D    | vi                   |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |
| Amaj7/C#    | A    | C#   | IVmaj7? (but C# bass) |
| D           | D    | D    | I                    |

---

### Step 2: Look for key center — what is the tonic?

The progression **starts and ends on D**, and **D appears frequently** as the harmonic center.

Also, notice the **B minor** chord — Bm is the **vi chord** in **D major**.

Let’s check what diatonic chords are in **D major**:

**D major scale**: D E F# G A B C#

Diatonic chords:
- I: D
- ii: Em
- iii: F#m
- IV: G
- V: A
- vi: Bm
- vii°: C#°

But we have **E7** and **Amaj7** — neither of these are diatonic to D major.

- **E7** = E G# B D → G# is **not** in D major (D major has G natural)
- **Amaj7** = A C# E G# → C# and G# are **not** in D major

So D major alone **cannot** explain E7 or Amaj7.

→ This suggests **borrowing** or a **modal mixture**, or possibly a **different key**.

---

### Step 3: Consider **D major with chromaticism**, or **D Mixolydian?**

Let’s test **D Mixolydian**: D E F# G A B C (C natural!)

But then E7 = E G# B D — G# is still **not** in D Mixolydian (has G natural). So no.

What about **D major with a borrowed E7**?

E7 is the **dominant of A**, so it could be a **secondary dominant**: **V7/ii**? But ii is Em, not A.

Wait — **E7 → Amaj7**?

E7 is the **V7 of A**, and Amaj7 is **A major 7**, so:

**E7 → Amaj7** = **V7 of IV** in D major?

In D major:

- IV = G
- But we have **Amaj7** — A is the **V** chord in D major. So why is it major 7?

Hold on — **Amaj7** is a **major 7th chord on A**, but in D major, A is the **V chord**, which is normally **A major** (triad), but **A7** (dominant 7) would be expected, not Amaj7.

Amaj7 = A C# E G# — that’s a **bright, colorful** chord — it’s **not** in D major.

But here's a key insight:

### The progression: E7 → Amaj7

- E7 = **E G# B D**
- Amaj7 = **A C# E G#**

They share **E and G#** → so E7 functions as **V7 of A** → tonicizing A.

So **E7 → Amaj7** = **V7/IV → IV**? Wait.

In D major, **IV is G**.

But Amaj7 is not IV — **A is V**.

Wait — **A is V** in D major.

So if we have **E7 → A**, that’s **V7/V → V** (secondary dominant).

Yes! That’s a **classic secondary dominant**:

- **E7 = V7 of A**
- **A = V chord** in D major

So: **V7/V → V**

Then what is **Amaj7**? That’s a **major 7th** on the V chord.

In pop/rock/jazz, it’s common to see **Vmaj7** instead of V7 — especially in ballads or smoother styles. It softens the dominant function.

So **Amaj7** → bending the tradition, but viable as a **colorful V chord**.

Now, **F#m/C#** — F#m = iii chord in D major → C# is the 7th degree, so F#m/C# is **iii6** (first inversion)

Also, **Bm/D** — Bm = vi → D is the 3rd of Bm, so Bm/D = vi6

So all the slash chords are just inversions!

So let’s re-express the progression **without slash notation**, just root movement:

**D – D – Bm – Bm – D – D – F#m – E7 – D – D – Bm – Bm – D – D – Amaj7 – D**

So the chord root progression is:

**D → D → Bm → Bm → D → D → F#m → E7 → D → D → Bm → Bm → D → D → Amaj7 → D**

Now let’s map this in **D major**:

| Chord    | Function in D major |
|----------|---------------------|
| D        | I                   |
| D        | I                   |
| Bm       | vi                  |
| Bm       | vi                  |
| D        | I                   |
| D        | I                   |
| F#m      | iii                 |
| E7       | V7/V (secondary dominant of V) → resolves to |
| D        | I                   |
| D        | I                   |
| Bm       | vi                  |
| Bm       | vi                  |
| D        | I                   |
| D        | I                   |
| **Amaj7**| **Vmaj7** (colorful version of V) |
| D        | I                   |

Wait — **Amaj7** is **A major 7**, which is **not diatonic** to D major, but **A** is diatonic. The **G#** in Amaj7 is the **clue**: D major has **C#**, not **G#**.

D major scale: **D E F# G A B C#**

Amaj7 = A C# E G# → contains **G#**, which is **not** in D major.

G# is the **raised 7th** of F#, or the **major 3rd of E** — but more importantly, **G# is the leading tone of A**, which is the note that Amaj7 is built on.

So Amaj7 is **not** a diatonic chord in D major — it introduces **G#**, which is an **accidental**.

But we already had G# in **E7** (E G# B D) — so the **G# is introduced in E7**, then carried into Amaj7.

So: **E7 has G#** → Amaj7 also has G# → so this is not an accidental — it’s **intentional**.

What key has G# and C#? **D major has C#**, and **E major has G#**, but **D major and E major** are not the same.

Let’s look at the **G#** — it**s** the major 7th in Amaj7 and the major 3rd in E7. So the harmonic area is **centered around A**, perhaps?

But the progression ends on **D**, and D is the most frequent chord.

So perhaps the key is **D major**, but the **V chord is being altered** to **Amaj7** — ie, **borrowed from D major with Lydian or modal mixture?**

Wait — no. A major 7 is not borrowed from D major. It’s borrowing from **A major**, meaning we are **temporarily tonicizing A**.

But the **overall key** is D → because the progression begins and ends in D, and D is home.

Also, Bm (vi) is common.

So:

### Final analysis:

- **Tonic chord**: D (appears 8 times)
- **vi chord**: Bm (appears 4 times) — very common in pop
- **iii chord**: F#m
- **Secondary dominant**: E7 → tonicizing A
- **V chord**: Amaj7 → instead of A or A7, we get Amaj7, which is a **colorful, non-dominant 7th** variant — common in modern pop, R&B, soft rock

The presence of **G#** in E7 and Amaj7 is **borrowed from the key of A major**, but not enough to change the overall key — it's **secondary dominant usage**.

### Is it D major or D minor?

D minor has F natural and C natural — we have F# and C#, so no.

→ Definitely **major tonality**.

### Mode?

The basic harmonic structure suggests **D Ionian (major)**. All chords are either diatonic or secondary dominants.

The **Amaj7** is an **altered V chord**, but it’s doing **tonicizing** work, not changing the mode.

### Conclusion:

> ✅ **Key: D major**  
> ✅ **Mode: Ionian (major)**

The chord progression uses:

- Diatonic chords: D, Bm, F#m
- Secondary dominant: E7 → tonicizing A (V)
- Colorful variant of V: Amaj7 instead of A or A7
- All slash chords are inversions (Bm/D = vi6, F#m/C# = iii6, E7/D = V7/V with bass in root position? Wait — E7/D = E7 with D in bass — which is not standard; E7/D is **E7 in 2nd inversion** if we consider the 3rd (G#) as the root... but this might be a **pedal D** or **bass line motion**.

Wait — **E7/D** = E7 chord with D in the bass. That’s **E7 with a non-chord tone in bass**.

E7 = E G# B D → with D in bass → so bass note D is the **7th of the chord**. So E7/D is **E7 (7th in bass)** — that’s **1st inversion of a dominant 7th chord**, but usually we write dominant 7th chords with root in bass unless specifying voicing.

E7 in 1st inversion is **E7/G#**  
E7 in 2nd inversion is **E7/B**  
E7 in 3rd inversion (7th in bass) is **E7/D**

So E7/D is just a **voicing** — the G# is still the major 3rd — this is fine.

The bass movement: D → D → D → D → D → D → C# → D → D → ... C# → D

This **C#** (in F#m/C# and Amaj7/C#) creates a nice **chromatic bass descent**:  
D → C# → B → A? But we have D → D → D → D → F#m/C# → E7/D → D → D → Amaj7/C# → D

Bass notes:  
D - D - D - D - D - D - **C#** - **D** - D - D - D - D - D - D - **C#** - D

It’s **not a smooth bass line** — but **C#** appears twice as a bass note under F#m and Amaj7.

C# is the **leading tone** to D — so F#m/C# and Amaj7/C# create a **leading-tone motion to D** — very expressive.

This gives the progression emotional color — especially the final Amaj7/C# → D, where C# (leading tone) resolves to D (tonic).

So overall: brilliant use of **color chords** and **leading tone bass motion** within **D major**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: D major**  
> **Mode: Ionian**

The progression is centered in D major, uses diatonic chords, includes secondary dominant (E7) tonicizing the V chord (A), and features expressive non-diatonic color chords (Amaj7, E7) and leading-tone bass motion (C#) to enhance emotional flow — all while remaining firmly in the D major key.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the **key and mode** of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**  
D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – F#m/C# – E7/D – D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – Amaj7/C# – D

---

### Step 1: List the unique chords (simplify bass notes for analysis)

- **D** (D major)
- **Bm/D** → B minor with D in the bass → essentially **Bm** (vi chord in D major)
- **F#m/C#** → F# minor with C# in the bass → **F#m** (iii chord in D major)
- **E7/D** → E dominant 7 with D in the bass → **E7** (V7 chord in A major, but in D major it’s the **V7 of V**, or secondary dominant)
- **Amaj7/C#** → A major 7 with C# in the bass → **Amaj7** (V chord in D major)

So simplified root chords:  
**D – Bm – F#m – E7 – Amaj7**

---

### Step 2: Analyze diatonic chords in possible keys

#### Try **D major** (key signature: 2 sharps – F#, C#)

Diatonic chords in D major:
- I = D
- ii = Em
- iii = F#m
- IV = G
- V = A (or A7/Amaj7)
- vi = Bm
- vii° = C#dim

Compare to our chords:
- D → I ✅  
- Bm → vi ✅  
- F#m → iii ✅  
- Amaj7 → Vmaj7 (common in pop/folk; V chord in major key is often major or dominant) ✅  
- E7 → **Not diatonic** to D major (E is the ii chord in D, but E7 implies E–G#–B–D; G# is not in D major)

However, **E7** is the **dominant of Amaj7** → it’s a **secondary dominant**: **V7/V** (five of five). This is very common in tonal music and doesn’t change the key—it just leads strongly to the V chord (A).

So:  
- E7 → V7 of A (V)  
- Then resolves to A (or Amaj7)  
- Then back to D (I)

This is a classic **V7–V–I** cadence chain in D major.

The **Amaj7/C#** is just an A major 7 chord with the 3rd (C#) in the bass—a common voicing that smooths voice leading (especially from E7/D: both have D in the bass, then C#).

---

### Step 3: Consider mode

All chords fit **D Ionian (major)** with one secondary dominant (E7). No modal mixture (like B♭, G minor, etc.) or consistent use of non-diatonic notes.

- No Dorian (which would have a B♭ or C natural)
- No Mixolydian (which would have C natural, not C#)
- No other modal inflections

So it’s **not modal**—it’s **tonal** in **D major**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

- **Key:** D major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major) — but more accurately described as **tonal in D major**, not modal

The use of secondary dominants (E7) and extended chords (Amaj7) is common in pop, folk, and singer-songwriter styles, but doesn’t change the underlying key.

**Answer: D major (Ionian mode).**

### Reasoning

**Determining Chord Keys and Modes**

I'm now deep in the analysis, meticulously charting the chord sequence. So far, the repeating D and Bm/D chords are very intriguing. I'm focusing on their relationships to the other chords to ascertain the key and probable mode. I'm paying extra attention to the F#m/C# and E7/D chords, which could offer vital clues.


**Assessing Key Signatures**

Now, I'm examining how each chord functions in relation to D. The frequent appearance of Bm and F#m strongly suggests a D major key. I'm focusing on the Amaj7/C# and E7/D chords as they seem to diverge from a purely diatonic approach. My goal is to determine if we're dealing with D major, or a modal variation thereof.


**Deciphering Scale and Mode**

The presence of G# in Amaj7 and E7 is a key revelation, suggesting alterations to the D major scale. Now, I'm carefully evaluating if this is a modal interchange. The dominant function of E7/D, and the overall progression, leans towards a D key, but with chromaticism.


**Determining Mode Confirmation**

I'm now fully immersed in the Lydian mode, confirming the D Lydian hypothesis by mapping the chord functions. The E7 and Amaj7 chords are clear indicators of this mode. Now, I'm focusing on validating if the progression adheres to this modal characteristic throughout, or if there are unexpected alterations.


**Deciding on Modal Integrity**

I'm now carefully analyzing the harmonic context of each chord within the D Lydian framework. The consistent usage of E7 and Amaj7 firmly establishes the mode, and I'm cross-referencing this to confirm if any unexpected chord alterations exist. This will help confirm the overall structure.


**Concluding Mode and Key**

I'm synthesizing all the analysis, confirming that D is the tonal center, and the persistent G# definitively establishes the Lydian mode. I'm satisfied that I've accurately determined the key and mode of this progression.




This chord progression is defined by its strong D tonic and the specific chromatic harmony used, particularly the characteristic raised 4th degree ($\text{G}\sharp$).

**Analysis:**

1.  **Tonic Identification:** The progression strongly centers on **D Major**. It begins and ends on D, and D is the most frequent chord.
    *   Tonic = D

2.  **Chord Function and Diatonic Scale (D Major: D E F# G A B C#):**
    *   D (I)
    *   Bm (vi)
    *   F#m (iii)
    *   Amaj7, E7

3.  **Crucial Chromatic Notes:** We must examine the chords that fall outside the standard D Major scale:
    *   **E7/D (E G# B D):** The $\text{G}\sharp$ is the defining factor here. In D Major, the 4th degree is G natural. The $\text{G}\sharp$ raises the 4th degree.
    *   **Amaj7/C# (A C# E G#):** Again, the presence of $\text{G}\sharp$ confirms the use of the raised 4th scale degree.

4.  **Mode Determination:** A major scale rooted on D, but featuring the raised 4th degree ($\text{G}\sharp$), is characteristic of the **Lydian Mode**.

    *   **D Lydian Scale:** D – E – F# – $\text{G}\sharp$ – A – B – C#

5.  **Diatonic Chords in D Lydian:**
    *   I = D Major (D F# A)
    *   vi = B minor (B D F#)
    *   iii = F# minor (F# A C#)
    *   V = Amaj7 (A C# E G#) — *Perfect fit for Amaj7*
    *   II dominant (Standard Lydian feature) = E7 (E G# B D) — *Perfect fit for E7*

**Conclusion:**

The tonal center is D, and the use of the $\text{G}\sharp$ requires the raised 4th scale degree, leading unequivocally to the Lydian mode.

**Key and Mode: D Lydian**

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

Based on the chords provided: D, Bm/D, F\#m/C\#, E7/D, and Amaj7/C\#, let's analyze the harmonic content to determine the key and mode.

The chords primarily consist of notes from the D major scale (D, E, F\#, G, A, B, C\#).

*   **D Major Chord (D):** D - F\# - A (Tonic in D Major)
*   **Bm/D Chord:** B - D - F\# (Tonic parallel minor, vi chord in D Major)
*   **Amaj7/C\# Chord:** A - C\# - E - G\# (The G\# is crucial)
*   **F\#m/C\# Chord:** F\# - A - C\# (mediant, iii chord in D Major)
*   **E7/D Chord:** E - G\# - B - D (Crucially contains G\#, the raised 4th)

### The Dominant Influence

In the diatonic key of **D Major**, the chords would typically be:

| Chord | Function | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| D | I | D - F\# - A |
| Em | ii | E - G - B |
| F\#m | iii | F\# - A - C\# |
| G | IV | G - B - D |
| A | V | A - C\# - E |
| Bm | vi | B - D - F\# |
| C\#dim | vii° | C\# - E - G |

The provided chords **Amaj7/C\#** and **E7/D** reveal non-diatonic notes.

*   The **Amaj7** chord (A - C\# - E - G\#) contains **G\#**.
*   The **E7** chord (E - G\# - B - D) contains **G\#**.

In D Major, the fourth scale degree is G. The presence of **G\# (the raised 4th, or \#4)** in these chords fundamentally changes the mode.

### Conclusion on Key and Mode

1.  **Key Center:** The piece centers around D (starting and ending with D, and using the Bm and F\#m chords). The key is **D**.
2.  **Mode:** The scale structure consists of the notes D, E, F\#, G\#, A, B, C\#.

This specific pattern (1, 2, 3, \#4, 5, 6, 7) is the definition of the **Lydian** mode.

**Therefore, the key is D, and the mode is Lydian (D Lydian).**

D Lydian is built on the fourth degree of the A major scale (A - B - C\# - D - E - F\# - G\#).

The function of the non-diatonic chords in D Lydian:
*   **D:** I
*   **Amaj7:** V (A - C\# - E - G\#)
*   **E7:** II7 (E - G\# - B - D) - often used as a secondary dominant to V, but here functions as the II7 chord within the Lydian mode, setting up the movement to the tonic D.

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's analyze the chords:

**Chords provided (assuming root position unless specified):**

*   D
*   Bm/D
*   D
*   F#m/C#
*   E7/D
*   D
*   Bm/D
*   D
*   Amaj7/C#
*   D

**Harmonic Analysis Strategy:**

1.  **What's the tonic?** Which chord feels like "home"? D major appears most frequently, starts and ends the progression.
2.  **What's the quality of the tonic?** D major is a major chord.
3.  **Compare scale degrees to major/minor.**

Let's consider D as the tonic:

*   **I** = D major (Tonic)
*   **ii** = Em (Not present)
*   **iii** = F#m (Present as F#m/C# - iii)
*   **IV** = G major (Not present)
*   **V** = A major (Present as Amaj7/C# - V7/V or just V with 7th and inversion)
*   **vi** = Bm (Present as Bm/D - vi)
*   **vii°** = C#dim (Not present, though C# is in the bass of F#m/C# and Amaj7/C#)

**Chord Functions in D Major:**

*   D = **I** (Tonic)
*   Bm/D = **vi** (Submediant, Tonic extension/substitute) - Very common in pop/folk. The bass D reinforces the tonic.
*   F#m/C# = **iii** (Median, weak tonic function, often leads to vi or IV) - The C# bass leads nicely to D (VII to I in D, or just a passing bass).
*   E7/D = **V<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub>** (Dominant 7th, 2nd inversion) - This is a **very strong** dominant function chord. The bass D is a passing tone delaying the resolution to I. The E7 wants to resolve to A (V/V), but here it likely resolves directly to D (I) via the inversion and passing bass.
*   Amaj7/C# = **V<sup>6</sup><sub>5</sub>** (Dominant 7th, 1st inversion) - This is also a **strong** dominant function chord. The maj7 (G#) is the leading tone in A major, but here it's the 7th of the Amaj7 chord. It wants to resolve to D (I).

**Determining Key and Mode:**

1.  **Key Center:** The progression clearly revolves around D major. It starts and ends on D, and the other chords function relative to D.
2.  **Quality:** The tonic chord is major.
3.  **Mode:** Since the tonic is major and the harmony is functional (I, iii, vi, V), this is the **Ionian mode** (which is synonymous with the major scale).

**Conclusion:**

The key is **D Major**, and the mode is **Ionian (Major)**.

### Step 1: Identify the chord tones and bass notes

| Chord        | Notes (in root position)       | Bass note |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| D             | D–F#–A                        | D          |
| Bm/D          | B–D–F#                        | D          |
| F#m/C#        | F#–A–C#                       | C#         |
| E7/D          | E–G#–B–D                      | D          |
| Amaj7/C#      | A–C#–E–G#                     | C#         |

---

### Step 2: Look at the tonal center and harmonic function

- The progression revolves *strongly* around **D** — it begins, ends, and returns to D constantly, suggesting **D major** as the tonal center.
- Supporting chords:
  - **Bm/D** is the vi chord (Bm) with a D in the bass (same root as the tonic).
  - **F#m/C#** corresponds to the iii chord in D major (F#m), with its third (C#) in the bass.
  - **E7/D** is **V7/V** (the V of A major), but with D in the bass. This is a **secondary dominant** leading toward A, though the strong D bass keeps us grounded in D.
  - **Amaj7/C#** is the **V** chord (A major, extended to maj7) with its third in the bass (C#), functioning normally as dominant.

---

### Step 3: Check for modes or modal mixture

- All chord tones (D, E, F#, A, B, C#) are from the **D major scale**: D–E–F#–G–A–B–C#.
- The only altered tone is **G#** (in E7 and Amaj7), which comes from the harmonic major (raised 7th in the dominant context).  
  This is very normal in tonal major harmony—it doesn't imply a modal shift.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Key:** D major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major)  
- **Functional interpretation:**  
  The chords reinforce D major with tonic (D), submediant (Bm), mediant (F#m), and dominant (A/E7) functions. The chromatic G# in the dominants is standard in classical/tonal major harmony.

---

**Therefore:**

> The progression is in **D major (Ionian mode)**.

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, F#m/C#, E7/D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, Amaj7/C#, D. I need to determine the key and mode.

I see that most chords are based on D, so the key might be D major or D minor. Let me list out the chords without the slashes for now to simplify. The slashes indicate bass notes, but for key analysis, I should focus on the chord qualities.

So, the chords are:

- D

- Bm/D (which is B minor with D bass)

- Bm/D again

- D

- F#m/C# (F# minor with C# bass)

- E7/D (E dominant 7 with D bass)

- D

- Bm/D

- Bm/D

- D

- Amaj7/C# (A major 7 with C# bass)

- D

Now, let's identify the chord qualities:

- D major

- B minor (with D bass, but still B minor chord)

- F# minor (with C# bass)

- E7 (E dominant 7)

- A major 7 (with C# bass)

The E7 is a dominant 7 chord, which often functions as the V chord in a key. In D major, the V chord would be A major, but here it's E7, which would be V of A? Let's think.

In D major, the chords would be D, Em, F#m, G, A, Bm, C#dim. So we have D, Bm, F#m, and then E7. E7 is not in D major; E7 would be the V chord in A major.

But we have Amaj7, which is in A major, but the progression starts and ends on D, so perhaps it's in D mixolydian or something.

Let me consider the mode. Since there are chords like Bm and F#m, which are both minor, and in D major, Bm is the vi chord and F#m is the iii chord, so that fits. But E7 is not in D major; E7 has a G# note, while D major has G natural.

D major scale: D E F# G A B C#

E7 chord: E G# B D – so G# is not in D major; it's the leading tone in A major.

Similarly, Amaj7: A C# E G# – again, G# is not in D major.

So, if I see G# in the chords, that suggests we might be in A major or something else.

But the progression revolves around D, and it starts and ends on D, so perhaps D is the tonic.

Let me list all the notes involved in the chords to find the key.

First, D major chord: D F# A

Bm chord: B D F# – so notes B D F#

F#m chord: F# A C# – with C# bass, but notes are F# A C#

E7 chord: E G# B D

Amaj7 chord: A C# E G#

Now, let's see all the notes used: D, F#, A, B, D, F#, F#, A, C#, E, G#, B, D, D, F#, A, B, D, F#, D, F#, A, A, C#, E, G#, D

From this, the notes are: D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#. That's almost all notes except C natural? We have C# from F#m and Amaj7, and G# from E7 and Amaj7. So the notes are D E F# G# A B C# – which is the D major scale? No, D major scale has C# and F#, but no G#. D major has G natural, but here we have G#.

D E F# G# A B C# – that's the D lydian scale? Lydian has raised fourth, but here G# is the seventh? Let's see the intervals.

From D to E: major second

E to F#: major second

F# to G#: major second

G# to A: minor second

A to B: major second

B to C#: major second

C# to D: minor second

So the scale is: D E F# G# A B C# – this is actually the A major scale starting from D? A major scale is A B C# D E F# G#, so if I start from D, it's D E F# G# A B C#, which is D lydian? Lydian mode has raised fourth, but here the fourth of D is G, and we have G#, so yes, raised fourth, so D lydian.

But let's confirm the chords. In D lydian, the chords would be similar to A major but with D as tonic.

In A major, the chords are A, Bm, C#m, D, E, F#m, G#dim.

In this progression, we have D (which is IV in A major), Bm (ii in A), F#m (vi in A), E7 (V in A), and Amaj7 (I in A). But the progression starts and ends on D, so if we consider D as tonic, then in A major, D is the IV chord, so if we use D as tonic, we are in the lydian mode.

Lydian mode has a raised fourth, which is G# in D, and we see G# in E7 and Amaj7 chords.

E7 has G#, which is the major third of E, and in D lydian, the seventh note is C# which is major seventh, but in lydian, the seventh is major, so C# is fine.

In D lydian, the chord built on E would be E major? Let's see the diatonic chords in D lydian.

D lydian scale: D E F# G# A B C#

Chords:

I: D major

ii: E minor? No, from E to G# is major third, so E major? Let's build triads.

On D: D F# A - D major

On E: E G# B - E major

On F#: F# A C# - F# minor

On G#: G# B D - G# diminished? G# B D is G# dim since B to D is minor third.

On A: A C# E - A major

On B: B D F# - B minor

On C#: C# E G# - C# minor? C# E G# is C# minor since E to G# is major third? C# to E is minor third, E to G# is major third, so it's a minor chord? No, C# to E is minor third, E to G# is major third, so that's an augmented chord? Let's see intervals.

C# to E: minor third (3 semitones)

E to G#: major third (4 semitones)

So minor third plus major third is augmented fifth? No, from C# to G# is perfect fifth? C# to G# is 7 semitones, which is perfect fifth? C# to G# is 7 semitones, yes perfect fifth, but since the third is minor, it's a minor chord? No, in a triad, if the root to third is minor third, and third to fifth is major third, then the root to fifth is perfect fifth, so it's a minor chord. For example, A minor is A C E, A to C minor third, C to E major third, perfect fifth. Similarly, C# to E minor third, E to G# major third, so C# E G# is C# minor chord? But G# is the fifth? C# to G# is perfect fifth? C# to G# is 7 semitones, yes perfect fifth. So C# E G# is indeed C# minor chord.

But in the scale, we have C# and E and G#, so C# minor chord.

But in the progression, we have Amaj7 which has C# E G# A, so that includes C# minor triad but with A, so it's A major 7 chord.

In the chord progression, we don't have a C# chord, so it's fine.

Back to diatonic chords in D lydian:

I: D maj

II: E maj

iii: F# min

iv°: G# dim? G# B D is G# diminished because B to D is minor third, and G# to B is minor third, so diminished triad.

V: A maj

vi: B min

vii: C# min

But in the progression, we have E7, which is E dominant 7, which is not diatonic to D lydian because diatonic would be E major, not E7. E7 has G# and B and D and F? E7 is E G# B D, so it has G# and B and D, which are in the scale, but E7 has a flat seventh? E dominant 7 has minor seventh, which would be D, but in the scale, the seventh is C#, which is major seventh. So E7 has D, which is the minor seventh of E, but in D lydian, the seventh note is C#, which is major seventh from D? Let's think in terms of E.

In E major, the seventh would be D#? No, for E chord, the seventh in E major scale is D#? E major scale: E F# G# A B C# D#, so the seventh is D#. But in E7, the seventh is D natural, which is the dominant seventh, so it's not from E major scale; it's from E mixolydian or something.

In the context of D lydian, if we have E7, that would require a D natural, but in D lydian, we have C# and D? No, in D lydian, the notes are D E F# G# A B C#, so we have C# but not D natural? We have D as the tonic, but the seventh note is C#, which is a major seventh above D? From D to C# is major seventh, so the scale has C#, not D natural.

But in E7 chord, we have D natural, which is not in the D lydian scale. So E7 introduces a D natural, which is not in the scale.

Similarly, in Amaj7, we have G#, which is in the scale, and C#, which is in the scale, and E and A, so Amaj7 is diatonic to D lydian? Amaj7: A C# E G# – all notes in D lydian scale? D lydian has G#, yes, so Amaj7 is diatonic.

But E7 has D natural, which is not in D lydian scale. So that is a problem.

Perhaps the key is A major, and D is the tonic? But the progression starts and ends on D, so if D is tonic, but in A major, D is IV, so it might be modal.

Let's list the chords in order and see the harmonic function.

The progression is: D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, F#m/C#, E7/D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, Amaj7/C#, D

So, essentially, the chords are D, Bm, D, F#m, E7, D, Bm, D, Amaj7, D

With bass notes mostly D, except for F#m/C# and Amaj7/C# which have C# bass.

But for key analysis, the bass might not affect the key, but it can emphasize certain notes.

Notice that many chords have D in the bass, so D is being emphasized as a pedal point or tonic.

So, perhaps D is the tonic, and we are in D mixolydian or something.

Let's see the chords: D major, B minor, F# minor, E7, A major.

In D mixolydian, the scale would be D E F# G A B C, so chords: D maj, E min, F# dim? G maj, A min, B min, C maj? Let's see.

D mixolydian: D E F# G A B C

Chords: I D maj, ii E min, iii F# dim, IV G maj, v A min, vi B min, VII C maj.

But in our progression, we have Bm, which is B D F#, so that matches vi chord in D mixolydian? B min is vi chord.

We have F#m, which is F# A C#, but in D mixolydian, F# dim would be F# A C, but here we have F#m with C#, so C# is not in D mixolydian. D mixolydian has C natural, but here we have C# in F#m and Amaj7.

So, not mixolydian.

We have E7, which has G# and D natural? E7 has G# and D, but in D mixolydian, we have G natural and C natural, so G# is not there, and D is there but D is tonic, so E7 has D which is in mixolydian, but G# is not.

So, not mixolydian.

Another idea: perhaps the key is D major, but with borrowed chords or something.

But in D major, we have G natural, but here we have G# in E7 and Amaj7, so that suggests that we are using the sharpened seventh? But in major key, the seventh is leading tone, which is C# in D major, but G# is the third of E, so for E7, it would be the V of A, so it's a secondary dominant.

Let's consider that E7 is the V7 of A, and Amaj7 is the I of A, so perhaps there is a temporary modulation to A major.

But the progression starts and ends on D, so overall, D might be the tonic, and E7 is V7/vi, but vi is Bm, but here we have Amaj7, which is V? In D major, A is V, but Amaj7 is still V, but with major 7, which is diatonic? In D major, A major chord has A C# E, so C# is diatonic, and if we add G#, that would be A major 7, but G# is not in D major; D major has G natural, so A major 7 has G# which is not in D major. So A major 7 is not diatonic to D major.

So, in D major, the A chord is dominant, so A7 would be common, but Amaj7 is not typical because it has the major seventh instead of flat seventh.

So, Amaj7 suggests A major tonality.

Let's look at the progression: we have D, then Bm, then D, then F#m, then E7, then D, then Bm, then D, then Amaj7, then D.

So, the E7 leads to Amaj7? But after E7, it goes to D, not to A. Let's see: E7/D then D, so E7 to D. Then later Amaj7 to D.

So, E7 to D and Amaj7 to D.

E7 to D is like V7 to IV in A major? But in A major, V7 is E7, and IV is D, so E7 to D is a common progression in A major, but then D is the IV chord.

Similarly, Amaj7 to D is I to IV in A major? But if D is tonic, then in A major, I to IV doesn't resolve to I.

Perhaps we are in A major, but the progression emphasizes D, so D is the tonic? But in A major, D is not tonic.

Another thought: perhaps the mode is D lydian, but as I saw, E7 has D natural which is not in lydian, but in the chord E7/D, the bass is D, so the D natural is in the bass, but the chord E7 has D natural as the seventh, so it is played, so it introduces D natural into the scale.

But in D lydian, the scale has C# and no D natural? But D natural is the tonic, so it's always there, but in terms of scale degrees, from D, the seventh is C#, so if we have a chord with D natural, it's the same as the tonic, so it's not out of scale? But when we play E7, the note D is the minor seventh of E, which is equivalent to the tonic D, so in terms of scale, if we are in D lydian, the note D is the tonic, so when we play E7, the D note is the tonic, which is fine, but the issue is that E7 has G#, which is in D lydian, and D natural, which is also in D lydian? No, in D lydian, the notes are D E F# G# A B C#, so D natural is the tonic, so it is in the scale. But the seventh of E is D, which is the same as the tonic D, so from E perspective, the seventh is D, which is a whole step below E, so it is the minor seventh, which is consistent with mixolydian mode for E, but for D scale, having D natural is fine.

So, in D lydian, the note D is always present, so when we play E7, the notes are E G# B D, all of which are in D lydian scale? G# is in lydian, B is in lydian, D is in lydian, E is in lydian. So yes, all notes of E7 are in D lydian scale!

I think I confused myself. D lydian scale has D E F# G# A B C#, so indeed, E G# B D are all in that scale. So E7 is diatonic to D lydian? But is E7 a diatonic chord in D lydian?

In D lydian, the chord on E is E major, which is E G# B, so if we add the seventh, what would it be? The seventh note from E in the scale would be D? From E, the notes in scale are E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D? Let's list the scale from E: since the scale is D E F# G# A B C#, from E, the notes are E F# G# A B C# D, so the seventh from E is D, which is a major seventh? E to D is a minor seventh interval because E to D is 10 semitones? E to D natural is 10 semitones down? Let's calculate intervals from E.

E to F#: major second

F# to G#: major second

G# to A: minor second

A to B: major second

B to C#: major second

C# to D: minor second

So from E, the seventh note is D, and the interval from E to D is a minor seventh because E to D is 10 semitones, which is a minor seventh. In terms of quality, from E to D is a minor seventh interval because E to D# would be major seventh, but here E to D is minor seventh.

So, in D lydian scale, the seventh degree from E is D, which is minor seventh, so the chord E7 (E G# B D) has a minor seventh, so it is indeed the diatonic seventh chord on II in D lydian? Let's see the seventh chords in D lydian.

D lydian scale: D E F# G# A B C#

Seventh chords:

I: Dmaj7 - D F# A C#

II: E7 - E G# B D? E G# B D is E7, yes dominant seventh.

iii: F#m7 - F# A C# E

iv: G#m7b5 - G# B D F#? G# B D F# is G# half-diminished, since B to D is minor third, D to F# is major third, so minor third and diminished fifth? G# to D is diminished fifth? G# to D is 6 semitones, which is diminished fifth, so yes G# half-diminished.

V: Amaj7 - A C# E G#

vi: Bm7 - B D F# A

vii: C#m7 - C# E G# B

So, in D lydian, the II chord is indeed E7, which is a dominant seventh chord. And the V chord is Amaj7.

In our progression, we have E7 and Amaj7, both are diatonic to D lydian.

We also have Bm, which is vi chord, and F#m, which is iii chord, and D, which is I chord.

So, all chords in the progression are diatonic to D lydian!

The chords are: D (I), Bm (vi), F#m (iii), E7 (II), Amaj7 (V).

And in the progression, we have multiple Ds and Bms, and it starts and ends on D, so clearly, D is the tonic.

Therefore, the key is D lydian.

So, mode is lydian.

But let's confirm the bass notes. In the progression, we have Bm/D, which means Bm chord with D bass, so it's essentially a D chord with some color? Bm/D is B minor with D bass, which is the same notes as D major add6? D major with B? D F# A B, so it's D6 chord? Similarly, F#m/C# is F#m with C# bass, which is C# and F# A, so it's like A major with C# bass? But in context, since we are in D lydian, F#m is iii, and with C# bass, it emphasizes the C# which is the major seventh of D, so it might create tension or lead to D.

Similarly, E7/D is E7 with D bass, so it emphasizes D, and since E7 is II7, it might lead to V or to I, but here it goes to D, which is I, so II7 to I is a common progression in lydian.

Amaj7/C# is Amaj7 with C# bass, so again emphasizing C#.

And all these bass notes are in the D lydian scale.

So, overall, the key is D lydian.

Therefore, for the question, key is D, mode is lydian.

So, to answer: Key: D Lydian

But sometimes people say the key is D major, but since it's lydian, we specify the mode.

In traditional terms, if we say key of D, it implies major, but here it's modal.

So, for this progression, it's D lydian.

The chord progression provided (D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, F#m/C#, E7/D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, Amaj7/C#, D) is in the **D Lydian** mode.

### Explanation:
- The progression centers around D as the tonic, with chords that are diatonic to the D Lydian scale (D E F# G# A B C#).
- The chords used (D major, B minor, F# minor, E7, and A major 7) all fit within the D Lydian mode:
  - D major is the I chord.
  - B minor is the vi chord.
  - F# minor is the iii chord.
  - E7 is the II7 chord (diatonic in Lydian).
  - A major 7 is the V chord (diatonic in Lydian).
- The frequent use of D in the bass and as the starting and ending chord reinforces

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. Look at the chords given:**

- **D**  
- **Bm/D** (B minor with D bass — still Bm harmony but D in bass)  
- **F#m/C#** (F# minor with C# bass)  
- **E7/D** (E7 with D bass — E7 = E G# B D, so D bass makes it a slash chord)  
- **Amaj7/C#** (A major 7th with C# bass)  
- **D** (final chord)

---

**2. Identify likely key from chord roots and harmonic function**

Common chords in **D major** key:  
D (I), E7 (V7 of A, which is V in D major), F#m (vi), Bm (ii), A (V), Amaj7 (V maj7 — common in jazz/pop).

Common chords in **D minor** key:  
Dm, B♭, F, C, etc. — but here we have Bm, F#m, E7, Amaj7 — all fit **D major** better except no G chord, but that’s fine.

---

**3. Check the bass movement**

The bass line in many of these chords is **D**:

- D  
- Bm/D (bass D)  
- D  
- F#m/C# (bass C#)  
- E7/D (bass D)  
- D  
- Bm/D (bass D)  
- D  
- Amaj7/C# (bass C#)  
- D

So bass alternates between **D** and **C#** a lot.

---

**4. Functional analysis in D major**

- D = I  
- Bm/D = ii chord with D pedal bass  
- F#m/C# = vi chord with C# in bass (C# is 3rd of A major, leading tone to D)  
- E7/D = V7 chord with D bass — creates tension because E7 wants to resolve to A (V–I in key of A), but bass D clashes (E7/D = E G# B D over D = D E G# B — a Dmaj7#9? Or just a polychord). Could be a way to tonicize A but keep D pedal.  
- Amaj7/C# = A major 7 with C# bass — in D major, A is V, Amaj7 is Vmaj7, C# bass is the 3rd of A, again that C#–D bass motion.  
- Ends on D.

---

**5. Mode consideration**

All chords are diatonic to D major except E7.  
E7 contains G# — not in D major scale (D major has G natural).  
G# is the leading tone of A major.  
So E7 is **V7 of A** (the dominant of the dominant).  
This suggests we’re in **D major** but using a secondary dominant (V7/V) to lead to A (or Amaj7), which then leads back to D (V–I in D).

No minor tonic chord, so not D minor.  
Bass emphasis on D and C# — C# is the major 7th of D, not the ♭7, so not Mixolydian.  
Raised 7th (C#) in scale from F#m, Amaj7, and the G# in E7 is a temporary accidental.

---

**6. Conclusion**

Key: **D major**  
Mode: **Ionian** (major) — despite the E7, which is a secondary dominant, not a modal mixture.  
The E7 doesn’t change the overall key; it’s a brief diversion to the dominant key area (A major) before returning.

---

**Final answer:**  
**Key: D major**  
**Mode: Ionian**

### Reasoning

1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user has provided a chord progression: `D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D`. They want to know the key and mode.

2.  **First Pass: Simplify the Chords.**
    *   The chords are `D`, `Bm/D`, `F#m/C#`, `E7/D`, `Amaj7/C#`.
    *   The bass notes are important. Let's write them out as chord/bass.
    *   `D/D` (just D)
    *   `Bm/D` (B minor with D in the bass)
    *   `F#m/C#` (F# minor with C# in the bass)
    *   `E7/D` (E dominant 7th with D in the bass)
    *   `Amaj7/C#` (A major 7th with C# in the bass)
    *   The progression repeats, ending on `D`.

3.  **Identify the "Home" Chord.**
    *   The progression starts and ends on `D`. This is a very strong indicator that `D` is the tonic (the "home" chord). The key is likely D *something*.

4.  **Analyze the Chord Qualities within the context of D Major.**
    *   Let's build the diatonic chords of the D Major scale (D E F# G A B C#).
        *   I: D major (D F# A) -> **D** (Matches)
        *   ii: E minor (E G B) -> Not present directly.
        *   iii: F# minor (F# A C#) -> **F#m** (Matches)
        *   IV: G major (G B D) -> Not present.
        *   V: A major (A C# E) -> **Amaj7** is a variation of this. (Matches)
        *   vi: B minor (B D F#) -> **Bm** (Matches)
        *   vii°: C# diminished (C# E G) -> Not present directly.

    *   So, the core chords `D`, `Bm`, `F#m`, `A` all fit perfectly within the key of D Major. This is a very strong piece of evidence.

5.  **Analyze the "Odd" Chord: E7/D.**
    *   This is the crucial chord that might define the mode or suggest a different key center.
    *   Let's break down `E7/D`. The notes of an E7 are E G# B D. The bass note is D.
    *   So, the full chord contains the notes: **D, E, G#, B**.
    *   Is this chord diatonic to D Major? No. The G# is not in the D Major scale (which has a G natural).
    *   What is the function of this chord?
        *   The `E7` is the dominant chord of A major (V of A). In the key of D, A is the V chord. So `E7` is the V of V (V/V), which is a very common secondary dominant. This strongly points to D Major.
        *   Let's look at the bass note. The bass is `D`. So we have a `V/V` chord over the tonic bass. This creates a strong pull towards the A chord, which then pulls back to the D chord. The sequence is essentially `... -> (E7/D) -> (Amaj7/C#) -> D ...`. This is a very classic and strong tonal progression in D Major. The `D` in the bass of the `E7` chord acts as a suspension or a pedal tone, holding the tonic feel while the harmony moves away temporarily.

6.  **Analyze the other bass notes (slash chords).**
    *   `Bm/D`: The notes of B minor are B D F#. The bass is D. This is a B minor chord in first inversion. It functions as the vi chord in D Major. Using the tonic in the bass of the vi chord is common and helps ground the progression.
    *   `F#m/C#`: The notes of F# minor are F# A C#. The bass is C#. This is an F# minor chord in first inversion. It's the iii chord in D Major.
    *   `Amaj7/C#`: The notes of Amaj7 are A C# E G#. The bass is C#. This is an Amaj7 chord in first inversion. The G# is not diatonic to D Major, but it's part of the secondary dominant function we just identified. The `E7/D` leads to `Amaj7/C#`. The Amaj7 chord itself often borrows the G# from its own dominant (E7) in this context. It's still functioning as the V chord.

7.  **Synthesize the findings and determine the Key.**
    *   The progression clearly starts and ends on D.
    *   The majority of the chords (`D`, `Bm`, `F#m`, `A`) are diatonic to D Major.
    *   The one non-diatonic chord, `E7`, has a clear and common function as a secondary dominant (V/V), leading to the V chord (`A`).
    *   The use of slash chords (inversions) like `Bm/D`, `F#m/C#`, `Amaj7/C#` creates smooth voice-leading in the bass (`D -> D -> C# -> C# -> C# -> D`), but doesn't change the underlying harmonic function. The primary motion is `I -> vi -> I -> iii -> V/V -> V -> I`.
    *   **Conclusion:** The key is **D Major**.

8.  **Determine the Mode.**
    *   "Mode" can mean two things here:
        1.  Is it a major key mode (Ionian, Lydian, etc.) or a minor key mode (Aeolian, Dorian, etc.)?
        2.  Is it a specific "church mode" like D Dorian, G Mixolydian, etc.?
    *   Based on the analysis, the tonic chord is D major (`D F# A`). The scale built from this tonic that fits the harmony is the D Major scale (`D E F# G A B C#`). The functional harmony (I-V-vi-iii, with a V/V) is characteristic of traditional major key harmony, not modal harmony.
    *   Therefore, the mode is **Ionian**.
    *   Could it be another mode?
        *   **D Lydian?** This would require a raised 4th degree (G#). The progression doesn't strongly feature a G# except as part of the secondary dominant (E7, Amaj7). The progression doesn't "feel" Lydian; it feels like standard major key harmony with a secondary dominant.
        *   **D Mixolydian?** This would require a flattened 7th degree (C). The progression has C#s all over the place (in F#m, Amaj7, the implied key). So it's not Mixolydian.
        *   **D Dorian/Aeolian/Phrygian/Locrian?** These are minor modes. The tonic chord is major. So, no.
    *   The most accurate and simple answer is that it's in the **Ionian mode**, which is just another name for the **major scale**. In modern music theory, we usually just say "D Major". Mentioning "Ionian" is a good, more technical clarification.

9.  **Structure the Final Answer.**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: "The key is D Major (Ionian mode)."
    *   Provide a detailed breakdown of the reasoning.
    *   **Step 1: The Tonic.** Explain why D is the tonic (starts/ends the progression, feels like "home").
    *   **Step 2: The Diatonic Chords.** List the chords (`D`, `Bm`, `F#m`, `Amaj7`) and show how they fit perfectly into the D Major scale. This establishes the core key.
    *   **Step 3: The Non-Diatonic Chord (The Clue).** Focus on the `E7/D`. Explain that the `E7` is not in D Major but functions as a "secondary dominant" (the V of V, or V/V). Explain what that means: it temporarily tonicizes the A chord, creating a strong pull towards it. This is a hallmark of functional major/minor harmony, not modal music.
    *   **Step 4: The Slash Chords.** Explain that the bass notes (the `/D`, `/C#`) are chord inversions. They create a smooth, descending bass line (`D -> D -> C# -> C# -> C# -> D`) but don't change the fundamental harmonic function. The harmony is still `I -> vi -> iii -> V/V -> V -> I`.
    *   **Step 5: Conclusion on Mode.** Explain *why* it's Ionian (major). The tonic chord is major, and the harmony is functional (using secondary dominants), which is characteristic of the Ionian mode/major scale system, not other modes which typically rely on more static, non-functional harmony.
    *   **Add a summary table.** This is a great way to present the information clearly. Show the chord, its function in D Major, and the notes. This reinforces the entire analysis.
    *   Keep the language accessible but accurate. Define terms like "diatonic" and "secondary dominant" simply.



Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **D Major**.

The specific mode is the **Ionian mode**, which is simply the standard major scale.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. Identifying the Tonic (The "Home" Chord)

*   The progression starts and ends on the **D major** chord. This is the strongest indicator that D is the tonic, or the "home base" of the piece.

### 2. Analyzing the Chords in the Context of D Major

Let's look at the chords and see how they fit into the D Major scale (D - E - F# - G - A - B - C#).

*   **D**: This is the **I** (one) chord, the tonic. **(Diatonic)**
*   **Bm/D**: This is a B minor chord (B - D - F#) with D in the bass. B minor is the **vi** (six) chord in the key of D Major. **(Diatonic)**
*   **F#m/C#**: This is an F# minor chord (F# - A - C#) with C# in the bass. F# minor is the **iii** (three) chord in the key of D Major. **(Diatonic)**
*   **Amaj7/C#**: This is an A major 7th chord (A - C# - E - G#) with C# in the bass. A major is the **V** (five) chord in the key of D Major. While the G# is not in the D Major scale, its appearance is explained by the next chord.
*   **E7/D**: This is an E dominant 7th chord (E - G# - B - D) with D in the bass. This is the crucial chord.

### 3. The Role of the "Non-Diatonic" Chord: E7

The E7 chord contains a G#, which is not in the D Major scale. At first glance, this might suggest a different key. However, in functional harmony, this chord has a very common and important role: it's a **secondary dominant**.

*   The E7 chord is the dominant (V) chord of **A major**.
*   Since A major is the V chord in the key of D, E7 functions as the **"V of V"** (written as V/V).
*   Its purpose is to create a strong pull towards the A chord (`Amaj7/C#`), which in turn pulls back to the home chord, D.

This `V/V -> V -> I` movement is a hallmark of traditional major key harmony. The D in the bass of the E7 chord acts as a pedal tone, grounding the harmony in the tonic even as it temporarily departs.

### 4. The Role of the Slash Chords

The slash chords (`/D`, `/C#`) are inversions that create a smooth, flowing bassline:

> **D** -> **Bm/D** (bass stays on D) -> **D** -> **F#m/C#** (bass steps down to C#) -> **E7/D** (bass returns to D) -> **D** -> **Bm/D** -> **D** -> **Amaj7/C#** (bass is on C#) -> **D**

The primary melodic movement in the bass is between D and C#, which reinforces the tonic dominant relationship (D and A/C#). These inversions add color and voice-leading but do not change the underlying harmonic functions.

### Conclusion

The progression is built on the diatonic chords of D Major (I, iii, vi, V) and uses a standard secondary dominant (E7) to create harmonic interest and a strong resolution. The tonic chord is major, and the harmony is functional.

Therefore, the key is unequivocally **D Major**.

| **D**      | D Major     | **I** (Tonic)       | The home chord.                                                        |
| **Bm/D**   | B minor     | **vi**              | A common diatonic chord, in first inversion to keep the bass on D.    |
| **F#m/C#** | F# minor    | **iii**             | A diatonic chord, in first inversion to lead the bass down to C#.     |
| **E7/D**   | E7          | **V/V** (secondary dominant) | The dominant of A, creating tension that pulls towards the V chord. |
| **Amaj7/C#**| A maj7      | **V** (Dominant)    | The dominant chord, which resolves back to the tonic (D).             |
