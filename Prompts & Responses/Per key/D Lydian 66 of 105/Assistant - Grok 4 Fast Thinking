### Key and Mode Analysis

The given chord progression (D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D) is a repetitive sequence with a strong tonal center. Here's a breakdown:

#### Primary Key: **D Major**
- **Tonal Center**: The progression revolves around D major as the home chord (I), with most bass notes anchoring on D (creating a pedal point effect). It resolves repeatedly to D, especially after tension-building chords.
- **Diatonic Fit**:
  - D (I): Root chord, establishes the key.
  - Bm (vi): Common in D major (e.g., Bm/D acts as an inversion or passing chord emphasizing the D bass).
  - F#m (iii): Diatonic to D major.
  - Amaj7 (IV): Diatonic (A major is the subdominant).
- **Non-Diatonic Elements**:
  - E7 (V7 of A major, or secondary dominant V7/IV): Introduces a G# (leading tone to A), adding temporary tension but resolving back to D. The /D bass keeps it grounded in the key.
  - The /C# bass notes (under F#m and Amaj7) suggest brief movement to the leading tone (C# is the #7 scale degree in D major), heightening expectation before returning to D.
- **Overall Structure**: This is a I–vi–iii–V7/IV–I pattern with variations and pedal bass, typical of pop/folk/rock in major keys. No strong pull to another key (e.g., no sustained Bm or F#m as tonic).

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major)**
- The progression uses the natural major scale of D (D E F# G A B C#), with no flattened scale degrees or modal mixture that would suggest Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.
- Harmonic function is tonal and major-oriented: Subdominant (IV) and mediant (iii) provide color, while the secondary dominant (E7) reinforces the major resolution without modal ambiguity.
- If played, it has a bright, uplifting feel consistent with Ionian mode—no minor tonic or flattened 3rd/7th to imply a minor mode.

This progression evokes a classic major-key ballad or folk-rock vibe (reminiscent of songs like "Space Oddity" by David Bowie or similar structures). If this is from a specific song or you have more context/melody, I can refine the analysis!
