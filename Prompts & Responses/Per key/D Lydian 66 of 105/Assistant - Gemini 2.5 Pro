### Reasoning

**Defining the Core Task**

I'm focused on breaking down the request to truly understand what's being asked. My initial step involves identifying the core input: a specific chord progression. Next, I plan to analyze each chord, and its relation to the preceding and following chords to create a detailed analysis.


**Assessing the Harmony**

I'm now investigating each chord's function within the apparent key of D major. The Bm and F#m chords are clearly diatonic, serving as the vi and iii chords, respectively. The E7, however, is intriguing, functioning as a secondary dominant targeting the A chord, the dominant of D major. This analysis is giving me a better understanding.


**Exploring Bass Lines and Structure**

I'm now zeroing in on the bass line's role in the progression's feel. The D-C#-D-C# pattern acts as a pedal point on D, anchoring the key. Analyzing the slash chords reveals a smooth, descending bass line from D to C#, adding a subtle chromatic touch. The C# is the leading tone, increasing the gravitational pull towards D.


**Refining Key and Function**

The analysis is focusing on how the chords relate to D major. I see Bm, F#m, and A as the key components, confirming the home key. Specifically, the Amaj7 adds a jazzy feel, while the E7 acts as a secondary dominant, further emphasizing the resolution towards A, and the established D major.


**Structuring the Analysis**

I'm now drafting a framework for the analysis. I'll start with the main conclusion, declaring D major as the key. I will then explain the D chord's repeated presence, along with the diatonic chords like Bm and F#m. Following this, I'll analyze the more unique chords.


**Finalizing the Explanation**

I'm now structuring my analysis with a clear conclusion: D major is the key. Then, I'll explain the repeated D chord, the diatonic chords like Bm and F#m, and the role of the E7 and Amaj7. The D pedal in the bass will also be highlighted.




Based on the chord progression provided, the key and mode are:

**Key:** **D Major**
**Mode:** **Major**

### **Analysis:**

Here is a breakdown of why this progression is in the key of D Major:

1.  **Tonic Center (Home Base):** The progression begins and ends on a **D major chord**. The D chord also appears more frequently than any other, establishing it as the tonal center or "home" chord (the **I** chord).

2.  **Diatonic Chords:** Most of the chords are diatonic to the key of D Major (the notes are D, E, F♯, G, A, B, C♯).
    *   **D (D-F♯-A):** The **I** chord (Tonic).
    *   **Bm (B-D-F♯):** The **vi** chord (the relative minor). This is a very common and natural-sounding chord in the key of D.
    *   **F♯m (F♯-A-C♯):** The **iii** chord. Another diatonic chord that fits perfectly.

3.  **Dominant Function (The V Chord):** The **Amaj7** chord functions as the dominant (**V**) chord. The V chord's job is to create tension that resolves back to the tonic (I).
    *   The root of the chord is A, which is the 5th degree of the D major scale.
    *   The bass note in the **Amaj7/C♯** is C♯, which is the **leading tone** of D. The C♯ moving up to D is the strongest and most definitive way to establish a key.
    *   While a standard dominant is usually a major or a dominant 7th chord (A or A7), using a **Amaj7** gives the progression a softer, more "Lydian" or "jazzy" sound, but its function remains a V chord pulling back to D.

4.  **Secondary Dominant (The E7 Chord):** The **E7 (E-G♯-B-D)** chord is the one chord that contains a note outside the D major scale (G♯).
    *   This is a classic example of a **secondary dominant**. E7 is the V chord of A (the V7 of V, written as V7/V).
    *   Its purpose is to momentarily "tonicize" the A chord, making the arrival on the Amaj7 feel even more significant before it resolves back to D. This is a very common technique to add harmonic interest.

5.  **The Bass Line and Pedal Tones:** The use of slash chords creates a very strong sense of being in D.
    *   **Bm/D** and **E7/D** both have a **D in the bass**. This is called a **tonic pedal point**. Holding the root of the key in the bass while the chords change above it powerfully reinforces D as the tonal center.
    *   The bass line frequently moves between **D** and **C♯**. As mentioned, this movement between the tonic (D) and the leading tone (C♯) is the defining sound of the D major key.
