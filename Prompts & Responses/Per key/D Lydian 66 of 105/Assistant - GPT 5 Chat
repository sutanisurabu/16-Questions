Let's analyze this progression:

**Chord progression:**

```
D   D   Bm/D Bm/D   D   D   F#m/C#  E7/D
D   D   Bm/D Bm/D   D   D   Amaj7/C# D
```

### Step 1: Identify the chord tones and bass notes

| Chord        | Notes (in root position)       | Bass note |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| D             | D–F#–A                        | D          |
| Bm/D          | B–D–F#                        | D          |
| F#m/C#        | F#–A–C#                       | C#         |
| E7/D          | E–G#–B–D                      | D          |
| Amaj7/C#      | A–C#–E–G#                     | C#         |

### Step 2: Look at the tonal center and harmonic function

- The progression revolves *strongly* around **D** — it begins, ends, and returns to D constantly, suggesting **D major** as the tonal center.
- Supporting chords:
  - **Bm/D** is the vi chord (Bm) with a D in the bass (same root as the tonic).
  - **F#m/C#** corresponds to the iii chord in D major (F#m), with its third (C#) in the bass.
  - **E7/D** is **V7/V** (the V of A major), but with D in the bass. This is a **secondary dominant** leading toward A, though the strong D bass keeps us grounded in D.
  - **Amaj7/C#** is the **V** chord (A major, extended to maj7) with its third in the bass (C#), functioning normally as dominant.

### Step 3: Check for modes or modal mixture

- All chord tones (D, E, F#, A, B, C#) are from the **D major scale**: D–E–F#–G–A–B–C#.
- The only altered tone is **G#** (in E7 and Amaj7), which comes from the harmonic major (raised 7th in the dominant context).  
  This is very normal in tonal major harmony—it doesn't imply a modal shift.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Key:** D major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major)  
- **Functional interpretation:**  
  The chords reinforce D major with tonic (D), submediant (Bm), mediant (F#m), and dominant (A/E7) functions. The chromatic G# in the dominants is standard in classical/tonal major harmony.

**Therefore:**

> The progression is in **D major (Ionian mode)**.
