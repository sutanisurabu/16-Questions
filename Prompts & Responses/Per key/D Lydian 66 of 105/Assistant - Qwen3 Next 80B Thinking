### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by analyzing this step by step.

First, I need to list out all the chords in the sequence. Looking at the progression: D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, D, F#m/C#, E7/D, D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, D, Amaj7/C#, D. Wait, some of these have slashes, which indicate bass notes. So Bm/D means B minor chord with D in the bass. Similarly, F#m/C# is F# minor with C# bass, E7/D is E7 with D bass, and Amaj7/C# is A major 7 with C# bass. But for key determination, the bass notes might not be as crucial as the chord qualities themselves. However, the bass notes can sometimes hint at inversions or pedal points, but the main chords are still D, Bm, F#m, E7, Amaj7.

Let me write the chord roots without considering inversions for simplicity: D, D, Bm, Bm, D, D, F#m, E7, D, D, Bm, Bm, D, D, Amaj7, D. So the chord roots are D, B, F#, E, A. Let me list them in order: D, D, B (for Bm), B, D, D, F#, E, D, D, B, B, D, D, A, D.

Now, to figure out the key, I need to see which key these chords belong to. Common chords in a key usually form a diatonic progression. Let's consider possible keys.

First, check key of D major. The diatonic chords in D major are:
I: D, ii: Em, iii: F#m, IV: G, V: A, vi: Bm, vii°: C#°.

Looking at the progression: D (I), Bm (vi), F#m (iii), E7 (which would be the V7 of A, but in D major, the V chord is A, not E. Wait, E7 isn't diatonic to D major. The diatonic V chord is A, and E7 is not part of D major because E7 has G# and D, but D major has G natural, so E7 would be E G# B D – that's a dominant 7th, but in D major, the V7 is A7 (A C# E G), not E7. So E7 isn't diatonic to D major.

Wait, maybe it's in G major? In G major, diatonic chords: G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), F#° (vii°). But here we have chords like Bm (which is iii in G major), D (V), but E7? In G major, E7 would be the VII7 chord, but E7 is E G# B D – G# is not in G major (G major has F# instead of G#). Wait, G major scale is G A B C D E F#, so E7 has G# which is not in the scale. So E7 isn't diatonic to G major.

How about A major? In A major: A (I), Bm (ii), C#m (iii), D (IV), E (V), F#m (vi), G#° (vii°). Check the chords: D (IV), Bm (ii), F#m (vi), E7? In A major, the V chord is E, but E7 is E G# B D – which is diatonic to A major because A major includes G#? A major scale: A B C# D E F# G#. Yes, G# is there. So E7 is the V7 chord in A major. That makes sense. But let's see the other chords. The progression has D (which is IV in A major), Bm (ii), F#m (vi), and E7 (V7). Also, Amaj7 – A major 7 is I maj7 in A major. But wait, the progression has Amaj7/C#. Amaj7 is A C# E G#, so Amaj7/C# would be C# bass, which is the third of the chord. But in A major, that's still a chord from A major.

Wait, let's list out all chords in the progression in terms of A major:

- D: IV (D major)
- Bm: ii (B minor)
- F#m: vi (F# minor)
- E7: V7 (E dominant 7)
- Amaj7: I maj7

Yes, that fits. So in A major, the chords are all diatonic. Let me confirm:

D major is IV, yes. Bm is ii, correct. F#m is vi, yes. E7 is V7 (since V chord in A major is E, and E7 is a common dominant 7th for resolution to A). Amaj7 is just I with a major 7th.

But wait, Amaj7 is I maj7, but typically when people say "key of A major", they might expect simple triads, but maj7 chords are still within the key because A major scale has G# as the 7th, so A C# E G# is diatonic.

Now, checking the chord progression: D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D.

So, in A major:

- D (IV), D (IV), Bm (ii) with D in bass (so D is the third of Bm, but Bm is B-D-F#, so Bm/D is first inversion), similarly F#m/C# is F#-A-C# with C# bass, which is root position for F#m? Wait, F#m is F#-A-C#, so C# is the fifth. So F#m/C# is bass note C#, which is fifth. E7/D: E7 is E-G#-B-D, so D is the seventh, so E7/D is a fourth inversion. Amaj7/C#: Amaj7 is A-C#-E-G#, so C# is the third, so Amaj7/C# is first inversion. D is A major's IV.

But the key here is A major, but let's see if there's another possibility.

Wait, what about D major? Earlier I thought E7 isn't in D major. D major is D-E#-F#-G-A-B-C#? Wait no: D major scale is D E F# G A B C#. So chord E7 would be E-G#-B-D. G# is not in D major (D major has G natural), so E7 is not diatonic to D major. So that's out.

What about E major? E major scale: E F# G# A B C# D#. But the chords here include D as a main chord, which isn't in E major. So probably not.

Wait, maybe it's in D Mixolydian? Mixolydian mode has a flat 7th. So D Mixolydian is D E F# G A B C natural. Then chord E7 would be E-G#-B-D – but G# is not in D Mixolydian (which has G natural), so E7 wouldn't be diatonic there either.

Alternatively, maybe the key is A minor? Let's check. A natural minor scale: A B C D E F G. Chords: i: Am, ii°: B°, III: C, iv: Dm, v: Em, VI: F, VII: G. But the progression has D (which would be iv), but D major is not diatonic; D minor is iv. But here the D chords are major? The progression has D major. Also F#m – in A minor, F#m isn't diatonic unless it's harmonic minor. A harmonic minor has F#? No, A harmonic minor is A B C D E F G#, so F# is not there. A melodic minor ascending has F#, G#.

Wait, but in A natural minor, chords are mostly minor and diminished. But here we have F#m – which is not in A natural minor. So probably not.

Another thought: A major key makes sense. Because:

- D is IV
- Bm is ii
- F#m is vi
- E7 is V7 (which resolves to A, but in the progression, it goes to Amaj7 next? Let's see the order: ... E7/D D D ... So after E7/D, it goes to D. So E7 to D? In A major, E7 is V7, which typically resolves to A (I), but here it goes to D (IV). That's not the typical V-I resolution. So maybe it's a deceptive resolution or part of a different progression.

Alternatively, maybe the key is D major, but E7 is used as a borrowed chord? But in D major, E7 would be from outside.

Wait, but if we consider A major, the E7 is V7, which often resolves to A, but here the progression has E7/D followed by D. So E7 to D. In the key of A major, that's V7 to IV. Which is not the strongest resolution, but it's possible. For example, in a I-IV-V progression, you might have V-IV, but usually IV-V-I. But V-IV is a possible movement. However, in A major, the IV is D major. So E7 to D is V7 to IV. That does happen sometimes, especially in rock or pop.

But let's look at the Amaj7 at the end. Amaj7 is I. Then it ends on D. So the progression ends with Amaj7/C# followed by D. So A maj7 then D. In A major, that's I to IV. Which is common.

Another way: let's list the notes present. If all chords are in A major, then the scale is A B C# D E F# G#.

D major chord: D F# A – all in A major scale (D is 4th degree, F# is 6th? Wait A major scale: A (1), B(2), C#(3), D(4), E(5), F#(6), G#(7). So yes, D major chord is D-F#-A. F# is 6th degree, A is 3rd of D chord. Yes, in scale.

Bm: B-D-F#. B is 2nd, D is 4th, F# is 6th. Yes, all in scale.

F#m: F#-A-C#. Yes, F#(6), A(1), C#(3). In scale.

E7: E-G#-B-D. E(5), G#(7), B(2), D(4). Yes, all in A major scale.

Amaj7: A-C#-E-G#. A(1), C#(3), E(5), G#(7). Perfect.

So all chords are diatonic to A major. So the key is A major.

Now, mode: A major is the Ionian mode. So it's in the key of A major, ionian mode.

But let's check if it's another mode. For example, could it be in D major but using some other mode? But the E7 chord wouldn't fit. Or maybe the progression is actually in D major but with the E7 as a borrowed chord? But why would they say "key and mode" then? If it's all diatonic to A major, then key is A major, mode is Ionian.

But let's see the bass notes. The chords with slashes: Bm/D means the bass is D, which is part of the D major chord. Similarly F#m/C# has bass C#. In A major, C# is the 3rd, which is a diatonic note. E7/D has bass D, which is part of E7 chord (since E7 has D as the 7th), so it's a common inversion. Amaj7/C# has bass C# (which is 3rd of A maj7).

But even considering inversions, all the chords fit in A major.

Another check: what's the tonic? The progression has Amaj7 at the end before final D. But the last chord is D. But in the progression, if it's A major, the tonic is A. However, the progression ends on D, which is IV. That might not be typical, but maybe it's not a complete piece. Maybe it's part of a longer progression. But often the key can be determined by the most stable chords, and chords that resolve.

But let's see the overall structure. The progression has D appearing very frequently. But in A major, the IV chord (D) can be a common chord. Also, Bm, F#m, E7 are all present.

Wait, another thought: sometimes if the progression revolves around a chord other than I, you might be in a different mode. For example, if it's centered on D, but D major scale chords don't include E7.

But let's see. If it were D Mixolydian, which is D E F# G A B C, no G#. But E7 has G# which is not in D Mixolydian. So that doesn't fit.

If in G major: scale G A B C D E F#. Chords: D is V, Bm is iii, F#m is vi? Wait in G major, F#m would be the vi chord? G major scale: G A B C D E F#. So F# is part of it. F#m would be F# A C#. Yes. But E7: E G# B D. G# is not in G major (G major has F#), so no. Therefore, E7 not diatonic here.

So back to A major: all chords fit perfectly. So key is A major, which is the Ionian mode.

But let me check once more. If it's in A major, then common chords are I(A), ii(Bm), iii(C#m), IV(D), V(E), vi(F#m), vii°(G#°). But the progression has E7 (which is V7), F#m (vi), D (IV), Bm (ii), Amaj7 (I). Yes. So all chords are diatonic. So key is A, mode Ionian.

Another angle: the E7 chord. In A major, E7 is definitely the dominant 7th. But when it leads to D (IV), it's a deceptive resolution (usually V7 to vi, but here it's V7 to IV). Still, possible. The Amaj7 is the I maj7. So the key is A major.

Alternatively, could it be in D major with borrowed chords? Like a Bm chord is ii in D major, which is fine. F#m is iii in D major. E7: in D major, E7 would be a borrowed chord from where? Maybe from A major, but that's not standard. But the chords in D major would not have E7 naturally. So that seems less likely.

Hence, after all checks, the key is A major, mode is Ionian.

Wait, but let's see the progression again. The chord after Amaj7/C# is D. So the entire progression is ... Amaj7/C# D. So Amaj7 to D. In A major, I to IV. That's a common cadence (like in I-IV-V-I, but here ending on IV).

But sometimes if the tonic isn't clearly established, you have to look for the chord that feels like home. However, in this progression, the Amaj7 is present, which is I. So probably the tonic is A.

So the key is A major, mode is Ionian.

Yes, that seems right.


The given chord progression is:

**D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D**

### 🔍 **Step-by-Step Analysis**

#### **1. Identify Chords (Roots Only):**
- D (major), D (major), Bm (minor), Bm (minor), D (major), D (major), F#m (minor), E7 (dominant 7th), D (major), D (major), Bm (minor), Bm (minor), D (major), D (major), Amaj7 (major 7th), D (major)

#### **2. Determine Diatonic Key:**
Let’s test **A Major** (Ionian mode) — the most likely key based on common diatonic chords and the presence of **E7** (dominant 7th).

**A Major Scale**:  
A – B – C# – D – E – F# – G#  

Chords in A Major:  
- I = **A**  
- ii = **Bm**  
- iii = **C#m**  
- IV = **D**  
- V = **E**  
- vi = **F#m**  
- vii° = **G#°**  

Now map the progression to A Major:

| Chord       | Function in A Major | Notes in A Major |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| D           | IV                  | D–F#–A ✅        |
| Bm          | ii                  | B–D–F# ✅        |
| F#m         | vi                  | F#–A–C# ✅       |
| E7          | V7 (dominant)       | E–G#–B–D ✅      |
| Amaj7       | I (maj7)            | A–C#–E–G# ✅     |

✅ **All chords are diatonic to A Major** — no chromatic or borrowed chords are needed.

#### **3. Check for Other Possibilities:**
- **D Major**:  
  Scale = D–E–F#–G–A–B–C#  
  E7 = E–G#–B–D ❌ G# is **not** in D Major (D Major has **G natural**).  
  → Not diatonic.

- **G Major**:  
  Scale = G–A–B–C–D–E–F#  
  E7 = E–G#–B–D ❌ G# is **not** in G Major (G Major has **F#**).  
  → Not diatonic.

- **A Minor**:  
  Natural Minor = A–B–C–D–E–F–G  
  E7 = E–G#–B–D ❌ G# is **not** in A Minor.  
  → Not diatonic.

- **Other Modes (e.g., D Mixolydian)**:  
  D Mixolydian = D–E–F#–G–A–B–C  
  E7 = E–G#–B–D ❌ G# is **not** in D Mixolydian (has **C natural**, not G#).  
  → Not diatonic.

✅ **Only A Major fits all chords perfectly.**

#### **4. Inversions & Bass Notes:**
- **Bm/D**: Bm (B–D–F#) with D in bass → first inversion (D is the 3rd of Bm)  
- **F#m/C#**: F#m (F#–A–C#) with C# in bass → first inversion (C# is the 5th)  
- **E7/D**: E7 (E–G#–B–D) with D in bass → seventh (D is the 7th of E7)  
- **Amaj7/C#**: Amaj7 (A–C#–E–G#) with C# in bass → third of the chord  

These are **standard inversions within A Major** and do not suggest a different key.

#### **5. Tonic Stability:**
- **Amaj7** is the **I chord** (tonic) in A Major.  
- The progression ends with **Amaj7/C# → D**, which is **I → IV** — a common resolution in many genres (e.g., pop, rock).  
- While the progression ends on **IV (D)**, the presence of **Amaj7** as the only major 7th chord and the consistent use of A Major scale tones strongly confirms **A** as the tonic.

---

### ✅ **Final Conclusion**

- **Key**: **A Major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (the major scale mode)  

This is a classic **A Major (Ionian)** progression. The chords all align perfectly with the scale, and the tonic is clearly **A**. The E7 chord resolves to D (IV), which is a common substitution for the typical V–I resolution, and the Amaj7 reinforces the major tonality.
