Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**
D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – F#m/C# – E7/D – D – D – Bm/D – Bm/D – D – D – Amaj7/C# – D

Let’s simplify by removing slash chords (which denote inversions) and look at the **root notes** of the chords:

- D
- D
- Bm
- Bm
- D
- D
- F#m
- E7
- D
- D
- Bm
- Bm
- D
- D
- Amaj7
- D

So the **basic chord progression** is:

**D – D – Bm – Bm – D – D – F#m – E7 – D – D – Bm – Bm – D – D – Amaj7 – D**

Now let’s see which **key** this fits into.

### Step 1: Look at the chords and see if they belong to a diatonic scale

List of chords: D, Bm, F#m, E7, Amaj7

Let’s check **D major** key (D E F# G A B C#):

- D (I) – yes
- Bm (vi) – yes
- F#m (iii) – yes
- Amaj7 = A major 7 (IV7) – A is IV in D major, so Amaj7 fits
- E7 – this is **V7 of A**, but in D major, the diatonic chord on V is **Em**, not E major or E7

So E7 is **not diatonic** to D major — it has a **G# and D natural**, which aren’t in D major (D major has C# not C natural). But E7 has **G#**, which **is** in D major (yes, G# is not in D major — wait: D major has notes: D E F# G A B C#. So **G natural**, not G#). So:

- E7 = E, G#, B, D → G# is **NOT** in D major (D major has G natural). So G# is a chromatic note.

Wait — correction:  
D major:  
D  E  F#  G  A  B  C#  
→ no G#, but E7 requires **G#**, so **E7 is not in D major**.

E7 is the **secondary dominant** — specifically **V7/V**, the dominant of A.

So E7 → A is a **V7–I** motion (or V7–IV in D major, since A is IV).

So E7 leads to A (or Amaj7), which fits as a **secondary dominant**.

Amaj7: A C# E G# — again, G# is not in D major. But if the chord is Amaj7, it has a **major 7th (G#)**, which is not diatonic to D major.

Wait — Amaj7: A, C#, E, **G#**  
But D major has **G natural**, so G# is chromatic.

So **Amaj7** is not diatonic to D major.

But **A7** is common as **V7 of D**, but here it's **Amaj7**, which is unusual.

Hmm — that suggests maybe we’re not in D major.

But wait — **Amaj7/C#** — perhaps it's functioning as something else?

Let’s consider **mode**.

Wait — what if we're in **D Lydian**?

Lydian has a raised 4th, so in D Lydian: D E F# **G#** A B C#

Now check:

- D major: I = D
- Bm: vi = Bm
- F#m: iii = F#m
- E7: V7/V = secondary dominant, leads to A
- Amaj7: IV in D Lydian? No — in D Lydian, 4th degree is **G#**, so IV would be **G# minor**, not A.

Wait — mode degrees depend on the root.

Alternatively, maybe the key is **A major**, and D is the IV.

Let’s try **A major**: A B C# D E F# G#

Chords:

- D – IV chord: yes
- Bm – vi chord: yes
- F#m – iii chord: yes
- E7 – V chord: yes (E7 is V in A major)
- Amaj7 – I chord: yes (I7)

But in the progression, the **tonic chord is D**, repeated many times, and the progression ends on D.

It starts with D and ends with D — D feels like **tonic**.

But Amaj7 appears late and then goes back to D, so D is still the home.

So D is tonic.

But D major doesn't have G# or C natural? Wait:

Wait — chords used:

- D: D F# A — fine
- Bm: B D F# — fine
- F#m: F# A C# — fine
- E7: E G# B D — G# is **not in D major**, but is in **D harmonic major or melodic minor**?
- Amaj7: A C# E G# — again, G# is chromatic to D major

But G# appears in both E7 and Amaj7.

So perhaps **G#** is being used as a leading tone.

But in D major, the leading tone is **C#**, not G#.

Unless the harmony is **borrowing** or modulating.

Wait — what if we're in **D Mixolydian**?

D Mixolydian: D E F# G A B C — so **C natural**, no C#

But we have **F#m**, which has **C#**, not C natural. So C# is required.

So C# means we are in a sharp key — likely **D major or D Lydian**.

Wait — another idea: **E7** is **V7 of Am**, and **Amaj7** could be interpreted as a **major I chord in A major**, but if it's **not** functioning as tonic, but as a temporary major IV?

Wait — let’s consider **D major with modal mixture or secondary dominants**.

Back to **D major**: D E F# G A B C#

But E7 and Amaj7 both require **G#**

So **G#** is used — which is raised 4th (since 4th is G natural)

So **raised 4th** = characteristic of **Lydian mode**

So try **D Lydian**:

D E F# **G#** A B C#

Now:

- D: I — yes
- Bm: vi — yes (B D F#)
- F#m: iii — yes (F# A C#) — wait, C# is in D Lydian? D Lydian comes from A major scale, so **C# is present** (since A major has C#)

D Lydian: D E F# G# A B C# — yes, C# is the 7th note.

Perfect — so:

- D: I — D F# A
- Bm: vi — B D F# — yes
- F#m: iii — F# A C# — yes
- E7: E G# B D — G# is in scale, B and D are in scale — E is 2nd degree, but E7 is not a diatonic chord in D Lydian. Diatonic chord on E would be **Emaj** (E G# B), which is I in E Lydian, but here we have E7 = E G# B D — that adds **D**, which is in scale. So E7 has notes: E, G#, B, D — all except the **7th (D)** — actually, in D Lydian, **D is root**, so **D is in scale**.

So E7: E G# B D — all notes are in **D Lydian** scale! Because:

- E = 2nd
- G# = #4 (raised 4th)
- B = 6th
- D = 7th above E, but D is **b7 of E**, so E7 = E G# B D = **dominant 7th chord**

Yes — and since **G#** is diatonic in D Lydian, and D natural is also diatonic, **E7 is diatonic to D Lydian**?

Wait — chord built on E in D Lydian: E F# G# A B C# D — so 1 3 5 b7 = E G# B D → **E7**!

Yes! So in **D Lydian**, the **ii7 chord is E7** — a dominant 7th!

Similarly, Amaj7: A C# E G# — A is 5th degree in D Lydian.

Chord on A: A B C# D E F# G# → 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 — so triad: A C# E = A major, and 7th is G# → **A major 7** → Amaj7!

So in **D Lydian**, the **V chord** is **Amaj7**!

Yes!

Summary in D Lydian:

- D = I
- Bm = vi (B D F#)
- F#m = iii (F# A C#)
- E7 = ii7
- Amaj7 = Vmaj7

All these chords are **diatonic** to **D Lydian**!

So let's confirm:

**D Lydian scale**: D E F# G# A B C#

Chords:

- D: D F# A → I
- Bm: B D F# → vi
- F#m: F# A C# → iii
- E7: E G# B D → ii7 — all notes in scale? E, G#, B, D → yes, all in D Lydian
- Amaj7: A C# E G# → Vmaj7 — yes, all notes in scale

Perfect fit.

Also, the progression **ends on D**, and D is emphasized — feels like tonic.

The use of G# (the #4) is essential and appears in E7 and Amaj7, which are strong chords in the key.

In contrast, in D major, G# would be chromatic, but here it's diatonic.

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: D
- **Mode**: **Lydian**
- **Full answer**: The progression is in **D Lydian mode**

✅ Final Answer: **Key: D, Mode: Lydian**
