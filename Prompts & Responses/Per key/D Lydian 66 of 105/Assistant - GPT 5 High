### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I have a chord progression that I need to break down: "D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D." 

First, I want to determine the key and mode since these chords often suggest specific harmonic functions. 

D major seems to be the likely key. The chords include a Bm/D, which is B minor in first inversion, and F#m/C#, hinting at its role in the harmonic structure. E7/D functions as a secondary dominant, adding some complexity.**Clarifying chord functions**

I realized that the diatonic ii in D major is actually Em. The typical V/ii is B7, not E7. Oops! So for D major: ii = Em and V/ii is indeed B7. 

Now, E7 corresponds to V/vi, with Bm as the vi in D major. Actually, E7 can be seen as V/V, where V is A, confirming that E7 is valid.

E7/D, which gives D as the bass note, is a 3rd inversion of E7, functioning as a V/V. Lastly, Amaj7/C# includes a G# note that doesn't belong in D major, which helps me understand its role better!**Exploring Amaj7 in D major**

I’m considering the Amaj7 chord, which includes G#. Is that typical in D major? The usual diatonic A chord is either A or A7, and in a major context, it could be A or A7. 

A7 includes G natural, which fits D major's key signature. It’s interesting that A7 as a dominant uses G natural while still being diatonic. However, Amaj7’s G# is outside the key, indicating possible temporary tonicization or modal interchange. It could be that in Amaj7/C#, G# acts like a leading tone to A.**Considering D Lydian effects**

I’m thinking about how the Amaj7 fits into the progression as a color chord. It seems to come from the A major scale but might suggest a nonfunctional use. In pop music, using Amaj7 in a D Lydian context is interesting. Since D Lydian has G# as part of the scale, chords like E major and A major would also include G#.

Looking at the chord structure, D major, Bm, and F#m all fit nicely, while E major incorporates G#, and the addition of D in E7 aligns with Lydian characteristics too.**Determining key and mode**

In D Lydian, I've realized C# is the 6th, and D natural is included, making E7 (E G# B D) diatonic. Nice! Amaj7 also fits, as it contains G#. 

I’ve verified the notes for the chords: D, Bm/D, F#m/C#, E7/D, and Amaj7/C# all align with the D Lydian scale. Therefore, the tonal center is D, and the mode is Lydian. The only notable alteration from D major is G#, which indicates this Lydian character.

So, the answer is: Key center D, mode Lydian!

D is the tonal center, and the repeated use of G# (in E7 and Amaj7) points to a raised 4th scale degree. That makes the mode Lydian.

Answer: D Lydian (D as key center, Lydian mode).
