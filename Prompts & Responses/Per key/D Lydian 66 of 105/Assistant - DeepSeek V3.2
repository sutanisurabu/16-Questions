Let’s break this down step by step.

**1. Look at the chords given:**

- **D**  
- **Bm/D** (B minor with D bass — still Bm harmony but D in bass)  
- **F#m/C#** (F# minor with C# bass)  
- **E7/D** (E7 with D bass — E7 = E G# B D, so D bass makes it a slash chord)  
- **Amaj7/C#** (A major 7th with C# bass)  
- **D** (final chord)

---

**2. Identify likely key from chord roots and harmonic function**

Common chords in **D major** key:  
D (I), E7 (V7 of A, which is V in D major), F#m (vi), Bm (ii), A (V), Amaj7 (V maj7 — common in jazz/pop).

Common chords in **D minor** key:  
Dm, B♭, F, C, etc. — but here we have Bm, F#m, E7, Amaj7 — all fit **D major** better except no G chord, but that’s fine.

**3. Check the bass movement**

The bass line in many of these chords is **D**:

- D  
- Bm/D (bass D)  
- D  
- F#m/C# (bass C#)  
- E7/D (bass D)  
- D  
- Bm/D (bass D)  
- D  
- Amaj7/C# (bass C#)  
- D

So bass alternates between **D** and **C#** a lot.

**4. Functional analysis in D major**

- D = I  
- Bm/D = ii chord with D pedal bass  
- F#m/C# = vi chord with C# in bass (C# is 3rd of A major, leading tone to D)  
- E7/D = V7 chord with D bass — creates tension because E7 wants to resolve to A (V–I in key of A), but bass D clashes (E7/D = E G# B D over D = D E G# B — a Dmaj7#9? Or just a polychord). Could be a way to tonicize A but keep D pedal.  
- Amaj7/C# = A major 7 with C# bass — in D major, A is V, Amaj7 is Vmaj7, C# bass is the 3rd of A, again that C#–D bass motion.  
- Ends on D.

**5. Mode consideration**

All chords are diatonic to D major except E7.  
E7 contains G# — not in D major scale (D major has G natural).  
G# is the leading tone of A major.  
So E7 is **V7 of A** (the dominant of the dominant).  
This suggests we’re in **D major** but using a secondary dominant (V7/V) to lead to A (or Amaj7), which then leads back to D (V–I in D).

No minor tonic chord, so not D minor.  
Bass emphasis on D and C# — C# is the major 7th of D, not the ♭7, so not Mixolydian.  
Raised 7th (C#) in scale from F#m, Amaj7, and the G# in E7 is a temporary accidental.

---

**6. Conclusion**

Key: **D major**  
Mode: **Ionian** (major) — despite the E7, which is a secondary dominant, not a modal mixture.  
The E7 doesn’t change the overall key; it’s a brief diversion to the dominant key area (A major) before returning.

**Final answer:**  
**Key: D major**  
**Mode: Ionian**
