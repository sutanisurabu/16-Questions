### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Amaj7/C# D. They want me to figure out the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to write out all the chords clearly. The progression is: D, D, Bm/D, Bm/D, D, D, F#m/C#, E7/D, D, D, Amaj7/C#, D. Hmm, those chords with slashes like Bm/D probably indicate slash chords where D is the bass note. So Bm/D is B minor with D in the bass, which is actually D major's second inversion since D-F#-A. Wait, no. Bm is B-D-F#, so Bm/D would have D as the bass, making it D-F#-B. That's the same notes as D major (D-F#-A) but with B instead of A. Actually, D-F#-B is the second inversion of B minor, but it's a different set of notes. Maybe I should list all the notes involved.

Let me list each chord's notes to see the overall key. Starting with D major: D-F#-A. Then Bm/D: bass D, then B and F#, so notes D, F#, B. That's actually a D6 chord (D-F#-A-B), but missing the A. Wait, no—Bm/D is specifically B minor triad over D bass, so notes are D (bass), B, D, F#? Typically, it's D (bass), then B and F# in the chord, so the notes present are D, B, F#. But D-B-F# is the same as B minor with D in bass, which is a first inversion Bm chord? Wait, standard inversion: root position Bm is B-D-F#, first inversion is D-F#-B, second inversion F#-B-D. So Bm/D likely means first inversion, so notes D, F#, B. Which is D-F#-B, the same as a D6 chord without the A. But D6 would be D-F#-A-B. Here it's D-F#-B, so it's actually a D major triad missing the A, or a Bsus4? Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as D as bass with Bm chord, so the harmony is B minor but with D bass.

But for key analysis, I should consider the root notes of the chords. The progression seems to be centered around D. Let me list the chord roots ignoring the bass notes for a moment: D, D, Bm (so root B), Bm, D, D, F#m (root F#), E7 (root E), D, D, Amaj7 (root A), D.

So roots: D, D, B, B, D, D, F#, E, D, D, A, D.

Now, dominant function chords often point to the key. Here, E7 is a dominant 7th chord. E7 usually resolves to A major or A minor. But in this progression, E7/D goes to D. Wait, E7/D means E7 chord with D in the bass. So the chord is E7 (E-G#-B-D) but with D as bass note, so it's D-E-G#-B. That's actually a D9 chord (D-F#-A-C#-E) but missing F# and A? Wait, E7 is E-G#-B-D. With D bass, it's D (bass), E, G#, B. So notes D, E, G#, B. That's a D7sus4? Or actually, D-E-G#-B is the same as E7/D, which functions as a secondary dominant. E7 is V7 of A, but here it's going to D, not A. So maybe it's V7/vi or something? Wait, if the key is D major, vi is Bm. E7 is V7 of A, but in D major, A is V. V7 of V is E7, which would resolve to A, but here E7/D goes to D. So E7 to D is a deceptive cadence? Or maybe the key isn't D major.

Perhaps the key is A major? But the progression starts and ends on D, and has a lot of D chords. Let me check the chords again. The progression is mostly D chords with some variations: Bm/D, F#m/C#, E7/D, Amaj7/C#. Let's look at the bass notes because slash chords indicate bass movement. The bass line: D, D, D, D, D, D, C#, D, D, D, C#, D. Wait, no: the chords are D (bass D), D (D), Bm/D (bass D), Bm/D (D), D (D), D (D), F#m/C# (bass C#), E7/D (bass D), D (D), D (D), Amaj7/C# (bass C#), D (D).

So the bass notes: D, D, D, D, D, D, C#, D, D, D, C#, D.

So the bass is mostly D, stepping down to C# occasionally. C# is the leading tone to D. So when bass goes C# to D, it's a cadence. Specifically, in D major, C# is the leading tone, so C#-D in bass is like #vii° to I, but here it's under F#m and Amaj7 chords.

Let's list all chords with their actual notes:

- D: D, F#, A

- Bm/D: D (bass), B, F# → notes D, F#, B

- F#m/C#: C# (bass), F#, A, C → F#m is F#-A-C, so F#m/C# has bass C#, so notes C#, F#, A, C? Wait, F# minor triad is F#-A-C, so F#m/C# would be C# bass with F#m chord, so the notes are C#, F#, A, C. But C natural? That's important.

- E7/D: D bass, E7 chord (E, G#, B, D), so notes D, E, G#, B

- Amaj7/C#: C# bass, A major 7th chord (A, C#, E, G#), so notes C#, A, C#, E, G# → so C#, A, E, G#

- D: D, F#, A

Now, listing all the notes used in the progression:

From D: D, F#, A

Bm/D: D, F#, B

F#m/C#: C#, F#, A, C

E7/D: D, E, G#, B

Amaj7/C#: C#, A, E, G#

D: D, F#, A

So compiling all notes: A, B, C, C#, D, E, F#, G#

Wait, C natural and C# both appear? From F#m/C#, we have C (since F#m is F#-A-C, so C natural). But from Amaj7/C#, we have C# (since A major is A-C#-E). Also, E7/D has G# (E7 is E-G#-B-D). D major has F#, so F# is present.

So notes present: A, B, C, C#, D, E, F#, G#

That's a lot of notes. C and C# are both there, which is unusual for a single key. Also G# and F#.

Let me see: C natural comes from F#m (F# minor key has C natural), but C# comes from A major (A natural key has C#). Similarly, G# is from E7 (E major has G#), which is typical in D major (since E7 is V7/V).

But the presence of C natural (from F#m) suggests a possible modal mixture or a different key.

Perhaps the key is D major, but with some borrowed chords.

Standard D major key: D E F# G A B C#

Chords in D major: I D, ii Em, iii F#m, IV G, V A, vi Bm, vii° C#dim

Now looking at the progression:

- D: I

- Bm/D: Bm is vi, so vi with D bass. So it's vi/I? But bass is D, so it's a first inversion vi chord.

- F#m/C#: F#m is iii in D major. C# is the bass, which is the fifth of F#m (F#m: F#-A-C, fifth is C). So F#m/C# is third inversion F#m7? Wait, F#m is triad, so F#m/C# would be second inversion if it's a triad (since root F#, first inv B, second inv C). But F#m triad second inversion is C-F#-A, so bass C. But here it's written as F#m/C#, which has C# bass, not C. C# vs C.

Problem: F#m chord should have C natural, but here it's written as F#m/C#—C# bass. But F# minor triad is F#-A-C, so the notes are C natural. But C# is a different note. So F#m/C# would imply a chord with root F#, minor triad, but bass C#. However, C# is not part of F# minor triad—it's a semitone above C. This seems like a mistake or misnotation.

Wait, maybe it's F#m7? F#m7 is F#-A-C-E. Then F#m7/C# would have bass C#, and notes C#, F#, A, C, E. But still has C natural.

But in the progression, it's written as F#m/C#, which is unusual because C# is not in F#m triad. Unless it's a different chord altogether.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be F#m7/C# or something else. But given the user wrote F#m/C#, I have to work with that.

Similarly, Amaj7/C#: A major 7 is A-C#-E-G#, so Amaj7/C# has bass C#, which is the third of the chord, so first inversion Amaj7.

E7/D: E7 is E-G#-B-D, bass D, so it's a second inversion E7? Or a D chord with added notes.

Another approach: look at the cadences. The progression ends with ...Amaj7/C# to D. So C# bass to D bass, which is a half-step resolution, typical of a cadence in D major (where C# is leading tone to D).

Similarly, earlier F#m/C# to E7/D to D: C# to D in bass.

So the bass movement C# - D suggests D is the tonic.

Chords that have C# bass are F#m/C# and Amaj7/C#, both resolving to D via C#-D bass.

In D major, the leading tone is C#, so any chord with C# in bass resolving to D would function as a cadential 6/4 or something, but here it's under different chords.

F#m/C#: if key is D major, F#m is iii chord. iii chord in first inversion would be A-F#-C? Wait, no. Inversion: root position iii is F#-A-C, first inversion A-C-F#, second inversion C-F#-A. So bass C for second inversion. But here it's C# bass, not C. So it's not standard.

Unless the chord is not F#m but something else. F#m/C#—if the chord is actually D/F# or something, but the user wrote F#m/C#.

Wait, maybe the "/D" and "/C#" indicate pedal point. Like a D pedal with Bm chord on top, so the harmony is Bm but over D bass, creating a D6 (D-F#-A-B) but without A, so D-F#-B. Similarly, F#m/C# might be C# pedal with F#m, but C# is not in F#m.

This is confusing. Let's try to hear the progression. If I imagine playing D constantly in bass, with chords changing, but the slash notation specifies the bass note.

Assume bass is as written:

Bar 1: D (bass D, chord D)

Bar 2: D

Bar 3: D bass with Bm chord → so notes D (bass), B, D, F# → D-F#-B, which is D6 (if A were present, but it's not). So essentially a D6 chord.

Similarly, F#m/C#: C# bass with F#m → F#m is F#-A-C, so notes C#, F#, A, C. But C natural.

E7/D: D bass with E7 → E7 is E-G#-B-D, so D bass with E,G#,B → D-E-G#-B, which is D7sus4? Or E7/D is a slash chord implying E7 harmony but D in bass.

But in functional harmony, E7/D is often used as a secondary dominant. E7 is V7 of A, so if it's resolving to A, but here it resolves to D. So maybe it's V7/vi resolving to I, but vi is Bm, not D.

Wait, in D major, vi is Bm. V7/vi would be E7, which should resolve to Bm. But here E7/D goes to D, not Bm. So it's a deceptive resolution? E7 to D instead of E7 to A (V to I) or E7 to Bm (V/vi to vi).

But E7 is V of A, so in D major, A is V chord. So E7 would be V7/V, resolving to A (V), but here it resolves to D (I), which is unusual.

Unless the key is A, but progression starts and ends on D.

Another idea: perhaps the key is D Mixolydian. Mixolydian has a b7, so C natural. Let's check.

D Mixolydian: D E F# G A B C

Notes: D, E, F#, G, A, B, C

Now look at the chords:

- D: D-F#-A (I)

- Bm/D: B-D-F# — Bm is vi in major, but in Mixolydian, vi would be B diminished? Wait, D Mixolydian scale: D E F# G A B C

Chords:

I: D-F#-A (major)

ii: E-G-A (E minor? E-G is minor third, but G to A is major second. E-G-A is E minor 7th without 7th? Wait, triads in Mixolydian:

I: D (D-F#-A)

ii: Emin (E-G-A? No: E-G is minor third, E-G-B is Emin, but B is natural in Mixolydian). D Mixolydian notes: D E F# G A B C

So triads:

D: D-F#-A → major

E: E-G-A → wait, E-G is minor third, G-A is major second, so E-G-B? No, let's build thirds.

Scale degrees:

1: D

2: E

3: F#

4: G

5: A

6: B

b7: C

So triads:

I: 1-3-5 = D-F#-A → major

ii: 2-4-6 = E-G-B → E minor (E-G is minor third? E to G is minor third? E-F#-G: E to G is minor third (3 semitones), yes. G to B is major third. So E minor.

iii: 3-5-b7 = F#-A-C → F# diminished? F#-A is minor third, A-C is minor third, so diminished triad.

IV: 4-6-1 = G-B-D → G major

V: 5-b7-2 = A-C-E → A minor

vi: b7-1-3 = C-D-F# → C major? C-D is major second, D-F# major third. C-D-F# is C major add9? Triad would be C-E-G, but here it's C-D-F#. Not a standard triad.

Actually, in modal harmony, chords are built on each degree with diatonic notes.

For D Mixolydian:

Chord on D (I): D-F#-A → D major

Chord on E (ii): E-G-B → Emin (since G natural)

Chord on F# (iii): F#-A-C → F# diminished

Chord on G (IV): G-B-D → G major

Chord on A (V): A-C-E → A minor

Chord on B (vi): B-D-F# → B minor

Chord on C (bVII): C-E-G → C major

In the given progression, we have:

- D major (I in Mixolydian)

- Bm/D: B minor chord, which is vi in Mixolydian. So vi with D bass is first inversion vi.

- F#m/C#: F#m chord. But in Mixolydian, F# chord is diminished (F#-A-C), not minor. So F#m would imply F#-A-C, but it's usually diminished in diatonic. However, sometimes written as minor for simplicity, but technically it's diminished.

- E7/D: E7 is E-G#-B-D. But in D Mixolydian, G is natural, so G# is not diatonic. E7 has G#, which is outside Mixolydian (which has G natural). So E7 suggests harmonic influence, like harmonic minor or major.

- Amaj7/C#: A major 7, which has C# and G#. In Mixolydian, A chord is minor (A-C-E), but here it's major (A-C#-E-G#), so definitely not diatonic to Mixolydian.

So Mixolydian doesn't fit because of G# and C#.

What about Dorian mode? D Dorian: D E F G A B C#

Chords:

i: D minor? Wait, Dorian is minor mode. D Dorian: D E F G A B C# — relative to C major.

Wait, D Dorian has:

1: D

2: E

b3: F

4: G

5: A

6: B

7: C#

So D minor with major 6th.

Chord on D: D-F-A → D minor

But in our progression, the tonic chord is D major (D-F#-A), not minor. So Dorian is out because it's minor.

Phrygian: D E♭ F G A B♭ C — but we have F# and A, so no.

Lydian: D E F# G# A B C# — but we have G natural in some chords? Wait, in the progression, do we have G natural? From F#m/C#, F#m is F#-A-C, so no G. E7 has G#, Amaj7 has G#. D major has no G. So all G's are sharped? Notes used: G# appears in E7 and Amaj7. Is there a G natural? Let's check.

Earlier, I thought F#m/C# has C natural, but does it have G? F#m is F#-A-C, so no G. E7 has G#, D has F# (no G), Amaj7 has G#. So all G notes are G#, no G natural. So possibly a key with G#.

D major has two sharps: F# and C#. So notes D E F# G A B C#.

But in the progression, we have C natural from F#m/C# (since F# minor chord is F#-A-C). So C natural is present, which is not in D major (which has C#).

Similarly, Amaj7 has C# (since A major is A-C#-E), so both C natural and C# are present.

This suggests modal mixture or a different key altogether.

Perhaps the key is A major? A major: A B C# D E F# G#

Chords in A major: I A, ii Bm, iii C#m, IV D, V E, vi F#m, vii° G#dim

Now, progression starts on D, which is IV in A major.

But the progression ends on D, and has a lot of D chords, so maybe not.

Unless it's a IV-I cadence, but typically tonic is where it resolves.

Another idea: maybe it's in D, but with a borrowed chord. The F#m chord is standard in D major (iii), but F#m/C# — C# is the leading tone.

Wait, F#m in D major is F#-A-C, so it has C natural. But in D major, the seventh is C#, so C natural is the minor seventh, borrowed from Dorian or something.

Similarly, E7 is V7 of A, but in D major, A is V, so E7 is V7/V.

The progression has E7/D going to D, which is not the standard V7/V to V, but V7/V to I, which is a deceptive cadence.

But also, Amaj7 is used, which is V major in D minor? Wait, in D harmonic minor, A would be major (V), but here tonic is D major.

This is tricky.

Let's list all chord roots with their functions if in D major:

- D: I

- Bm: vi

- F#m: iii

- E7: V7/V (since V is A, V7 is E7)

- Amaj7: V (A is V in D major)

- Amaj7/C#: same, first inversion V

In the progression, after two D's, it goes to Bm/D (vi), then back to D. Then D, D, then F#m/C# (iii), E7/D (V7/V), D (I), then D, D, Amaj7/C# (V), D (I).

The sequence F#m - E7 - D: iii - V7/V - I. In functional harmony, iii is not usually a dominant function chord. But E7 is V7/V, which should go to A, but it goes to D.

Similarly, later Amaj7 (V) goes to D (I), which is a standard V-I cadence. But in the progression, it's written as Amaj7/C# to D, so first inversion V to I.

Ah! The progression ends with Amaj7/C# to D, which is a V-I cadence. In D major, A is V, so V-I is standard.

But earlier, E7/D goes to D, which would be like a secondary dominant resolving deceptively. E7 is V7 of A (V), so V7/V resolving to I instead of V.

So the key is D major, with a deceptive cadence (E7 to D instead of to A), and the F#m is just the iii chord.

But what about the C natural in F#m? In D major, F#m chord is diatonic (iii), which has C natural, yes. D major key signature has F# and C#, but the iii chord is F#-A-C, so it uses C natural, which is correct because in major keys, the mediant chord is minor and contains the flat seventh scale degree (in D major, C natural is b7).

Yes! In D major:

Scale: D E F# G A B C#

But the iii chord is F#-A-C. C is natural, which is the minor seventh of the scale (since C# is seventh, C natural is b7).

So F#m is standard diatonic chord in D major.

Similarly, Bm is vi chord: B-D-F#, diatonic.

E7 is V7 of A (V chord), so E7 is secondary dominant.

Amaj7 is V chord with added seventh.

Now, the slash chords:

- Bm/D: B minor chord with D bass → this is first inversion Bm, which is common. Notes D, F#, B. Sometimes written as D6 (D-F#-A-B), but missing A, so it's just Bm/D.

- F#m/C#: F# minor chord with C# bass. F#m is F#-A-C, so bass C#? But C# is not in F#m triad. Wait, F#m triad notes: F#, A, C. C natural. C# is different. So F#m/C# would have bass C#, but C# is not part of the chord. That's a problem.

Unless it's a typo and should be F#m7/C#. F#m7 is F#-A-C-E, so C# bass? Still C# not in chord.

Wait, perhaps it's not F#m/C# but F#m7/C#, which would be F#m7 (F#-A-C-E) with C# bass. But C# isn't in F#m7. F#m7 has C natural.

This is confusing. Maybe the bass note is written incorrectly. In many contexts, C# under F#m might imply a different chord.

Another possibility: in guitar tab or some notations, "/C#" might mean something else, but standardly it's bass note.

Wait, F#m/C# — if we take C# as bass, and the chord is F#m, but F#m has C natural, so the note C# in bass clashes with C natural in chord. That would create a minor ninth interval (C# and C natural), which is dissonant.

That seems unlikely in a typical progression. So perhaps it's a misnotation.

Maybe it's F#7/C# or something else. F#7 is F#-A#-C#-E, but then C# bass is root position.

But user wrote F#m/C#.

Alternatively, in the key of D, the chord F#m/C# — C# is the leading tone, so perhaps it's a cadential 6/4 chord. But cadential 6/4 is usually V6/4, which is second inversion dominant.

For example, in D major, A6/4 (A-E-C#) then A (A-C#-E) then D.

But here it's F#m/C#, which is not V.

Unless it's a iv6/4 or something in minor, but we're in major.

Another idea: perhaps the "/C#" is not bass note but part of the chord name. But standard notation is chord/root.

Wait, Amaj7/C# is clearly A major 7 with C# bass, which is first inversion, since C# is third of A chord.

Similarly, E7/D is E7 with D bass.

F#m/C# should be F#m with C# bass.

But F#m has C natural, so bass C# over C natural is a minor second, very dissonant. Unlikely.

Unless in the context, the C# is a passing tone or the chord is actually different.

Wait, maybe it's F#m7(b5)/C# or something, but user said F#m.

Perhaps in the progression, the F#m/C# is actually a D/F# chord? D major with F# bass, which is first inversion D. But user wrote F#m/C#.

This is a problem. Let's assume it's a notation error. Common chords in D major with C# bass: the dominant chord A has C# as third, so A/C# is first inversion A. Or the leading tone chord C#dim, which is C#-E-G, so C#dim would have C# bass.

C#dim is the vii° chord in D major: C#-E-G.

So C#dim is C#-E-G, which is vii°.

Now, F#m/C# — if it's actually C#dim, but written as F#m/C# by mistake? Because C#dim = E-G-C#, which is also Gmaj6/E or something, but not F#m.

C#dim notes: C#, E, G.

F#m notes: F#, A, C.

No overlap.

But E7/D: E7 is E-G#-B-D, bass D. G# is in there.

Amaj7/C#: A-C#-E-G#, bass C#.

Now, the note G# appears in E7 and Amaj7, which are both related to the V chord (A in D major).

In D major, the V chord is A major (A-C#-E), and V7 is A7 (A-C#-E-G). But here we have E7 (which is V7/V) and Amaj7 (which is I7 of V? No, Amaj7 is not standard in major key; V7 is dominant 7th, but Amaj7 would be A-C#-E-G#, which has major seventh, unusual in diatonic harmony but common in jazz/pop.

Similarly, Dmaj7 would be D-F#-A-C#, but here tonic is triad D.

Given that, let's accept the chords as written and see the overall tonality.

The progression emphasizes D as tonic:

- Starts with D

- Has multiple D chords

- Ends with D

- Cadential motion: Amaj7/C# to D (V to I)

- Also, E7/D to D, which might be a deceptive cadence (V7/V to I instead of to V)

The presence of Bm (vi), F#m (iii) are diatonic to D major.

F#m has C natural (b7), which is fine in major key for the iii chord.

Now, the slash chords' bass notes:

- Bm/D: D bass under Bm, so it's a first inversion vi chord, creating a D in bass throughout much of the progression.

- F#m/C#: if F#m is iii, then C# should be the fifth of F#m? F#m triad: F# (root), A (third), C (fifth). So fifth is C natural. But bass is specified as C#, not C. So discrepancy.

Unless it's a typo and should be F#m/C, which would be second inversion F#m (bass C). That makes more sense.

Similarly, Amaj7/C# is correctly C# bass (third of A chord).

E7/D: E7 with D bass, which is the seventh of E7 (E7 is E-G#-B-D), so it's third inversion E7.

But if F#m/C# is a typo for F#m/C, then bass note C natural.

Let's check the bass line assuming that:

Original: D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Amaj7/C# D

If F#m/C# is meant to be F#m/C, then bass: D, D, D, D, D, D, C, D, D, D, C#, D

Now, bass movement: ...D to C to D... and ...D to C# to D.

C to D is whole step, C# to D is half step.

In D major, the cadential bass is often A (V) to D (I), or sometimes with pedal.

But C natural is b7, C# is leading tone.

The sequence F#m/C (bass C) to E7/D to D — bass C to D, which is b7 to 1, common in blues or Mixolydian.

But earlier analysis suggested D major with the iii chord having C natural.

Given that Amaj7/C# to D is a clear V-I cadence (since A is V in D major), that strongly points to D major.

The E7/D to D is a V7/V - I cadence, which is non-standard but can happen as a deceptive resolution.

The F#m/C# is problematic, but if we assume it's a misnotation for F#m/C (bass C natural), then it makes sense as second inversion iii chord.

Similarly, Bm/D is fine as first inversion vi.

So overall, key is D major.

Mode is Ionian, since it's major key.

The presence of C natural in iii chord is diatonic to major key (as b7 scale degree), not a modal mixture.

G# appears in secondary dominants (E7 is V7/V) and in Amaj7 (which could be analyzed as Vmaj7, common in some genres even though diatonic V7 is dominant 7th).

Therefore, the key is D major, mode is Ionian.

Based on the chord progression provided—**D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Amaj7/C# D**—I've analyzed the harmonic structure, bass movement, cadences, and scale degrees to determine the **key** and **mode**. Here's a clear breakdown of the reasoning, followed by the conclusion.

---

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**
#### **1. Tonic Confirmation (Where the Music Resolves)**
- The progression **starts and ends on D**, with D chords dominating (8 out of 12 measures).
- The final two chords (**Amaj7/C# → D**) form a **strong cadence**:
  - **Amaj7/C#** = A major 7th chord with C♯ in the bass (first inversion of A major).
  - **A major is the V chord in D major**, making **A → D a classic V–I cadence** (the most definitive resolution in major keys).
- This confirms **D as the tonic (home chord)**.

#### **2. Diatonic Chords in D Major**
The key of **D major** has the notes: **D E F♯ G A B C♯**  
Common diatonic chords:
- **I = D** (D–F♯–A)
- **vi = Bm** (B–D–F♯)
- **iii = F♯m** (F♯–A–C♮)  
  *(Note: The "C♮" is correct—the iii chord in major keys uses the **♭7 scale degree** (C♮ in D major), not C♯.)*
- **V = A** (A–C♯–E)
- **V7/V = E7** (E–G♯–B–D), the secondary dominant resolving to A (V chord), though here it resolves deceptively to D (more on this below).

All chords in your progression fit **D major**:
- **D** = I (tonic)
- **Bm/D** = vi chord (Bm) with D in bass (first inversion vi)
- **F♯m/C#** = iii chord (F♯m) with **C♯ bass** (more below)
- **E7/D** = V7/V (E7) with D bass (third inversion)
- **Amaj7/C#** = V chord (A major 7th) with C♯ bass (first inversion V)

#### **3. Resolving the Slash Chord Ambiguity**
- **F♯m/C#** is the only chord that appears problematic:
  - F♯ minor (F♯–A–C♮) **does not contain C♯**—it has **C♮** (♭7).
  - C♯ bass + C♮ in the chord creates a dissonant minor 2nd (C♯–C♮), which is atypical.
- **Resolution**: This is likely a **notation shorthand or common mislabeling** in practice. In D major:
  - **F♯m/C#** is almost certainly meant to be **F♯m/C♮** (C♮ bass = second inversion F♯m), as C♮ is diatonic to D major (via the iii chord).
  - The bass movement **C♮ → D** (after "F♯m/C#") is a classic **♭7 → 1 bass line** (e.g., in blues or Mixolydian-influenced progressions), but **still diatonic to D major** (since C♮ is part of the iii chord).
- Similarly, **Amaj7/C#** is correctly labeled (C♯ = 3rd of A major), and **E7/D** (D bass = 7th of E7) fits as a secondary dominant.

#### **4. Cadential Motion & Harmonic Function**
- **Amaj7/C# → D** = **V–I cadence** (resolves strongly to tonic).
- **E7/D → D** = **V7/V → I** (deceptive cadence, as E7 normally resolves to A, not D). This is common in pop/jazz for tension.
- **F♯m → E7 → D** = **iii → V7/V → I**, a less common but valid progression in major keys (reinforces D as tonic via the cadence).
- **Bm/D** = First-inversion vi chord, often used for smooth bass voice-leading (D–F♯–B over D bass).

#### **5. Why Not Another Key or Mode?**
- **Not A major**: A is the V chord, but the progression centers on D and cadences to D.
- **Not D Mixolydian**: Mixolydian has a ♭7 (C♮), but here:
  - **G♯ appears in E7 and Amaj7** (diatonic to D major's secondary dominants/V chord).
  - Mixolydian lacks G♯ and C♯ (it has G♮ and C♮), but your progression uses **G♯** (in E7) and **C♯** (in Amaj7)—core tonal elements of **D major**.
- **Not Dorian/Aeolian**: These are minor modes, but the tonic chord (D) is **major**—not minor.

### **Conclusion**
- **Key: D major**  
- **Mode: Ionian** (the standard major scale)  

#### **Why This Works**
- All chords are **diatonic to D major**, with:
  - **C♮** from the iii chord (F♯m = F♯–A–C♮), 
  - **G♯/C♯** from the V and V7/V chords (A major = A–C♯–E–G♯, E7 = E–G♯–B–D).
- The **V–I cadence (A → D)** is definitive.
- The progression uses **functional harmony** typical of major keys (tonic, dominant, pre-dominant chords), not modal mixture.

#### **Practical Note**
- The **F♯m/C#** notation is likely a shorthand for **F♯m/C♮** (second inversion F♯m) in practice, as C♮ is required for the iii chord in D major. If played as written (C♯ bass), it would clash, but context confirms D major is intended.

This progression is characteristic of **tonal pop/rock music in D major** (e.g., similar to "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses, which uses D major with iii–V–I motion). The mode is **Ionian**—no modal inflection alters the major tonality.
