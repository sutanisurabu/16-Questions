### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m working to determine the key and mode from the chord progression: "D D Bm/D Bm/D D D F#m/C# E7/D D D Bm/D Bm/D D D Amaj7/C# D." The sequence features D major chords primarily in the bass. 

I note that Bm/D is a B minor chord in first inversion, F#m/C# is F# minor over C#, and E7/D is an E dominant 7 over D. Amaj7/C# is also present. It seems like the tonality revolves around D, suggesting it could be in D major (Ionian). I should consider if V/V applies here.**Analyzing chord structure**

I’m breaking down the chords in D major. The chords are I = D, ii = Em, iii = F#m, IV = G, V = A, vi = Bm, and vii° = C#dim. 

I see that E7 isn't diatonic to D major—it's a V/V, the dominant of A. Bm is vi, and F#m is iii, which fit. Amaj7, representing Vmaj7, introduces a G# that’s non-diatonic because D major naturally includes G natural. So, Amaj7/C# has notes A, C#, E, and G#, suggesting a Lydian flavor, but Lydian would need G# as #4.**Examining Lydian implications**

I’m considering if the presence of G# suggests D Lydian. The E7 chord contains G# (E, G#, B, D), so there are two chords with G#—E7 and Amaj7. This means the progression includes G#.

D Lydian consists of the notes D, E, F#, G#, A, B, and C#. In analyzing the chords, Bm contains D and F#, but not G. However, F#m fits, and both E7 and Amaj7 align with D Lydian too. So, it seems all the chords could indeed be diatonic to D Lydian.**Checking D Lydian chords**

Let’s break down the D Lydian scale degrees. 

Starting with the I chord, D major (D, F#, A) fits perfectly. The ii chord, E major (E, G#, B), would include D natural as the flat 7, but in D Lydian, D is actually the 1st scale degree. So, E7 (E, G#, B, D) also works. 

The iii chord, F#m (F#, A, C#), fits too. The IV# could be G#dim since, in Lydian, it’s used for the fourth. 

A major (A, C#, E) fits, and Amaj7 introduces G#, which is diatonic to D Lydian. So, Amaj7 is indeed diatonic here!**Determining key and mode**

I’m concluding that the key is D Lydian due to the presence of G#. Amaj7 and E7 accommodate this mode, both being diatonic in D Lydian. 

- Chords include: 
  - I: D
  - II7: E7 (dominant 7)
  - iii: F#m
  - V: Amaj7
  - vi: Bm
  - vii: C#m7
  
The progression sits on a D pedal, aligning with the D Lydian scale—D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#. 

So, the final answer is D Lydian with D as the tonal center, reflecting A major's key signature of three sharps.

D Lydian (tonal center D, using the A major pitch collection: D E F# G# A B C#)

Reason:
- Repeated D pedal and cadencing on D
- Presence of G# in E7 and Amaj7 rules out D major (Ionian) and fits D Lydian, where II7 (E7) and Vmaj7 (Amaj7) are diatonic.
