Let's analyze the chords:

**Chords provided (assuming root position unless specified):**

*   D
*   Bm/D
*   D
*   F#m/C#
*   E7/D
*   D
*   Bm/D
*   D
*   Amaj7/C#
*   D

**Harmonic Analysis Strategy:**

1.  **What's the tonic?** Which chord feels like "home"? D major appears most frequently, starts and ends the progression.
2.  **What's the quality of the tonic?** D major is a major chord.
3.  **Compare scale degrees to major/minor.**

Let's consider D as the tonic:

*   **I** = D major (Tonic)
*   **ii** = Em (Not present)
*   **iii** = F#m (Present as F#m/C# - iii)
*   **IV** = G major (Not present)
*   **V** = A major (Present as Amaj7/C# - V7/V or just V with 7th and inversion)
*   **vi** = Bm (Present as Bm/D - vi)
*   **viiÂ°** = C#dim (Not present, though C# is in the bass of F#m/C# and Amaj7/C#)

**Chord Functions in D Major:**

*   D = **I** (Tonic)
*   Bm/D = **vi** (Submediant, Tonic extension/substitute) - Very common in pop/folk. The bass D reinforces the tonic.
*   F#m/C# = **iii** (Median, weak tonic function, often leads to vi or IV) - The C# bass leads nicely to D (VII to I in D, or just a passing bass).
*   E7/D = **V<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub>** (Dominant 7th, 2nd inversion) - This is a **very strong** dominant function chord. The bass D is a passing tone delaying the resolution to I. The E7 wants to resolve to A (V/V), but here it likely resolves directly to D (I) via the inversion and passing bass.
*   Amaj7/C# = **V<sup>6</sup><sub>5</sub>** (Dominant 7th, 1st inversion) - This is also a **strong** dominant function chord. The maj7 (G#) is the leading tone in A major, but here it's the 7th of the Amaj7 chord. It wants to resolve to D (I).

**Determining Key and Mode:**

1.  **Key Center:** The progression clearly revolves around D major. It starts and ends on D, and the other chords function relative to D.
2.  **Quality:** The tonic chord is major.
3.  **Mode:** Since the tonic is major and the harmony is functional (I, iii, vi, V), this is the **Ionian mode** (which is synonymous with the major scale).

**Conclusion:**

The key is **D Major**, and the mode is **Ionian (Major)**.
