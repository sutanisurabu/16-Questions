### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking at a chord sequence with bass notes, and it seems like it’s heavily based in Eb major. The Eb major scale includes Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, and D. Analyzing the chords, I see that Cm/Eb is actually the first inversion of C minor, which is the vi chord in Eb major. So that makes it vi6. The Gdim/Db is a dim triad likely built on G, Bb, and Db.**Exploring G diminished chord**

I’m analyzing the G diminished chord, which consists of G, Bb, and Db. Over a Db bass, it appears as the second inversion because Db is the fifth in the triad. While looking at the Eb major scale, G diminished isn't diatonic because it includes Db, which is the flat sixth degree. This suggests that Gdim functions as a passing chord or a leading tone that resolves to Ab, since it naturally leads to the Ab minor context.**Understanding chord functions**

I’m exploring how G diminished functions as a leading tone to Ab in Ab major/minor. In Eb major, Ab is the IV chord, and Gdim acts as a vii°/IV. So, with Db in the bass, it’s the second inversion. Moving on to Fm/Eb, I see that Fm (F, Ab, C) over an Eb bass gives a sense of ii6/5, but it's actually more like a ii7 chord since it lacks the Eb. Fm over Eb gives a seventh chord feel due to the stacking.**Clarifying chord structure**

I’m analyzing the Fm/Eb chord, which consists of F, Ab, and C over an Eb bass. This forms an Fm7 with the seventh (Eb) as the bass note, making it a ii7 in third inversion. Although it lacks explicit labeling, it's functioning as ii7/Eb. Moving on to the Db6 chord, I realize it's a major triad with an added sixth. This borrowed chord could be seen as a bII in Eb major, with bVI confirming as Cb, which confuses me a bit!**Determining key and mode**

I’m considering the Db chord, which acts as bII in Eb major and is related to the Neapolitan function. A Db6 chord could indicate a Neapolitan sixth, but with a major sixth added, suggesting ambiguity. The recurring Db in the progression, along with the continual emphasis on Eb, points towards a modal center. This suggests it might be in Eb mixolydian, as both Gdim and Db6 align with its characteristics, forming a bVII to I cadence. The entire progression fits diatonically within Eb mixolydian as seen in the shared notes.**Finalizing key and mode**

The mode is Eb mixolydian, with the key signature being Ab major (4 flats). Our tonic center is Eb. The key center is Eb, and the mode is specifically mixolydian. All chords are diatonic to Eb mixolydian, including Eb (I), Cm/Eb (vi6), Gdim/Db (iii°6/4), Fm/Eb (ii7), and Db6 (bVII add6). The presence of Db indicates a b7 scale degree, reinforcing the mixolydian mode. 

- Tonic: Eb  
- Mode: Mixolydian (b7 = Db)  
- Diatonic evidence: Eb, Cm/Eb (vi6), G°/Db (iii°6/4), Fm/Eb (ii7), Db6 (bVII).

Eb Mixolydian (tonic Eb, mode mixolydian)

- All chords fit Eb mixolydian (same key signature as Ab major): Eb (I), Cm/Eb (vi6), Gdim/Db (iii°6/4), Fm/Eb (ii7 4/2), Db6 (bVII add6), resolving to Eb.
- The presence of Db (b7) and absence of D natural point to mixolydian rather than Eb major.

### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to figure out the key and mode from the chord progression provided by the user: "Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb." This looks like it might be in Eb major since the chords suggest that. The involvement of Cm/Eb indicates that it’s the vi chord in first inversion. The Gdim chord complicates things, but it can be part of a minor key structure, leading me to consider Eb minor as well.**Analyzing chord functions**

I’m considering the chord G, which isn’t in the Eb minor scale. G might actually be functioning as a leading tone chord in the context of Eb major, especially with Gdim/Db possibly being a secondary leading tone chord. In Eb major, Fm serves as the ii chord, and Fm/Eb suggests F minor over an Eb bass, which means it’s functioning as ii7 in third inversion. Even though it’s written as Fm/Eb, it could imply Fm7/Eb, focusing on creating a suspension over the bass to emphasize the tonic.**Identifying modal borrowing**

Looking at the chord sequence: Eb - Eb - Cm/Eb - Cm/Eb - Gdim/Db - Fm/Eb - Eb - Eb - Cm/Eb - Cm/Eb - Eb - Eb - Db6 - Eb, I notice the Db6 chord near the end. In Eb major, Db serves as the flat VII chord, which likely stems from Mixolydian borrowing. The addition of the 6th (Bb) to the Db major chord is pretty common in Eb major. While the majority of chords point to Eb major, I can't ignore that Gdim, as it sits outside the diatonic structure.**Considering passing chords**

I’m thinking about how the Gdim/Db chord can work as a passing chord between Cm/Eb and Fm/Eb. The bass moves from Eb to Db and back to Eb, linking them together. The inner voices feature C minor leading into Gdim/Db and then Fm/Eb, which might act as a chromatic neighbor passing chord. In Eb major, Db is the flat seventh, so Gdim/Db would function like a V7 chord of Eb, even though it lacks the root.**Evaluating key and mode**

I’m breaking down the chord progression, focusing on how Gdim/Db relates to other chords like Cm/Eb and Fm/Eb. The Gdim chord, lacking a root, has G-Bb-Db and serves a leading-tone function. This could imply it’s functioning as vii°7/IV. While these progressions suggest Eb major, the presence of Db leads me to consider Mixolydian influences. After analyzing the functional roles of chords, it seems the key is indeed Eb major, with elements of modal mixture indicated by the bVII chord.**Determining key and mode**

I’m analyzing the chord Gdim/Db, which denotes a G diminished triad over a Db bass, suggesting it's a second inversion iii°6. Both Cm/Eb and Fm/Eb fit as vi6 and ii6/4, respectively. The presence of Db6 indicates bVII, which is diatonic in Mixolydian. This means the progression is best described in Eb Mixolydian rather than major. Since no D natural is present in the chords, everything aligns with Eb Mixolydian. So, I'll affirm: the tonal center is Eb, and the mode is Mixolydian.

Eb Mixolydian (tonal center Eb, major with flat 7).

Why: The progression is diatonic to Eb Mixolydian: I (Eb), vi (Cm/Eb), iii° (Gdim/Db), ii (Fm/Eb), bVII (Db6). The presence of G diminished and Db (bVII) rules out Eb Ionian (major) and points to Mixolydian.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord structure**

I’m exploring a bass line and thinking about a sus type chord on the I. The Cm/Eb indicates a C minor triad with Eb in the bass, which might yield something akin to Ebmaj add9 add6. It's interesting how C is the sixth of Eb, making it feel like an Eb major 6 chord. It seems that both Cm/Eb and Fm/Eb function like upper triads over a tonic pedal, with Eb as the tonal center but incorporating mixolydian elements. The transition with Gdim over Db also invites exploration.**Exploring chord transitions**

I’m realizing that the measure is actually Gdim/Db followed by Fm/Eb, where the bass moves from Db to Eb — that half step adds a nice touch! The voice-leading from Gdim to Fm feels smooth, almost leading me into Fm as a ii chord in Eb. Since Gdim acts as the leading-tone diminished chord, it leads into Fm effectively. Now, considering the overall key, it seems to be Eb major or maybe even Eb mixolydian due to the borrowed flat VII. It's tricky!**Determining the key and scale**

I’m noticing that while D natural isn’t explicitly present, it would typically be the leading tone in Eb major. But looking at the chords used — Eb, Cm, Gdim, Fm, and Db6 — it seems like D natural is absent. The presence of Db suggests an Eb Mixolydian feel. The scale degrees of Eb Mixolydian point to this as well, especially since we’ve got C natural, which aligns with the scale, confirming it’s indeed Mixolydian rather than Ionian since D natural just isn’t there!**Analyzing key and mode**

Without D natural present, it's a bit tricky. The Db6 and Gdim chords suggest Db over D natural, leaning away from Ionian. So, I might conclude that the key center is Eb with a Mixolydian mode thanks to the flat VII (Db) and lack of a leading tone. For a brief answer, I could say, "Eb major (Ionian) with a bVII (Db)." Still, repeated chords anchor this strongly in Eb, leading me to question whether mixolydian or major is more precise.**Establishing key and mode**

The G diminished chord fits into Eb Mixolydian, where the scale degrees are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, and Db. The triad built on G would indeed be G diminished, as it follows the structure of Mixolydian. So, I see that Gdim is diatonic to Eb Mixolydian, along with Db6. The entire progression — Eb, Cm, Gdim, Fm, Db6 — aligns with Eb Mixolydian. For clarity, I can summarize: Tonic center is Eb, mode is Mixolydian, and it’s backed by the presence of Db and G diminished chords.

Eb Mixolydian.

Tonal center is Eb, and the presence of Db (b7) and G° (iii°) along with Fm (ii) and Cm (vi) fits Eb Mixolydian. The Db6 → Eb move is a bVII → I cadence typical of Mixolydian, and much of the passage sits over an Eb pedal.

### Analysis of the Chord Progression
The given progression is: **Eb - Eb - Cm/Eb - Cm/Eb - Gdim/Db - Fm/Eb - Eb - Eb - Cm/Eb - Cm/Eb - Eb - Eb - Db6 - Eb**.

This is a repetitive, jazz ballad-style sequence with mostly Eb bass notes and some passing harmony. I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step.

#### Step 1: Identifying the Tonic (Root/Key Center)
- The progression starts, repeats, and resolves heavily on **Eb** (7 out of 14 chords, plus frequent Eb bass).
- It ends on **Db6 - Eb**, pulling strongly back to Eb as the resolution (V7-of-V or bVII - I feel).
- No other chord competes as tonic (e.g., Cm feels like a subdominant pull, not resolution).
- **Tonic: Eb**.

#### Step 2: Diatonic Chords and Scale Fit
Eb major (Ionian) scale: **Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D**  
Common chords:  
- Eb (I)  
- Cm (vi)  
- Fm (iv)  

However:  
- **Gdim/Db** (G - Bb - Db triad over Db bass) introduces **Db** (not in Eb major; D natural would be expected for diatonic vii° = D - F - Ab).  
- **Db6** (Db - F - Ab - Bb) is fully based on **Db**, the flat subtonic (bVII).  

These suggest a mode with **Db** (b7) instead of **D** (7), making everything diatonic.

Eb Mixolydian scale: **Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db** (5th mode of Ab major; major scale with flattened 7th).  
Diatonic chords (all fit perfectly):  
- **Eb**: I (Eb - G - Bb)  
- **Cm** (or Cm/Eb): vi (C - Eb - G)  
- **Fm** (or Fm/Eb): iv (F - Ab - C)  
- **Gdim** (or Gdim/Db): ♭vi° or passing dim (G - Bb - Db); fully diatonic here.  
- **Db6**: bVII6 (Db - F - Ab - Bb); classic Mixolydian color chord.  

The bass notes (mostly Eb, with Db under Gdim) reinforce this—no accidentals or tensions outside the mode.

#### Step 3: Mode Confirmation
- **Mixolydian mode**: Characterized by the b7 (Db here), giving a "bluesy" or dominant flavor without full resolution to minor. Common in jazz/pop for its warm, unresolved vibe (e.g., bVII - I turnaround).  
- Why not Ionian (major)? The Db in Gdim/Db and Db6 would be chromatic (#5 or altered), but they fit natively in Mixolydian. No D natural appears to pull toward pure major.  
- Why not minor (e.g., C minor or Eb minor)? Cm pulls subdominantly but doesn't resolve as tonic; no strong minor v or VII° expected. Eb feels brighter and more stable.  
- Other modes ruled out: No #4 (Lydian), b3 (Aeolian/Dorian), or #2 (other exotics).

#### Step 4: Functional Interpretation
- **Eb - Cm/Eb**: Tonic to submediant (I - vi), lyrical setup.  
- **Gdim/Db - Fm/Eb**: Chromatic passing dim (♭vi° over bVII bass) to iv; builds tension toward tonic.  
- Repetition reinforces the modal loop.  
- Overall: Relaxed, cyclical feel typical of Mixolydian standards (e.g., similar to parts of "All Blues" or "So What" in modal jazz).

### Final Determination
- **Key**: Eb  
- **Mode**: Mixolydian  

This progression could be a jazz standard excerpt (possibly from "As Time Goes By" or a similar ballad in alternate voicings). If this is from a specific song or you have more context/chords, I can refine further!

**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

**Key: Eb**  
**Mode: Mixolydian**  

This progression centers tonally on Eb as the tonic, with repeated Eb chords framing the structure and providing resolution. The mode is Mixolydian due to the characteristic ♭7 (Db) introduced via the Gdim/Db and Db6 chords, alongside the absence of the natural 7th (D). All chords (Eb, Cm/Eb, Fm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Db6) derive from the Eb Mixolydian scale (Eb F G Ab Bb C Db), with the bVII (Db6) functioning as a common plagal resolution to I (Eb). No notes outside this scale appear, creating a consistent modal flavor often heard in jazz, pop, or rock standards.

### Reasoning

**Deconstructing the Chords**

I've started by examining the provided chord progression, aiming to break it down systematically. My initial step involves identifying each individual chord within the sequence: Eb, Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb, etc. I'm focusing on accurately noting all the chords and inversions presented.


**Identifying Potential Keys**

I'm now leaning towards an Eb major key, given the repeated Eb chords. I'm focusing on the Gdim/Db chord, trying to understand its place in relation to the overall key signature. Further, I'm examining how the Db6 functions, noting its potential as a borrowed chord.


**Exploring Pedal Point Dynamics**

I'm now zeroing in on the bassline's impact, particularly the Eb pedal point. It really shifts the focus, as the harmony unfolds *above* that static tonic. The lone Db in the bass before the Eb chord creates a strong pull. The fact that Eb major triads are repeated reinforces it as the tonal center.


**Considering Harmonic Functions**

I'm now deep-diving into the function of each chord, building on the initial key determination. The frequent inversions, particularly the Cm and Fm chords, have prompted me to focus on the bassline's role. I'm exploring how these chords contribute to the overall movement.


**Synthesizing the Key and Mode**

The progression strongly suggests Eb major, given the Eb chords and pedal point. I've pinpointed the functions of all chords, recognizing how the bVII (Db6) adds a unique flavor. The Gdim/Db acts as a chromatic passing chord, resolving nicely to Fm. I'm confident now in my conclusions.


**Refining Mode and Function**

The presence of the Db6 and Gdim/Db chords confirms my suspicions of Mixolydian influence. I'm now certain of the Eb major key, but the bVII and chromatic passing chord give the progression a distinct character. I'm focused on how the bVII chord resolves.


**Determining the Modal Flavor**

Now, I'm analyzing the implications of the bVII chord's presence within the Eb key. The Db6 specifically points to a Mixolydian influence. Further, I'm evaluating its resolution, assessing how the bVII chord resolves into the other chords.


**Reflecting on the Gdim**

I'm now focusing on the diminished chord, its tension, and its chromatic nature. I'm exploring how the Gdim/Db functions as a passing chord, adding interest. I now understand it resolves nicely to the Fm chord.




Excellent question. Let's break down this progression.

### Analysis

1.  **Tonal Center:** The progression starts and ends on an **Eb** chord. Furthermore, nearly the entire progression is played over an **Eb pedal point** in the bass (`Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb... Fm/Eb Eb Eb...`), which powerfully establishes **Eb** as the root and tonal center.

2.  **Chord Quality:** The tonic chord is **Eb major** (Eb-G-Bb), not Eb minor. This tells us we are in a major-type key or mode.

3.  **The "Color" Notes:** The key to identifying the specific mode lies in the notes that fall outside of the standard Eb major scale (Eb F G Ab Bb C D).
    *   The chords `Gdim/Db` and `Db6` both contain the note **Db**.
    *   In the key of Eb, the note Db is the **flattened 7th** degree (the 7th degree of Eb major is D natural).

4.  **Putting it Together:**
    *   We have a major tonic chord (Eb).
    *   We have a flattened 7th degree (Db).

    A major scale with a flattened 7th is the defining characteristic of the **Mixolydian mode**.

Let's check the chords against the Eb Mixolydian scale (Eb F G Ab Bb C Db):

*   **Eb** (Eb-G-Bb): The **I** chord. Fits perfectly.
*   **Cm** (C-Eb-G): The **vi** chord. Fits perfectly.
*   **Fm** (F-Ab-C): The **ii** chord. Fits perfectly.
*   **Gdim** (G-Bb-Db): The **iii°** (diminished) chord. This triad is naturally occurring on the third degree of the Mixolydian mode. Perfect fit.
*   **Db6** (Db-F-Ab-Bb): The **bVII** chord with an added 6th. This is the signature chord of the Mixolydian sound. Fits perfectly.

### Conclusion

The key and mode are:

**Key: Eb**
**Mode: Mixolydian**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to write out the chords clearly. The progression is: Eb, Eb, Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb, Eb, Eb, Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Eb, Eb, Db6, Eb. Those slash chords like Cm/Eb mean the chord is C minor with Eb in the bass. So, for analysis, I should consider the root notes and the bass notes separately if needed, but mainly focus on the chord roots.

Let me list the chord roots ignoring the bass notes for now. Eb (I), Cm (III minor), Gdim (VII diminished), Fm (VI minor), Db6 (that's a Db major with a sixth, which usually implies a Db6 chord). Wait, Db6 is Db major with a sixth note added, so the root is Db.

Now, identifying the key. Since most chords are Eb-based, Eb major or Eb minor are candidates. Let's check the chords in Eb major. The diatonic chords in Eb major would be:

I: Eb
ii: Fm
iii: Gm
IV: Ab
V: Bb
vi: Cm
vii°: Ddim

But looking at the progression, we have Cm, which is the vi chord in Eb major. But we also have Fm, which would be the ii chord in Eb major. However, Fm appears here as Fm/Eb, so the chord is F minor with Eb in the bass. In Eb major, Fm is the ii chord, which is diatonic. Then there's Gdim. In Eb major, the vii° chord is Ddim, not Gdim. Gdim would be out of key. Gdim is G-Bb-Db, so its root is G. In Eb major, G is the third scale degree, but the diatonic chord on G would be Gm, not Gdim. So Gdim isn't from Eb major.

What about Eb minor? The natural minor key of Eb has the same notes as Gb major. Eb natural minor scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. So the diatonic chords:

i: Ebm
ii°: Fdim
III: Gb
iv: Abm
v: Bbm
VI: Cb
VII: Db

But the progression has Eb major chords, not minor. Wait, the first chord is Eb (major), not Ebm. So that might not fit. Unless it's a harmonic minor. Let's check Eb harmonic minor. The harmonic minor raises the 7th, so the scale would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, D. The chords would include:

i: Ebm
ii°: Fdim
III+: Gbaug (since the 3rd is augmented: Gb-Bb-D)
iv: Abm
V: Bb (major, because of the raised 7th D)
VI: Cb
vii°: Ddim

But again, we have Eb major chords here. The progression starts with Eb major, which isn't the tonic in minor keys unless it's a major key with borrowed chords. Maybe it's not a minor key. Perhaps it's a major key but with some modal mixture.

Wait, another approach: look for the most frequent chord. The progression starts and ends with Eb, and it appears many times. So Eb is likely the tonic. Now, checking which key has Eb as tonic. So either Eb major or Eb minor. But since the Eb chords are major (indicated as Eb without a 'm'), it's probably Eb major. But earlier, the chords like Cm and Fm are diatonic to Eb major (vi and ii), but Gdim isn't. Gdim in the context of Eb... what's G relative to Eb? G is the mediant (3rd degree). In major keys, the iii chord is minor, not diminished. So Gm would be diatonic, but Gdim is not. So that's a problem.

Wait, the chord is Gdim/Db. So the Gdim chord with Db in the bass. Gdim is G-Bb-Db, so Db is the fifth of Gdim. Playing Gdim/Db means the bass is Db, which is the same note as C# but enharmonically Db. In terms of function, inverted diminished chords can act as passing chords or dominant substitutes.

Let me look at the chord roots again. Listing all chord roots from the progression:

Eb (x2), Cm (x2), Gdim (x1), Fm (x1), Eb (x2), Cm (x2), Eb (x2), Db6 (x1), Eb (x1)

So roots: Eb, C, G, F, Eb, C, Eb, Db, Eb.

Now, thinking in terms of the circle of fifths or possible keys. If the key is Eb major, then:

- Eb = I
- Cm = vi
- Fm = ii
- Db = ? Db is the flat VII (because in Eb major, the VII would be D, but Db is the flat VII, which is a common borrowed chord from the parallel minor).

Ah, that's a point. Db is a semitone below D, which is the leading tone in Eb major. So Db would be the bVII chord. In rock/pop music, the bVII is often borrowed from the mixolydian mode or the parallel minor.

Also, Gdim – what's G in relation to Eb? G is the third scale degree. In Eb major, the iii chord is G minor. But here it's G diminished. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords, especially vii° of the next chord. Let's see the progression around Gdim/Db: ... Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb ...

So after Gdim/Db comes Fm/Eb. Fm is the ii chord in Eb. So Gdim/Db leading to Fm. Gdim is G-Bb-Db. If the next chord is Fm (F-Ab-C), then the common tones might be Ab (which is G# enharmonically, but Db is the same as C#). Wait, Db is the same as C#, and in F minor, the notes are F, Ab, Cb. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, Gdim could be acting as a secondary dominant. For example, Gdim could be functioning as a vii° of Ab, since Gdim is enharmonically equivalent to Ab diminished seventh (but Gdim is G-Bb-Db, whereas Abdim7 is Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gbb, which is the same as Gdim if we consider enharmonic equivalence in some contexts, but that's stretching). Wait, G#dim7 is G#-B-D-F, but here it's Gdim. Alternatively, maybe Gdim is the vii° of A, but that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps it's the common tone diminished chord. Let me think differently.

Another angle: let's list all the roots and see the scale degrees they imply.

Assuming the key is Eb major:

- Eb = I
- Cm = vi
- Fm = ii
- Db = bVII (since Db is the flat 7th scale degree, as D is natural 7th in Eb major? Wait, Eb major scale is Eb F G Ab Bb C D. So the seventh note is D, natural. So bVII would be Db. Yes, so Db is bVII.
- Gdim: G is the third note in Eb major. The diatonic chord is Gm (iii), but Gdim is not diatonic. However, in harmonic contexts, sometimes the iii chord is altered, but it's uncommon.

But perhaps the key is not major. What if it's C minor? Because we have Cm chords appearing. But the progression starts and ends on Eb. Wait, if the tonic is Eb, then Cm is the vi chord of Eb major. So if it's in Eb major, Cm is vi, Fm is ii, Db is bVII (borrowed from Eb minor), and Gdim... maybe Gdim is a chromatic chord.

Wait, let's consider the entire set of notes used in the progression. Let's list all the chord tones.

Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
Cm: C, Eb, G
Gdim: G, Bb, Db
Fm: F, Ab, C
Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb (since Db6 is Db major triad plus sixth: Db-F-Ab-Bb)

So the notes used:
From Eb: Eb, G, Bb
From Cm: C, Eb, G
From Gdim: G, Bb, Db
From Fm: F, Ab, C
From Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

So compiling all notes: C, Db, Eb, E (wait, no E notes), F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, the notes are: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Missing D? But Db is there. So the scale would be C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Which is the same as the C Phrygian mode. But the progression is centered around Eb. Wait, if we take Eb as the tonic, what mode has these notes?

Eb as tonic. Let's list the scale degrees:

Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Comparing to natural minor: Eb natural minor is Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. So here we have G natural instead of Gb, and C natural instead of Cb. So the third scale degree is G natural (major third), sixth is C natural (major sixth). So the scale would be: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db.

That's the same as the Dorian mode. Because Dorian has a major sixth. Let's check:

Eb Dorian: starting on Eb, but Dorian is the second mode of the major scale. So if Eb is Dorian, then the relative major is Db (since Dorian is ii of major). So Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. Therefore, Eb Dorian would have the notes: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Wait, that's different from what we have. The progression has G natural, not Gb.

Wait, in our note list, we have G natural. So in the chords: Eb major has G natural, Cm has G (which is G natural, since C minor is C-Eb-G). Wait, C minor triad is C-Eb-G. Eb is the minor third of C. So yes, G natural.

So the scale degrees over Eb tonic:

- 1: Eb
- 2: F (from Fm, and the progression)
- b3: ? Eb major chords have G, which is the major third. So the third scale degree is G natural (major third), so it's not minor.
- 4: Ab (from Fm, Cm, Db6)
- 5: Bb (from Eb, Cm, etc.)
- 6: C (from Cm, Fm)
- b7: Db (from Gdim, Db6)

Wait, so the scale would be: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. That's seven notes. Let's number them:

1. Eb
2. F
3. G (major third)
4. Ab (flat fourth? Wait, but in major scales, 4 is natural. In this case, 4 is Ab, which is the natural fourth in Eb major (since Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D). Wait, but here the seventh note is Db instead of D. So D is natural in Eb major, but we have Db here.

So the scale Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db is actually Eb Mixolydian. Because Mixolydian has a flat seventh. Eb Mixolydian is the same as Ab major scale starting on Eb. Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So the Mixolydian mode on Eb would be Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Exactly! So the scale degrees: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, b7.

In this case, the chords:

- Eb: I (major)
- Cm: vi (since in Ab major, Cm is the vi chord? Wait, Ab major diatonic chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim. Wait, so if the key is Ab major, then Eb would be V, Cm would be iii, Fm would be vi, Db would be IV. But our progression is centered on Eb, so maybe the tonic is Eb, which would make it the Mixolydian mode.

Eb Mixolydian scale: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db.

Chords diatonic to Eb Mixolydian:

I: Eb (major)
ii: Fm
iii°: Gdim
IV: Ab
v: Bbm
vi: Cm
bVII: Db

Perfect! Let's check:

- Eb is I
- Cm is vi
- Gdim would be iii° (since G is the third note, Gdim is the diminished triad on iii)
- Fm is ii
- Db (Db6 is built on Db, which is the bVII in Mixolydian) because in Mixolydian, the seventh scale degree is flat, so the chord on bVII is major.

Wait, in the progression, after Gdim/Db comes Fm/Eb. So Gdim is iii°, which in a major key would be minor, but in Mixolydian it's diminished because of the flat seventh affecting the third degree's chord. Wait, let's construct the chords in Eb Mixolydian:

Scale: Eb (1), F (2), G (3), Ab (4), Bb (5), C (6), Db (7b)

Triads:

I: Eb-G-Bb (Eb major)
ii: F-Ab-C (F minor)
iii°: G-Bb-Db (G diminished)
IV: Ab-C-Eb (Ab major)
v: Bb-Db-F (Bb minor)
vi: C-Eb-G (C minor)
bVII: Db-F-Ab (Db major)

Yes! Exactly. So the progression:

Eb (I), Cm (vi), Gdim (iii°), Fm (ii), Db6 (bVII, since Db6 is Db-F-Ab-Bb, which is Db major with the sixth added; Db major is the bVII chord).

And Db6 fits as bVII because the sixth in the chord (Bb) is the fifth scale degree in the Mixolydian mode.

Now, checking the progression again:

Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb

Translating to Roman numerals in Eb Mixolydian:

I I vi vi iii° ii I I vi vi I I bVII I

Yes, that all fits diatonically within Eb Mixolydian. No borrowed chords needed. The Gdim is the natural iii° chord in Mixolydian mode. Fm is ii. Cm is vi. Db is bVII.

Also, the use of slash chords like Cm/Eb emphasizes the bass staying on Eb in some places, but the chord roots are still Cm. Similarly, Gdim/Db has Db in the bass, which is the root of bVII, but the chord is Gdim, which is iii°. However, Gdim/Db is an inversion of Gdim, with Db (the third of Gdim) in the bass. But functionally, it's still the iii° chord.

The progression ends on Db6 followed by Eb, which is a common cadence in Mixolydian: bVII - I.

Therefore, the key is Eb, and the mode is Mixolydian.

Based on the chord progression **Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb**, here's the analysis:

---

### **Key and Mode: Eb Mixolydian**
- **Tonic (I chord): Eb major**  
- **Mode: Mixolydian** (the 5th mode of the major scale, characterized by a **♭7** scale degree).

---

### **Why Eb Mixolydian?**
1. **Scale Structure**:  
   The notes used in the progression align with the **Eb Mixolydian scale**:  
   **Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb – C – Db**  
   - This scale is identical to the **Ab major scale** (Eb Mixolydian = Ab major starting on Eb).  
   - Critical feature: The **♭7 (Db)** replaces the natural leading tone (D) of Eb major, giving Mixolydian its distinctive dominant 7th "vibe."

2. **Diatonic Chord Analysis** (chords built *naturally* on each scale degree in Eb Mixolydian):
   | Scale Degree | Roman Numeral | Chord       | Appears in Progression? |
   |--------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|
   | **1 (Eb)**   | **I**         | **Eb**      | Yes (repeatedly)        |
   | 2 (F)        | ii            | Fm          | Yes (Fm/Eb)             |
   | **3 (G)**    | **iii°**      | **Gdim**    | Yes (Gdim/Db)           |
   | 4 (Ab)       | IV            | Ab          | Not present             |
   | 5 (Bb)       | v             | Bbm         | Not present             |
   | **6 (C)**    | **vi**        | **Cm**      | Yes (Cm/Eb)             |
   | **♭7 (Db)**  | **♭VII**      | **Db**      | Yes (Db6)               |

   - **All chords in your progression fit diatonically** (no borrowed chords needed):  
     - **Eb = I** (tonic, repeated).  
     - **Cm = vi** (common in Mixolydian progressions).  
     - **Gdim = iii°** (a defining trait of Mixolydian *vs.* major, where iii is minor).  
     - **Fm = ii** (standard diatonic chord).  
     - **Db6 = ♭VII** (the hallmark "♭7 chord" of Mixolydian; Db6 adds the 6th/Bb for color).

3. **Harmonic Confirmation**:  
   - The **♭VII (Db) → I (Eb)** cadence (Db6 → Eb) is a signature Mixolydian resolution (e.g., classic rock/blues: "Sweet Child O' Mine," "Norwegian Wood").  
   - **Gdim (iii°)** functioning naturally as a pre-dominant (→ Fm/ii) confirms the ♭7 context (in major keys, iii is minor, not diminished).

---

### **Why Not Other Keys/Modes?**
- **Eb Major?** ❌  
  - Gdim is **not diatonic** to Eb major (where iii = Gm).  
  - Db6 (♭VII) is borrowed from minor, but the progression uses **no other borrowed chords** (e.g., no Bb or Ab chords typical of Eb major).  
  - Gdim here is **diatonic to Mixolydian**, not an alteration.

- **C Minor?** ❌  
  - Progression centers on **Eb**, not Cm.  
  - Eb is the **III chord** in C minor (not tonic), and Db6 is ♭II (uncommon cadence).

- **Eb Dorian?** ❌  
  - Dorian has a **♮6** (C in this case) but also a **♭3** (Gb), while this progression uses **Eb major triads** (G♮ = major 3rd).

---

### **Slash Chords Explained**
- **Cm/Eb**, **Fm/Eb**, **Gdim/Db**: Bass notes emphasize pedal points or smooth voice-leading but **don’t change root functionality**.  
  - Example: **Gdim/Db** = Gdim chord (root G) with Db in bass → still functions as **iii°** (Db is the 3rd of Gdim).

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: Eb (tonic center).  
- **Mode**: **Mixolydian** (due to the ♭7 scale degree/Db, diatonic Gdim, and ♭VII→I resolution).  
- **Signature Sound**: Bluesy, rock-inspired (Mixolydian is ubiquitous in rock/funk due to its dominant 7th flavor without tension for resolution to I).  

This progression **doesn’t “feel minor”** (third is major → G♮), yet avoids the “bright” major sound due to the flattened 7th (Db). Classic Mixolydian! 🎸

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**
Eb – Eb – Cm/Eb – Cm/Eb – Gdim/Db – Fm/Eb – Eb –  
Eb – Cm/Eb – Cm/Eb – Eb – Eb – Db6 – Eb

### Step 1: Identify the Chords
Let’s write out the chords and their **roots and qualities**:

1. **Eb** = E♭ major  
2. **Cm/Eb** = C minor with E♭ in the bass → chord is C minor, root C, but bass is E♭  
3. **Gdim/Db** = G diminished with D♭ in the bass → G diminished = G–B♭–D♭ (same as F♯–A–C), and D♭ = C♯, so this is Gdim with D♭ (enharmonic) in bass → likely functions as a **diminished chord** descending  
4. **Fm/Eb** = F minor with E♭ in the bass → F minor chord, root F, bass E♭  
5. **Db6** = D♭ major 6th: D♭–F–A♭–B♭

So let’s list the **roots** of the chords (ignoring inversions for now):

- Eb (I)
- Cm (vi)
- Cm (vi)
- Gdim (iii°)
- Fm (iv)
- Eb (I)
- Eb
- Cm
- Cm
- Eb
- Eb
- Db6
- Eb

But let’s also note the **bassline** since inversions are given:

Bass notes:  
Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Db – Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Db – Eb

So the bass moves:
- Mostly **Eb**
- Then briefly **Db**, then back to **Eb**

So strong emphasis on **Eb** as tonic, especially at the beginning and end.

### Step 2: Look at Harmonic Function

Now analyze the chords in the key of **Eb major**:
- Eb = **I**
- Cm = **vi**
- Gdim = **iii°**
- Fm = **ii**
- Db6 = D♭–F–A♭–B♭ → this is **bVI6** in Eb major

So in Eb major:
- I: Eb
- vi: Cm
- iii°: Gdim
- ii: Fm
- bVI6: Db6

Wait — Db6 is **not diatonic** to Eb major.  
In Eb major, the VI chord is C minor, not Db. D♭ is **flat VI** — so **bVI**, which is borrowed from the **parallel minor**.

So Db is bVI in **Eb minor**, but here it’s a **major 6th chord (Db6)** — D♭–F–A♭–B♭.

But in **Eb minor**, the VI chord is C♭ (not practical), but enharmonically D♭ might be used. However, **F** is not in Eb natural minor — Eb minor is: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db.

So **F natural** appears in Db6 — that’s not in Eb natural minor.

But in **Eb Dorian**, we have:  
Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db

Still no **F natural chord with F major**.

Wait — Db6 contains: D♭, F, A♭, B♭  
That’s: 1, 3, 5, 6 of Db

So Db major 6th chord — but Db major is not in Eb major or minor.

But Db is the **flat VI degree** in **E major**, but not relevant.

Alternatively, maybe **Cm6**? No — it’s written as **Db6**, which is different.

Wait — could this be a **German augmented sixth chord**?

German 6th in Eb:  
A German augmented sixth in **Eb** would have: G♭ (F), A♭, B, D♭ — resolves to Eb.

But Db6 = Db–F–Ab–Bb → that's **Db–F–Ab–Bb** = 1–3–5–6 — that’s actually the **same as a Bb7 in first inversion?**

Wait:

Bb7 = Bb–D–F–Ab  
But Db6 = Db–F–Ab–Bb → that’s **Db–F–Ab–Bb**

Rearranged: Bb–Db–F–Ab → that’s **Bb7** without the D (has Db instead). Db is enharmonic to C#, not D.

No — Db is **not** D. So it's **Bb–Db–F–Ab** = intervals: Bb–Db (m3), Db–F (M3), F–Ab (m3) → so **Bb–Db–F–Ab** = **Bb minor 7**? No — Bb to F is a **diminished fifth** (Bb–F = tritone), but Bb–F is actually a **P5** in equal temperament, just spelled as augmented fourth if needed.

Wait: Bb to F is a perfect fifth.
Db to F is a major third.
F to Ab is a minor third.

So Bb–Db–F–Ab = Bb **half-diminished?** No: Bb–Db = m3, Db–F = M3, F–Ab = m3 → stacked: m3, M3, m3 = **minor 7th chord on Bb?**

But Bb minor 7 is Bb–Db–F–Ab → yes, exactly.

Wait — Db6 = Db–F–Ab–Bb → same notes as Bb–Db–F–Ab → that’s **Bbm7** in third inversion.

So **Db6 ≡ Bbm7/Cb?** In third inversion: Bbm7 with Bb on top? No, bass is Db.

- Chord: Db6 in bass = Db
- Notes: Db, F, Ab, Bb → so that’s **Db6**
- But enharmonically, it's the **same pitches** as Bb7(b5)? No.

Actually, **Db6** is its own thing: a Db major triad with a 6th (Bb). So it's **not** a dominant 7 chord.

But here's a thought: in **Bb minor**, the iv chord is Ebm — no.

Alternatively, could this be a **Neapolitan chord**?

In **Eb major**, the Neapolitan is **Fb**, not Db.

But in **C minor**, the Neapolitan is **Db**.

Wait — let's consider **C minor**.

In **C minor**, the Neapolitan is **Db major**, often in first inversion (N6), and it leads to the dominant (G or G7), resolving to C minor.

But here, we have **Db6**, then **Eb** — so **Db6 → Eb**

That could be **N → I**, if in **C minor**.

But the final chord is **Eb**, not C minor.

But the progression ends on **Eb**, and starts on **Eb** — so Eb feels like **tonic**.

But the chord **Db6 → Eb** — that's like **bII → I**, which is the **Neapolitan resolution** — very common in **minor keys**.

So **Db major → Eb major** = **bII → I**, which is the **Neapolitan resolving to tonic**, a very strong cadence in **Eb minor**.

Ah! So that suggests the key is **Eb minor**, not Eb major.

Let’s test that.

### Try: Key of **Eb minor**

Eb natural minor:
- Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db

But we have chords:
- Eb: i
- Cm: ♭VI (since Cb would be normal VI, so C natural = ♯VI? No — C minor is **not diatonic to Eb minor**)
- In Eb minor: the VI chord is **Cb major** — but we have **C minor** = C–Eb–G — but C is not in Eb minor (has Cb), so C natural is chromatic.

Wait — perhaps **C harmonic minor**?

Hold on — maybe the key is **C minor**, and **Eb is the relative major?**

No — the progression starts and ends on Eb.

But let’s look at the **most common root movement**:

Chord roots:
Eb → Cm → Cm → Gdim → Fm → Eb → Eb → Cm → Cm → Eb → Eb → Db6 → Eb

So root movement:
Eb ← Cm ← Gdim ← Fm ← Eb

The sequence: Gdim → Fm → Eb

Gdim = G–Bb–Db  
Fm = F–Ab–C  
Eb = Eb–G–Bb

Is there a functional progression?

Gdim to Fm: roots move down by major second — not standard.

Fm to Eb: root down by semitone — common in minor: iv–bIII–bII–I

Wait — in **Eb minor**, the common borrowed chords:
- bIII = Gb major
- bVI = Cb major
- bII = Db major (Neapolitan)
- iv = Ab minor

But we have:
- Fm = **iv** in **C minor**
- Cm = **i** in C minor
- Eb = **bIII** in C minor
- Gdim = **ii°** in C harmonic minor
- Db6 = bII in C minor? No — bII in C minor is Db major — but we are in Eb?

Wait — let's try **C minor**.

In **C minor**:
- Cm = i
- Eb = III (major, from harmonic or melodic minor)
- Fm = iv
- Gdim = ii°
- Db = bII = Neapolitan

So progression becomes:
Eb – Eb – Cm – Cm – Gdim – Fm – Eb – Eb – Cm – Cm – Eb – Eb – Db6 – Eb

In C minor:
- Eb = **III**
- Cm = **i**
- Gdim = **ii°**
- Fm = **iv**
- Db6 = **bII6**
- Back to Eb = **III**

But it ends on **Eb**, not Cm.

So it starts with **III**, goes to **i**, **ii°**, **iv**, **III**, then to **bII** (Neapolitan), then back to **III**

But doesn’t end on tonic — ends on **III**, which is **Eb**

So if it ends and starts on **Eb**, and doesn’t resolve to Cm, then **Cm can't be the tonic**.

Thus, **Eb is the tonic**, and it's **Eb minor**, because:

- **Db6 → Eb** = **bII → i** = Neapolitan to tonic — a **very strong cadence in minor keys**
- **Fm** = iv in Eb minor
- **Cm** = VI (but in minor, bVI is Cb — so C minor is **not diatonic**)
- **Gdim** = iii° in Eb minor? Eb minor: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db → G is not in scale — G natural is raised

Wait — Gdim = G–Bb–Db

In **Eb harmonic minor**, we raise the 7th: D natural.

But G is not in Eb harmonic minor — chords built on 3rd degree: Gb–Bb–Db = Gb major

No G natural.

But **Gdim** could be **a diminished chord leading to Gb or Ab**, but not directly.

Alternatively, is **Gdim** a passing chord between Cm and Fm?

Cm = C–Eb–G  
Gdim = G–Bb–Db  
Fm = F–Ab–C

Notice:
- Cm → Gdim: shares G
- Gdim → Fm: voice leading — G to F? Bb to Ab? Db to C? Not strong.

Perhaps **Gdim** is functioning as a **common-tone diminished chord**?

Or perhaps it’s **vii° of Ab**? vii° of Ab is G–Bb–Db — yes, Gdim is **vii° of Ab**, which is the IV in Eb.

But we go **Gdim → Fm**, not Ab.

Fm is **iv** in Eb.

So not supporting that.

Alternative idea: **Modal mixture**.

Back to **Eb minor**:

Suppose the key is **Eb minor**, but using **borrowed chords**.

We have:
- Eb = i
- Cm = ?? (this is tricky — in Eb minor, C natural is ♯VI — not typical)
- But Cm is **VI** in **G minor**? Not helpful.

Wait — perhaps **relative key**.

Cm is the **relative minor of Eb major**.

Ah! Here’s a better idea:

### Try: **Key of Eb major**

Eb major:  
Cm = vi  
Fm = ii  
Gdim = iii°  
Db6 = bVI6 → borrowed from **Eb minor**

So the progression:
- I (Eb)
- vi (Cm)
- iii° (Gdim)
- ii (Fm)
- I (Eb)
- then later: bVI6 (Db6) → I (Eb)

The **bVI → I** move is a **common modal mixture** (from minor), often called a **backdoor progression** — in fact, **bVII → I** is more common (e.g., Ab → Eb), but **bVI → I** also occurs in modal mixture.

But Db is **not** bVII — bVII in Eb is Db? No:

Eb major:
- bVII = Db major? No — VII is D diminished, bVII is Db major — yes: Db major is **bVII**

Wait! **Db major is bVII in Eb major**, not bVI.

Let’s clarify:

In **Eb major**:
- I = Eb
- ii = Fm
- iii = Gm
- IV = Ab
- V = Bb
- vi = Cm
- vii° = Ddim

So:
- **Db major = Db–F–Ab–Bb** (in Db6) — so **Db major triad + Bb**

Db major is **not diatonic to Eb major** — but it **is** the **bVII chord**?

bVII in Eb: flat the 7th scale degree: D → Db

So **bVII = Db major**

Yes! So in **Eb major**, you can borrow **bVII** from the **parallel minor**, and it’s very common (e.g., in rock: I–bVII–IV–I)

So **Db6** is **bVII6**, which is the **flat seventh chord**, and **Db6 → Eb** is a **plagal or backdoor-type cadence**, very common.

Also, **bVII → I** is a strong cadence in rock and pop.

Moreover, **Cm/Eb** = vi chord in first inversion — very common in I–vi–ii–V or similar.

So progression:
- I → vi → vi → iii° → ii → I → I → vi → vi → I → I → bVII6 → I

Yes — all makes sense in **Eb major**, with modal mixture.

The **Gdim** is diatonic (iii°) — often used as a passing chord.

**Cm** is vi — common

**Fm** is ii — standard

**bVII (Db)** borrowed from minor — very common

So the **key is Eb major**

### Mode = Major (Ionian)

### Final Answer:

**Key: Eb major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

Let me confirm the Db6 → Eb:  
- Db6 (bVII6) → I = common in pop/rock — e.g., “Get Back” by Beatles, “Losing My Religion” by R.E.M., etc.

Yes.

Even though Cm/Eb and the prominence of Cm might suggest relative minor, the **tonic chord is Eb**, which starts, ends, and appears most frequently — and the cadence **bVII → I** is a strong indicator of major key with modal borrowing.

### ✅ Conclusion:
**Key: Eb major**  
**Mode: Major (Ionian)**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chords: Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at the chords and their bass notes. The notation uses slashes, like Cm/Eb, which means a C minor chord with Eb in the bass. So the actual notes for each chord would be:

- Eb: just Eb major? Wait, but chords without a third specified might be ambiguous, but usually in this context, it's probably Eb major. But let's check all.

Wait, Eb alone – without a suffix, it's often assumed to be dominant or major. But in many contexts, especially jazz or modern harmony, just "Eb" could mean Eb major. But sometimes it could be something else. I should list all chords properly.

Let's list each chord:

1. Eb – likely Eb major (E♭-G-B♭)
2. Eb – same as above
3. Cm/Eb – C minor with Eb bass, so notes C-Eb-G with Eb in bass? Wait, no. Cm/Eb means the chord is C minor, but the bass note is Eb. So the chord is C-Eb-G, but the lowest note is Eb. So the notes are Eb, C, G. Which is actually an Ebmaj7? Wait, no. C minor chord with Eb bass: the intervals would be Eb (root?), but the chord is C minor. So the bass note is Eb, which is the minor third of C minor. So Cm/Eb is a first inversion of C minor. Similarly:

Cm/Eb: Bass note Eb, chord is C minor. So notes: Eb (bass), then C and G. So the chord consists of Eb, C, G. Which is the same as Eb6? Wait, Eb major chord is Eb-G-Bb. But here, Eb, C, G – that's Eb, G, C. Wait, the order doesn't matter. So Eb, G, C. But C is above G. So Eb, G, C. That's the same as C minor with Eb in bass, or Eb major flat 6? Wait, Eb major chord has G and Bb. But here we have Eb, G, C. So there's a C instead of Bb. So that's not Eb major. Eb, G, C – that's Ebm6? Wait, no. C is the 6th of Eb? Eb to C is a minor 6th? Wait, Eb to C is 9 half steps, which is a minor 6th? Wait, no: Eb to C: Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, Bb, B, C. Wait, that's 10 half steps? Wait, let's count properly. From Eb to C:

Eb to E: 1, E to F: 2, F to F#: 3, F# to G:4, G to G#:5, G# to A:6, A to A#:7, A# to B:8, B to C:9. So yes, 9 half steps, which is a minor 6th? No: minor 6th is 8 half steps, major 6th is 9. Because minor 6th from C to Ab is 8 steps, major 6th C to A is 9. So from Eb to C: Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, Bb, B, C – wait, Eb to C is actually 9 semitones, which is a major 6th. Because major 6th is 9 semitones. For example, C to A is 9 semitones.

But in terms of chord names: Eb, G, C. The notes are Eb, G, C. Let's sort them: C, Eb, G. That's a C minor triad, with the bass being Eb. So yes, Cm/Eb. So the chord is C minor first inversion.

Similarly, Gdim/Db: G diminished, bass Db. Gdim is G-Bb-Db. If bass is Db, then notes Db, G, Bb. Which is Db diminished? Wait, Gdim is G, Bb, Db. So Db is the diminished fifth of G? Yes, because G to Db is a diminished 5th. So Gdim chord has Db as the fifth. If we put Db in the bass, then the notes are Db, G, Bb. But a diminished chord with root Db would be Db, Fb, Abb? No, better to think of Gdim chord as G, Bb, Db. So when played with Db in bass, the notes are Db-G-Bb. That's a Db diminished triad? Db diminished is Db-Fb-Abb, but usually written as Dbdim. But Db diminished is same as Bdim or something else. Maybe it's an inversion.

But perhaps better to list all chord tones.

Let me list each chord with their full notes:

1. Eb: Likely Eb major (Eb, G, Bb)
2. Eb: same
3. Cm/Eb: C minor chord (C, Eb, G) with bass Eb → notes: Eb, C, G (so C, Eb, G; the bass is Eb)
4. Cm/Eb: same as above
5. Gdim/Db: G diminished chord is G, Bb, Db. With Db bass → Db, G, Bb. (so Db, G, Bb. Which is a Db diminished triad? Db is root, then minor 3rd is Fb (E), diminished 5th is C. Wait, Gdim chord: G to Bb is minor 3rd, Bb to Db is minor 3rd, so G to Db is dim5. So Gdb is G, Bb, Db. When Db is bass, the chord is Db, G, Bb. So Db root: Db, Fb (but usually written as E), G? Wait, no. Diminished triad with root Db would be Db, Fb, Abb. But actually, the Gdim is the same as Bdim and Dbdim? Let's see. Gdim is G-Bb-Db. Which is equivalent to Db dim: Db-Fb-Abb (but Abb is G). So yes, same notes. So Gdim/Db is Db diminished chord, root Db. But chord symbols might be written as Gdim with Db bass.

6. Fm/Eb: F minor chord (F, Ab, C) with Eb bass → notes Eb, F, Ab, C? Wait, Fm is F, Ab, C. If bass is Eb, then the notes are Eb, F, Ab, C. But Eb is the bass note, then the chord is Eb-F-Ab-C. So the chord would be Eb minor seventh? Or maybe a Fm7? Because F, Ab, C, Eb is Fm7. Yes! So Fm/Eb is F minor 7th with Eb in the bass, which would be a common jazz chord. So Fm7 = F, Ab, C, Eb. So if bass is Eb, then it's Fm7/Eb, but usually written as Fm/Eb to indicate the bass note. So the full chord is Eb in bass, with Fm7 above it. So yes, the chord consists of Eb, F, Ab, C. Which is Fm7 in first inversion? Or actually, since Eb is the bass, the notes are Eb, F, Ab, C. So root would be Eb? But Eb-F-Ab-C would be Eb, F minor third? No, Eb to F is major second. So maybe this is a F minor 7th chord with Eb bass. But that's correct.

7. Eb: again, Eb major
8. Eb: same
9. Cm/Eb: C minor with Eb bass
10. Cm/Eb: same
11. Eb: same
12. Eb: same
13. Db6: Db 6th chord. Db6 is usually Db, F, Ab, B. Wait, Db major with added 6th. Db6 chord: Db, F, Ab, B. Because the 6th above Db is Bb? Wait, Db to Bb is a minor 6th, but Db6 usually means Db major 6th chord: Db, F, Ab, Bb? Wait, no. Wait, major 6th chord: root, major 3rd, perfect 5th, major 6th. So Db major 6th: Db - F (major 3rd), Ab (perfect 5th), and Bb (major 6th). Wait, Db to Bb is 9 semitones, which is a minor 6th. Wait, no. Db to B: Db to D (1), D to D# (2), D# to E (3), etc. Wait, Db to B: from Db up a minor sixth would be Bbb? No, this is confusing.

Let's clarify: In Db major scale, notes are Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb. No, that's not right. Standard Db major scale: Db - Eb - F - Gb - Ab - Bb - C - Db. So the scale degrees: 1 Db, 2 Eb, 3 F, 4 Gb, 5 Ab, 6 Bb, 7 C.

So Db major 6th chord would be root (Db), major 3rd (F), perfect 5th (Ab), major 6th (Bb). Yes, because from Db to Bb is a minor 6th? Wait, Db to Bb: the interval is 10 semitones, which is a minor 6th. Because 10 semitones: half steps from Db to Bb: Db to D (1), D to D# (2), D# to E (3), E to F (4), F to F# (5), F# to G (6), G to G# (7), G# to A (8), A to A# (9), A# to Bb (10). Yes, 10 semitones. But a perfect fifth is 7 semitones, minor sixth is 8 semitones? Wait, no. Let's list intervals by semitones:

- Minor 2nd: 1
- Major 2nd: 2
- Minor 3rd: 3
- Major 3rd: 4
- Perfect 4th: 5
- Tritone: 6
- Perfect 5th: 7
- Minor 6th: 8
- Major 6th: 9
- Minor 7th: 10
- Major 7th: 11
- Octave: 12

Wait, Db to Bb: let's count the semitones. From Db to Bb:

Db - D (1), D - D# (2), D# - E (3), E - F (4), F - F# (5), F# - G (6), G - G# (7), G# - A (8), A - A# (9), A# - Bb (10). So yes, 10 semitones. But according to the above list, minor 7th is 10 semitones. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, the major 7th from Db is C (Db to C is 11 semitones). Minor 7th is 10 semitones, so Db to Bb is 10 semitones, which is a minor 7th. So Db to Bb is minor seventh.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's take another example. From C to Bb is a minor 7th (10 semitones). C to B is major 7th (11). So yes, Db to Bb is a minor 7th. So why would Db6 include Bb? That doesn't make sense. Wait, Db major 6th chord: root Db, major third F (4 semitones), perfect fifth Ab (7), and major sixth should be Bb? No. Db to Bb is minor seventh. The major sixth above Db would be B? Because Db to B: Db to B is 10 semitones? Wait, Db to B. Let's count: Db, D (1), D# (2), E (3), F (4), F# (5), G (6), G# (7), A (8), A# (9), B (10). Wait, that's 10 semitones. Wait, so Db to B is a minor 7th? But in major scale, the 6th should be a major 6th interval above root. For Db major scale, the 6th scale degree is Bb, right? Because Db major scale is Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So yes, the 6th is Bb. But Db to Bb is a minor 6th? Wait, no. Wait, interval names: from Db to Bb. Let's use the diatonic scale. In Db major, the 6th note is Bb. So the interval from Db to Bb is a sixth. How many semitones? From Db to Bb: as before, 10 semitones. But for a sixth interval, major sixth is 9 semitones. Wait, for example, C to A: 9 semitones (C to A natural), which is a major sixth. C to Ab is minor sixth (8 semitones). So Db to Bb: Db, Eb (2), F (4), Gb (5), Ab (7), Bb (9 semitones). Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Db up a major sixth: Db to Bb? Let's see, starting at Db:

Db to Eb: 2 semitones (major second)

Eb to F: 2 more (total 4)

F to Gb: 1 (5)

Gb to Ab: 2 (7)

Ab to Bb: 2 (9 semitones). So Db to Bb is 9 semitones. Ah, right! So from Db to Bb is 9 semitones: yes, that's a major sixth. Because:

For C major, C to A is A major sixth. From C to A: C(0), C#(1), D(2), D#(3), E(4), F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9). Yes, 9 semitones. So Db to Bb would be same: Db to Bb is 9 semitones. Let's count again: Db (0), D(1), D#(2), E(3), F(4), F#(5), G(6), G#(7), A(8), Bb(9). Yes, 9 semitones. So Db to Bb is major sixth. Therefore, Db6 chord is Db - F (major 3rd) - Ab (perfect 5th) - Bb (major 6th). Yes.

So Db6 chord notes: Db, F, Ab, Bb.

Then the last chord is Eb.

So now, let's list all the chords with their actual notes:

1. Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
2. Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
3. Cm/Eb: C, Eb, G with Eb bass → so notes Eb, C, G (but order doesn't matter, so C, Eb, G)
4. Same as above
5. Gdim/Db: G diminished chord (G, Bb, Db) with Db bass → Db, G, Bb
6. Fm/Eb: F, Ab, C with Eb bass → Eb, F, Ab, C (so Fm7 chord with Eb bass; Fm7 is F, Ab, C, Eb)
7. Eb major
8. Eb major
9. Cm/Eb
10. Cm/Eb
11. Eb major
12. Eb major
13. Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb
14. Eb major

Wait, the user listed "Db6 Eb" at the end, so 13th chord is Db6 and 14th is Eb.

Now, looking at all these chords: Eb major, Cm/Eb (which is C minor), Gdim/Db (which is G diminished but bass Db), Fm/Eb (which is F minor 7th), Db6, and repeated Eb.

So maybe the chords are in a progression that has Eb as tonic. Let's think in terms of keys.

Possible keys: let's list all the notes in each chord.

Eb major: E♭, G, B♭

Cm/Eb: C, E♭, G

Gdim/Db: G, Bb, Db → notes G, Bb, Db

Fm/Eb: Eb, F, Ab, C → F, Ab, C, Eb

Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

And Eb again.

So let's list all the notes appearing in all the chords:

Eb major has Eb, G, Bb

Cm/Eb has C, Eb, G

Gdim/Db has G, Bb, Db

Fm/Eb has Eb, F, Ab, C

Db6 has Db, F, Ab, Bb

So compiling all notes:

From Eb: E♭, G, B♭

Cm/Eb: C, E♭, G

Gdim/Db: G, Bb, Db

Fm/Eb: E♭, F, Ab, C

Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

So combining all, the notes present are:

Eb, Bb, G, C, D♭, F, A♭

Wait, D♭ and G is already there? Let's list all unique pitches:

- C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Wait, that's all seven notes of Db major scale! Because Db major scale is Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Wait, but in our list we have G instead of Gb? Let's see. The chords have G, which is natural G. But Db major scale has Gb (double flat? No, Db major scale:

Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

Wait, Gb? So the 4th scale degree is Gb. But in our chords, we have G natural. So if there's a G natural, that doesn't fit into Db major, which has Gb.

Hmm. So maybe not Db major. Wait, but Db6 has Db, F, Ab, Bb – which are all in Db major. Fm/Eb is F, Ab, C, Eb – C is in Db major (C is the 7th of Db). Eb is 2nd scale degree. Ab is 5th. Bb is 6th. So Db scale has Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So all notes except G (natural). But we have G in Gdim chord and Cm/Eb.

So G natural here. That would mean that there's a note not in Db major. So perhaps another key.

Wait, Eb major scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Wait, no. Eb major is Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

Wait, that's important. Eb major scale:

Root Eb

2nd F

3rd G

4th Ab

5th Bb

6th C

7th D

Octave Eb.

So Eb major has G natural, not Gb. So yes, G is in Eb major. Let's check.

Eb major: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

Yes. So G natural is part of Eb major. So let's see all the notes from chords:

From above:

Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. But wait, Db is the note D flat. Wait, in Eb major, the scale is Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So D natural. But Db is a flattened D. So we have Db there?

Yes, in the Gdim/Db chord: Db is part of the notes. Wait, Gdim chord is G, Bb, Db. So Db is present. But in Eb major scale, is Db present? Eb major's notes are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So D natural, but Db would be a flat of D. So Db is not in Eb major scale. So Db is not in Eb major.

But Db also appears in the Db6 chord. So Db is present. So if the key is Eb, then Db would be a chromatic note. But maybe the key is Db major? But Db major has Gb, not G natural. But we have G natural in Cm/Eb and Gdim.

Wait, Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So Gb, not G. So G natural is not part of Db major. So that's a clash. So perhaps it's Eb minor? Or some other mode.

Wait, let's list all the pitches used:

From the chords:

- C

- Db

- Eb

- F

- G

- Ab

- Bb

So the notes present are: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

That's seven pitches. Let's see which key this could be.

Looking at the notes:

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, how many accidentals? Db and Eb are flats.

Let's list all notes in order:

Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C.

Wait, that sort of makes sense. Let's check Db major: as mentioned, Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C. But here, we have G natural instead of Gb. So G natural is not in Db major.

What about C minor? Let's see. C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! C natural minor (Aeolian mode of Eb major or Bb major). Let's confirm.

C minor scale:

C (root), D (m2), Eb (m3), F (P4), G (P5), Ab (m6), Bb (m7), C.

Yes! Perfect. Notes in C minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

But wait, in the chord list, we have Db as well. Db is a chromatic note here. Wait, in the Gdim/Db chord, Db is present. So Gdim chord has G, Bb, Db. Db is the diminished fifth of G. So Db is part of the chord.

Wait, but in C minor scale, there is no Db. The notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

But Db is not in C minor. So there is a Db here. So that suggests maybe not.

Wait, but perhaps the key is Bb major? Let's see. Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab.

But again, we have Db, which isn't in Bb major. Bb major has no Db.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Eb major.

Eb major: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

We have in our chords: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So Db is not in Eb major; Eb major has D natural. So Db would be a chromatic note here, or perhaps a borrowed mode.

Wait, let's consider the chords again. Maybe the key is Eb minor? Eb minor scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb (which is A), Cb, Db. Hmm, not sure. Eb natural minor (Aeolian) would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. Wait, Cb is B natural? No, C flat would be B, but that's not standard. Natural minor from Eb would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. But Cb is spelled as B natural in practical terms? But usually, it's spelled as Bb for Eb minor? No, better to write the exact notes.

Eb natural minor: E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭. Wait, no. Natural minor scale is based on the relative major. Eb minor's relative major is Gb major? Actually, Eb minor uses its own natural scale. The natural minor scale of Eb has the same notes as Gb major. Let's clarify.

Key of Eb minor:

The natural minor scale of Eb is: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db.

But Cb is B, and Db is Db. But usually, when written, it's Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, B, Db? No, better to use correct spellings. Cb is the same as B natural, but that's not standard. The correct spelling for Eb minor scale is Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db – where Cb is B, but written as Cb.

But in practice, this might be tricky. Alternatively, Eb harmonic minor would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, D. Or natural minor has Cb and Db.

But let's see if the chords fit into Eb minor.

If key is Eb minor, then the scale is Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db.

Wait, but in our chords we have G natural. But Eb minor has Gb. So G natural is a chromatic note here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the key is Ab major? Let's check Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes! Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Ah! Let's see:

Ab major scale: A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G.

That's the seven notes. Now, check all chords:

Look at chord Gdim/Db: Db is in Ab major (D♭), yes.

G natural is part of Ab major. Yes, the 7th degree is G natural.

F is in Ab major.

Eb is 5th degree.

C is 3rd.

Bb is 2nd.

Ab is tonic.

So Ab major scale includes all the pitches we have:

Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes.

Now, let's confirm each chord:

- Eb major: Eb is the 5th of Ab major. So Eb major chord would be V7? Wait, Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. But Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. Which is not part of the Ab major diatonic chords. Ab major diatonic chords: I (Ab), ii (Bb), iii (Cm), IV (Db), V (Eb), V7 is Eb minor? No. Let's list Ab major chords:

I: Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)

ii: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

iii: C minor (C, Eb, G)

IV: Db major (Db, F, Ab)

V: Eb major (Eb, G, Bb)

vi: F minor (F, Ab, C)

vii°: G diminished (G, Bb, Db)

Oh! Wait a minute. Yes! This looks promising.

Let's see:

- Eb major chord (in Ab major, Eb is the V chord: V chord is Eb major, yes. Because in Ab major scale, the V chord is built on Eb: Eb, G, Bb. Yes, that's correct.)

- Gdim: that's the vii° chord in Ab major. Yes, G diminished triad: G, Bb, Db. Exactly what we have. And in the chord list, it's Gdim/Db. Which is Gdim chord with Db bass, which makes sense as the triad is G Bb Db.

- Fm/Eb: F minor chord with Eb bass. In Ab major scale, F minor is the vi chord. Fm with Eb bass? Fm chord is F, Ab, C. Adding Eb makes it Fm7, which is a common chord. The Fm7 chord is diatonic to Ab major? Let's see: The vi chord is F minor (F, Ab, C), so Fm7 would be F, Ab, C, Eb, which is diatonic because Eb is the 7th degree of F minor? Wait, in the key of Ab, F is vi, so Fm7 would be built from the 6th degree: in Ab major, the vi chord is F minor, Fm7 would have notes F, Ab, C, Eb. And Eb is the b7 of the F minor scale? No, in Ab major, the note Eb is the 5th of the scale. So Fm7 chord (F, Ab, C, Eb) is diatonic to Ab major.

- Db6: Db major 6th chord. In Ab major, Db is the IV chord. Db major chord is Db, F, Ab. Db6 would add the 6th (Bb), but wait, Db6 chord is Db, F, Ab, Bb. Bb is a chord tone. In Ab major, yes, Bb is part of the scale. So Db6 chord: Db, F, Ab, Bb. Diatonic. So IV chord with added 6th? Or in Ab major, the IV chord is Db major. Adding the 6th (Bb), which is the 7th of Db. So that's a Db6 chord, which is a common extension.

- Also, Eb major chord occurs frequently, which is V in Ab major.

Now, the other chords: Cm/Eb. In Ab major, C minor is the iii chord. Cm/Eb is first inversion of Cm (C, Eb, G), with Eb bass. So Eb is part of the C minor chord. Yes.

So putting this together, all chords appear to be diatonic to Ab major.

Let's list all chords in Ab major:

I: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gdim

So in the given progression:

- Eb: V

- Eb: V

- Cm/Eb: iii chord with Eb bass? Or iii chord first inversion. But Cm is iii, yes.

- Gdim/Db: vii° chord (Gdim), with Db bass. So it's a diminished triad. Db is the 5th degree of the Gdim chord.

- Fm/Eb: vi chord with Eb bass. So Fm is vi, and Eb as bass note. This could be a vi7? Fm7.

- Then repeated Eb (V), Cm/Eb again (iii), and finally Db6.

Now Db6 in Ab major is IV chord with added 6th. Because IV chord is Db. Adding the 6th (Bb) would make it Db6, which is Db-F-Ab-Bb. Yes.

So the chords all fit into Ab major.

But wait, the user listed the chord sequence as "Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb"

So let's check if all these chords are in Ab major:

- Eb: V chord

- Cm/Eb: iii chord (C minor), first inversion

- Gdim/Db: vii° chord, with Db bass

- Fm/Eb: vi chord, which is F minor 7th if we consider the Eb bass (since Fm with Eb in bass is Fm7 inversion)

- Db6: IV6 chord (Db with added 6th)

Yes, all these diatonic.

Now, the key signature of Ab major has 4 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. So four flats.

But wait, the chord Db6 – that's Db major, which is the IV chord. But Db6 in Ab major is fine. All good.

Now, what about the mode? The question is to find key and mode. If it's Ab major, then it's the Ionian mode. But let's confirm.

Wait, but sometimes the key might not be Ab major. Maybe Eb major? But in Eb major, there's a G natural, yes, but then Db isn't in Eb major. Wait, Ab major's key signature is 4 flats, which includes Db.

Yes.

Another way: Let's check the final chord. It ends with Db6 followed by Eb. So Db6 to Eb. That could be IV to V in Ab major.

Yes, in Ab major, IV-Db, V-Eb. So that progression makes sense.

Also, if the song ends on Eb, which would be the V chord, that's not typical to end on V. But sometimes it does. However, if the whole progression is centered around Ab.

Wait, but the last chord is Eb, so maybe it's not the tonic. Let's see the starting chord: starts on Eb. So maybe Eb minor? But then G natural might be confusing.

But according to diatonic chords in Ab major, Eb acts as V chord, so if the progression ends on Eb, that could be a V chord in Ab, which is common for a half cadence.

So the key is Ab major, and the mode is Ionian. But sometimes key and mode refer to the same thing in major.

But maybe it's in Eb minor? Let's see.

If key is Eb minor, which is Aeolian mode of Gb major.

Eb minor scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db

But then, the chords: Gdim/Db: but Gdim would be G, Bb, Db. In Eb minor, the vii° chord is Db diminished? Wait, Eb minor scale: degrees are 1 Eb, 2 F, 3 Gb, 4 Ab, 5 Bb, 6 Cb, 7 Db.

So the vii° chord would be built on Db? No, in natural minor, the vii° chord is on the seventh scale degree, which is Db. But Db diminished triad: Db, Fb, Abb. Not matching. Hmm.

Whereas in Ab major, as we saw, the vii° is Gdim.

So it seems more logical that the key is Ab major.

Another check: common chords.

For instance, Fm/Eb – in Ab major, that's a vi chord with 7th. The presence of Fm (vi) and Eb (V) suggests Ab is the tonic.

Also, Cm/Eb – iii chord is C minor.

Gdim is vii°.

So I think key is Ab major.

Wait, but what about the Db6 chord? Db6 is IV chord in Ab major. IV chord is Db major. Db6 adds a major 6th (Bb), which is a common extension. So yes.

But let's see the order of chords:

Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb

So starting on V (Eb), then Cm/Eb (iii), Gdim/Db (vii°), Fm/Eb (vi), which is common progression. Like V - iii - vii° - vi, etc.

In the key of Ab major, yes.

So yes, this progression is built on Ab major chords. So the key is Ab major, mode is Ionian.

But to confirm, let's see if any chord requires a note outside Ab major. The chords have Db, which is in Ab major. G natural is there. All other notes are Ab major. Yes.

Another angle: Let's see the final Db6 to Eb. In Ab major, that's IV to V, which is very common.

So the answer should be key of Ab major, mode Ionian.

But wait, sometimes people refer to mode as the mode of the starting chord. But in this context, the key is Ab major.

Alternatively, perhaps the piece is in Eb minor? Let's see.

If the tonic were Eb minor, then the chords:

Eb minor has scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db.

But note Cb would be B natural. But in the chords, we have C? In Cm/Eb, which is C minor chord. In Eb minor's scale, is there a C? The sixth scale degree is Cb (Bb?), wait.

Eb natural minor: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. So Cb (B natural?), but it's written as Cb. The presence of C (natural) would not be in that scale. Because Cb is B. So if there's a C natural, that's not in Eb minor. So the C note in Cm/Eb would be a chord note, but in Eb minor, the scale has Cb (B) as the sixth degree, but the notes of Cm would need to be C, Eb, G. If the scale has B and Gb, then C natural is not in the scale. So that would be non-diatonic. But in Ab major, it's diatonic because C is the third degree.

Yes, so this confirms that Ab major is the better fit.

So the key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

Alternatively, sometimes key is referred to by its tonic, but in this case, the chord progression is centered around Ab, even if it starts on V.

But usually, the key is determined by the tonic chord. Even though the progression starts on V, if the tonic is Ab, then the key is Ab major.

Another check: Db6 is a major key IV chord, which fits into Ab major. If it were Eb minor, Db6 would be... ?

Eb minor: Db would be the bVII chord. But Db6 in Eb minor would be non-diatonic. So probably not.

So yes, I think the key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

But wait, another perspective: the presence of a C minor chord (third chord) – in Ab major, iii chord is C minor. Yes.

Gdim – vii° chord in Ab.

So all good.

Final conclusion: key of Ab major, mode Ionian.

But sometimes people say "in the key of Ab" which implies major ionian.

So yes, the key is Ab major. Mode is Ionian.

Alternatively, if they ask for mode, it's Ionian.

But maybe the key is Eb, but that seems less likely.

Wait, wait. Wait a second: what about Gdim/Db chord? If key is Ab major, Gdim is the diminished chord from the 7th degree. But Gdim chord in Ab major is G-Bb-Db. Yes. In Ab major's key, the seventh scale degree is G? No: Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes, seventh note is G. So G is the seventh scale degree. So G diminished would be built on G: G, Bb, Db. Which is correct. So yes.

So the key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

So the final answer should be: Key of Ab major, Mode Ionian.

But let's check if there's a possibility of it being in a different mode. For example, if it were Eb minor, but as we saw, many notes wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Db minor? No, not likely.

Another check: the Db6 chord. Db major with added 6th. In Ab major, Db is IV chord. Adding 6th (Bb) makes Db6.

Now, the very end is Db6 followed by Eb. That's a IV to V progression in Ab major. Common cadence.

Yes. So if the piece ends on Eb, which is V, it's like a half cadence. But the key is still Ab.

Alternatively, maybe some jazz pieces use a different key. But given all chords fit Ab major, I think that's the answer.

Yes. So the key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

But sometimes people omit "Ionian" for major key, but technically the mode is Ionian.

So final answer: Key: Ab major, Mode: Ionian.


The chord progression provided is:  
**Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb**

### Step 1: Analyze the Chords
Let’s break down each chord explicitly (noting all notes present):

- **Eb** → Eb, G, Bb  
- **Cm/Eb** → C, Eb, G (C minor chord with Eb bass)  
- **Gdim/Db** → G, Bb, Db (G diminished triad with Db bass)  
- **Fm/Eb** → Eb, F, Ab, C (F minor 7th chord with Eb bass → F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- **Db6** → Db, F, Ab, Bb  

### Step 2: Compile All Unique Pitches
From all chords, the pitches used are:  
**C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**  

This is a complete **7-note diatonic scale**. Let’s cross-reference with known scales:

- **Ab Major Scale**:  
  **Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G**  
  ✅ *Matches exactly* the pitches derived from the chords.  

- **Eb Minor Scale**:  
  The natural (Aeolian) minor scale of Eb includes **Cb (B), D, Gb**, etc., but **no G natural** (only Gb/Ab). The presence of **G natural** rules out Eb minor.  

- **Other Keys**:  
  No other key (e.g., Bb major, Gb major) includes **all** these pitches without chromatic deviations (e.g., Bb major lacks Db and G natural).  

### Step 3: Diatonic Chord Function in Ab Major
All chords align perfectly with **Ab major (Ionian mode)**:

| Chord        | Function in Ab Major | Notes (Ab Major Scale) |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Eb**       | **V (Dominant)**     | Eb, G, Bb              |
| **Cm/Eb**    | **iii (Mediant)**    | C, Eb, G               |
| **Gdim/Db**  | **vii° (Leading Tone)** | G, Bb, Db              |
| **Fm/Eb**    | **vi (Submediant)**  | F, Ab, C, Eb           |
| **Db6**      | **IV6 (Subdominant)** | Db, F, Ab, Bb          |

- **Why Ab major?**  
  - The chord progression centers around **Ab** as the tonic (even if it doesn’t explicitly appear, the functional relationships confirm it).  
  - **Db6 → Eb** is a **IV–V cadence**, a standard progression in Ab major (IV = Db, V = Eb).  
  - All pitches fit Ab major’s scale:  
    - G natural is the **7th scale degree** (Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, **G**).  
    - Db is the **4th scale degree** (IV chord), consistent with the Db6 chord.  
    - Fm/Eb (F minor 7th) is the **vi7 chord**, diatonic to Ab major.  

### Step 4: Mode Confirmation
- The **key is Ab major**, which corresponds to the **Ionian mode** (the first mode of the major scale).  
- Since the entire progression is built diatonically from the Ab major scale and centers on Ab as the tonal center (even if implied by functional harmony), the mode is **Ionian**.  

### Final Answer
- **Key**: **Ab major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian**  

*(Note: In practice, "Ab major" implies Ionian mode, so specifying the mode is redundant but technically correct for clarity.)*

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let's analyze the given chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### Chord progression:
**Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb**

We can simplify this by ignoring repeated chords and focusing on the unique harmonic motion:

> **Eb — Cm/Eb — Gdim/Db — Fm/Eb — Db6 — Eb**

(Note: The slashes indicate bass notes — e.g., Cm/Eb means a C minor chord with Eb in the bass.)

---

## Step 1: Identify the chords in root position for easier analysis

1. **Eb** = Eb major chord → Eb - G - Bb  
2. **Cm/Eb** = C minor with Eb in bass → notes: Eb - G - C → This is an **Eb major 6th** chord (Eb - G - C), but voiced as C minor in first inversion.  
   - *Actually, Cm/Eb = C-Eb-G with Eb in bass → so the notes are Eb, G, C — same as Eb6 (Eb - G - C - Bb? Wait, we’re missing Bb here)*  
   - Wait — C minor triad is C-Eb-G. With Eb in bass: **Eb, G, C** — this is **Ebsus2 or Eb6 without 5th?** But note: Eb, G, C = **Eb6 chord without the 5th (Bb)**.  
     - Eb6 = Eb - G - C - Bb → here we have Eb - G - C → it's a **triad version of Eb6** (missing Bb). So functionally, it's **Eb6**.
3. **Gdim/Db** = G diminished triad with Db in bass → G-Bb-Db with Db in bass → notes: Db - G - Bb  
   - Db - G - Bb = Db, Bb, G → that's **Bb7b5**? Or Db in bass with Gdim → actually, this is **Db7(b5)** or **Gdim/D** but with Db bass → **Db augmented 6th?** Wait — let’s think differently.
   - Gdim = G-Bb-Db. With Db in bass → interval from Db to G is a **tritone**, Db to Bb is a minor 6th.  
   - This chord is **Db7(b5)** = Db - F - Ab - Cb → doesn’t match.  
   - Alternatively, **Db - G - Bb** = Db - Bb - G → which is the **same as Bb7(♭9)** without root? No.  
   - Let’s consider this as a **German Augmented Sixth** chord?  
     - German +6: in key of C, it’s Ab - C - Eb - G → doesn’t fit.  
   - Actually, **Db - G - Bb** = Db - Bb - G → that's **Bb minor 7 flat 5?** No.  
     - Let's invert: G-Bb-Db → that's a **G diminished 7th without the 7th** (G-Bb-Db-Fb) → so Gdim is just G-Bb-Db.  
     - So **Gdim/Db** = Db, G, Bb = **Db minor 6th?** Not quite.  
     - Another way: Db - G is an **augmented 4th/diminished 5th**, Db - Bb is a **minor 6th** → this is actually **Bb7 chord without root and without 7th**? Bb-D-F-Ab → not matching.  
     - Harmonically, **Gdim/Db** is often used as a **borrowed chord** from the key of F minor — it functions as **ii°** of F minor?  
       In F minor:  
       - ii° = Gdim = G-Bb-Db  
       - So Gdim/Db is ii° in first inversion.  
       So perhaps key is F minor?

4. **Fm/Eb** = F minor with Eb in bass → F-Ab-C with Eb → notes: Eb - F - Ab - C → that’s **Eb major 7th with a suspension?**  
   - Eb - F - Ab - C → Eb to F is a major 2nd → dissonant.  
   - Alternatively, think of it as **Fm/Eb = Eb, F, Ab, C** → this is **Eb7#9?** No.  
   - Wait — Fm = F, Ab, C  
     With Eb in bass: Eb, F, Ab, C  
     That’s **Eb - F - Ab - C** — this is **Eb13sus4** if we consider F = 9th, but that’s complicated.  
     Or better: this is **Eb major chord with a major 2nd suspension?**  

     However, **Eb - F - Ab - C** can be viewed as **Ab minor 7th in second inversion**, since Ab - C - Eb - F = Abm7 with F = 9th?  
     But Abm7 = Ab - C - Eb - Gb — here we have F, not Gb → so no.  

     **Instead, think of it as a passing chord or alteration.**

     Let’s recall: **Fm/Eb** is the **same as Eb7(b9)** without the 5th?  
     - Eb7 = Eb - G - Bb - Db  
     - Eb7(b9) = Eb - G - Bb - Db - Fb → we have F natural, not Fb → so it's **Eb7(#9)**? Because #9 of Eb is G#? No, #9 of Eb is F natural:  
       - Eb root → 9th = F → #9 = F# → argh!  
     - Wait — #9 of Eb is not F.  
       - Eb → 9th = F  
       - #9 = F#  
       But we have F natural — so it’s just a **9th** — that would make it **Eb9**.  
     - But we don’t have G or Bb? The chord is just Fm/Eb = F-Ab-C with Eb bass = notes: **Eb, F, Ab, C**  
       So: 1=Eb, 2=F, b3=Ab, 5=C → that’s **Eb2addb3**? Not standard.  

     This is more simply the **V7 chord of Bb minor?** Let’s step back.

5. **Db6** = Db - F - Bb → Db major 6th (Db - F - Ab - Bb? Wait, Db6 = Db - F - Ab - Bb? No — 6th is Bb, since Db - F - Ab - Bb — yes, Db6 = Db, F, Ab, Bb)

6. **Eb**

---

## Step 2: Try to find a tonal center

Look at the first chord: **Eb** — large and prominent.  
Last chord: **Eb** — tonal resolution.  

Also, **Db6 → Eb** is a very strong **subdominant to tonic** motion — Db to Eb.  

In fact, **Db6 → Eb** is like **IV6 → I** in a flat key — which suggests key of Eb major.

### Let’s test **Eb major** as the key.

**Eb major scale**: Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D

Chords in Eb major (diatonic):

| Degree | Chord |
|--------|-------|
| I      | Eb    |
| ii     | Fm    |
| iii    | Gm    |
| IV     | Ab    |
| V      | Bb    |
| vi     | Cm    |
| vii°   | Ddim  |

Now let’s map the progression with diatonic equivalents.

Progression:

1. **Eb** → I ✓  
2. **Cm/Eb** → Cm is vi in Eb major → **vi in first inversion (Cm/Eb)** = vi6 — common substitution. ✓  
3. **Gdim/Db** → Gdim is not diatonic to Eb major.  
   - In Eb major, vii° is Ddim, not Gdim.  
   → So **Gdim is borrowed** — likely from **Eb minor** (the parallel minor).  

   In **Eb natural minor**: Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb Db  
   - vii° = Dbdim → still not Gdim.  
   - Gdim = G-Bb-Db → which is the **vii° of Ab major** — or the **ii° of F minor**  

   Let’s try **F minor (parallel minor of Ab major)** — maybe it’s **F minor?**

Wait — let’s look at chord 4: **Fm/Eb**

Fm/Eb — Fm is iv in Ab major, or ii in Eb major — but it’s in first inversion with Eb bass.  

What if the key is **F minor**? That would make sense with the Gdim.

### Try **F minor** as tonic:

F natural minor: F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb  
Diatonic chords:
- i: Fm  
- ii°: Gdim  
- III: Ab  
- iv: Bbm  
- v: Cm  
- VI: Db  
- VII: Eb  

**Check progression:**

1. **Eb** → VII of F minor → ✓ common in minor keys  
2. **Cm/Eb** → v/i = Cm (v) with Eb bass — Eb is the VII → so this is **v - VII** motion  
   - Cm/Eb = Bb - C - Eb? Wait, Cm/Eb = C-Eb-G with Eb bass → Eb-C-G — same as Eb6 again  
   - In F minor, Cm is v — so **v in first inversion** → common  
3. **Gdim/Db** → ii° of F minor (Gdim), with Db bass → Db = VI of F minor  
   → So **ii°/VI** — this is very interesting.  
   - Gdim/Db = Db - G - Bb → this is **Ab7 (no root)**? Actually, Db - G - Bb = Db, Bb, G →  
   - This is **Bb7(b9)** without root? (Bb - D - F - Ab — no)  
   - Best interpretation: this is **vi - ii°** but with chromatic bass descent: Db → ?  

   Let's trace bass notes:  

   Chord       | Bass note  
   --------------------------  
   Eb          | Eb  
   Cm/Eb       | Eb  
   Gdim/Db     | Db  
   Fm/Eb       | Eb  
   Db6         | Db  
   Eb          | Eb  

   So bass movement: **Eb → Eb → Db → Eb → Db → Eb**  

   That’s a **chromatic neighbor** motion: Eb - Db - Eb  

   That’s common in minor keys for descent.  

   Now: **Db6 → Eb** = VI → I in F minor → **very common cadence in minor keys**!  

   In F minor:  
   - Db major = VI (major) chord — borrowed from F melodic minor (raised 6th)  
   - Then to i (Fm) — **VI-i cadence** is a **perfect authentic cadence** in minor keys, often used in classical and pop.  

   Now check: What is **Fm/Eb**? = Fm with Eb bass → that’s **iv chord with the VII in bass** — so **iv7?**  
   - Fm = F-Ab-C  
   - Eb in bass → Eb - F - Ab - C → this is **Abm7?**  
     Abm7 = Ab - C - Eb - Gb → we have F, not Gb — so no.  
   - But Eb - F - Ab - C = **Eb major with added 9th and 11th?**  
   - Actually: **Eb - F - Ab - C** = Fm7/Eb? Fm7 = F - Ab - C - Eb → yes! That’s **Fm7** — and it’s the **iv7** chord in F minor.  
     And we’re just voicing it with Eb in bass — so it’s **Fm7/Eb**, which is **iv7**.  

   And Fm7 is diatonic to F minor → yes:  
   - F minor scale: F-G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb  
   - Fm7 = F - Ab - C - Eb → IV7 → yes!  
   - So Fm/Eb = Eb - F - Ab - C = C - Eb - F - Ab → same as Fm7, bass Eb → so it's **iv7**  

   Now **Gdim/Db** = Gdim with Db bass → G-Bb-Db with Db bass → Db - G - Bb  
   In F minor scale:  
   - Gdim = ii°  
   - Db = VI  
   So **ii°/VI** — this functions as a **passing chord** or augmented 6th?  

   Actually, **Db - G - Bb** = Db, Bb, G → is the same as **Bb7(♭9)** without root? But swapped.  
   This chord can be interpreted as **an augmented sixth chord leading to Eb** — but we go to Fm/Eb next, then Db6.  

   But wait, progression is:  
   **Gdim/Db → Fm/Eb → Db6 → Eb**

   So: **Db → Eb → Db → Eb**

   The **Gdim/Db** leads into **Fm/Eb** — which is iv7 — so: **ii°/VI → iv7** — that’s **viio6 → iv7** in F minor?  

   Actually, **Gdim** (II°) to **Fm** (iv) — that’s descending by minor 3rd — common in minor keys.  
   And **Db** bass is just a passing tone.  

   So the key is **F minor**.  

   The progression ends on **Eb** — which is the **VII chord**, not the tonic. But we’re back to Eb = VII, which often resolves to I = Fm. But the progression ends on Eb.

   **Wait — progression ends on Eb — but Fm is the tonic. Why end on Eb?**

   The full progression:  
   - Starts: Eb → Eb → Cm/Eb → Cm/Eb → Gdim/Db → Fm/Eb → Eb → Eb → Cm/Eb → Cm/Eb → Eb → Eb → Db6 → **Eb**

   **Final chord is Eb** — not Fm. So is the tonic Fm or Eb?

   But **Db6 → Eb** is a deceptive cadence in F minor: VI → VII, not VI → i. But it’s possible.  

   But wait — Db6 is **Db major 6th = Db-F-Ab-Bb**

   And then Eb — Eb major = Eb-G-Bb  

   So: Db6 → Eb major  
   - Db6 = Db - F - Ab - Bb  
   - Eb = Eb - G - Bb  
   - Common tone: **Bb**  
   - The bass descent: Db → Eb (up minor 2nd)  
   - The upper voices: F→G (up minor 2nd), Ab→Bb (up minor 2nd), Db→Eb (up minor 2nd)  

   This is a very strong **chromatic mediant move**: Db major to Eb major — a **root movement of minor 2nd UP**

   This is **not diatonic** to F minor — F minor has Db as VI and Eb as VII — they are not closely related.  

   But Eb major chord sounds like **I** in Eb major — so perhaps we **modulate to Eb major** at the end?

   The **last two chords**: **Db6 → Eb**  

   This is **a Neapolitan to tonic** motion — **but in Eb major**!  

   In Eb major:  
   - Neapolitan = **Db** major — not Db6  
   - Typically, Neapolitan = **Db major (b2)** → then I = Eb  

   So **Db major → Eb** is **N - I** in Eb major.  

   Here we have **Db6** — which is **Db major with added 6th** — that's common in romantic music as a variant of the Neapolitan.  

   And the whole beginning uses **Eb major** chords.  

   So now the case weakens for F minor.  

   Let’s reconsider.

---

## Final Interpretation: **Eb Major** with modal mixture

Chord progression:

1. **Eb** → I  
2. **Cm/Eb** → vi6 → common in major keys  
3. **Gdim/Db** → **this is the problem** — Gdim doesn’t belong to Eb major  
   - But Gdim is the vii° of A minor — or in Eb major, we can borrow it as **viio of F minor**?  
   - Wait — Gdim = G-Bb-Db = **viio of Ab major**? No, viio of Ab is G#dim  
   - Gdim = viio of **C minor** → so maybe it's **borrowed from C minor**, which is **III minor** in Eb major.  

   This is a **chromatic mediant** relationship.  

   But better: Gdim is **the ii° of F minor** — which is the **relative minor of Eb major?** No, relative minor of Eb is C minor.  

   Eb major’s relative minor is **C minor** — and in C minor:  
   - ii° = D°  
   - v = G° → yes! In minor, the fifth degree is diminished.  
     → **C minor scale**: C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb  
     - v = G - Bb - Db → Gdim  
   - So Gdim = v chord of **C minor** — which is **iii of Eb major**  

   So **borrowing the v chord from relative minor** — very common!  

   Used for: modulation or dramatic tension.  

   So:  
   - **Cm/Eb** = vi6 of Eb major  
   - **Gdim/Db** = borrowed v° from C minor — Db bass sets up a descent to the next chord  

   Then: **Fm/Eb** = ii of Eb major in first inversion?  
   - Fm = ii in Eb major  
   - Fm/Eb = Eb-F-Ab-C → Fm7 (as before) → ii7 — common in jazz  

   Then: **Db6** = Neapolitan chord of Eb major → **N6**

   Db6 = Db-F-Ab-Bb → in Eb major: Db is the lowered second degree → N6 → strong resolution to I = Eb

   And finally: **Eb** as tonic

---

## ✅ Final Answer:

### **Key: Eb major**  
### **Mode: Major**  

### Explanation:
- The progression begins and ends on **Eb major**, establishing the tonic.  
- Chords like **Cm** (vi), **Fm** (ii) are diatonic to Eb major.  
- **Gdim** is **borrowed** from the relative minor (C minor) — as its **v° chord**, a very common modal mixture.  
- **Db6** is the **Neapolitan sixth chord** (N6) — beautifully prepared by Eb and Fm, and resolves directly to tonic Eb.  
- The bass motion (Db → Eb) is a classic N6→I cadence.  
- The use of **Db** as a chromatic neighbor to Eb, and **Gdim/Db** as a steeply borrowed chord, is characteristic of **Romantic-era harmonic language within a major key** — not a modal change.

### Conclusion:
> **Key: Eb major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (Major)**

With rich use of **modal mixture** (borrowed chords from C minor) and **Neapolitan** harmony — very expressive, but still centered firmly in Eb major.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**

> **Eb – Eb – Cm/Eb – Cm/Eb – Gdim/Db – Fm/Eb – Eb – Eb – Cm/Eb – Cm/Eb – Eb – Eb – Db6 – Eb**

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center

The progression **starts and ends on Eb**, and **Eb appears very frequently** — this strongly suggests **Eb is the tonic** (home chord).

### Step 2: Look at the chords used

Let’s list the unique chords (ignoring bass inversions for now):

- **Eb** (E♭ major triad): I chord if in E♭ major
- **Cm** (C minor): vi chord in E♭ major
- **Gdim** (G diminished): vii° chord in A♭ major, but also appears as #v° in E♭ minor or as a chromatic passing chord
- **Fm** (F minor): ii chord in E♭ major? Wait—**F minor is not in E♭ major** (E♭ major has F **minor**? No — E♭ major scale is: E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D → so F is **major**, so F minor is **not diatonic** to E♭ major)
- **Db6** (D♭6 = D♭ major with added 6th → D♭, F, A♭, B♭): This is a major chord with a 6th, built on D♭

So let’s consider **E♭ minor** instead.

E♭ natural minor scale: **E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭**

But we see **C natural** (in Cm chord: C–E♭–G), and **G natural** (in Gdim: G–B♭–D♭), and **D natural** (in Db6? Wait—Db6 has B♭ as the 6th, which is fine, but does it have D natural? No—it has D♭ as root, F, A♭, and B♭. So no D natural.)

Wait: hold on—**Cm chord contains C–E♭–G**, which includes **G natural**, not G♭. In **E♭ natural minor**, the 6th scale degree is **C♭**, not C natural, and the 3rd of the C chord would be E♭ (ok), but root C vs C♭ is a problem.

So C natural is **not in E♭ natural minor**.

But **C natural is in E♭ harmonic minor** and **E♭ melodic minor**.

E♭ harmonic minor: **E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♮**

Wait—still has **C♭**, not C♮.

Hold on—maybe we’re better off thinking **relative major**.

What if the key is **G♭ major**? That seems remote.

Alternatively, consider **E♭ as tonic, but using chords from C minor** (relative minor of E♭ major). Wait—**C minor is the relative minor of E♭ major**.

In **E♭ major**, the diatonic chords are:

- I: E♭
- ii: Fm
- iii: Gm
- IV: A♭
- V: B♭
- vi: Cm
- vii°: D°

But in our progression, we have:

- E♭ → ✅ I
- Cm → ✅ vi
- Fm → ✅ ii
- Gdim → **not diatonic** (should be Gm, not Gdim)
- D♭6 → **not diatonic** (D♭ is bVII in E♭ major — that’s a common modal mixture chord)

Ah! **D♭ major (bVII)** is a common chord borrowed from **E♭ mixolydian** or used in **modal mixture** (from E♭ minor).

Also, **Gdim**: in E♭ major, the vii° is **D°**, not G°. So G° is not in key.

But **G°** can be seen as a **secondary leading-tone chord**. For example:

- G° = vii° of A♭ (since A♭ is IV in E♭)
- But here it’s **Gdim/Db**, so the bass is D♭.

Gdim = G–B♭–D♭. Over D♭ bass, it’s a **D♭ diminished chord in first inversion**, which is enharmonically the same as **A diminished** or **B diminished**, but more usefully: **G°/D♭ = D♭–G–B♭** — that’s actually a **D♭7♭5** without the 7th? Hmm.

Alternatively, consider **G° as vii° of A♭**, and A♭ is IV in E♭.

But perhaps more telling: **the presence of D♭ (bVII)** and **C natural (in Cm)** suggests we are in **E♭ major**, using **modal interchange** from **E♭ minor**.

In **E♭ minor**, the chords include:

- i: E♭m (not used — we have E♭ major)
- bIII: G♭ major
- bVI: C♭ major (enharmonic to B major – not used)
- bVII: D♭ major → ✅ used as D♭6
- ii°: F°
- iv: A♭m
- vi°: C°

But we have **Cm (minor with C natural)** — that doesn’t fit E♭ minor.

Wait a minute—**Cm is diatonic to E♭ major** as the **vi chord**.

So:

- **E♭ major**: contains E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D
- Chords:
  - E♭ = I
  - Cm = vi
  - Fm = **not diatonic** → F should be F minor? No! In E♭ major, F is **minor?** Wait:

E♭ major scale:  
1. E♭  
2. F  
3. G  
4. A♭  
5. B♭  
6. C  
7. D  

→ So ii chord is **F minor?** Wait, triad on F: F–A–C → **F major**, because A is natural in E♭ major.

Hold on—**A is natural in E♭ major**, so F–A–C = **F major**, not F minor.

Therefore, **F minor** is **not in E♭ major**.

But **F minor is in C minor** (relative minor). Wait—C minor scale: C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭

→ F minor = F–A♭–C → yes, that’s diatonic to **C minor**.

But our tonic seems to be **E♭**, not C.

So maybe the key is **C minor**, and E♭ is the **♭III**, which is a common tonicized chord in minor keys.

But the progression **starts and ends on E♭**, and E♭ is used more than Cm.

Also, **Db6** = D♭ major with added 6th = D♭–F–A♭–B♭

In **C minor**, D♭ is **♭II**, which is a **Neapolitan chord** — very common.

And **Gdim** is the **vii° of A♭**, and A♭ is ♭VI in C minor.

But again, the tonal center feels like **E♭**, not C.

Let’s consider **modes**.

What if the key is **E♭ Mixolydian**?

E♭ Mixolydian = E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭

→ This scale has **D♭ instead of D♮**

Now check the chords:

- E♭ = I ✅
- Cm = C–E♭–G → C is 6th degree → Cm = vi ✅ (C–E♭–G are all in E♭ Mixolydian)
- Fm = F–A♭–C → F is 2nd degree → in Mixolydian, F chord is **F minor**? Let's see: F–A♭–C → A♭ is in the scale (yes) → so **F minor is diatonic to E♭ Mixolydian!**

Yes! Because E♭ Mixolydian has **A♭**, not A♮, so F chord is **F minor**.

- Gdim = G–B♭–D♭ → G is 3rd degree: G–B♭–D♭ → all in E♭ Mixolydian → **G° is the iii° chord** in Mixolydian! (In major, it's G minor; in Mixolydian, because of D♭, it becomes diminished)

- D♭6 = D♭–F–A♭–B♭ → D♭ is the ♭7 degree → **♭VII chord**, which is **major** in Mixolydian (D♭–F–A♭) + 6th (B♭) → fully diatonic!

So **ALL chords are diatonic to E♭ Mixolydian**:

- E♭ = I
- Cm = vi
- Fm = ii
- G° = iii°
- D♭ = ♭VII

Perfect fit!

### Conclusion:

- **Key center**: E♭  
- **Mode**: **Mixolydian**

Because the scale required to explain all chords (especially Fm, G°, and D♭) is **E♭ Mixolydian** (E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭).

✅ All chords are diatonic to **E♭ Mixolydian**.

**Answer**:  
**Key: E♭  
Mode: Mixolydian**

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking**

### Reasoning

**Deciphering the Chords**

I'm currently breaking down the chord progression to understand its structure. The initial focus is on identifying the specific chords present, including inversions like Cm/Eb and Gdim/Db. Next, I plan to analyze the relationships between these chords to determine the key and mode.


**Unpacking the Harmony**

I'm now investigating the non-diatonic chords. The Gdim/Db is the current puzzle, since the notes don't directly align with the Eb major scale. I'm considering possible chromatic alterations or borrowed chords, and how it might be functioning within the progression. My focus is on determining its purpose and resolution within the phrase.


**Unveiling the Modal Flavor**

The inclusion of Db6 and the presence of Gdim/Db, which isn't diatonic to Eb major, has shifted my thinking towards a modal context. It looks like we are in Eb major, but with the bVII chord borrowed from the Mixolydian, Aeolian, or Dorian modes. The harmonic movement and the bVII chord are giving a strong signal that this piece is borrowing from these modes.


**Final Mode Assessment**

I've carefully analyzed the non-diatonic elements, especially Gdim/Db and Db6. While the presence of the bVII chord points to Mixolydian, the consistent use of Fm and Cm chords from Eb major reveals a borrowing from the Eb Aeolian, or natural minor. Overall, I conclude that we are in Eb major, with borrowing from Aeolian.


**Concluding the Analysis**

I've reached my final assessment. The piece is firmly rooted in Eb major, thanks to the chord qualities and their established major tonic. However, the use of Db6 (bVII) indicates a borrowing from the Aeolian mode, bringing a subtle blues-inspired flavor to the harmony. The analysis is now complete.


**Determining Key and Mode**

My analysis has progressed. I've pinpointed Eb as the tonal center and am now weighing the significance of the Db6 chord. It's clear that the piece is predominantly in Eb major, but the Db6 introduces a modal flavor. I am considering borrowed chords, such as bVII, from parallel modes like Aeolian or Mixolydian. The next step is synthesizing this information to make a final mode determination.




This chord progression establishes a clear tonal center and uses elements of modal borrowing.

## Key and Mode Determination

1.  **Identify the Tonal Center (Tonic):**
    The progression begins and ends on **Eb** and features it repeatedly as the primary chord. Therefore, the key center is **Eb**.

2.  **Analyze Diatonic Chords:**
    The core chords used are:
    *   **Eb Major** (I)
    *   **Fm** (F minor) (ii)
    *   **Cm** (C minor) (vi)

    These three chords (I-ii-vi) are perfectly diatonic to **Eb Major**. The use of C minor and F minor firmly establishes the major scale structure (specifically, the sixth and second degrees are natural).

3.  **Analyze Non-Diatonic/Ambiguous Chords:**

    *   **Db6:** The chord Db major (Db-F-Ab) is the **bVII** chord relative to Eb. In Eb Major, the seventh degree is D natural, leading to the D diminished chord (vii°) or the D being part of the dominant Bb chord (V). The use of the D-flat (b7) is a strong indicator of **modal borrowing**, typically from Eb Aeolian (natural minor) or frequently used in rock/pop harmony to lead back to the tonic (bVII -> I).

    *   **Gdim/Db:** G diminished (G-Bb-Db) functions harmonically as a passing or substitution chord. It often acts as a surrogate dominant (V) to the relative minor (Cm).

4.  **Conclusion:**

The overwhelming evidence points to **Eb Major** as the primary mode, as the major tonic and the diatonic supertonic (Fm) and submediant (Cm) are utilized. The Db6 chord is a common instance of **modal mixture (borrowing)**, adding a distinctive flavor without changing the fundamental major mode.

**Key:** **Eb**
**Mode:** **Major** (with modal borrowing from the parallel minor/Aeolian).

The analysis of the given chord progression points towards the key of **E-flat minor ($E{\flat}m$)** or **E-flat Phrygian**. However, based on the function of the chords and standard harmony, **E-flat minor ($E{\flat}m$) (Aeolian or Harmonic/Melodic Minor)** is the most likely key center.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

| Chord | Root | Quality | Roman Numeral (Assuming $E{\flat}m$) | Function | Notes (E $\to$ Eb) | Function |
| :---: | :--: | :-----: | :--------------------------------: | :-------: | :---: | :-------: |
| **Eb** | $Eb$ | Major | $I$ (Phrygian) or $bIII$ (Minor key) or $V$(Harmonic minor) | Tonic/Dominant/Mediant | $\rightarrow$ | Tonic Chord (${\bf I}$) |
| **Eb** | $Eb$ | Major | $I$ (Phrygian) or $bIII$ (Minor key) or $V$(Harmonic minor) | Tonic/Dominant/Mediant | $\rightarrow$ | Tonic Chord (${\bf I}$) |
| **Cm/Eb** | $C$ | minor | $bVI$ (Phrygian) or $VI$ (Harmonic Minor) | Submediant | $\rightarrow$ | Submediant Chord (${\bf vi}$) |
| **Cm/Eb** | $C$ | minor | $bVI$ (Phrygian) or $VI$ (Harmonic Minor) | Submediant | $\rightarrow$ | Submediant Chord (${\bf vi}$) |
| **Gdim/Db** | $G$ | diminished | $III$ diminished | Leading Tone/Mediant | $\rightarrow$ | Leading Tone Chord (${\bf iii}^{\circ}$) |
| **Fm/Eb** | $F$ | minor | $II$ minor | Supertonic | $\rightarrow$ | Supertonic Chord (${\bf ii}$) |
| **Eb** | $Eb$ | Major | $I$ (Phrygian) or $bIII$ (Minor key) or $V$(Harmonic minor) | Tonic/Dominant/Mediant | $\rightarrow$ | Tonic Chord (${\bf I}$) |
| **Eb** | $Eb$ | Major | $I$ (Phrygian) or $bIII$ (Minor key) or $V$(Harmonic minor) | $\rightarrow$ | Tonic Chord (${\bf I}$) |
| **Cm/Eb** | $C$ | minor | $bVI$ (Phrygian) or $VI$ (Harmonic Minor) | $\rightarrow$ | Submediant Chord (${\bf vi}$) |
| **Cm/Eb** | $C$ | minor | $bVI$ (Phrygian) or $VI$ (Harmonic Minor) | $\rightarrow$ | Submediant Chord (${\bf vi}$) |
| **Eb** | $Eb$ | Major | $I$ (Phrygian) or $bIII$ (Minor key) or $V$(Harmonic minor) | $\rightarrow$ | Tonic Chord (${\bf I}$) |
| **Eb** | $Eb$ | Major | $I$ (Phrygian) or $bIII$ (Minor key) or $V$(Harmonic minor) | $\rightarrow$ | Tonic Chord (${\bf I}$) |
| **Db6** | $Db$ | Major | $VII$ major ${}^{6}$ or $IV$ (Harmonic Minor) | Subtonic/Subdominant | $\rightarrow$ | Subtonic/Subdominant Chord (${\bf VII}$) |
| **Eb** | $Eb$ | Major | $I$ (Phrygian) or $bIII$ (Minor key) or $V$(Harmonic minor) | $\rightarrow$ | Tonic Chord (${\bf I}$) |

### Key & Mode Determination:

1.  **The Dominant Sound:** The most unusual aspect is the repeated use of **Eb Major** (Eb-G-Bb) as the apparent tonic, initiating and concluding the phrase.
2.  **The Context:**
    *   The secondary chords are **Cm** (C-Eb-G), **Gdim** (G-Bb-Db), **Fm** (F-Ab-C), and **Db6** (Db-F-Ab-Bb).
    *   The notes present are **Eb, G, Bb** (from Eb Major); **C, Eb, G** (from Cm); **G, Bb, Db** (from Gdim); **F, Ab, C** (from Fm); **Db, F, Ab, Bb** (from Db6).
    *   Combining all notes: **Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db**. This set of notes is highly characteristic of the **E-flat natural minor scale (Aeolian)**: $E{\flat}, F, G{\flat}, A{\flat}, B{\flat}, C{\flat}, D{\flat}$.
3.  **The Conflict/Resolution:**
    *   If the key were strict **$E{\flat}$ minor (Aeolian)**, the tonic chord would be $E{\flat}m$ ($E{\flat}-G{\flat}-B{\flat}$) and the dominant minor $B{\flat}m$.
    *   If the key were strict **$E{\flat}$ Phrygian**, the $I$ chord would be $E{\flat}m$, and the $V$ chord is $B{\flat}d$. $\boldsymbol{E{\flat}m}$ is the chord that would have *all* of the following chords derived from it easily.
    *   The presence of **$E{\flat}$ Major ($E{\flat}-G-B{\flat}$)**, **$C$ minor ($C-E{\flat}-G$)**, **$F$ minor ($F-A{\flat}-C$)**, and **$D{\flat}$ Major ($D{\flat}-F-A{\flat}$)**, along with a $\mathbf{G}$ diminished ($\mathbf{G}-B{\flat}-D{\flat}$), strongly points to an ambiguity common in minor keys where a major chord is tonicized.

### Conclusion

The overall tonal center is **E-flat** due to the beginning and ending chord. The surrounding harmony (Fm, Cm, Gdim, Db) defines the minor tonality. The major **Eb** chords, however, suggest that this is a song in **$E{\flat}$ minor** but which has borrowed the **Picardy Third** or utilizes the major-triad dominant (V) from the **$A{\flat}$ Major** scale as a way to create a deceptive tonicity. Considering the harmonic content:

The **Key** is **E-flat minor ($E{\flat}m$)**.

The **Mode** is a mixture, primarily **Aeolian/Natural Minor**, but with strong characteristics of its **parallel Major (Eb Major)** or a **Dorian** borrowing, given the use of the **Eb Major** chord as the main harmonic pillar. Since the secondary chords (Cm, Fm, Db, Gdim) align best with **Natural Minor**, we default to:

**Key:** **Eb Minor ($E{\flat}m$)**
**Mode:** **Aeolian** (with tonicization of the major $I$ chord)

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Write out the chords
You provided the following chord progression:

```
Eb  Eb  Cm/Eb  Cm/Eb  Gdim/Db  Fm/Eb  Eb  Eb  Cm/Eb  Cm/Eb  Eb  Eb  Db6  Eb
```

### Step 2: Identify the root notes and chord qualities
Let's list out the chords with their roots and qualities:

- **Eb**: Major chord (Eb–G–Bb)
- **Cm/Eb**: C minor triad with Eb in the bass (C–Eb–G over Eb)
- **Gdim/Db**: G diminished triad (G–Bb–Db) with Db in the bass
- **Fm/Eb**: F minor triad (F–Ab–C) with Eb in the bass
- **Db6**: Db major sixth chord (Db–F–Ab–Bb)

### Step 3: Analyze the notes
Let's collect all the notes from these chords and see what scale they fit into.

- Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
- Cm/Eb: C, Eb, G (Eb is bass)
- Gdim/Db: G, Bb, Db (Db is bass)
- Fm/Eb: F, Ab, C (Eb is bass)
- Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

Unique notes:  
**Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db**

This is the **Eb major scale with a lowered 7th** (Db instead of D). This corresponds to the **Eb Mixolydian mode**.

### Step 4: Check tonal center
The progression starts and ends on **Eb**, and Eb is the tonal center. The presence of **Db (b7)** instead of D natural (which would be in Eb major) confirms the **Mixolydian** character.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: Eb**  
**Mode: Mixolydian**

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let’s look at your progression:  

```
Eb   Eb   Cm/Eb   Cm/Eb   Gdim/Db   Fm/Eb   Eb   Eb   
Cm/Eb   Cm/Eb   Eb   Eb   Db6   Eb
```

### Step 1: Identify key candidates
- Strong presence of **Eb** chords → likely **Eb major** or **Eb minor**.
- Chords in Eb major are: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim.
- You have **Cm** (fits), **Fm** (fits), **Gdim** (fits as vii°), and **Db6** (borrowed chord).

### Step 2: Check harmonic function
- The sequence heavily centers around **Eb** (tonic).
- **Cm/Eb** acts like a tonic prolongation (vi in rootless 1st inversion).
- **Fm/Eb** also shares Eb in the bass (iv/tonic pedal).
- **Gdim/Db** could serve as a passing chord approaching Fm (ii°7/V or vii°/ii type effect).
- **Db6** (borrowed from the parallel minor or as a ♭VI chord) is common as a color chord in Eb major.

### Step 3: Mode determination
Everything fits **Eb major** with a single modal interchange (the **Db6**, from the parallel minor).

✅ **Key:** Eb major  
✅ **Mode:** Ionian (major), with occasional borrowed ♭VI (Db6) from the parallel minor

---

**Summary:**
- **Tonal center:** Eb  
- **Mode:** Eb Ionian (Major)  
- **Borrowed chord:** Db6 (♭VI from Eb minor)

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, the sequence of chords is: Eb, Eb, Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb, Eb, Eb, Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Eb, Eb, Db6, Eb.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since the chords are given with bass notes in some cases, like Cm/Eb, which means C minor chord with Eb in the bass, I should consider the overall harmonic context.

Let me list out the chords without the bass designations for simplicity, focusing on the chord qualities:

- Eb major

- Eb major

- C minor (but with Eb bass, so it's still C minor chord)

- C minor

- G diminished (with Db bass, so G diminished chord)

- F minor (with Eb bass, so F minor chord)

- Eb major

- Eb major

- C minor

- C minor

- Eb major

- Eb major

- Db6 (which is Db major with an added 6th, so Db F Ab Bb)

- Eb major

Now, I see that Eb major appears frequently, and C minor also appears. There's also G diminished and F minor, and Db6.

I should consider the key of Eb major. In Eb major, the chords would be:

- I: Eb

- ii: Fm

- iii: Gm

- IV: Ab

- V: Bb

- vi: Cm

- vii: Ddim

In this sequence, we have Cm, which is the vi chord in Eb major. We have Fm, which is the ii chord. We have Gdim, which might be related to the vii chord, but in Eb major, vii is Ddim, not Gdim. Gdim would be a diminished chord built on G, which in Eb major would be the third scale degree, but Gm is minor, not diminished. So Gdim doesn't fit directly into Eb major.

Gdim is a diminished chord. Diminished chords are often used as leading tones or passing chords. In Eb major, the leading tone is D, so Ddim is the vii dim chord. But here we have Gdim.

Perhaps this is in a minor key. Let's consider Eb minor. But the chords include Eb major, not Eb minor. So probably not Eb minor.

Another thought: the mode might be mixolydian or something else. But let's look at the chord progression.

I see Cm/Eb, which is C minor with Eb bass. This could be interpreted as an Eb major chord with a C in it, but since it's written as Cm/Eb, it's clearly a C minor triad over Eb bass, so it's like a first inversion C minor chord. Similarly, Fm/Eb is first inversion F minor chord.

In terms of harmonic function, these inverted chords might still function similarly to their root positions.

Now, let's list the roots of the chords: Eb, Eb, C, C, G, F, Eb, Eb, C, C, Eb, Eb, Db, Eb.

So the roots are: Eb, C, G, F, Db. And Eb is repeated a lot.

In Eb major, the notes are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So the roots Eb, C, F are in the scale, but G and Db are not. G is in the scale, but Gdim has G, Bb, Db? Let's spell the chords.

Eb major: Eb, G, Bb

Cm: C, Eb, G — so C minor has C, Eb, G. But in Cm/Eb, the bass is Eb, but the chord is still C, Eb, G.

Gdim: G, Bb, Db — so G diminished has G, Bb, Db.

Fm: F, Ab, C — so F minor has F, Ab, C.

Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb — so Db major with added 6th, which is Bb.

Now, let's see what notes are used in these chords:

From Eb: Eb, G, Bb

From Cm: C, Eb, G

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db

From Fm: F, Ab, C

From Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

So all together, the notes are: Eb, G, Bb, C, F, Ab, Db. So we have Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. That's almost the Eb major scale, but instead of D natural, we have Db. So we have a flat 7th? In Eb major, the 7th is D, but here we have Db, which is flat 7.

In Eb major, the scale is Eb F G Ab Bb C D. But here we have Db instead of D. So it seems like we have a flat 7th, which is characteristic of the Mixolydian mode.

Mixolydian mode has a major scale with a flat 7th. So for Eb Mixolydian, the scale would be Eb F G Ab Bb C Db.

And looking at the chords, we have Eb major (I), Fm (ii), Cm (vi), and Gdim? What is Gdim in Eb Mixolydian?

Let's build chords from Eb Mixolydian scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C Db

I: Eb major (Eb, G, Bb)

ii: F minor (F, Ab, C)

iii: G diminished? G, Bb, Db — yes, G diminished! Because from G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, so diminished triad.

IV: Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)

V: Bb major (Bb, D, F) — but wait, in Mixolydian, the fifth note is Bb, but the chord would be Bb major only if we have D natural? But in Eb Mixolydian, the scale has Db, not D. So the fifth degree is Bb, and for Bb chord, we need Bb, D, F? But D is not in the scale; we have Db. So actually, the V chord in Mixolydian is minor? Let's see.

If we build chords on each degree of the Mixolydian scale:

- I: Eb G Bb → Eb major

- ii: F Ab C → F minor

- iii: G Bb Db → G diminished

- IV: Ab C Eb → Ab major

- v: Bb Db F → Bb minor? Bb, Db, F is Bb minor chord.

- vi: C Eb G → C minor

- vii: Db F Ab → Db major? Db, F, Ab is Db major chord.

In the sequence, we have Db6, which is Db major with added 6th, so Db, F, Ab, Bb. The Bb is the 6th, which is from the scale? In Db major, the 6th would be Bb, yes, and in Eb Mixolydian, Bb is the fifth degree, so it fits.

In the chord progression, we have Gdim, which is the iii chord in Mixolydian, and we have Fm, which is ii, and Cm, which is vi, and Eb, which is I, and Db6, which is like the VII chord but with added 6th.

In the sequence, we have Gdim/Db, which means G diminished with Db bass. Since Gdim is G, Bb, Db, and with Db bass, it might be emphasizing the Db, or it could be seen as a Db chord with some alterations, but since it's written as Gdim, it's probably functioning as a diminished chord.

In the context, after Gdim/Db, we have Fm/Eb, then Eb.

Now, let's see the progression: Eb, Cm, Gdim, Fm, Eb, and then Db6, Eb.

In Mixolydian, the chords I, ii, iii, IV, v, vi, VII.

Here we have I (Eb), vi (Cm), iii (Gdim), ii (Fm), I (Eb), and then VII (Db6), I (Eb).

So it seems to fit well in Eb Mixolydian.

But let's confirm the mode. Mixolydian is a major mode with flat 7th, and here we have Db instead of D, so yes.

Also, in the chord progression, the use of Db6 leads to Eb, which is typical of a flat VII to I progression in Mixolydian or in rock music.

So, I think the key is Eb Mixolydian.

But is there another possibility? For example, if we consider C minor, which is relative to Eb major, but in C minor, the chords would be different. In C minor, Eb is the mediant, but here Eb is tonicized, so probably not.

Moreover, in C minor, we would have G major or G minor as V chord, but here we have Gdim, which doesn't fit.

So, Eb Mixolydian seems correct.

Therefore, the key is Eb, and the mode is Mixolydian.

So, for the answer, I should say key of Eb Mixolydian.

But let's make sure about the chord notations. The user wrote "Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb"

The bass notes are specified, but in terms of harmonic analysis, the bass notes might affect the inversion, but the chord qualities are what matter for key determination.

In this case, with the chords fitting Eb Mixolydian, it should be fine.

So, I think that's it.

The chord progression Eb, Cm, Gdim, Fm, and Db6 suggests that the key is Eb Mixolydian. This is determined by the presence of chords that align with the Eb Mixolydian scale (Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db), where the flat 7th (Db) is characteristic of the Mixolydian mode.

- Eb major functions as the I chord.
- C minor (Cm) is the vi chord.
- G diminished (Gdim) is the iii chord.
- F minor (Fm) is the ii chord.
- Db6 (Db major with an added 6th) is the VII chord, which commonly resolves to I in Mixolydian progressions.

The bass notes (e.g., Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb) indicate inversions but do not change the overall harmonic context. The progression emphasizes the Mixolydian sound, particularly with the Db6 leading to Eb, reinforcing the flat VII-I cadence.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.  

The chord progression you’ve given is:  

**Eb  Eb  Cm/Eb  Cm/Eb  Gdim/Db  Fm/Eb  Eb  Eb  Cm/Eb  Cm/Eb  Eb  Eb  Db6  Eb**  

---

### 1. Identify the chords and their functions

- **Eb major** = I chord in Eb major, or bVI in G minor (less likely here given the ending).
- **Cm/Eb** = C minor with Eb in bass = Cm in first inversion. In Eb major, Cm is the **vi** chord.
- **Gdim/Db** = G diminished with Db in bass. Gdim in Eb major is vii° (G–Bb–Db). With Db in bass, it’s a first-inversion vii° chord.
- **Fm/Eb** = F minor with Eb in bass = Fm in first inversion. In Eb major, Fm is the **ii** chord.
- **Db6** = Db–F–Bb (Db6 = Db F Bb). In Eb major, Db major is the **bVII** chord (common in rock/pop mixolydian b7 style).

---

### 2. Try Eb major key first

In **Eb major**:  
Eb = I  
Cm = vi  
Gdim = vii°  
Fm = ii  
Db = bVII (borrowed from Mixolydian or from parallel minor)

The progression:  
I – I – vi – vi – vii°6 – ii6 – I – I – vi – vi – I – I – bVII – I  

That’s a plausible major key progression with a bVII–I rock cadence at the end instead of V–I.  

---

### 3. Try Eb minor key

In **Eb minor** (G♭ major key signature):  
Eb minor = i  
Cm = ♭VI (Cb major? No, Cm is C–Eb–G, which in Eb minor is C–Eb–G = C diminished? Wait, no: C–Eb–G in Eb minor scale (Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb) would be C–Eb–Gb = Cdim, not Cm. So C–Eb–G is not in natural Eb minor. It’s in Eb harmonic minor? C–Eb–G is C minor, which requires a G natural, so G is not in Eb minor scale unless raised 7th in harmonic minor? Actually, in Eb harmonic minor: Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb D natural — so C–Eb–G? G natural is not in Eb harmonic minor either (the raised 7th is D natural, not G natural). So Cm chord is C–Eb–G: G natural is the 5th of Cm, so G natural is not in Eb minor scale at all. So Cm is foreign to Eb minor — it’s from Eb major.  

So the presence of Cm and Fm (F–Ab–C) means both have Ab and C natural, which are in Eb major, not Eb minor (Eb minor would have Ab and Cb).  

Thus the key is **Eb major**.

---

### 4. Mode

The use of **Db major (bVII)** at the end in a major key context, resolving to I (Eb), is characteristic of **Mixolydian mode** (major key with b7 scale degree).  

Eb Mixolydian scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C Db Eb.  
Check chords:  
Eb (I) = Eb G Bb — all in Eb Mixolydian  
Cm (vi) = C Eb G — all in Eb Mixolydian  
Gdim (vii°) = G Bb Db — all in Eb Mixolydian  
Fm (ii) = F Ab C — all in Eb Mixolydian  
Db (bVII) = Db F Ab — all in Eb Mixolydian  

Yes — all chords are diatonic to Eb Mixolydian.

---

### 5. Conclusion

**Key:** Eb  
**Mode:** Mixolydian

**Final answer:**

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**
    *   **Input:** A sequence of chords: `Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb`
    *   **Task:** Determine the key and mode.

2.  **Initial Analysis & Simplification:**
    *   The chords are a bit messy with all the repeated chords and slash chords. Let's simplify and look for the essential harmonic content.
    *   List the unique chords:
        *   `Eb` (major)
        *   `Cm/Eb` (C minor over an Eb bass)
        *   `Gdim/Db` (G diminished over a Db bass)
        *   `Fm/Eb` (F minor over an Eb bass)
        *   `Db6` (Db major 6th)

3.  **Analyze the Unique Chords:**
    *   `Eb`: This is a strong starting point. It's the first chord, the most frequent chord, and it's a plain major triad. It could be the tonic (I chord).
    *   `Cm/Eb`: Let's look at the notes. C minor is `C - Eb - G`. The bass is `Eb`. So the notes are `Eb - G - C` (from bottom to top). This is an `Cm7` chord in first inversion (`Cm7/Eb`). The notes are `C - Eb - G - Bb`. Wait, the chord is just `Cm/Eb`, not `Cm7/Eb`. So the notes are `C - Eb - G` over `Eb`. This is an `Eb` major chord with an added 6th (`Eb - G - Bb - C`), but written in a very convoluted way. Or, more simply, it's a `Cm` triad functioning over an `Eb` pedal point. This strongly reinforces `Eb` as the tonal center. The notes (`C`, `Eb`, `G`) are all diatonic to the key of Eb major.
    *   `Fm/Eb`: F minor is `F - Ab - C`. Over an `Eb` bass. This is a very common chord in rock and pop. It's an `Fm` triad, but the bass note `Eb` creates a strong pull. Let's analyze the notes together: `Eb - F - Ab - C`. This is an `Fm7` chord with the 7th in the bass (`Fm7/Eb`). The 7th of `Fm7` is `Eb`. This chord (`Fm7`) is the iv chord in the key of Eb major. The `Fm7/Eb` voicing is a classic "Amen Cadence" feel (`IV` to `I`), but here it's `iv7` to `I`. This is *very* common in minor keys, but also functions in major keys as a subdominant minor chord.
    *   `Gdim/Db`: This is the weirdest one. G diminished is `G - Bb - Db`. The bass is `Db`. So the notes are `Db - G - Bb`. Let's rearrange: `Db - G - Bb`. This is a `Db` major triad (`Db - F - Ab`) with a raised 5th (`G` instead of `Ab`). It's a `Db+` (Db augmented) triad. More likely, let's think of it functionally. `Gdim` is the leading tone chord to `Ab` (in Eb major) or `Ab` (in C minor). But the bass is `Db`. `Gdim/Db` could be a rootless `A7(b9)` chord. Let's check: `A7(b9)` is `A - C# - E - G - Bb`. Not quite. How about a `Bb7b9`? `Bb - D - F - Ab - Cb(B)`. No. Let's look at the notes again: `G - Bb - Db`. This is a `Gdim7` chord (fully diminished) without the 7th (`F`). `Gdim7` is `G - Bb - Db - F`. So we have `G - Bb - Db`. The bass is `Db`. What is `Gdim7`? It's a symmetrical chord. `Gdim7` can resolve to `Ab`, `Bb`, `Db`, or `E`. In the key of Eb major, it would resolve to `Ab` (the IV chord). The bass note being `Db` is strange. Let's re-examine the chord symbol. `Gdim/Db`. Is it possible it's a mis-transcription? Could it be `Gm7b5/Db`? That would be `G - Bb - Db - F` over `Db`. Still weird. Let's stick to the notes: `G, Bb, Db` over `Db`. This could be seen as a `Db`maj7(#11) without the 3rd and 7th. `Dbmaj7#11` is `Db - F - Ab - C - G`. We have `Db - G - Bb`. `Bb` is the #11 of `Db`. So it's `Db` with a #11. This is a Lydian sound. But the context doesn't strongly suggest Db Lydian. Let's consider another possibility. Maybe the `/Db` is a passing tone. The progression goes `Fm/Eb` -> `Gdim/Db`. The bass moves `Eb` -> `Db`. This is a descending chromatic bass line. The chords above it are `Fm` -> `Gdim`. This is a common progression (iim7b5 - V7b9 in minor, but here it's `iv` -> `vii°` in major). The `Gdim` chord strongly wants to resolve to `Ab` or `C`. The next chord is `Fm/Eb` again, which doesn't resolve it. Then it goes back to `Eb`. This chord is the most ambiguous part. Let's hold this thought.
    *   `Db6`: This is `Db - F - Ab - Bb`. The notes are all diatonic to the key of Eb major. `Db` is the bVII chord (flat-seven) in Eb major. This is a very common chord, especially in rock, pop, and blues. It often functions as a pre-dominant, leading to the IV chord (`Ab`) or back to the tonic (`Eb`).

4.  **Synthesizing the Chord Functions:**
    *   **Primary Tonic:** `Eb`. It's the home base.
    *   **Subdominant function:**
        *   `Fm/Eb` (`iv7`): A classic subdominant minor sound.
        *   `Db6` (`bVII`): Another common subdominant-type chord, often called the "rock dominant" or "subtonic".
    *   **Dominant function:** There is no clear dominant chord (`Bb7` or `Bb`). This is a major clue.
    *   **The weird chord:** `Gdim/Db`. Let's reconsider it in context. `Fm/Eb` -> `Gdim/Db` -> `Fm/Eb`. The bass is `Eb` -> `Db` -> `Eb`. The harmony is `Fm` -> `Gdim` -> `Fm`. This seems like a little decorative/contrapuntal flourish. The `Gdim` is acting as a passing chord, connecting two `Fm` chords while the bass does a little chromatic dip. The notes `G - Bb - Db` are all diatonic to Eb major. The function is primarily to create melodic and harmonic interest, not to establish a strong dominant pull. Given the lack of a `Bb` chord, the `Gdim` isn't functioning as a leading-tone chord to `Ab`. It's just a passing diminished chord. The `Db` in the bass is part of a descending line `Eb - Db`.

5.  **Evaluating Key and Mode Candidates:**

    *   **Candidate 1: Eb Major**
        *   **Chords:** `I` (Eb), `iv7` (Fm7/Eb), `bVII` (Db6), `vii°7` (Gdim7, sort of).
        *   **Pros:** All the notes of all the chords (`Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db`) are found in the Eb major scale except for `Db`. Wait, `Db` is not in Eb major. The scale is `Eb F G Ab Bb C D`. `Db` is a b2. The chord `Db6` contains `Db`. The chord `Gdim/Db` contains `Db`. This immediately rules out **pure Eb Major**. The presence of `Db` (the flat-2) is a strong indicator of a mode or a borrowed chord.

    *   **Candidate 2: C Minor (the relative minor)**
        *   **Chords:** `Eb` would be `bIII`, `Fm` would be `iv`, `Db` would be `bII` (Neapolitan), `Gdim` would be `vii°7/bII` (a leading tone chord to the Neapolitan).
        *   **Tonal Center?** The progression starts and ends on `Eb` and spends most of its time there. It feels like `Eb` is home, not `C`. So C minor is unlikely.

    *   **Candidate 3: Aeolian Mode (Natural Minor)**
        *   The problem with C minor (Aeolian) is that `Eb` feels like the tonic.

    *   **Candidate 4: Let's re-examine the `Db`.** It's the b2 of Eb. What mode has a flat-2? **Phrygian**.
        *   **Eb Phrygian:** The scale is `Eb Db C Bb Ab G F`.
        *   Let's check the chords against this scale:
            *   `Eb` (Imaj7): `Eb G Bb D`. The `D` is not in the Phrygian scale. But the plain triad `Eb` (`Eb G Bb`) is. The root chord is often a major triad in Phrygian, creating that characteristic tonality.
            *   `Cm/Eb`: This is `C Eb G` over `Eb`. `C`, `Eb`, `G` are all in the Phrygian scale. This works. It would be the `bVI` chord.
            *   `Fm/Eb`: This is `F Ab C` over `Eb`. `F`, `Ab`, `C` are all in the Phrygian scale. This works. It would be the `iv` chord.
            *   `Gdim/Db`: `G Bb Db` over `Db`. `G`, `Bb`, `Db` are all in the Phrygian scale. This works. This could be seen as `vii°` (G Bb Db F) over the `bII` bass note (`Db`).
            *   `Db6`: `Db F Ab Bb`. `Db`, `F`, `Ab`, `Bb` are all in the Phrygian scale. This is the `bII6` chord, the quintessential Phrygian cadence chord (often called a "Phrygian half-cadence" when it moves to the dominant, but here it's used differently).

6.  **Conclusion on Mode:**
    *   The presence of the `Db` (b2) is the most significant feature.
    *   The chords `Db6` and `Gdim/Db` both heavily feature the `Db`.
    *   Every single note used across all chords is contained within the Eb Phrygian scale.
    *   The harmonic feel is characteristic of Phrygian: a static tonic (`Eb`) with movement to the `bII` (`Db`) and `iv` (`Fm`) chords. The lack of a functional dominant (`Bb`) is also very typical of modal music.

7.  **Structuring the Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **Eb Phrygian**.
    *   Provide the "tl;dr" or main reasoning: The presence of the Db (the flat-2) is the deciding factor, ruling out major keys and pointing to Phrygian.
    *   Create a "Chord-by-Chord Analysis" section. This is where the detailed work from step 3 and 5 goes.
        *   Explain the role of `Eb` as the tonic.
        *   Explain the function of `Cm/Eb` and `Fm/Eb` as diatonic chords that reinforce the tonic (`Eb`).
        *   Address the `Db6` as the crucial `bII` chord, the hallmark of Phrygian.
        *   Analyze the `Gdim/Db` as a passing chord that also uses the Phrygian notes.
    *   Create a "Why it's not Eb Major" section. This is important for contrast.
        *   Point out the `Db` is not in the Eb major scale.
        *   Mention the lack of a dominant chord (`Bb`), which is expected in a major key progression.
    *   Create a "Summary of the Phrygian Sound" section.
        *   Describe the characteristic tonal "flavor": static, slightly dark or exotic.
        *   Mention the common Phrygian chord movements: `I` to `bII` (the Andalusian cadence is a related concept, though this isn't exactly it).
        *   Mention the use of the `iv` chord (`Fm`), which is also very common in Phrygian.
    *   Final concluding sentence to wrap it up neatly.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key and mode is **Eb Phrygian**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis.

### The Short Answer

The presence of the **Db** chord is the most important clue. In the key of Eb, the note Db is the flattened 2nd degree (b2). This note is the defining characteristic of the Phrygian mode. All the other chords support this interpretation, functioning diatonically within the Eb Phrygian scale.

### Detailed Analysis

Let's look at the chords and their function relative to an **Eb** tonal center. The scale notes for Eb Phrygian are: **Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db**.

1.  **The Tonic Center: Eb Major**
    *   The progression starts and ends on **Eb**.
    *   It's the most frequently occurring chord.
    *   This firmly establishes **Eb** as our tonal center, or the "I" chord.

2.  **The Defining Chord: Db6**
    *   The chord **Db6** contains the notes `Db - F - Ab - Bb`.
    *   The root, **Db**, is the **b2 (flattened second degree)** in the key of Eb.
    *   The b2 is the signature note of the Phrygian mode. In a standard major or minor key, this chord would be considered a "borrowed chord," but here it feels foundational.
    *   This chord functions as the **bII** chord in Eb Phrygian.

3.  **The Other Chords (Reinforcing Phrygian)**
    *   **Cm/Eb** and **Fm/Eb**: These are slash chords that function as a type of pedal point. The bass stays on the tonic **Eb** while the harmony moves above it.
        *   **Fm/Eb**: The notes are `F - Ab - C` over an `Eb` bass. This is an **Fm7** chord (`F - Ab - C - Eb`) with the 7th in the bass. This is the **iv** chord in Eb Phrygian, a very common and strong chord in the mode.
        *   **Cm/Eb**: The notes are `C - Eb - G` over an `Eb` bass. This is the **bVI** chord in Eb Phrygian. It also strongly reinforces the tonic feel.
    *   **Gdim/Db**: This is the most complex chord, but it fits perfectly.
        *   The notes of G diminished are `G - Bb - Db`.
        *   Played over a **Db** bass, the combined notes are `Db - G - Bb`. All three of these notes are in the Eb Phrygian scale.
        *   Functionally, this acts as a colorful passing chord. The bass line `Eb` to `Db` (in Fm/Eb to Gdim/Db) is a descending step, and the Gdim adds harmonic tension that resolves back to the Fm/Eb and ultimately the Eb tonic. It can be seen as a vii° chord built on the 3rd of the bII chord.

### Why It's Not Eb Major

The progression strongly centers on **Eb**, so one might initially assume Eb major. However, two key features rule this out:

1.  **The Db Note**: The note **Db** does not exist in the Eb major scale (`Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D`). Its appearance is not accidental; it's a core part of the harmony.
2.  **Lack of a Dominant Chord**: A progression in Eb major would almost certainly feature a dominant chord (**Bb** or **Bb7**) to create tension and resolution back to the tonic. This progression completely lacks a dominant function, which is very typical of modal music where the focus is on the "color" of the mode rather than functional tension and release.

### Summary of the Phrygian Sound

This progression perfectly captures the classic Phrygian feel:
*   **A strong, static tonic chord** (Eb).
*   **Movement to the characteristic bII chord** (Db6), which gives the mode its unique, exotic, and slightly tense flavor.
*   **Use of the minor iv chord** (Fm), another common color in Phrygian.
*   **Absence of a functional dominant** (V chord).

Therefore, the key is **Eb Phrygian**.
