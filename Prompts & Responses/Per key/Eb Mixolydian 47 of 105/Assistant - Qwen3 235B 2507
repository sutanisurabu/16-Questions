Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**
Eb – Eb – Cm/Eb – Cm/Eb – Gdim/Db – Fm/Eb – Eb –  
Eb – Cm/Eb – Cm/Eb – Eb – Eb – Db6 – Eb

### Step 1: Identify the Chords
Let’s write out the chords and their **roots and qualities**:

1. **Eb** = E♭ major  
2. **Cm/Eb** = C minor with E♭ in the bass → chord is C minor, root C, but bass is E♭  
3. **Gdim/Db** = G diminished with D♭ in the bass → G diminished = G–B♭–D♭ (same as F♯–A–C), and D♭ = C♯, so this is Gdim with D♭ (enharmonic) in bass → likely functions as a **diminished chord** descending  
4. **Fm/Eb** = F minor with E♭ in the bass → F minor chord, root F, bass E♭  
5. **Db6** = D♭ major 6th: D♭–F–A♭–B♭

So let’s list the **roots** of the chords (ignoring inversions for now):

- Eb (I)
- Cm (vi)
- Cm (vi)
- Gdim (iii°)
- Fm (iv)
- Eb (I)
- Eb
- Cm
- Cm
- Eb
- Eb
- Db6
- Eb

But let’s also note the **bassline** since inversions are given:

Bass notes:  
Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Db – Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Eb – Db – Eb

So the bass moves:
- Mostly **Eb**
- Then briefly **Db**, then back to **Eb**

So strong emphasis on **Eb** as tonic, especially at the beginning and end.

### Step 2: Look at Harmonic Function

Now analyze the chords in the key of **Eb major**:
- Eb = **I**
- Cm = **vi**
- Gdim = **iii°**
- Fm = **ii**
- Db6 = D♭–F–A♭–B♭ → this is **bVI6** in Eb major

So in Eb major:
- I: Eb
- vi: Cm
- iii°: Gdim
- ii: Fm
- bVI6: Db6

Wait — Db6 is **not diatonic** to Eb major.  
In Eb major, the VI chord is C minor, not Db. D♭ is **flat VI** — so **bVI**, which is borrowed from the **parallel minor**.

So Db is bVI in **Eb minor**, but here it’s a **major 6th chord (Db6)** — D♭–F–A♭–B♭.

But in **Eb minor**, the VI chord is C♭ (not practical), but enharmonically D♭ might be used. However, **F** is not in Eb natural minor — Eb minor is: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db.

So **F natural** appears in Db6 — that’s not in Eb natural minor.

But in **Eb Dorian**, we have:  
Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db

Still no **F natural chord with F major**.

Wait — Db6 contains: D♭, F, A♭, B♭  
That’s: 1, 3, 5, 6 of Db

So Db major 6th chord — but Db major is not in Eb major or minor.

But Db is the **flat VI degree** in **E major**, but not relevant.

Alternatively, maybe **Cm6**? No — it’s written as **Db6**, which is different.

Wait — could this be a **German augmented sixth chord**?

German 6th in Eb:  
A German augmented sixth in **Eb** would have: G♭ (F), A♭, B, D♭ — resolves to Eb.

But Db6 = Db–F–Ab–Bb → that's **Db–F–Ab–Bb** = 1–3–5–6 — that’s actually the **same as a Bb7 in first inversion?**

Wait:

Bb7 = Bb–D–F–Ab  
But Db6 = Db–F–Ab–Bb → that’s **Db–F–Ab–Bb**

Rearranged: Bb–Db–F–Ab → that’s **Bb7** without the D (has Db instead). Db is enharmonic to C#, not D.

No — Db is **not** D. So it's **Bb–Db–F–Ab** = intervals: Bb–Db (m3), Db–F (M3), F–Ab (m3) → so **Bb–Db–F–Ab** = **Bb minor 7**? No — Bb to F is a **diminished fifth** (Bb–F = tritone), but Bb–F is actually a **P5** in equal temperament, just spelled as augmented fourth if needed.

Wait: Bb to F is a perfect fifth.
Db to F is a major third.
F to Ab is a minor third.

So Bb–Db–F–Ab = Bb **half-diminished?** No: Bb–Db = m3, Db–F = M3, F–Ab = m3 → stacked: m3, M3, m3 = **minor 7th chord on Bb?**

But Bb minor 7 is Bb–Db–F–Ab → yes, exactly.

Wait — Db6 = Db–F–Ab–Bb → same notes as Bb–Db–F–Ab → that’s **Bbm7** in third inversion.

So **Db6 ≡ Bbm7/Cb?** In third inversion: Bbm7 with Bb on top? No, bass is Db.

- Chord: Db6 in bass = Db
- Notes: Db, F, Ab, Bb → so that’s **Db6**
- But enharmonically, it's the **same pitches** as Bb7(b5)? No.

Actually, **Db6** is its own thing: a Db major triad with a 6th (Bb). So it's **not** a dominant 7 chord.

But here's a thought: in **Bb minor**, the iv chord is Ebm — no.

Alternatively, could this be a **Neapolitan chord**?

In **Eb major**, the Neapolitan is **Fb**, not Db.

But in **C minor**, the Neapolitan is **Db**.

Wait — let's consider **C minor**.

In **C minor**, the Neapolitan is **Db major**, often in first inversion (N6), and it leads to the dominant (G or G7), resolving to C minor.

But here, we have **Db6**, then **Eb** — so **Db6 → Eb**

That could be **N → I**, if in **C minor**.

But the final chord is **Eb**, not C minor.

But the progression ends on **Eb**, and starts on **Eb** — so Eb feels like **tonic**.

But the chord **Db6 → Eb** — that's like **bII → I**, which is the **Neapolitan resolution** — very common in **minor keys**.

So **Db major → Eb major** = **bII → I**, which is the **Neapolitan resolving to tonic**, a very strong cadence in **Eb minor**.

Ah! So that suggests the key is **Eb minor**, not Eb major.

Let’s test that.

### Try: Key of **Eb minor**

Eb natural minor:
- Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db

But we have chords:
- Eb: i
- Cm: ♭VI (since Cb would be normal VI, so C natural = ♯VI? No — C minor is **not diatonic to Eb minor**)
- In Eb minor: the VI chord is **Cb major** — but we have **C minor** = C–Eb–G — but C is not in Eb minor (has Cb), so C natural is chromatic.

Wait — perhaps **C harmonic minor**?

Hold on — maybe the key is **C minor**, and **Eb is the relative major?**

No — the progression starts and ends on Eb.

But let’s look at the **most common root movement**:

Chord roots:
Eb → Cm → Cm → Gdim → Fm → Eb → Eb → Cm → Cm → Eb → Eb → Db6 → Eb

So root movement:
Eb ← Cm ← Gdim ← Fm ← Eb

The sequence: Gdim → Fm → Eb

Gdim = G–Bb–Db  
Fm = F–Ab–C  
Eb = Eb–G–Bb

Is there a functional progression?

Gdim to Fm: roots move down by major second — not standard.

Fm to Eb: root down by semitone — common in minor: iv–bIII–bII–I

Wait — in **Eb minor**, the common borrowed chords:
- bIII = Gb major
- bVI = Cb major
- bII = Db major (Neapolitan)
- iv = Ab minor

But we have:
- Fm = **iv** in **C minor**
- Cm = **i** in C minor
- Eb = **bIII** in C minor
- Gdim = **ii°** in C harmonic minor
- Db6 = bII in C minor? No — bII in C minor is Db major — but we are in Eb?

Wait — let's try **C minor**.

In **C minor**:
- Cm = i
- Eb = III (major, from harmonic or melodic minor)
- Fm = iv
- Gdim = ii°
- Db = bII = Neapolitan

So progression becomes:
Eb – Eb – Cm – Cm – Gdim – Fm – Eb – Eb – Cm – Cm – Eb – Eb – Db6 – Eb

In C minor:
- Eb = **III**
- Cm = **i**
- Gdim = **ii°**
- Fm = **iv**
- Db6 = **bII6**
- Back to Eb = **III**

But it ends on **Eb**, not Cm.

So it starts with **III**, goes to **i**, **ii°**, **iv**, **III**, then to **bII** (Neapolitan), then back to **III**

But doesn’t end on tonic — ends on **III**, which is **Eb**

So if it ends and starts on **Eb**, and doesn’t resolve to Cm, then **Cm can't be the tonic**.

Thus, **Eb is the tonic**, and it's **Eb minor**, because:

- **Db6 → Eb** = **bII → i** = Neapolitan to tonic — a **very strong cadence in minor keys**
- **Fm** = iv in Eb minor
- **Cm** = VI (but in minor, bVI is Cb — so C minor is **not diatonic**)
- **Gdim** = iii° in Eb minor? Eb minor: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db → G is not in scale — G natural is raised

Wait — Gdim = G–Bb–Db

In **Eb harmonic minor**, we raise the 7th: D natural.

But G is not in Eb harmonic minor — chords built on 3rd degree: Gb–Bb–Db = Gb major

No G natural.

But **Gdim** could be **a diminished chord leading to Gb or Ab**, but not directly.

Alternatively, is **Gdim** a passing chord between Cm and Fm?

Cm = C–Eb–G  
Gdim = G–Bb–Db  
Fm = F–Ab–C

Notice:
- Cm → Gdim: shares G
- Gdim → Fm: voice leading — G to F? Bb to Ab? Db to C? Not strong.

Perhaps **Gdim** is functioning as a **common-tone diminished chord**?

Or perhaps it’s **vii° of Ab**? vii° of Ab is G–Bb–Db — yes, Gdim is **vii° of Ab**, which is the IV in Eb.

But we go **Gdim → Fm**, not Ab.

Fm is **iv** in Eb.

So not supporting that.

Alternative idea: **Modal mixture**.

Back to **Eb minor**:

Suppose the key is **Eb minor**, but using **borrowed chords**.

We have:
- Eb = i
- Cm = ?? (this is tricky — in Eb minor, C natural is ♯VI — not typical)
- But Cm is **VI** in **G minor**? Not helpful.

Wait — perhaps **relative key**.

Cm is the **relative minor of Eb major**.

Ah! Here’s a better idea:

### Try: **Key of Eb major**

Eb major:  
Cm = vi  
Fm = ii  
Gdim = iii°  
Db6 = bVI6 → borrowed from **Eb minor**

So the progression:
- I (Eb)
- vi (Cm)
- iii° (Gdim)
- ii (Fm)
- I (Eb)
- then later: bVI6 (Db6) → I (Eb)

The **bVI → I** move is a **common modal mixture** (from minor), often called a **backdoor progression** — in fact, **bVII → I** is more common (e.g., Ab → Eb), but **bVI → I** also occurs in modal mixture.

But Db is **not** bVII — bVII in Eb is Db? No:

Eb major:
- bVII = Db major? No — VII is D diminished, bVII is Db major — yes: Db major is **bVII**

Wait! **Db major is bVII in Eb major**, not bVI.

Let’s clarify:

In **Eb major**:
- I = Eb
- ii = Fm
- iii = Gm
- IV = Ab
- V = Bb
- vi = Cm
- vii° = Ddim

So:
- **Db major = Db–F–Ab–Bb** (in Db6) — so **Db major triad + Bb**

Db major is **not diatonic to Eb major** — but it **is** the **bVII chord**?

bVII in Eb: flat the 7th scale degree: D → Db

So **bVII = Db major**

Yes! So in **Eb major**, you can borrow **bVII** from the **parallel minor**, and it’s very common (e.g., in rock: I–bVII–IV–I)

So **Db6** is **bVII6**, which is the **flat seventh chord**, and **Db6 → Eb** is a **plagal or backdoor-type cadence**, very common.

Also, **bVII → I** is a strong cadence in rock and pop.

Moreover, **Cm/Eb** = vi chord in first inversion — very common in I–vi–ii–V or similar.

So progression:
- I → vi → vi → iii° → ii → I → I → vi → vi → I → I → bVII6 → I

Yes — all makes sense in **Eb major**, with modal mixture.

The **Gdim** is diatonic (iii°) — often used as a passing chord.

**Cm** is vi — common

**Fm** is ii — standard

**bVII (Db)** borrowed from minor — very common

So the **key is Eb major**

### Mode = Major (Ionian)

### Final Answer:

**Key: Eb major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

Let me confirm the Db6 → Eb:  
- Db6 (bVII6) → I = common in pop/rock — e.g., “Get Back” by Beatles, “Losing My Religion” by R.E.M., etc.

Yes.

Even though Cm/Eb and the prominence of Cm might suggest relative minor, the **tonic chord is Eb**, which starts, ends, and appears most frequently — and the cadence **bVII → I** is a strong indicator of major key with modal borrowing.

### ✅ Conclusion:
**Key: Eb major**  
**Mode: Major (Ionian)**
