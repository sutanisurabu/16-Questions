**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

**Key: Eb**  
**Mode: Mixolydian**  

This progression centers tonally on Eb as the tonic, with repeated Eb chords framing the structure and providing resolution. The mode is Mixolydian due to the characteristic â™­7 (Db) introduced via the Gdim/Db and Db6 chords, alongside the absence of the natural 7th (D). All chords (Eb, Cm/Eb, Fm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Db6) derive from the Eb Mixolydian scale (Eb F G Ab Bb C Db), with the bVII (Db6) functioning as a common plagal resolution to I (Eb). No notes outside this scale appear, creating a consistent modal flavor often heard in jazz, pop, or rock standards.
