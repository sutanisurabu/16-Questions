### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking at a chord sequence with bass notes, and it seems like it’s heavily based in Eb major. The Eb major scale includes Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, and D. Analyzing the chords, I see that Cm/Eb is actually the first inversion of C minor, which is the vi chord in Eb major. So that makes it vi6. The Gdim/Db is a dim triad likely built on G, Bb, and Db.**Exploring G diminished chord**

I’m analyzing the G diminished chord, which consists of G, Bb, and Db. Over a Db bass, it appears as the second inversion because Db is the fifth in the triad. While looking at the Eb major scale, G diminished isn't diatonic because it includes Db, which is the flat sixth degree. This suggests that Gdim functions as a passing chord or a leading tone that resolves to Ab, since it naturally leads to the Ab minor context.**Understanding chord functions**

I’m exploring how G diminished functions as a leading tone to Ab in Ab major/minor. In Eb major, Ab is the IV chord, and Gdim acts as a vii°/IV. So, with Db in the bass, it’s the second inversion. Moving on to Fm/Eb, I see that Fm (F, Ab, C) over an Eb bass gives a sense of ii6/5, but it's actually more like a ii7 chord since it lacks the Eb. Fm over Eb gives a seventh chord feel due to the stacking.**Clarifying chord structure**

I’m analyzing the Fm/Eb chord, which consists of F, Ab, and C over an Eb bass. This forms an Fm7 with the seventh (Eb) as the bass note, making it a ii7 in third inversion. Although it lacks explicit labeling, it's functioning as ii7/Eb. Moving on to the Db6 chord, I realize it's a major triad with an added sixth. This borrowed chord could be seen as a bII in Eb major, with bVI confirming as Cb, which confuses me a bit!**Determining key and mode**

I’m considering the Db chord, which acts as bII in Eb major and is related to the Neapolitan function. A Db6 chord could indicate a Neapolitan sixth, but with a major sixth added, suggesting ambiguity. The recurring Db in the progression, along with the continual emphasis on Eb, points towards a modal center. This suggests it might be in Eb mixolydian, as both Gdim and Db6 align with its characteristics, forming a bVII to I cadence. The entire progression fits diatonically within Eb mixolydian as seen in the shared notes.**Finalizing key and mode**

The mode is Eb mixolydian, with the key signature being Ab major (4 flats). Our tonic center is Eb. The key center is Eb, and the mode is specifically mixolydian. All chords are diatonic to Eb mixolydian, including Eb (I), Cm/Eb (vi6), Gdim/Db (iii°6/4), Fm/Eb (ii7), and Db6 (bVII add6). The presence of Db indicates a b7 scale degree, reinforcing the mixolydian mode. 

- Tonic: Eb  
- Mode: Mixolydian (b7 = Db)  
- Diatonic evidence: Eb, Cm/Eb (vi6), G°/Db (iii°6/4), Fm/Eb (ii7), Db6 (bVII).

Eb Mixolydian (tonic Eb, mode mixolydian)

- All chords fit Eb mixolydian (same key signature as Ab major): Eb (I), Cm/Eb (vi6), Gdim/Db (iii°6/4), Fm/Eb (ii7 4/2), Db6 (bVII add6), resolving to Eb.
- The presence of Db (b7) and absence of D natural point to mixolydian rather than Eb major.
