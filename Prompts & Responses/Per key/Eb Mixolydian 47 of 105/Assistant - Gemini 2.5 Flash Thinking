### Reasoning

**Deciphering the Chords**

I'm currently breaking down the chord progression to understand its structure. The initial focus is on identifying the specific chords present, including inversions like Cm/Eb and Gdim/Db. Next, I plan to analyze the relationships between these chords to determine the key and mode.


**Unpacking the Harmony**

I'm now investigating the non-diatonic chords. The Gdim/Db is the current puzzle, since the notes don't directly align with the Eb major scale. I'm considering possible chromatic alterations or borrowed chords, and how it might be functioning within the progression. My focus is on determining its purpose and resolution within the phrase.


**Unveiling the Modal Flavor**

The inclusion of Db6 and the presence of Gdim/Db, which isn't diatonic to Eb major, has shifted my thinking towards a modal context. It looks like we are in Eb major, but with the bVII chord borrowed from the Mixolydian, Aeolian, or Dorian modes. The harmonic movement and the bVII chord are giving a strong signal that this piece is borrowing from these modes.


**Final Mode Assessment**

I've carefully analyzed the non-diatonic elements, especially Gdim/Db and Db6. While the presence of the bVII chord points to Mixolydian, the consistent use of Fm and Cm chords from Eb major reveals a borrowing from the Eb Aeolian, or natural minor. Overall, I conclude that we are in Eb major, with borrowing from Aeolian.


**Concluding the Analysis**

I've reached my final assessment. The piece is firmly rooted in Eb major, thanks to the chord qualities and their established major tonic. However, the use of Db6 (bVII) indicates a borrowing from the Aeolian mode, bringing a subtle blues-inspired flavor to the harmony. The analysis is now complete.


**Determining Key and Mode**

My analysis has progressed. I've pinpointed Eb as the tonal center and am now weighing the significance of the Db6 chord. It's clear that the piece is predominantly in Eb major, but the Db6 introduces a modal flavor. I am considering borrowed chords, such as bVII, from parallel modes like Aeolian or Mixolydian. The next step is synthesizing this information to make a final mode determination.




This chord progression establishes a clear tonal center and uses elements of modal borrowing.

## Key and Mode Determination

1.  **Identify the Tonal Center (Tonic):**
    The progression begins and ends on **Eb** and features it repeatedly as the primary chord. Therefore, the key center is **Eb**.

2.  **Analyze Diatonic Chords:**
    The core chords used are:
    *   **Eb Major** (I)
    *   **Fm** (F minor) (ii)
    *   **Cm** (C minor) (vi)

    These three chords (I-ii-vi) are perfectly diatonic to **Eb Major**. The use of C minor and F minor firmly establishes the major scale structure (specifically, the sixth and second degrees are natural).

3.  **Analyze Non-Diatonic/Ambiguous Chords:**

    *   **Db6:** The chord Db major (Db-F-Ab) is the **bVII** chord relative to Eb. In Eb Major, the seventh degree is D natural, leading to the D diminished chord (viiÂ°) or the D being part of the dominant Bb chord (V). The use of the D-flat (b7) is a strong indicator of **modal borrowing**, typically from Eb Aeolian (natural minor) or frequently used in rock/pop harmony to lead back to the tonic (bVII -> I).

    *   **Gdim/Db:** G diminished (G-Bb-Db) functions harmonically as a passing or substitution chord. It often acts as a surrogate dominant (V) to the relative minor (Cm).

4.  **Conclusion:**

The overwhelming evidence points to **Eb Major** as the primary mode, as the major tonic and the diatonic supertonic (Fm) and submediant (Cm) are utilized. The Db6 chord is a common instance of **modal mixture (borrowing)**, adding a distinctive flavor without changing the fundamental major mode.

**Key:** **Eb**
**Mode:** **Major** (with modal borrowing from the parallel minor/Aeolian).
