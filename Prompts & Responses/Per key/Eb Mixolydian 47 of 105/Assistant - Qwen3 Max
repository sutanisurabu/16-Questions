Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**

> **Eb – Eb – Cm/Eb – Cm/Eb – Gdim/Db – Fm/Eb – Eb – Eb – Cm/Eb – Cm/Eb – Eb – Eb – Db6 – Eb**

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center

The progression **starts and ends on Eb**, and **Eb appears very frequently** — this strongly suggests **Eb is the tonic** (home chord).

### Step 2: Look at the chords used

Let’s list the unique chords (ignoring bass inversions for now):

- **Eb** (E♭ major triad): I chord if in E♭ major
- **Cm** (C minor): vi chord in E♭ major
- **Gdim** (G diminished): vii° chord in A♭ major, but also appears as #v° in E♭ minor or as a chromatic passing chord
- **Fm** (F minor): ii chord in E♭ major? Wait—**F minor is not in E♭ major** (E♭ major has F **minor**? No — E♭ major scale is: E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D → so F is **major**, so F minor is **not diatonic** to E♭ major)
- **Db6** (D♭6 = D♭ major with added 6th → D♭, F, A♭, B♭): This is a major chord with a 6th, built on D♭

So let’s consider **E♭ minor** instead.

E♭ natural minor scale: **E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭**

But we see **C natural** (in Cm chord: C–E♭–G), and **G natural** (in Gdim: G–B♭–D♭), and **D natural** (in Db6? Wait—Db6 has B♭ as the 6th, which is fine, but does it have D natural? No—it has D♭ as root, F, A♭, and B♭. So no D natural.)

Wait: hold on—**Cm chord contains C–E♭–G**, which includes **G natural**, not G♭. In **E♭ natural minor**, the 6th scale degree is **C♭**, not C natural, and the 3rd of the C chord would be E♭ (ok), but root C vs C♭ is a problem.

So C natural is **not in E♭ natural minor**.

But **C natural is in E♭ harmonic minor** and **E♭ melodic minor**.

E♭ harmonic minor: **E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♮**

Wait—still has **C♭**, not C♮.

Hold on—maybe we’re better off thinking **relative major**.

What if the key is **G♭ major**? That seems remote.

Alternatively, consider **E♭ as tonic, but using chords from C minor** (relative minor of E♭ major). Wait—**C minor is the relative minor of E♭ major**.

In **E♭ major**, the diatonic chords are:

- I: E♭
- ii: Fm
- iii: Gm
- IV: A♭
- V: B♭
- vi: Cm
- vii°: D°

But in our progression, we have:

- E♭ → ✅ I
- Cm → ✅ vi
- Fm → ✅ ii
- Gdim → **not diatonic** (should be Gm, not Gdim)
- D♭6 → **not diatonic** (D♭ is bVII in E♭ major — that’s a common modal mixture chord)

Ah! **D♭ major (bVII)** is a common chord borrowed from **E♭ mixolydian** or used in **modal mixture** (from E♭ minor).

Also, **Gdim**: in E♭ major, the vii° is **D°**, not G°. So G° is not in key.

But **G°** can be seen as a **secondary leading-tone chord**. For example:

- G° = vii° of A♭ (since A♭ is IV in E♭)
- But here it’s **Gdim/Db**, so the bass is D♭.

Gdim = G–B♭–D♭. Over D♭ bass, it’s a **D♭ diminished chord in first inversion**, which is enharmonically the same as **A diminished** or **B diminished**, but more usefully: **G°/D♭ = D♭–G–B♭** — that’s actually a **D♭7♭5** without the 7th? Hmm.

Alternatively, consider **G° as vii° of A♭**, and A♭ is IV in E♭.

But perhaps more telling: **the presence of D♭ (bVII)** and **C natural (in Cm)** suggests we are in **E♭ major**, using **modal interchange** from **E♭ minor**.

In **E♭ minor**, the chords include:

- i: E♭m (not used — we have E♭ major)
- bIII: G♭ major
- bVI: C♭ major (enharmonic to B major – not used)
- bVII: D♭ major → ✅ used as D♭6
- ii°: F°
- iv: A♭m
- vi°: C°

But we have **Cm (minor with C natural)** — that doesn’t fit E♭ minor.

Wait a minute—**Cm is diatonic to E♭ major** as the **vi chord**.

So:

- **E♭ major**: contains E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D
- Chords:
  - E♭ = I
  - Cm = vi
  - Fm = **not diatonic** → F should be F minor? No! In E♭ major, F is **minor?** Wait:

E♭ major scale:  
1. E♭  
2. F  
3. G  
4. A♭  
5. B♭  
6. C  
7. D  

→ So ii chord is **F minor?** Wait, triad on F: F–A–C → **F major**, because A is natural in E♭ major.

Hold on—**A is natural in E♭ major**, so F–A–C = **F major**, not F minor.

Therefore, **F minor** is **not in E♭ major**.

But **F minor is in C minor** (relative minor). Wait—C minor scale: C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭

→ F minor = F–A♭–C → yes, that’s diatonic to **C minor**.

But our tonic seems to be **E♭**, not C.

So maybe the key is **C minor**, and E♭ is the **♭III**, which is a common tonicized chord in minor keys.

But the progression **starts and ends on E♭**, and E♭ is used more than Cm.

Also, **Db6** = D♭ major with added 6th = D♭–F–A♭–B♭

In **C minor**, D♭ is **♭II**, which is a **Neapolitan chord** — very common.

And **Gdim** is the **vii° of A♭**, and A♭ is ♭VI in C minor.

But again, the tonal center feels like **E♭**, not C.

Let’s consider **modes**.

What if the key is **E♭ Mixolydian**?

E♭ Mixolydian = E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭

→ This scale has **D♭ instead of D♮**

Now check the chords:

- E♭ = I ✅
- Cm = C–E♭–G → C is 6th degree → Cm = vi ✅ (C–E♭–G are all in E♭ Mixolydian)
- Fm = F–A♭–C → F is 2nd degree → in Mixolydian, F chord is **F minor**? Let's see: F–A♭–C → A♭ is in the scale (yes) → so **F minor is diatonic to E♭ Mixolydian!**

Yes! Because E♭ Mixolydian has **A♭**, not A♮, so F chord is **F minor**.

- Gdim = G–B♭–D♭ → G is 3rd degree: G–B♭–D♭ → all in E♭ Mixolydian → **G° is the iii° chord** in Mixolydian! (In major, it's G minor; in Mixolydian, because of D♭, it becomes diminished)

- D♭6 = D♭–F–A♭–B♭ → D♭ is the ♭7 degree → **♭VII chord**, which is **major** in Mixolydian (D♭–F–A♭) + 6th (B♭) → fully diatonic!

So **ALL chords are diatonic to E♭ Mixolydian**:

- E♭ = I
- Cm = vi
- Fm = ii
- G° = iii°
- D♭ = ♭VII

Perfect fit!

### Conclusion:

- **Key center**: E♭  
- **Mode**: **Mixolydian**

Because the scale required to explain all chords (especially Fm, G°, and D♭) is **E♭ Mixolydian** (E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭).

✅ All chords are diatonic to **E♭ Mixolydian**.
