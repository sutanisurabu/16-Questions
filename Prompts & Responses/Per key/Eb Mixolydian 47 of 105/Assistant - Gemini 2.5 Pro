### Reasoning

**Deconstructing the Chords**

I've started by examining the provided chord progression, aiming to break it down systematically. My initial step involves identifying each individual chord within the sequence: Eb, Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb, etc. I'm focusing on accurately noting all the chords and inversions presented.


**Identifying Potential Keys**

I'm now leaning towards an Eb major key, given the repeated Eb chords. I'm focusing on the Gdim/Db chord, trying to understand its place in relation to the overall key signature. Further, I'm examining how the Db6 functions, noting its potential as a borrowed chord.


**Exploring Pedal Point Dynamics**

I'm now zeroing in on the bassline's impact, particularly the Eb pedal point. It really shifts the focus, as the harmony unfolds *above* that static tonic. The lone Db in the bass before the Eb chord creates a strong pull. The fact that Eb major triads are repeated reinforces it as the tonal center.


**Considering Harmonic Functions**

I'm now deep-diving into the function of each chord, building on the initial key determination. The frequent inversions, particularly the Cm and Fm chords, have prompted me to focus on the bassline's role. I'm exploring how these chords contribute to the overall movement.


**Synthesizing the Key and Mode**

The progression strongly suggests Eb major, given the Eb chords and pedal point. I've pinpointed the functions of all chords, recognizing how the bVII (Db6) adds a unique flavor. The Gdim/Db acts as a chromatic passing chord, resolving nicely to Fm. I'm confident now in my conclusions.


**Refining Mode and Function**

The presence of the Db6 and Gdim/Db chords confirms my suspicions of Mixolydian influence. I'm now certain of the Eb major key, but the bVII and chromatic passing chord give the progression a distinct character. I'm focused on how the bVII chord resolves.


**Determining the Modal Flavor**

Now, I'm analyzing the implications of the bVII chord's presence within the Eb key. The Db6 specifically points to a Mixolydian influence. Further, I'm evaluating its resolution, assessing how the bVII chord resolves into the other chords.


**Reflecting on the Gdim**

I'm now focusing on the diminished chord, its tension, and its chromatic nature. I'm exploring how the Gdim/Db functions as a passing chord, adding interest. I now understand it resolves nicely to the Fm chord.




Excellent question. Let's break down this progression.

### Analysis

1.  **Tonal Center:** The progression starts and ends on an **Eb** chord. Furthermore, nearly the entire progression is played over an **Eb pedal point** in the bass (`Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb... Fm/Eb Eb Eb...`), which powerfully establishes **Eb** as the root and tonal center.

2.  **Chord Quality:** The tonic chord is **Eb major** (Eb-G-Bb), not Eb minor. This tells us we are in a major-type key or mode.

3.  **The "Color" Notes:** The key to identifying the specific mode lies in the notes that fall outside of the standard Eb major scale (Eb F G Ab Bb C D).
    *   The chords `Gdim/Db` and `Db6` both contain the note **Db**.
    *   In the key of Eb, the note Db is the **flattened 7th** degree (the 7th degree of Eb major is D natural).

4.  **Putting it Together:**
    *   We have a major tonic chord (Eb).
    *   We have a flattened 7th degree (Db).

    A major scale with a flattened 7th is the defining characteristic of the **Mixolydian mode**.

Let's check the chords against the Eb Mixolydian scale (Eb F G Ab Bb C Db):

*   **Eb** (Eb-G-Bb): The **I** chord. Fits perfectly.
*   **Cm** (C-Eb-G): The **vi** chord. Fits perfectly.
*   **Fm** (F-Ab-C): The **ii** chord. Fits perfectly.
*   **Gdim** (G-Bb-Db): The **iiiÂ°** (diminished) chord. This triad is naturally occurring on the third degree of the Mixolydian mode. Perfect fit.
*   **Db6** (Db-F-Ab-Bb): The **bVII** chord with an added 6th. This is the signature chord of the Mixolydian sound. Fits perfectly.

### Conclusion

The key and mode are:

**Key: Eb**
**Mode: Mixolydian**
