Let’s look at your progression:  

```
Eb   Eb   Cm/Eb   Cm/Eb   Gdim/Db   Fm/Eb   Eb   Eb   
Cm/Eb   Cm/Eb   Eb   Eb   Db6   Eb
```

### Step 1: Identify key candidates
- Strong presence of **Eb** chords → likely **Eb major** or **Eb minor**.
- Chords in Eb major are: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim.
- You have **Cm** (fits), **Fm** (fits), **Gdim** (fits as vii°), and **Db6** (borrowed chord).

### Step 2: Check harmonic function
- The sequence heavily centers around **Eb** (tonic).
- **Cm/Eb** acts like a tonic prolongation (vi in rootless 1st inversion).
- **Fm/Eb** also shares Eb in the bass (iv/tonic pedal).
- **Gdim/Db** could serve as a passing chord approaching Fm (ii°7/V or vii°/ii type effect).
- **Db6** (borrowed from the parallel minor or as a ♭VI chord) is common as a color chord in Eb major.

### Step 3: Mode determination
Everything fits **Eb major** with a single modal interchange (the **Db6**, from the parallel minor).

✅ **Key:** Eb major  
✅ **Mode:** Ionian (major), with occasional borrowed ♭VI (Db6) from the parallel minor

---

**Summary:**
- **Tonal center:** Eb  
- **Mode:** Eb Ionian (Major)  
- **Borrowed chord:** Db6 (♭VI from Eb minor)
