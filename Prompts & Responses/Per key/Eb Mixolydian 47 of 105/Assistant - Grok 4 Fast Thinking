**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast Thinking**

### Analysis of the Chord Progression
The given progression is: **Eb - Eb - Cm/Eb - Cm/Eb - Gdim/Db - Fm/Eb - Eb - Eb - Cm/Eb - Cm/Eb - Eb - Eb - Db6 - Eb**.

This is a repetitive, jazz ballad-style sequence with mostly Eb bass notes and some passing harmony. I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step.

#### Step 1: Identifying the Tonic (Root/Key Center)
- The progression starts, repeats, and resolves heavily on **Eb** (7 out of 14 chords, plus frequent Eb bass).
- It ends on **Db6 - Eb**, pulling strongly back to Eb as the resolution (V7-of-V or bVII - I feel).
- No other chord competes as tonic (e.g., Cm feels like a subdominant pull, not resolution).
- **Tonic: Eb**.

#### Step 2: Diatonic Chords and Scale Fit
Eb major (Ionian) scale: **Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D**  
Common chords:  
- Eb (I)  
- Cm (vi)  
- Fm (iv)  

However:  
- **Gdim/Db** (G - Bb - Db triad over Db bass) introduces **Db** (not in Eb major; D natural would be expected for diatonic vii° = D - F - Ab).  
- **Db6** (Db - F - Ab - Bb) is fully based on **Db**, the flat subtonic (bVII).  

These suggest a mode with **Db** (b7) instead of **D** (7), making everything diatonic.

Eb Mixolydian scale: **Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db** (5th mode of Ab major; major scale with flattened 7th).  
Diatonic chords (all fit perfectly):  
- **Eb**: I (Eb - G - Bb)  
- **Cm** (or Cm/Eb): vi (C - Eb - G)  
- **Fm** (or Fm/Eb): iv (F - Ab - C)  
- **Gdim** (or Gdim/Db): ♭vi° or passing dim (G - Bb - Db); fully diatonic here.  
- **Db6**: bVII6 (Db - F - Ab - Bb); classic Mixolydian color chord.  

The bass notes (mostly Eb, with Db under Gdim) reinforce this—no accidentals or tensions outside the mode.

#### Step 3: Mode Confirmation
- **Mixolydian mode**: Characterized by the b7 (Db here), giving a "bluesy" or dominant flavor without full resolution to minor. Common in jazz/pop for its warm, unresolved vibe (e.g., bVII - I turnaround).  
- Why not Ionian (major)? The Db in Gdim/Db and Db6 would be chromatic (#5 or altered), but they fit natively in Mixolydian. No D natural appears to pull toward pure major.  
- Why not minor (e.g., C minor or Eb minor)? Cm pulls subdominantly but doesn't resolve as tonic; no strong minor v or VII° expected. Eb feels brighter and more stable.  
- Other modes ruled out: No #4 (Lydian), b3 (Aeolian/Dorian), or #2 (other exotics).

#### Step 4: Functional Interpretation
- **Eb - Cm/Eb**: Tonic to submediant (I - vi), lyrical setup.  
- **Gdim/Db - Fm/Eb**: Chromatic passing dim (♭vi° over bVII bass) to iv; builds tension toward tonic.  
- Repetition reinforces the modal loop.  
- Overall: Relaxed, cyclical feel typical of Mixolydian standards (e.g., similar to parts of "All Blues" or "So What" in modal jazz).

### Final Determination
- **Key**: Eb  
- **Mode**: Mixolydian  

This progression could be a jazz standard excerpt (possibly from "As Time Goes By" or a similar ballad in alternate voicings). If this is from a specific song or you have more context/chords, I can refine further!
