Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Write out the chords
You provided the following chord progression:

```
Eb  Eb  Cm/Eb  Cm/Eb  Gdim/Db  Fm/Eb  Eb  Eb  Cm/Eb  Cm/Eb  Eb  Eb  Db6  Eb
```

### Step 2: Identify the root notes and chord qualities
Let's list out the chords with their roots and qualities:

- **Eb**: Major chord (Eb–G–Bb)
- **Cm/Eb**: C minor triad with Eb in the bass (C–Eb–G over Eb)
- **Gdim/Db**: G diminished triad (G–Bb–Db) with Db in the bass
- **Fm/Eb**: F minor triad (F–Ab–C) with Eb in the bass
- **Db6**: Db major sixth chord (Db–F–Ab–Bb)

### Step 3: Analyze the notes
Let's collect all the notes from these chords and see what scale they fit into.

- Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
- Cm/Eb: C, Eb, G (Eb is bass)
- Gdim/Db: G, Bb, Db (Db is bass)
- Fm/Eb: F, Ab, C (Eb is bass)
- Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

Unique notes:  
**Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db**

This is the **Eb major scale with a lowered 7th** (Db instead of D). This corresponds to the **Eb Mixolydian mode**.

### Step 4: Check tonal center
The progression starts and ends on **Eb**, and Eb is the tonal center. The presence of **Db (b7)** instead of D natural (which would be in Eb major) confirms the **Mixolydian** character.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: Eb**  
**Mode: Mixolydian**
