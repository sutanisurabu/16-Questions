Let's analyze the given chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### Chord progression:
**Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb**

We can simplify this by ignoring repeated chords and focusing on the unique harmonic motion:

> **Eb — Cm/Eb — Gdim/Db — Fm/Eb — Db6 — Eb**

(Note: The slashes indicate bass notes — e.g., Cm/Eb means a C minor chord with Eb in the bass.)

---

## Step 1: Identify the chords in root position for easier analysis

1. **Eb** = Eb major chord → Eb - G - Bb  
2. **Cm/Eb** = C minor with Eb in bass → notes: Eb - G - C → This is an **Eb major 6th** chord (Eb - G - C), but voiced as C minor in first inversion.  
   - *Actually, Cm/Eb = C-Eb-G with Eb in bass → so the notes are Eb, G, C — same as Eb6 (Eb - G - C - Bb? Wait, we’re missing Bb here)*  
   - Wait — C minor triad is C-Eb-G. With Eb in bass: **Eb, G, C** — this is **Ebsus2 or Eb6 without 5th?** But note: Eb, G, C = **Eb6 chord without the 5th (Bb)**.  
     - Eb6 = Eb - G - C - Bb → here we have Eb - G - C → it's a **triad version of Eb6** (missing Bb). So functionally, it's **Eb6**.
3. **Gdim/Db** = G diminished triad with Db in bass → G-Bb-Db with Db in bass → notes: Db - G - Bb  
   - Db - G - Bb = Db, Bb, G → that's **Bb7b5**? Or Db in bass with Gdim → actually, this is **Db7(b5)** or **Gdim/D** but with Db bass → **Db augmented 6th?** Wait — let’s think differently.
   - Gdim = G-Bb-Db. With Db in bass → interval from Db to G is a **tritone**, Db to Bb is a minor 6th.  
   - This chord is **Db7(b5)** = Db - F - Ab - Cb → doesn’t match.  
   - Alternatively, **Db - G - Bb** = Db - Bb - G → which is the **same as Bb7(♭9)** without root? No.  
   - Let’s consider this as a **German Augmented Sixth** chord?  
     - German +6: in key of C, it’s Ab - C - Eb - G → doesn’t fit.  
   - Actually, **Db - G - Bb** = Db - Bb - G → that's **Bb minor 7 flat 5?** No.  
     - Let's invert: G-Bb-Db → that's a **G diminished 7th without the 7th** (G-Bb-Db-Fb) → so Gdim is just G-Bb-Db.  
     - So **Gdim/Db** = Db, G, Bb = **Db minor 6th?** Not quite.  
     - Another way: Db - G is an **augmented 4th/diminished 5th**, Db - Bb is a **minor 6th** → this is actually **Bb7 chord without root and without 7th**? Bb-D-F-Ab → not matching.  
     - Harmonically, **Gdim/Db** is often used as a **borrowed chord** from the key of F minor — it functions as **ii°** of F minor?  
       In F minor:  
       - ii° = Gdim = G-Bb-Db  
       - So Gdim/Db is ii° in first inversion.  
       So perhaps key is F minor?

4. **Fm/Eb** = F minor with Eb in bass → F-Ab-C with Eb → notes: Eb - F - Ab - C → that’s **Eb major 7th with a suspension?**  
   - Eb - F - Ab - C → Eb to F is a major 2nd → dissonant.  
   - Alternatively, think of it as **Fm/Eb = Eb, F, Ab, C** → this is **Eb7#9?** No.  
   - Wait — Fm = F, Ab, C  
     With Eb in bass: Eb, F, Ab, C  
     That’s **Eb - F - Ab - C** — this is **Eb13sus4** if we consider F = 9th, but that’s complicated.  
     Or better: this is **Eb major chord with a major 2nd suspension?**  

     However, **Eb - F - Ab - C** can be viewed as **Ab minor 7th in second inversion**, since Ab - C - Eb - F = Abm7 with F = 9th?  
     But Abm7 = Ab - C - Eb - Gb — here we have F, not Gb → so no.  

     **Instead, think of it as a passing chord or alteration.**

     Let’s recall: **Fm/Eb** is the **same as Eb7(b9)** without the 5th?  
     - Eb7 = Eb - G - Bb - Db  
     - Eb7(b9) = Eb - G - Bb - Db - Fb → we have F natural, not Fb → so it's **Eb7(#9)**? Because #9 of Eb is G#? No, #9 of Eb is F natural:  
       - Eb root → 9th = F → #9 = F# → argh!  
     - Wait — #9 of Eb is not F.  
       - Eb → 9th = F  
       - #9 = F#  
       But we have F natural — so it’s just a **9th** — that would make it **Eb9**.  
     - But we don’t have G or Bb? The chord is just Fm/Eb = F-Ab-C with Eb bass = notes: **Eb, F, Ab, C**  
       So: 1=Eb, 2=F, b3=Ab, 5=C → that’s **Eb2addb3**? Not standard.  

     This is more simply the **V7 chord of Bb minor?** Let’s step back.

5. **Db6** = Db - F - Bb → Db major 6th (Db - F - Ab - Bb? Wait, Db6 = Db - F - Ab - Bb? No — 6th is Bb, since Db - F - Ab - Bb — yes, Db6 = Db, F, Ab, Bb)

6. **Eb**

## Step 2: Try to find a tonal center

Look at the first chord: **Eb** — large and prominent.  
Last chord: **Eb** — tonal resolution.  

Also, **Db6 → Eb** is a very strong **subdominant to tonic** motion — Db to Eb.  

In fact, **Db6 → Eb** is like **IV6 → I** in a flat key — which suggests key of Eb major.

### Let’s test **Eb major** as the key.

**Eb major scale**: Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D

Chords in Eb major (diatonic):

| Degree | Chord |
|--------|-------|
| I      | Eb    |
| ii     | Fm    |
| iii    | Gm    |
| IV     | Ab    |
| V      | Bb    |
| vi     | Cm    |
| vii°   | Ddim  |

Now let’s map the progression with diatonic equivalents.

Progression:

1. **Eb** → I ✓  
2. **Cm/Eb** → Cm is vi in Eb major → **vi in first inversion (Cm/Eb)** = vi6 — common substitution. ✓  
3. **Gdim/Db** → Gdim is not diatonic to Eb major.  
   - In Eb major, vii° is Ddim, not Gdim.  
   → So **Gdim is borrowed** — likely from **Eb minor** (the parallel minor).  

   In **Eb natural minor**: Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb Db  
   - vii° = Dbdim → still not Gdim.  
   - Gdim = G-Bb-Db → which is the **vii° of Ab major** — or the **ii° of F minor**  

   Let’s try **F minor (parallel minor of Ab major)** — maybe it’s **F minor?**

Wait — let’s look at chord 4: **Fm/Eb**

Fm/Eb — Fm is iv in Ab major, or ii in Eb major — but it’s in first inversion with Eb bass.  

What if the key is **F minor**? That would make sense with the Gdim.

### Try **F minor** as tonic:

F natural minor: F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb  
Diatonic chords:
- i: Fm  
- ii°: Gdim  
- III: Ab  
- iv: Bbm  
- v: Cm  
- VI: Db  
- VII: Eb  

**Check progression:**

1. **Eb** → VII of F minor → ✓ common in minor keys  
2. **Cm/Eb** → v/i = Cm (v) with Eb bass — Eb is the VII → so this is **v - VII** motion  
   - Cm/Eb = Bb - C - Eb? Wait, Cm/Eb = C-Eb-G with Eb bass → Eb-C-G — same as Eb6 again  
   - In F minor, Cm is v — so **v in first inversion** → common  
3. **Gdim/Db** → ii° of F minor (Gdim), with Db bass → Db = VI of F minor  
   → So **ii°/VI** — this is very interesting.  
   - Gdim/Db = Db - G - Bb → this is **Ab7 (no root)**? Actually, Db - G - Bb = Db, Bb, G →  
   - This is **Bb7(b9)** without root? (Bb - D - F - Ab — no)  
   - Best interpretation: this is **vi - ii°** but with chromatic bass descent: Db → ?  

   Let's trace bass notes:  

   Chord       | Bass note  
   --------------------------  
   Eb          | Eb  
   Cm/Eb       | Eb  
   Gdim/Db     | Db  
   Fm/Eb       | Eb  
   Db6         | Db  
   Eb          | Eb  

   So bass movement: **Eb → Eb → Db → Eb → Db → Eb**  

   That’s a **chromatic neighbor** motion: Eb - Db - Eb  

   That’s common in minor keys for descent.  

   Now: **Db6 → Eb** = VI → I in F minor → **very common cadence in minor keys**!  

   In F minor:  
   - Db major = VI (major) chord — borrowed from F melodic minor (raised 6th)  
   - Then to i (Fm) — **VI-i cadence** is a **perfect authentic cadence** in minor keys, often used in classical and pop.  

   Now check: What is **Fm/Eb**? = Fm with Eb bass → that’s **iv chord with the VII in bass** — so **iv7?**  
   - Fm = F-Ab-C  
   - Eb in bass → Eb - F - Ab - C → this is **Abm7?**  
     Abm7 = Ab - C - Eb - Gb → we have F, not Gb — so no.  
   - But Eb - F - Ab - C = **Eb major with added 9th and 11th?**  
   - Actually: **Eb - F - Ab - C** = Fm7/Eb? Fm7 = F - Ab - C - Eb → yes! That’s **Fm7** — and it’s the **iv7** chord in F minor.  
     And we’re just voicing it with Eb in bass — so it’s **Fm7/Eb**, which is **iv7**.  

   And Fm7 is diatonic to F minor → yes:  
   - F minor scale: F-G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb  
   - Fm7 = F - Ab - C - Eb → IV7 → yes!  
   - So Fm/Eb = Eb - F - Ab - C = C - Eb - F - Ab → same as Fm7, bass Eb → so it's **iv7**  

   Now **Gdim/Db** = Gdim with Db bass → G-Bb-Db with Db bass → Db - G - Bb  
   In F minor scale:  
   - Gdim = ii°  
   - Db = VI  
   So **ii°/VI** — this functions as a **passing chord** or augmented 6th?  

   Actually, **Db - G - Bb** = Db, Bb, G → is the same as **Bb7(♭9)** without root? But swapped.  
   This chord can be interpreted as **an augmented sixth chord leading to Eb** — but we go to Fm/Eb next, then Db6.  

   But wait, progression is:  
   **Gdim/Db → Fm/Eb → Db6 → Eb**

   So: **Db → Eb → Db → Eb**

   The **Gdim/Db** leads into **Fm/Eb** — which is iv7 — so: **ii°/VI → iv7** — that’s **viio6 → iv7** in F minor?  

   Actually, **Gdim** (II°) to **Fm** (iv) — that’s descending by minor 3rd — common in minor keys.  
   And **Db** bass is just a passing tone.  

   So the key is **F minor**.  

   The progression ends on **Eb** — which is the **VII chord**, not the tonic. But we’re back to Eb = VII, which often resolves to I = Fm. But the progression ends on Eb.

   **Wait — progression ends on Eb — but Fm is the tonic. Why end on Eb?**

   The full progression:  
   - Starts: Eb → Eb → Cm/Eb → Cm/Eb → Gdim/Db → Fm/Eb → Eb → Eb → Cm/Eb → Cm/Eb → Eb → Eb → Db6 → **Eb**

   **Final chord is Eb** — not Fm. So is the tonic Fm or Eb?

   But **Db6 → Eb** is a deceptive cadence in F minor: VI → VII, not VI → i. But it’s possible.  

   But wait — Db6 is **Db major 6th = Db-F-Ab-Bb**

   And then Eb — Eb major = Eb-G-Bb  

   So: Db6 → Eb major  
   - Db6 = Db - F - Ab - Bb  
   - Eb = Eb - G - Bb  
   - Common tone: **Bb**  
   - The bass descent: Db → Eb (up minor 2nd)  
   - The upper voices: F→G (up minor 2nd), Ab→Bb (up minor 2nd), Db→Eb (up minor 2nd)  

   This is a very strong **chromatic mediant move**: Db major to Eb major — a **root movement of minor 2nd UP**

   This is **not diatonic** to F minor — F minor has Db as VI and Eb as VII — they are not closely related.  

   But Eb major chord sounds like **I** in Eb major — so perhaps we **modulate to Eb major** at the end?

   The **last two chords**: **Db6 → Eb**  

   This is **a Neapolitan to tonic** motion — **but in Eb major**!  

   In Eb major:  
   - Neapolitan = **Db** major — not Db6  
   - Typically, Neapolitan = **Db major (b2)** → then I = Eb  

   So **Db major → Eb** is **N - I** in Eb major.  

   Here we have **Db6** — which is **Db major with added 6th** — that's common in romantic music as a variant of the Neapolitan.  

   And the whole beginning uses **Eb major** chords.  

   So now the case weakens for F minor.  

   Let’s reconsider.

---

## Final Interpretation: **Eb Major** with modal mixture

Chord progression:

1. **Eb** → I  
2. **Cm/Eb** → vi6 → common in major keys  
3. **Gdim/Db** → **this is the problem** — Gdim doesn’t belong to Eb major  
   - But Gdim is the vii° of A minor — or in Eb major, we can borrow it as **viio of F minor**?  
   - Wait — Gdim = G-Bb-Db = **viio of Ab major**? No, viio of Ab is G#dim  
   - Gdim = viio of **C minor** → so maybe it's **borrowed from C minor**, which is **III minor** in Eb major.  

   This is a **chromatic mediant** relationship.  

   But better: Gdim is **the ii° of F minor** — which is the **relative minor of Eb major?** No, relative minor of Eb is C minor.  

   Eb major’s relative minor is **C minor** — and in C minor:  
   - ii° = D°  
   - v = G° → yes! In minor, the fifth degree is diminished.  
     → **C minor scale**: C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb  
     - v = G - Bb - Db → Gdim  
   - So Gdim = v chord of **C minor** — which is **iii of Eb major**  

   So **borrowing the v chord from relative minor** — very common!  

   Used for: modulation or dramatic tension.  

   So:  
   - **Cm/Eb** = vi6 of Eb major  
   - **Gdim/Db** = borrowed v° from C minor — Db bass sets up a descent to the next chord  

   Then: **Fm/Eb** = ii of Eb major in first inversion?  
   - Fm = ii in Eb major  
   - Fm/Eb = Eb-F-Ab-C → Fm7 (as before) → ii7 — common in jazz  

   Then: **Db6** = Neapolitan chord of Eb major → **N6**

   Db6 = Db-F-Ab-Bb → in Eb major: Db is the lowered second degree → N6 → strong resolution to I = Eb

   And finally: **Eb** as tonic

---

## ✅ Final Answer:

### **Key: Eb major**  
### **Mode: Major**  

### Explanation:
- The progression begins and ends on **Eb major**, establishing the tonic.  
- Chords like **Cm** (vi), **Fm** (ii) are diatonic to Eb major.  
- **Gdim** is **borrowed** from the relative minor (C minor) — as its **v° chord**, a very common modal mixture.  
- **Db6** is the **Neapolitan sixth chord** (N6) — beautifully prepared by Eb and Fm, and resolves directly to tonic Eb.  
- The bass motion (Db → Eb) is a classic N6→I cadence.  
- The use of **Db** as a chromatic neighbor to Eb, and **Gdim/Db** as a steeply borrowed chord, is characteristic of **Romantic-era harmonic language within a major key** — not a modal change.

### Conclusion:
> **Key: Eb major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (Major)**

With rich use of **modal mixture** (borrowed chords from C minor) and **Neapolitan** harmony — very expressive, but still centered firmly in Eb major.
