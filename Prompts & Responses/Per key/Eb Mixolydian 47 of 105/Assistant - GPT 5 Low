### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord structure**

I’m exploring a bass line and thinking about a sus type chord on the I. The Cm/Eb indicates a C minor triad with Eb in the bass, which might yield something akin to Ebmaj add9 add6. It's interesting how C is the sixth of Eb, making it feel like an Eb major 6 chord. It seems that both Cm/Eb and Fm/Eb function like upper triads over a tonic pedal, with Eb as the tonal center but incorporating mixolydian elements. The transition with Gdim over Db also invites exploration.**Exploring chord transitions**

I’m realizing that the measure is actually Gdim/Db followed by Fm/Eb, where the bass moves from Db to Eb — that half step adds a nice touch! The voice-leading from Gdim to Fm feels smooth, almost leading me into Fm as a ii chord in Eb. Since Gdim acts as the leading-tone diminished chord, it leads into Fm effectively. Now, considering the overall key, it seems to be Eb major or maybe even Eb mixolydian due to the borrowed flat VII. It's tricky!**Determining the key and scale**

I’m noticing that while D natural isn’t explicitly present, it would typically be the leading tone in Eb major. But looking at the chords used — Eb, Cm, Gdim, Fm, and Db6 — it seems like D natural is absent. The presence of Db suggests an Eb Mixolydian feel. The scale degrees of Eb Mixolydian point to this as well, especially since we’ve got C natural, which aligns with the scale, confirming it’s indeed Mixolydian rather than Ionian since D natural just isn’t there!**Analyzing key and mode**

Without D natural present, it's a bit tricky. The Db6 and Gdim chords suggest Db over D natural, leaning away from Ionian. So, I might conclude that the key center is Eb with a Mixolydian mode thanks to the flat VII (Db) and lack of a leading tone. For a brief answer, I could say, "Eb major (Ionian) with a bVII (Db)." Still, repeated chords anchor this strongly in Eb, leading me to question whether mixolydian or major is more precise.**Establishing key and mode**

The G diminished chord fits into Eb Mixolydian, where the scale degrees are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, and Db. The triad built on G would indeed be G diminished, as it follows the structure of Mixolydian. So, I see that Gdim is diatonic to Eb Mixolydian, along with Db6. The entire progression — Eb, Cm, Gdim, Fm, Db6 — aligns with Eb Mixolydian. For clarity, I can summarize: Tonic center is Eb, mode is Mixolydian, and it’s backed by the presence of Db and G diminished chords.

Eb Mixolydian.

Tonal center is Eb, and the presence of Db (b7) and G° (iii°) along with Fm (ii) and Cm (vi) fits Eb Mixolydian. The Db6 → Eb move is a bVII → I cadence typical of Mixolydian, and much of the passage sits over an Eb pedal.
