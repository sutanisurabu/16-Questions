### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chords: Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at the chords and their bass notes. The notation uses slashes, like Cm/Eb, which means a C minor chord with Eb in the bass. So the actual notes for each chord would be:

- Eb: just Eb major? Wait, but chords without a third specified might be ambiguous, but usually in this context, it's probably Eb major. But let's check all.

Wait, Eb alone – without a suffix, it's often assumed to be dominant or major. But in many contexts, especially jazz or modern harmony, just "Eb" could mean Eb major. But sometimes it could be something else. I should list all chords properly.

Let's list each chord:

1. Eb – likely Eb major (E♭-G-B♭)
2. Eb – same as above
3. Cm/Eb – C minor with Eb bass, so notes C-Eb-G with Eb in bass? Wait, no. Cm/Eb means the chord is C minor, but the bass note is Eb. So the chord is C-Eb-G, but the lowest note is Eb. So the notes are Eb, C, G. Which is actually an Ebmaj7? Wait, no. C minor chord with Eb bass: the intervals would be Eb (root?), but the chord is C minor. So the bass note is Eb, which is the minor third of C minor. So Cm/Eb is a first inversion of C minor. Similarly:

Cm/Eb: Bass note Eb, chord is C minor. So notes: Eb (bass), then C and G. So the chord consists of Eb, C, G. Which is the same as Eb6? Wait, Eb major chord is Eb-G-Bb. But here, Eb, C, G – that's Eb, G, C. Wait, the order doesn't matter. So Eb, G, C. But C is above G. So Eb, G, C. That's the same as C minor with Eb in bass, or Eb major flat 6? Wait, Eb major chord has G and Bb. But here we have Eb, G, C. So there's a C instead of Bb. So that's not Eb major. Eb, G, C – that's Ebm6? Wait, no. C is the 6th of Eb? Eb to C is a minor 6th? Wait, Eb to C is 9 half steps, which is a minor 6th? Wait, no: Eb to C: Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, Bb, B, C. Wait, that's 10 half steps? Wait, let's count properly. From Eb to C:

Eb to E: 1, E to F: 2, F to F#: 3, F# to G:4, G to G#:5, G# to A:6, A to A#:7, A# to B:8, B to C:9. So yes, 9 half steps, which is a minor 6th? No: minor 6th is 8 half steps, major 6th is 9. Because minor 6th from C to Ab is 8 steps, major 6th C to A is 9. So from Eb to C: Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, Bb, B, C – wait, Eb to C is actually 9 semitones, which is a major 6th. Because major 6th is 9 semitones. For example, C to A is 9 semitones.

But in terms of chord names: Eb, G, C. The notes are Eb, G, C. Let's sort them: C, Eb, G. That's a C minor triad, with the bass being Eb. So yes, Cm/Eb. So the chord is C minor first inversion.

Similarly, Gdim/Db: G diminished, bass Db. Gdim is G-Bb-Db. If bass is Db, then notes Db, G, Bb. Which is Db diminished? Wait, Gdim is G, Bb, Db. So Db is the diminished fifth of G? Yes, because G to Db is a diminished 5th. So Gdim chord has Db as the fifth. If we put Db in the bass, then the notes are Db, G, Bb. But a diminished chord with root Db would be Db, Fb, Abb? No, better to think of Gdim chord as G, Bb, Db. So when played with Db in bass, the notes are Db-G-Bb. That's a Db diminished triad? Db diminished is Db-Fb-Abb, but usually written as Dbdim. But Db diminished is same as Bdim or something else. Maybe it's an inversion.

But perhaps better to list all chord tones.

Let me list each chord with their full notes:

1. Eb: Likely Eb major (Eb, G, Bb)
2. Eb: same
3. Cm/Eb: C minor chord (C, Eb, G) with bass Eb → notes: Eb, C, G (so C, Eb, G; the bass is Eb)
4. Cm/Eb: same as above
5. Gdim/Db: G diminished chord is G, Bb, Db. With Db bass → Db, G, Bb. (so Db, G, Bb. Which is a Db diminished triad? Db is root, then minor 3rd is Fb (E), diminished 5th is C. Wait, Gdim chord: G to Bb is minor 3rd, Bb to Db is minor 3rd, so G to Db is dim5. So Gdb is G, Bb, Db. When Db is bass, the chord is Db, G, Bb. So Db root: Db, Fb (but usually written as E), G? Wait, no. Diminished triad with root Db would be Db, Fb, Abb. But actually, the Gdim is the same as Bdim and Dbdim? Let's see. Gdim is G-Bb-Db. Which is equivalent to Db dim: Db-Fb-Abb (but Abb is G). So yes, same notes. So Gdim/Db is Db diminished chord, root Db. But chord symbols might be written as Gdim with Db bass.

6. Fm/Eb: F minor chord (F, Ab, C) with Eb bass → notes Eb, F, Ab, C? Wait, Fm is F, Ab, C. If bass is Eb, then the notes are Eb, F, Ab, C. But Eb is the bass note, then the chord is Eb-F-Ab-C. So the chord would be Eb minor seventh? Or maybe a Fm7? Because F, Ab, C, Eb is Fm7. Yes! So Fm/Eb is F minor 7th with Eb in the bass, which would be a common jazz chord. So Fm7 = F, Ab, C, Eb. So if bass is Eb, then it's Fm7/Eb, but usually written as Fm/Eb to indicate the bass note. So the full chord is Eb in bass, with Fm7 above it. So yes, the chord consists of Eb, F, Ab, C. Which is Fm7 in first inversion? Or actually, since Eb is the bass, the notes are Eb, F, Ab, C. So root would be Eb? But Eb-F-Ab-C would be Eb, F minor third? No, Eb to F is major second. So maybe this is a F minor 7th chord with Eb bass. But that's correct.

7. Eb: again, Eb major
8. Eb: same
9. Cm/Eb: C minor with Eb bass
10. Cm/Eb: same
11. Eb: same
12. Eb: same
13. Db6: Db 6th chord. Db6 is usually Db, F, Ab, B. Wait, Db major with added 6th. Db6 chord: Db, F, Ab, B. Because the 6th above Db is Bb? Wait, Db to Bb is a minor 6th, but Db6 usually means Db major 6th chord: Db, F, Ab, Bb? Wait, no. Wait, major 6th chord: root, major 3rd, perfect 5th, major 6th. So Db major 6th: Db - F (major 3rd), Ab (perfect 5th), and Bb (major 6th). Wait, Db to Bb is 9 semitones, which is a minor 6th. Wait, no. Db to B: Db to D (1), D to D# (2), D# to E (3), etc. Wait, Db to B: from Db up a minor sixth would be Bbb? No, this is confusing.

Let's clarify: In Db major scale, notes are Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb, Cb. No, that's not right. Standard Db major scale: Db - Eb - F - Gb - Ab - Bb - C - Db. So the scale degrees: 1 Db, 2 Eb, 3 F, 4 Gb, 5 Ab, 6 Bb, 7 C.

So Db major 6th chord would be root (Db), major 3rd (F), perfect 5th (Ab), major 6th (Bb). Yes, because from Db to Bb is a minor 6th? Wait, Db to Bb: the interval is 10 semitones, which is a minor 6th. Because 10 semitones: half steps from Db to Bb: Db to D (1), D to D# (2), D# to E (3), E to F (4), F to F# (5), F# to G (6), G to G# (7), G# to A (8), A to A# (9), A# to Bb (10). Yes, 10 semitones. But a perfect fifth is 7 semitones, minor sixth is 8 semitones? Wait, no. Let's list intervals by semitones:

- Minor 2nd: 1
- Major 2nd: 2
- Minor 3rd: 3
- Major 3rd: 4
- Perfect 4th: 5
- Tritone: 6
- Perfect 5th: 7
- Minor 6th: 8
- Major 6th: 9
- Minor 7th: 10
- Major 7th: 11
- Octave: 12

Wait, Db to Bb: let's count the semitones. From Db to Bb:

Db - D (1), D - D# (2), D# - E (3), E - F (4), F - F# (5), F# - G (6), G - G# (7), G# - A (8), A - A# (9), A# - Bb (10). So yes, 10 semitones. But according to the above list, minor 7th is 10 semitones. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, the major 7th from Db is C (Db to C is 11 semitones). Minor 7th is 10 semitones, so Db to Bb is 10 semitones, which is a minor 7th. So Db to Bb is minor seventh.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's take another example. From C to Bb is a minor 7th (10 semitones). C to B is major 7th (11). So yes, Db to Bb is a minor 7th. So why would Db6 include Bb? That doesn't make sense. Wait, Db major 6th chord: root Db, major third F (4 semitones), perfect fifth Ab (7), and major sixth should be Bb? No. Db to Bb is minor seventh. The major sixth above Db would be B? Because Db to B: Db to B is 10 semitones? Wait, Db to B. Let's count: Db, D (1), D# (2), E (3), F (4), F# (5), G (6), G# (7), A (8), A# (9), B (10). Wait, that's 10 semitones. Wait, so Db to B is a minor 7th? But in major scale, the 6th should be a major 6th interval above root. For Db major scale, the 6th scale degree is Bb, right? Because Db major scale is Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So yes, the 6th is Bb. But Db to Bb is a minor 6th? Wait, no. Wait, interval names: from Db to Bb. Let's use the diatonic scale. In Db major, the 6th note is Bb. So the interval from Db to Bb is a sixth. How many semitones? From Db to Bb: as before, 10 semitones. But for a sixth interval, major sixth is 9 semitones. Wait, for example, C to A: 9 semitones (C to A natural), which is a major sixth. C to Ab is minor sixth (8 semitones). So Db to Bb: Db, Eb (2), F (4), Gb (5), Ab (7), Bb (9 semitones). Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Db up a major sixth: Db to Bb? Let's see, starting at Db:

Db to Eb: 2 semitones (major second)

Eb to F: 2 more (total 4)

F to Gb: 1 (5)

Gb to Ab: 2 (7)

Ab to Bb: 2 (9 semitones). So Db to Bb is 9 semitones. Ah, right! So from Db to Bb is 9 semitones: yes, that's a major sixth. Because:

For C major, C to A is A major sixth. From C to A: C(0), C#(1), D(2), D#(3), E(4), F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9). Yes, 9 semitones. So Db to Bb would be same: Db to Bb is 9 semitones. Let's count again: Db (0), D(1), D#(2), E(3), F(4), F#(5), G(6), G#(7), A(8), Bb(9). Yes, 9 semitones. So Db to Bb is major sixth. Therefore, Db6 chord is Db - F (major 3rd) - Ab (perfect 5th) - Bb (major 6th). Yes.

So Db6 chord notes: Db, F, Ab, Bb.

Then the last chord is Eb.

So now, let's list all the chords with their actual notes:

1. Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
2. Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
3. Cm/Eb: C, Eb, G with Eb bass → so notes Eb, C, G (but order doesn't matter, so C, Eb, G)
4. Same as above
5. Gdim/Db: G diminished chord (G, Bb, Db) with Db bass → Db, G, Bb
6. Fm/Eb: F, Ab, C with Eb bass → Eb, F, Ab, C (so Fm7 chord with Eb bass; Fm7 is F, Ab, C, Eb)
7. Eb major
8. Eb major
9. Cm/Eb
10. Cm/Eb
11. Eb major
12. Eb major
13. Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb
14. Eb major

Wait, the user listed "Db6 Eb" at the end, so 13th chord is Db6 and 14th is Eb.

Now, looking at all these chords: Eb major, Cm/Eb (which is C minor), Gdim/Db (which is G diminished but bass Db), Fm/Eb (which is F minor 7th), Db6, and repeated Eb.

So maybe the chords are in a progression that has Eb as tonic. Let's think in terms of keys.

Possible keys: let's list all the notes in each chord.

Eb major: E♭, G, B♭

Cm/Eb: C, E♭, G

Gdim/Db: G, Bb, Db → notes G, Bb, Db

Fm/Eb: Eb, F, Ab, C → F, Ab, C, Eb

Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

And Eb again.

So let's list all the notes appearing in all the chords:

Eb major has Eb, G, Bb

Cm/Eb has C, Eb, G

Gdim/Db has G, Bb, Db

Fm/Eb has Eb, F, Ab, C

Db6 has Db, F, Ab, Bb

So compiling all notes:

From Eb: E♭, G, B♭

Cm/Eb: C, E♭, G

Gdim/Db: G, Bb, Db

Fm/Eb: E♭, F, Ab, C

Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

So combining all, the notes present are:

Eb, Bb, G, C, D♭, F, A♭

Wait, D♭ and G is already there? Let's list all unique pitches:

- C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Wait, that's all seven notes of Db major scale! Because Db major scale is Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

Wait, but in our list we have G instead of Gb? Let's see. The chords have G, which is natural G. But Db major scale has Gb (double flat? No, Db major scale:

Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

Wait, Gb? So the 4th scale degree is Gb. But in our chords, we have G natural. So if there's a G natural, that doesn't fit into Db major, which has Gb.

Hmm. So maybe not Db major. Wait, but Db6 has Db, F, Ab, Bb – which are all in Db major. Fm/Eb is F, Ab, C, Eb – C is in Db major (C is the 7th of Db). Eb is 2nd scale degree. Ab is 5th. Bb is 6th. So Db scale has Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So all notes except G (natural). But we have G in Gdim chord and Cm/Eb.

So G natural here. That would mean that there's a note not in Db major. So perhaps another key.

Wait, Eb major scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Wait, no. Eb major is Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

Wait, that's important. Eb major scale:

Root Eb

2nd F

3rd G

4th Ab

5th Bb

6th C

7th D

Octave Eb.

So Eb major has G natural, not Gb. So yes, G is in Eb major. Let's check.

Eb major: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

Yes. So G natural is part of Eb major. So let's see all the notes from chords:

From above:

Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. But wait, Db is the note D flat. Wait, in Eb major, the scale is Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So D natural. But Db is a flattened D. So we have Db there?

Yes, in the Gdim/Db chord: Db is part of the notes. Wait, Gdim chord is G, Bb, Db. So Db is present. But in Eb major scale, is Db present? Eb major's notes are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So D natural, but Db would be a flat of D. So Db is not in Eb major scale. So Db is not in Eb major.

But Db also appears in the Db6 chord. So Db is present. So if the key is Eb, then Db would be a chromatic note. But maybe the key is Db major? But Db major has Gb, not G natural. But we have G natural in Cm/Eb and Gdim.

Wait, Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. So Gb, not G. So G natural is not part of Db major. So that's a clash. So perhaps it's Eb minor? Or some other mode.

Wait, let's list all the pitches used:

From the chords:

- C

- Db

- Eb

- F

- G

- Ab

- Bb

So the notes present are: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

That's seven pitches. Let's see which key this could be.

Looking at the notes:

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, how many accidentals? Db and Eb are flats.

Let's list all notes in order:

Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C.

Wait, that sort of makes sense. Let's check Db major: as mentioned, Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C. But here, we have G natural instead of Gb. So G natural is not in Db major.

What about C minor? Let's see. C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! C natural minor (Aeolian mode of Eb major or Bb major). Let's confirm.

C minor scale:

C (root), D (m2), Eb (m3), F (P4), G (P5), Ab (m6), Bb (m7), C.

Yes! Perfect. Notes in C minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

But wait, in the chord list, we have Db as well. Db is a chromatic note here. Wait, in the Gdim/Db chord, Db is present. So Gdim chord has G, Bb, Db. Db is the diminished fifth of G. So Db is part of the chord.

Wait, but in C minor scale, there is no Db. The notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

But Db is not in C minor. So there is a Db here. So that suggests maybe not.

Wait, but perhaps the key is Bb major? Let's see. Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab.

But again, we have Db, which isn't in Bb major. Bb major has no Db.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Eb major.

Eb major: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.

We have in our chords: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So Db is not in Eb major; Eb major has D natural. So Db would be a chromatic note here, or perhaps a borrowed mode.

Wait, let's consider the chords again. Maybe the key is Eb minor? Eb minor scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bbb (which is A), Cb, Db. Hmm, not sure. Eb natural minor (Aeolian) would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. Wait, Cb is B natural? No, C flat would be B, but that's not standard. Natural minor from Eb would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. But Cb is spelled as B natural in practical terms? But usually, it's spelled as Bb for Eb minor? No, better to write the exact notes.

Eb natural minor: E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭. Wait, no. Natural minor scale is based on the relative major. Eb minor's relative major is Gb major? Actually, Eb minor uses its own natural scale. The natural minor scale of Eb has the same notes as Gb major. Let's clarify.

Key of Eb minor:

The natural minor scale of Eb is: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db.

But Cb is B, and Db is Db. But usually, when written, it's Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, B, Db? No, better to use correct spellings. Cb is the same as B natural, but that's not standard. The correct spelling for Eb minor scale is Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db – where Cb is B, but written as Cb.

But in practice, this might be tricky. Alternatively, Eb harmonic minor would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, D. Or natural minor has Cb and Db.

But let's see if the chords fit into Eb minor.

If key is Eb minor, then the scale is Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db.

Wait, but in our chords we have G natural. But Eb minor has Gb. So G natural is a chromatic note here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the key is Ab major? Let's check Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes! Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Ah! Let's see:

Ab major scale: A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G.

That's the seven notes. Now, check all chords:

Look at chord Gdim/Db: Db is in Ab major (D♭), yes.

G natural is part of Ab major. Yes, the 7th degree is G natural.

F is in Ab major.

Eb is 5th degree.

C is 3rd.

Bb is 2nd.

Ab is tonic.

So Ab major scale includes all the pitches we have:

Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes.

Now, let's confirm each chord:

- Eb major: Eb is the 5th of Ab major. So Eb major chord would be V7? Wait, Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. But Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. Which is not part of the Ab major diatonic chords. Ab major diatonic chords: I (Ab), ii (Bb), iii (Cm), IV (Db), V (Eb), V7 is Eb minor? No. Let's list Ab major chords:

I: Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)

ii: Bb minor (Bb, Db, F)

iii: C minor (C, Eb, G)

IV: Db major (Db, F, Ab)

V: Eb major (Eb, G, Bb)

vi: F minor (F, Ab, C)

vii°: G diminished (G, Bb, Db)

Oh! Wait a minute. Yes! This looks promising.

Let's see:

- Eb major chord (in Ab major, Eb is the V chord: V chord is Eb major, yes. Because in Ab major scale, the V chord is built on Eb: Eb, G, Bb. Yes, that's correct.)

- Gdim: that's the vii° chord in Ab major. Yes, G diminished triad: G, Bb, Db. Exactly what we have. And in the chord list, it's Gdim/Db. Which is Gdim chord with Db bass, which makes sense as the triad is G Bb Db.

- Fm/Eb: F minor chord with Eb bass. In Ab major scale, F minor is the vi chord. Fm with Eb bass? Fm chord is F, Ab, C. Adding Eb makes it Fm7, which is a common chord. The Fm7 chord is diatonic to Ab major? Let's see: The vi chord is F minor (F, Ab, C), so Fm7 would be F, Ab, C, Eb, which is diatonic because Eb is the 7th degree of F minor? Wait, in the key of Ab, F is vi, so Fm7 would be built from the 6th degree: in Ab major, the vi chord is F minor, Fm7 would have notes F, Ab, C, Eb. And Eb is the b7 of the F minor scale? No, in Ab major, the note Eb is the 5th of the scale. So Fm7 chord (F, Ab, C, Eb) is diatonic to Ab major.

- Db6: Db major 6th chord. In Ab major, Db is the IV chord. Db major chord is Db, F, Ab. Db6 would add the 6th (Bb), but wait, Db6 chord is Db, F, Ab, Bb. Bb is a chord tone. In Ab major, yes, Bb is part of the scale. So Db6 chord: Db, F, Ab, Bb. Diatonic. So IV chord with added 6th? Or in Ab major, the IV chord is Db major. Adding the 6th (Bb), which is the 7th of Db. So that's a Db6 chord, which is a common extension.

- Also, Eb major chord occurs frequently, which is V in Ab major.

Now, the other chords: Cm/Eb. In Ab major, C minor is the iii chord. Cm/Eb is first inversion of Cm (C, Eb, G), with Eb bass. So Eb is part of the C minor chord. Yes.

So putting this together, all chords appear to be diatonic to Ab major.

Let's list all chords in Ab major:

I: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gdim

So in the given progression:

- Eb: V

- Eb: V

- Cm/Eb: iii chord with Eb bass? Or iii chord first inversion. But Cm is iii, yes.

- Gdim/Db: vii° chord (Gdim), with Db bass. So it's a diminished triad. Db is the 5th degree of the Gdim chord.

- Fm/Eb: vi chord with Eb bass. So Fm is vi, and Eb as bass note. This could be a vi7? Fm7.

- Then repeated Eb (V), Cm/Eb again (iii), and finally Db6.

Now Db6 in Ab major is IV chord with added 6th. Because IV chord is Db. Adding the 6th (Bb) would make it Db6, which is Db-F-Ab-Bb. Yes.

So the chords all fit into Ab major.

But wait, the user listed the chord sequence as "Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb"

So let's check if all these chords are in Ab major:

- Eb: V chord

- Cm/Eb: iii chord (C minor), first inversion

- Gdim/Db: vii° chord, with Db bass

- Fm/Eb: vi chord, which is F minor 7th if we consider the Eb bass (since Fm with Eb in bass is Fm7 inversion)

- Db6: IV6 chord (Db with added 6th)

Yes, all these diatonic.

Now, the key signature of Ab major has 4 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. So four flats.

But wait, the chord Db6 – that's Db major, which is the IV chord. But Db6 in Ab major is fine. All good.

Now, what about the mode? The question is to find key and mode. If it's Ab major, then it's the Ionian mode. But let's confirm.

Wait, but sometimes the key might not be Ab major. Maybe Eb major? But in Eb major, there's a G natural, yes, but then Db isn't in Eb major. Wait, Ab major's key signature is 4 flats, which includes Db.

Yes.

Another way: Let's check the final chord. It ends with Db6 followed by Eb. So Db6 to Eb. That could be IV to V in Ab major.

Yes, in Ab major, IV-Db, V-Eb. So that progression makes sense.

Also, if the song ends on Eb, which would be the V chord, that's not typical to end on V. But sometimes it does. However, if the whole progression is centered around Ab.

Wait, but the last chord is Eb, so maybe it's not the tonic. Let's see the starting chord: starts on Eb. So maybe Eb minor? But then G natural might be confusing.

But according to diatonic chords in Ab major, Eb acts as V chord, so if the progression ends on Eb, that could be a V chord in Ab, which is common for a half cadence.

So the key is Ab major, and the mode is Ionian. But sometimes key and mode refer to the same thing in major.

But maybe it's in Eb minor? Let's see.

If key is Eb minor, which is Aeolian mode of Gb major.

Eb minor scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db

But then, the chords: Gdim/Db: but Gdim would be G, Bb, Db. In Eb minor, the vii° chord is Db diminished? Wait, Eb minor scale: degrees are 1 Eb, 2 F, 3 Gb, 4 Ab, 5 Bb, 6 Cb, 7 Db.

So the vii° chord would be built on Db? No, in natural minor, the vii° chord is on the seventh scale degree, which is Db. But Db diminished triad: Db, Fb, Abb. Not matching. Hmm.

Whereas in Ab major, as we saw, the vii° is Gdim.

So it seems more logical that the key is Ab major.

Another check: common chords.

For instance, Fm/Eb – in Ab major, that's a vi chord with 7th. The presence of Fm (vi) and Eb (V) suggests Ab is the tonic.

Also, Cm/Eb – iii chord is C minor.

Gdim is vii°.

So I think key is Ab major.

Wait, but what about the Db6 chord? Db6 is IV chord in Ab major. IV chord is Db major. Db6 adds a major 6th (Bb), which is a common extension. So yes.

But let's see the order of chords:

Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb

So starting on V (Eb), then Cm/Eb (iii), Gdim/Db (vii°), Fm/Eb (vi), which is common progression. Like V - iii - vii° - vi, etc.

In the key of Ab major, yes.

So yes, this progression is built on Ab major chords. So the key is Ab major, mode is Ionian.

But to confirm, let's see if any chord requires a note outside Ab major. The chords have Db, which is in Ab major. G natural is there. All other notes are Ab major. Yes.

Another angle: Let's see the final Db6 to Eb. In Ab major, that's IV to V, which is very common.

So the answer should be key of Ab major, mode Ionian.

But wait, sometimes people refer to mode as the mode of the starting chord. But in this context, the key is Ab major.

Alternatively, perhaps the piece is in Eb minor? Let's see.

If the tonic were Eb minor, then the chords:

Eb minor has scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db.

But note Cb would be B natural. But in the chords, we have C? In Cm/Eb, which is C minor chord. In Eb minor's scale, is there a C? The sixth scale degree is Cb (Bb?), wait.

Eb natural minor: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. So Cb (B natural?), but it's written as Cb. The presence of C (natural) would not be in that scale. Because Cb is B. So if there's a C natural, that's not in Eb minor. So the C note in Cm/Eb would be a chord note, but in Eb minor, the scale has Cb (B) as the sixth degree, but the notes of Cm would need to be C, Eb, G. If the scale has B and Gb, then C natural is not in the scale. So that would be non-diatonic. But in Ab major, it's diatonic because C is the third degree.

Yes, so this confirms that Ab major is the better fit.

So the key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

Alternatively, sometimes key is referred to by its tonic, but in this case, the chord progression is centered around Ab, even if it starts on V.

But usually, the key is determined by the tonic chord. Even though the progression starts on V, if the tonic is Ab, then the key is Ab major.

Another check: Db6 is a major key IV chord, which fits into Ab major. If it were Eb minor, Db6 would be... ?

Eb minor: Db would be the bVII chord. But Db6 in Eb minor would be non-diatonic. So probably not.

So yes, I think the key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

But wait, another perspective: the presence of a C minor chord (third chord) – in Ab major, iii chord is C minor. Yes.

Gdim – vii° chord in Ab.

So all good.

Final conclusion: key of Ab major, mode Ionian.

But sometimes people say "in the key of Ab" which implies major ionian.

So yes, the key is Ab major. Mode is Ionian.

Alternatively, if they ask for mode, it's Ionian.

But maybe the key is Eb, but that seems less likely.

Wait, wait. Wait a second: what about Gdim/Db chord? If key is Ab major, Gdim is the diminished chord from the 7th degree. But Gdim chord in Ab major is G-Bb-Db. Yes. In Ab major's key, the seventh scale degree is G? No: Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes, seventh note is G. So G is the seventh scale degree. So G diminished would be built on G: G, Bb, Db. Which is correct. So yes.

So the key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

So the final answer should be: Key of Ab major, Mode Ionian.

But let's check if there's a possibility of it being in a different mode. For example, if it were Eb minor, but as we saw, many notes wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Db minor? No, not likely.

Another check: the Db6 chord. Db major with added 6th. In Ab major, Db is IV chord. Adding 6th (Bb) makes Db6.

Now, the very end is Db6 followed by Eb. That's a IV to V progression in Ab major. Common cadence.

Yes. So if the piece ends on Eb, which is V, it's like a half cadence. But the key is still Ab.

Alternatively, maybe some jazz pieces use a different key. But given all chords fit Ab major, I think that's the answer.

Yes. So the key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

But sometimes people omit "Ionian" for major key, but technically the mode is Ionian.

So final answer: Key: Ab major, Mode: Ionian.


The chord progression provided is:  
**Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb**

### Step 1: Analyze the Chords
Let’s break down each chord explicitly (noting all notes present):

- **Eb** → Eb, G, Bb  
- **Cm/Eb** → C, Eb, G (C minor chord with Eb bass)  
- **Gdim/Db** → G, Bb, Db (G diminished triad with Db bass)  
- **Fm/Eb** → Eb, F, Ab, C (F minor 7th chord with Eb bass → F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- **Db6** → Db, F, Ab, Bb  

### Step 2: Compile All Unique Pitches
From all chords, the pitches used are:  
**C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**  

This is a complete **7-note diatonic scale**. Let’s cross-reference with known scales:

- **Ab Major Scale**:  
  **Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G**  
  ✅ *Matches exactly* the pitches derived from the chords.  

- **Eb Minor Scale**:  
  The natural (Aeolian) minor scale of Eb includes **Cb (B), D, Gb**, etc., but **no G natural** (only Gb/Ab). The presence of **G natural** rules out Eb minor.  

- **Other Keys**:  
  No other key (e.g., Bb major, Gb major) includes **all** these pitches without chromatic deviations (e.g., Bb major lacks Db and G natural).  

### Step 3: Diatonic Chord Function in Ab Major
All chords align perfectly with **Ab major (Ionian mode)**:

| Chord        | Function in Ab Major | Notes (Ab Major Scale) |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Eb**       | **V (Dominant)**     | Eb, G, Bb              |
| **Cm/Eb**    | **iii (Mediant)**    | C, Eb, G               |
| **Gdim/Db**  | **vii° (Leading Tone)** | G, Bb, Db              |
| **Fm/Eb**    | **vi (Submediant)**  | F, Ab, C, Eb           |
| **Db6**      | **IV6 (Subdominant)** | Db, F, Ab, Bb          |

- **Why Ab major?**  
  - The chord progression centers around **Ab** as the tonic (even if it doesn’t explicitly appear, the functional relationships confirm it).  
  - **Db6 → Eb** is a **IV–V cadence**, a standard progression in Ab major (IV = Db, V = Eb).  
  - All pitches fit Ab major’s scale:  
    - G natural is the **7th scale degree** (Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, **G**).  
    - Db is the **4th scale degree** (IV chord), consistent with the Db6 chord.  
    - Fm/Eb (F minor 7th) is the **vi7 chord**, diatonic to Ab major.  

### Step 4: Mode Confirmation
- The **key is Ab major**, which corresponds to the **Ionian mode** (the first mode of the major scale).  
- Since the entire progression is built diatonically from the Ab major scale and centers on Ab as the tonal center (even if implied by functional harmony), the mode is **Ionian**.  

### Final Answer
- **Key**: **Ab major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian**  

*(Note: In practice, "Ab major" implies Ionian mode, so specifying the mode is redundant but technically correct for clarity.)*
