Let’s break this down step by step.  

The chord progression you’ve given is:  

**Eb  Eb  Cm/Eb  Cm/Eb  Gdim/Db  Fm/Eb  Eb  Eb  Cm/Eb  Cm/Eb  Eb  Eb  Db6  Eb**

### 1. Identify the chords and their functions

- **Eb major** = I chord in Eb major, or bVI in G minor (less likely here given the ending).
- **Cm/Eb** = C minor with Eb in bass = Cm in first inversion. In Eb major, Cm is the **vi** chord.
- **Gdim/Db** = G diminished with Db in bass. Gdim in Eb major is vii° (G–Bb–Db). With Db in bass, it’s a first-inversion vii° chord.
- **Fm/Eb** = F minor with Eb in bass = Fm in first inversion. In Eb major, Fm is the **ii** chord.
- **Db6** = Db–F–Bb (Db6 = Db F Bb). In Eb major, Db major is the **bVII** chord (common in rock/pop mixolydian b7 style).

### 2. Try Eb major key first

In **Eb major**:  
Eb = I  
Cm = vi  
Gdim = vii°  
Fm = ii  
Db = bVII (borrowed from Mixolydian or from parallel minor)

The progression:  
I – I – vi – vi – vii°6 – ii6 – I – I – vi – vi – I – I – bVII – I  

That’s a plausible major key progression with a bVII–I rock cadence at the end instead of V–I.

### 3. Try Eb minor key

In **Eb minor** (G♭ major key signature):  
Eb minor = i  
Cm = ♭VI (Cb major? No, Cm is C–Eb–G, which in Eb minor is C–Eb–G = C diminished? Wait, no: C–Eb–G in Eb minor scale (Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb) would be C–Eb–Gb = Cdim, not Cm. So C–Eb–G is not in natural Eb minor. It’s in Eb harmonic minor? C–Eb–G is C minor, which requires a G natural, so G is not in Eb minor scale unless raised 7th in harmonic minor? Actually, in Eb harmonic minor: Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb D natural — so C–Eb–G? G natural is not in Eb harmonic minor either (the raised 7th is D natural, not G natural). So Cm chord is C–Eb–G: G natural is the 5th of Cm, so G natural is not in Eb minor scale at all. So Cm is foreign to Eb minor — it’s from Eb major.  

So the presence of Cm and Fm (F–Ab–C) means both have Ab and C natural, which are in Eb major, not Eb minor (Eb minor would have Ab and Cb).  

Thus the key is **Eb major**.

### 4. Mode

The use of **Db major (bVII)** at the end in a major key context, resolving to I (Eb), is characteristic of **Mixolydian mode** (major key with b7 scale degree).  

Eb Mixolydian scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C Db Eb.  
Check chords:  
Eb (I) = Eb G Bb — all in Eb Mixolydian  
Cm (vi) = C Eb G — all in Eb Mixolydian  
Gdim (vii°) = G Bb Db — all in Eb Mixolydian  
Fm (ii) = F Ab C — all in Eb Mixolydian  
Db (bVII) = Db F Ab — all in Eb Mixolydian  

Yes — all chords are diatonic to Eb Mixolydian.

### 5. Conclusion

**Key:** Eb  
**Mode:** Mixolydian

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Eb\ \text{Mixolydian}}
\]
