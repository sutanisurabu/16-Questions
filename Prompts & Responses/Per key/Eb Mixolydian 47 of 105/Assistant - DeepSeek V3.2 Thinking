### Reasoning

First, the sequence of chords is: Eb, Eb, Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb, Eb, Eb, Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Eb, Eb, Db6, Eb.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since the chords are given with bass notes in some cases, like Cm/Eb, which means C minor chord with Eb in the bass, I should consider the overall harmonic context.

Let me list out the chords without the bass designations for simplicity, focusing on the chord qualities:

- Eb major

- Eb major

- C minor (but with Eb bass, so it's still C minor chord)

- C minor

- G diminished (with Db bass, so G diminished chord)

- F minor (with Eb bass, so F minor chord)

- Eb major

- Eb major

- C minor

- C minor

- Eb major

- Eb major

- Db6 (which is Db major with an added 6th, so Db F Ab Bb)

- Eb major

Now, I see that Eb major appears frequently, and C minor also appears. There's also G diminished and F minor, and Db6.

I should consider the key of Eb major. In Eb major, the chords would be:

- I: Eb

- ii: Fm

- iii: Gm

- IV: Ab

- V: Bb

- vi: Cm

- vii: Ddim

In this sequence, we have Cm, which is the vi chord in Eb major. We have Fm, which is the ii chord. We have Gdim, which might be related to the vii chord, but in Eb major, vii is Ddim, not Gdim. Gdim would be a diminished chord built on G, which in Eb major would be the third scale degree, but Gm is minor, not diminished. So Gdim doesn't fit directly into Eb major.

Gdim is a diminished chord. Diminished chords are often used as leading tones or passing chords. In Eb major, the leading tone is D, so Ddim is the vii dim chord. But here we have Gdim.

Perhaps this is in a minor key. Let's consider Eb minor. But the chords include Eb major, not Eb minor. So probably not Eb minor.

Another thought: the mode might be mixolydian or something else. But let's look at the chord progression.

I see Cm/Eb, which is C minor with Eb bass. This could be interpreted as an Eb major chord with a C in it, but since it's written as Cm/Eb, it's clearly a C minor triad over Eb bass, so it's like a first inversion C minor chord. Similarly, Fm/Eb is first inversion F minor chord.

In terms of harmonic function, these inverted chords might still function similarly to their root positions.

Now, let's list the roots of the chords: Eb, Eb, C, C, G, F, Eb, Eb, C, C, Eb, Eb, Db, Eb.

So the roots are: Eb, C, G, F, Db. And Eb is repeated a lot.

In Eb major, the notes are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So the roots Eb, C, F are in the scale, but G and Db are not. G is in the scale, but Gdim has G, Bb, Db? Let's spell the chords.

Eb major: Eb, G, Bb

Cm: C, Eb, G — so C minor has C, Eb, G. But in Cm/Eb, the bass is Eb, but the chord is still C, Eb, G.

Gdim: G, Bb, Db — so G diminished has G, Bb, Db.

Fm: F, Ab, C — so F minor has F, Ab, C.

Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb — so Db major with added 6th, which is Bb.

Now, let's see what notes are used in these chords:

From Eb: Eb, G, Bb

From Cm: C, Eb, G

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db

From Fm: F, Ab, C

From Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

So all together, the notes are: Eb, G, Bb, C, F, Ab, Db. So we have Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. That's almost the Eb major scale, but instead of D natural, we have Db. So we have a flat 7th? In Eb major, the 7th is D, but here we have Db, which is flat 7.

In Eb major, the scale is Eb F G Ab Bb C D. But here we have Db instead of D. So it seems like we have a flat 7th, which is characteristic of the Mixolydian mode.

Mixolydian mode has a major scale with a flat 7th. So for Eb Mixolydian, the scale would be Eb F G Ab Bb C Db.

And looking at the chords, we have Eb major (I), Fm (ii), Cm (vi), and Gdim? What is Gdim in Eb Mixolydian?

Let's build chords from Eb Mixolydian scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C Db

I: Eb major (Eb, G, Bb)

ii: F minor (F, Ab, C)

iii: G diminished? G, Bb, Db — yes, G diminished! Because from G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, so diminished triad.

IV: Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)

V: Bb major (Bb, D, F) — but wait, in Mixolydian, the fifth note is Bb, but the chord would be Bb major only if we have D natural? But in Eb Mixolydian, the scale has Db, not D. So the fifth degree is Bb, and for Bb chord, we need Bb, D, F? But D is not in the scale; we have Db. So actually, the V chord in Mixolydian is minor? Let's see.

If we build chords on each degree of the Mixolydian scale:

- I: Eb G Bb → Eb major

- ii: F Ab C → F minor

- iii: G Bb Db → G diminished

- IV: Ab C Eb → Ab major

- v: Bb Db F → Bb minor? Bb, Db, F is Bb minor chord.

- vi: C Eb G → C minor

- vii: Db F Ab → Db major? Db, F, Ab is Db major chord.

In the sequence, we have Db6, which is Db major with added 6th, so Db, F, Ab, Bb. The Bb is the 6th, which is from the scale? In Db major, the 6th would be Bb, yes, and in Eb Mixolydian, Bb is the fifth degree, so it fits.

In the chord progression, we have Gdim, which is the iii chord in Mixolydian, and we have Fm, which is ii, and Cm, which is vi, and Eb, which is I, and Db6, which is like the VII chord but with added 6th.

In the sequence, we have Gdim/Db, which means G diminished with Db bass. Since Gdim is G, Bb, Db, and with Db bass, it might be emphasizing the Db, or it could be seen as a Db chord with some alterations, but since it's written as Gdim, it's probably functioning as a diminished chord.

In the context, after Gdim/Db, we have Fm/Eb, then Eb.

Now, let's see the progression: Eb, Cm, Gdim, Fm, Eb, and then Db6, Eb.

In Mixolydian, the chords I, ii, iii, IV, v, vi, VII.

Here we have I (Eb), vi (Cm), iii (Gdim), ii (Fm), I (Eb), and then VII (Db6), I (Eb).

So it seems to fit well in Eb Mixolydian.

But let's confirm the mode. Mixolydian is a major mode with flat 7th, and here we have Db instead of D, so yes.

Also, in the chord progression, the use of Db6 leads to Eb, which is typical of a flat VII to I progression in Mixolydian or in rock music.

So, I think the key is Eb Mixolydian.

But is there another possibility? For example, if we consider C minor, which is relative to Eb major, but in C minor, the chords would be different. In C minor, Eb is the mediant, but here Eb is tonicized, so probably not.

Moreover, in C minor, we would have G major or G minor as V chord, but here we have Gdim, which doesn't fit.

So, Eb Mixolydian seems correct.

Therefore, the key is Eb, and the mode is Mixolydian.

So, for the answer, I should say key of Eb Mixolydian.

But let's make sure about the chord notations. The user wrote "Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb"

The bass notes are specified, but in terms of harmonic analysis, the bass notes might affect the inversion, but the chord qualities are what matter for key determination.

In this case, with the chords fitting Eb Mixolydian, it should be fine.

So, I think that's it.

The chord progression Eb, Cm, Gdim, Fm, and Db6 suggests that the key is Eb Mixolydian. This is determined by the presence of chords that align with the Eb Mixolydian scale (Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db), where the flat 7th (Db) is characteristic of the Mixolydian mode.

- Eb major functions as the I chord.
- C minor (Cm) is the vi chord.
- G diminished (Gdim) is the iii chord.
- F minor (Fm) is the ii chord.
- Db6 (Db major with an added 6th) is the VII chord, which commonly resolves to I in Mixolydian progressions.

The bass notes (e.g., Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb) indicate inversions but do not change the overall harmonic context. The progression emphasizes the Mixolydian sound, particularly with the Db6 leading to Eb, reinforcing the flat VII-I cadence.
