### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to figure out the key and mode from the chord progression provided by the user: "Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb." This looks like it might be in Eb major since the chords suggest that. The involvement of Cm/Eb indicates that it’s the vi chord in first inversion. The Gdim chord complicates things, but it can be part of a minor key structure, leading me to consider Eb minor as well.**Analyzing chord functions**

I’m considering the chord G, which isn’t in the Eb minor scale. G might actually be functioning as a leading tone chord in the context of Eb major, especially with Gdim/Db possibly being a secondary leading tone chord. In Eb major, Fm serves as the ii chord, and Fm/Eb suggests F minor over an Eb bass, which means it’s functioning as ii7 in third inversion. Even though it’s written as Fm/Eb, it could imply Fm7/Eb, focusing on creating a suspension over the bass to emphasize the tonic.**Identifying modal borrowing**

Looking at the chord sequence: Eb - Eb - Cm/Eb - Cm/Eb - Gdim/Db - Fm/Eb - Eb - Eb - Cm/Eb - Cm/Eb - Eb - Eb - Db6 - Eb, I notice the Db6 chord near the end. In Eb major, Db serves as the flat VII chord, which likely stems from Mixolydian borrowing. The addition of the 6th (Bb) to the Db major chord is pretty common in Eb major. While the majority of chords point to Eb major, I can't ignore that Gdim, as it sits outside the diatonic structure.**Considering passing chords**

I’m thinking about how the Gdim/Db chord can work as a passing chord between Cm/Eb and Fm/Eb. The bass moves from Eb to Db and back to Eb, linking them together. The inner voices feature C minor leading into Gdim/Db and then Fm/Eb, which might act as a chromatic neighbor passing chord. In Eb major, Db is the flat seventh, so Gdim/Db would function like a V7 chord of Eb, even though it lacks the root.**Evaluating key and mode**

I’m breaking down the chord progression, focusing on how Gdim/Db relates to other chords like Cm/Eb and Fm/Eb. The Gdim chord, lacking a root, has G-Bb-Db and serves a leading-tone function. This could imply it’s functioning as vii°7/IV. While these progressions suggest Eb major, the presence of Db leads me to consider Mixolydian influences. After analyzing the functional roles of chords, it seems the key is indeed Eb major, with elements of modal mixture indicated by the bVII chord.**Determining key and mode**

I’m analyzing the chord Gdim/Db, which denotes a G diminished triad over a Db bass, suggesting it's a second inversion iii°6. Both Cm/Eb and Fm/Eb fit as vi6 and ii6/4, respectively. The presence of Db6 indicates bVII, which is diatonic in Mixolydian. This means the progression is best described in Eb Mixolydian rather than major. Since no D natural is present in the chords, everything aligns with Eb Mixolydian. So, I'll affirm: the tonal center is Eb, and the mode is Mixolydian.

Eb Mixolydian (tonal center Eb, major with flat 7).

Why: The progression is diatonic to Eb Mixolydian: I (Eb), vi (Cm/Eb), iii° (Gdim/Db), ii (Fm/Eb), bVII (Db6). The presence of G diminished and Db (bVII) rules out Eb Ionian (major) and points to Mixolydian.
