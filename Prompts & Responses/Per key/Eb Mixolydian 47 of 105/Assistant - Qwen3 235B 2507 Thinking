### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to write out the chords clearly. The progression is: Eb, Eb, Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb, Eb, Eb, Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Eb, Eb, Db6, Eb. Those slash chords like Cm/Eb mean the chord is C minor with Eb in the bass. So, for analysis, I should consider the root notes and the bass notes separately if needed, but mainly focus on the chord roots.

Let me list the chord roots ignoring the bass notes for now. Eb (I), Cm (III minor), Gdim (VII diminished), Fm (VI minor), Db6 (that's a Db major with a sixth, which usually implies a Db6 chord). Wait, Db6 is Db major with a sixth note added, so the root is Db.

Now, identifying the key. Since most chords are Eb-based, Eb major or Eb minor are candidates. Let's check the chords in Eb major. The diatonic chords in Eb major would be:

I: Eb
ii: Fm
iii: Gm
IV: Ab
V: Bb
vi: Cm
vii°: Ddim

But looking at the progression, we have Cm, which is the vi chord in Eb major. But we also have Fm, which would be the ii chord in Eb major. However, Fm appears here as Fm/Eb, so the chord is F minor with Eb in the bass. In Eb major, Fm is the ii chord, which is diatonic. Then there's Gdim. In Eb major, the vii° chord is Ddim, not Gdim. Gdim would be out of key. Gdim is G-Bb-Db, so its root is G. In Eb major, G is the third scale degree, but the diatonic chord on G would be Gm, not Gdim. So Gdim isn't from Eb major.

What about Eb minor? The natural minor key of Eb has the same notes as Gb major. Eb natural minor scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. So the diatonic chords:

i: Ebm
ii°: Fdim
III: Gb
iv: Abm
v: Bbm
VI: Cb
VII: Db

But the progression has Eb major chords, not minor. Wait, the first chord is Eb (major), not Ebm. So that might not fit. Unless it's a harmonic minor. Let's check Eb harmonic minor. The harmonic minor raises the 7th, so the scale would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, D. The chords would include:

i: Ebm
ii°: Fdim
III+: Gbaug (since the 3rd is augmented: Gb-Bb-D)
iv: Abm
V: Bb (major, because of the raised 7th D)
VI: Cb
vii°: Ddim

But again, we have Eb major chords here. The progression starts with Eb major, which isn't the tonic in minor keys unless it's a major key with borrowed chords. Maybe it's not a minor key. Perhaps it's a major key but with some modal mixture.

Wait, another approach: look for the most frequent chord. The progression starts and ends with Eb, and it appears many times. So Eb is likely the tonic. Now, checking which key has Eb as tonic. So either Eb major or Eb minor. But since the Eb chords are major (indicated as Eb without a 'm'), it's probably Eb major. But earlier, the chords like Cm and Fm are diatonic to Eb major (vi and ii), but Gdim isn't. Gdim in the context of Eb... what's G relative to Eb? G is the mediant (3rd degree). In major keys, the iii chord is minor, not diminished. So Gm would be diatonic, but Gdim is not. So that's a problem.

Wait, the chord is Gdim/Db. So the Gdim chord with Db in the bass. Gdim is G-Bb-Db, so Db is the fifth of Gdim. Playing Gdim/Db means the bass is Db, which is the same note as C# but enharmonically Db. In terms of function, inverted diminished chords can act as passing chords or dominant substitutes.

Let me look at the chord roots again. Listing all chord roots from the progression:

Eb (x2), Cm (x2), Gdim (x1), Fm (x1), Eb (x2), Cm (x2), Eb (x2), Db6 (x1), Eb (x1)

So roots: Eb, C, G, F, Eb, C, Eb, Db, Eb.

Now, thinking in terms of the circle of fifths or possible keys. If the key is Eb major, then:

- Eb = I
- Cm = vi
- Fm = ii
- Db = ? Db is the flat VII (because in Eb major, the VII would be D, but Db is the flat VII, which is a common borrowed chord from the parallel minor).

Ah, that's a point. Db is a semitone below D, which is the leading tone in Eb major. So Db would be the bVII chord. In rock/pop music, the bVII is often borrowed from the mixolydian mode or the parallel minor.

Also, Gdim – what's G in relation to Eb? G is the third scale degree. In Eb major, the iii chord is G minor. But here it's G diminished. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords, especially vii° of the next chord. Let's see the progression around Gdim/Db: ... Cm/Eb, Cm/Eb, Gdim/Db, Fm/Eb ...

So after Gdim/Db comes Fm/Eb. Fm is the ii chord in Eb. So Gdim/Db leading to Fm. Gdim is G-Bb-Db. If the next chord is Fm (F-Ab-C), then the common tones might be Ab (which is G# enharmonically, but Db is the same as C#). Wait, Db is the same as C#, and in F minor, the notes are F, Ab, Cb. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, Gdim could be acting as a secondary dominant. For example, Gdim could be functioning as a vii° of Ab, since Gdim is enharmonically equivalent to Ab diminished seventh (but Gdim is G-Bb-Db, whereas Abdim7 is Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gbb, which is the same as Gdim if we consider enharmonic equivalence in some contexts, but that's stretching). Wait, G#dim7 is G#-B-D-F, but here it's Gdim. Alternatively, maybe Gdim is the vii° of A, but that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps it's the common tone diminished chord. Let me think differently.

Another angle: let's list all the roots and see the scale degrees they imply.

Assuming the key is Eb major:

- Eb = I
- Cm = vi
- Fm = ii
- Db = bVII (since Db is the flat 7th scale degree, as D is natural 7th in Eb major? Wait, Eb major scale is Eb F G Ab Bb C D. So the seventh note is D, natural. So bVII would be Db. Yes, so Db is bVII.
- Gdim: G is the third note in Eb major. The diatonic chord is Gm (iii), but Gdim is not diatonic. However, in harmonic contexts, sometimes the iii chord is altered, but it's uncommon.

But perhaps the key is not major. What if it's C minor? Because we have Cm chords appearing. But the progression starts and ends on Eb. Wait, if the tonic is Eb, then Cm is the vi chord of Eb major. So if it's in Eb major, Cm is vi, Fm is ii, Db is bVII (borrowed from Eb minor), and Gdim... maybe Gdim is a chromatic chord.

Wait, let's consider the entire set of notes used in the progression. Let's list all the chord tones.

Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
Cm: C, Eb, G
Gdim: G, Bb, Db
Fm: F, Ab, C
Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb (since Db6 is Db major triad plus sixth: Db-F-Ab-Bb)

So the notes used:
From Eb: Eb, G, Bb
From Cm: C, Eb, G
From Gdim: G, Bb, Db
From Fm: F, Ab, C
From Db6: Db, F, Ab, Bb

So compiling all notes: C, Db, Eb, E (wait, no E notes), F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, the notes are: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Missing D? But Db is there. So the scale would be C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Which is the same as the C Phrygian mode. But the progression is centered around Eb. Wait, if we take Eb as the tonic, what mode has these notes?

Eb as tonic. Let's list the scale degrees:

Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Comparing to natural minor: Eb natural minor is Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. So here we have G natural instead of Gb, and C natural instead of Cb. So the third scale degree is G natural (major third), sixth is C natural (major sixth). So the scale would be: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db.

That's the same as the Dorian mode. Because Dorian has a major sixth. Let's check:

Eb Dorian: starting on Eb, but Dorian is the second mode of the major scale. So if Eb is Dorian, then the relative major is Db (since Dorian is ii of major). So Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. Therefore, Eb Dorian would have the notes: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Wait, that's different from what we have. The progression has G natural, not Gb.

Wait, in our note list, we have G natural. So in the chords: Eb major has G natural, Cm has G (which is G natural, since C minor is C-Eb-G). Wait, C minor triad is C-Eb-G. Eb is the minor third of C. So yes, G natural.

So the scale degrees over Eb tonic:

- 1: Eb
- 2: F (from Fm, and the progression)
- b3: ? Eb major chords have G, which is the major third. So the third scale degree is G natural (major third), so it's not minor.
- 4: Ab (from Fm, Cm, Db6)
- 5: Bb (from Eb, Cm, etc.)
- 6: C (from Cm, Fm)
- b7: Db (from Gdim, Db6)

Wait, so the scale would be: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. That's seven notes. Let's number them:

1. Eb
2. F
3. G (major third)
4. Ab (flat fourth? Wait, but in major scales, 4 is natural. In this case, 4 is Ab, which is the natural fourth in Eb major (since Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D). Wait, but here the seventh note is Db instead of D. So D is natural in Eb major, but we have Db here.

So the scale Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db is actually Eb Mixolydian. Because Mixolydian has a flat seventh. Eb Mixolydian is the same as Ab major scale starting on Eb. Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So the Mixolydian mode on Eb would be Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Exactly! So the scale degrees: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, b7.

In this case, the chords:

- Eb: I (major)
- Cm: vi (since in Ab major, Cm is the vi chord? Wait, Ab major diatonic chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim. Wait, so if the key is Ab major, then Eb would be V, Cm would be iii, Fm would be vi, Db would be IV. But our progression is centered on Eb, so maybe the tonic is Eb, which would make it the Mixolydian mode.

Eb Mixolydian scale: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db.

Chords diatonic to Eb Mixolydian:

I: Eb (major)
ii: Fm
iii°: Gdim
IV: Ab
v: Bbm
vi: Cm
bVII: Db

Perfect! Let's check:

- Eb is I
- Cm is vi
- Gdim would be iii° (since G is the third note, Gdim is the diminished triad on iii)
- Fm is ii
- Db (Db6 is built on Db, which is the bVII in Mixolydian) because in Mixolydian, the seventh scale degree is flat, so the chord on bVII is major.

Wait, in the progression, after Gdim/Db comes Fm/Eb. So Gdim is iii°, which in a major key would be minor, but in Mixolydian it's diminished because of the flat seventh affecting the third degree's chord. Wait, let's construct the chords in Eb Mixolydian:

Scale: Eb (1), F (2), G (3), Ab (4), Bb (5), C (6), Db (7b)

Triads:

I: Eb-G-Bb (Eb major)
ii: F-Ab-C (F minor)
iii°: G-Bb-Db (G diminished)
IV: Ab-C-Eb (Ab major)
v: Bb-Db-F (Bb minor)
vi: C-Eb-G (C minor)
bVII: Db-F-Ab (Db major)

Yes! Exactly. So the progression:

Eb (I), Cm (vi), Gdim (iii°), Fm (ii), Db6 (bVII, since Db6 is Db-F-Ab-Bb, which is Db major with the sixth added; Db major is the bVII chord).

And Db6 fits as bVII because the sixth in the chord (Bb) is the fifth scale degree in the Mixolydian mode.

Now, checking the progression again:

Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb

Translating to Roman numerals in Eb Mixolydian:

I I vi vi iii° ii I I vi vi I I bVII I

Yes, that all fits diatonically within Eb Mixolydian. No borrowed chords needed. The Gdim is the natural iii° chord in Mixolydian mode. Fm is ii. Cm is vi. Db is bVII.

Also, the use of slash chords like Cm/Eb emphasizes the bass staying on Eb in some places, but the chord roots are still Cm. Similarly, Gdim/Db has Db in the bass, which is the root of bVII, but the chord is Gdim, which is iii°. However, Gdim/Db is an inversion of Gdim, with Db (the third of Gdim) in the bass. But functionally, it's still the iii° chord.

The progression ends on Db6 followed by Eb, which is a common cadence in Mixolydian: bVII - I.

Therefore, the key is Eb, and the mode is Mixolydian.

Based on the chord progression **Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Gdim/Db Fm/Eb Eb Eb Cm/Eb Cm/Eb Eb Eb Db6 Eb**, here's the analysis:

---

### **Key and Mode: Eb Mixolydian**
- **Tonic (I chord): Eb major**  
- **Mode: Mixolydian** (the 5th mode of the major scale, characterized by a **♭7** scale degree).

---

### **Why Eb Mixolydian?**
1. **Scale Structure**:  
   The notes used in the progression align with the **Eb Mixolydian scale**:  
   **Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb – C – Db**  
   - This scale is identical to the **Ab major scale** (Eb Mixolydian = Ab major starting on Eb).  
   - Critical feature: The **♭7 (Db)** replaces the natural leading tone (D) of Eb major, giving Mixolydian its distinctive dominant 7th "vibe."

2. **Diatonic Chord Analysis** (chords built *naturally* on each scale degree in Eb Mixolydian):
   | Scale Degree | Roman Numeral | Chord       | Appears in Progression? |
   |--------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|
   | **1 (Eb)**   | **I**         | **Eb**      | Yes (repeatedly)        |
   | 2 (F)        | ii            | Fm          | Yes (Fm/Eb)             |
   | **3 (G)**    | **iii°**      | **Gdim**    | Yes (Gdim/Db)           |
   | 4 (Ab)       | IV            | Ab          | Not present             |
   | 5 (Bb)       | v             | Bbm         | Not present             |
   | **6 (C)**    | **vi**        | **Cm**      | Yes (Cm/Eb)             |
   | **♭7 (Db)**  | **♭VII**      | **Db**      | Yes (Db6)               |

   - **All chords in your progression fit diatonically** (no borrowed chords needed):  
     - **Eb = I** (tonic, repeated).  
     - **Cm = vi** (common in Mixolydian progressions).  
     - **Gdim = iii°** (a defining trait of Mixolydian *vs.* major, where iii is minor).  
     - **Fm = ii** (standard diatonic chord).  
     - **Db6 = ♭VII** (the hallmark "♭7 chord" of Mixolydian; Db6 adds the 6th/Bb for color).

3. **Harmonic Confirmation**:  
   - The **♭VII (Db) → I (Eb)** cadence (Db6 → Eb) is a signature Mixolydian resolution (e.g., classic rock/blues: "Sweet Child O' Mine," "Norwegian Wood").  
   - **Gdim (iii°)** functioning naturally as a pre-dominant (→ Fm/ii) confirms the ♭7 context (in major keys, iii is minor, not diminished).

---

### **Why Not Other Keys/Modes?**
- **Eb Major?** ❌  
  - Gdim is **not diatonic** to Eb major (where iii = Gm).  
  - Db6 (♭VII) is borrowed from minor, but the progression uses **no other borrowed chords** (e.g., no Bb or Ab chords typical of Eb major).  
  - Gdim here is **diatonic to Mixolydian**, not an alteration.

- **C Minor?** ❌  
  - Progression centers on **Eb**, not Cm.  
  - Eb is the **III chord** in C minor (not tonic), and Db6 is ♭II (uncommon cadence).

- **Eb Dorian?** ❌  
  - Dorian has a **♮6** (C in this case) but also a **♭3** (Gb), while this progression uses **Eb major triads** (G♮ = major 3rd).

---

### **Slash Chords Explained**
- **Cm/Eb**, **Fm/Eb**, **Gdim/Db**: Bass notes emphasize pedal points or smooth voice-leading but **don’t change root functionality**.  
  - Example: **Gdim/Db** = Gdim chord (root G) with Db in bass → still functions as **iii°** (Db is the 3rd of Gdim).

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: Eb (tonic center).  
- **Mode**: **Mixolydian** (due to the ♭7 scale degree/Db, diatonic Gdim, and ♭VII→I resolution).  
- **Signature Sound**: Bluesy, rock-inspired (Mixolydian is ubiquitous in rock/funk due to its dominant 7th flavor without tension for resolution to I).  

This progression **doesn’t “feel minor”** (third is major → G♮), yet avoids the “bright” major sound due to the flattened 7th (Db). Classic Mixolydian! 🎸
