To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

```
F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim
```

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: List all unique chords (with bass notes)**

We'll simplify the notation by identifying the **chord quality** and **root** (even with inversions):

1. **F#dim** → F# diminished triad = F# A C  
2. **D/F#** → D major triad with F# in bass → inversion of D major  
3. **Am/E** → A minor triad with E in bass → inversion of A minor  
4. **G/F#** → G major triad with F# in bass → inversion of G major  
5. **Cmaj7/E** → C major 7th chord with E in bass → inversion of Cmaj7

So the **chord roots** (ignoring inversion) are:

- F#dim (x6)
- D (x4)
- A (x1)
- G (x1)
- C (x1)

So the **chord roots** used are: **F#, D, A, G, C**

---

### **Step 2: Find the key that contains these roots**

Let’s consider which **major key** contains **C, D, G, A, F#** as scale degrees.

List the notes of possible major keys:

#### Try **E major**:
- E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D# → no C, no G natural, no D natural ❌

#### Try **A major**:
- A, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G# → has F#, A, D# — but we have **D natural**, **G natural**, **C natural** ❌

#### Try **D major**:
- D, E, F#, G, A, B, C# → Has D, F#, G, A → all good! But we have **C natural** (Cmaj7) — but D major has **C#**, not C natural ❌

#### Try **G major**:
- G, A, B, C, D, E, F# → ✅ **All roots are here!**
  - G → yes
  - A → yes
  - C → yes
  - D → yes
  - F# → yes

**Perfect!** All chord roots (G, A, C, D, F#) are in **G major**.

Also, the only "outlier" chord is **F#dim** — which is the **vii° chord** in G major.

Let’s map the diatonic chords of **G major**:

| Scale Degree | Chord       | Type     |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| I            | G           | Maj      |
| II           | A           | Min      |
| III          | B           | Min      |
| IV           | C           | Maj      |
| V            | D           | Maj      |
| VI           | E           | Min      |
| VII          | F#          | Dim      |

Our chords:
- **F#dim** → VII° ✅
- **D** → V ✅
- **A** → II ✅
- **G** → I? → Wait, we have **G/F#** — that’s G major in first inversion, so **G root** ✅
- **Cmaj7** → IVmaj7 ✅
- **Am/E** → A minor with E bass → A minor is II, so ✅

The presence of **Cmaj7** doesn’t hurt — diatonic IV chord in G major is C major, and Cmaj7 is just an extended tone (B natural, which is in G major: G-A-B-C-D-E-F# → yes, B is in scale).

**So, all chords are diatonic to G major.**

---

### **Step 3: Analyze mode?**

The question asks for **key and mode**.

- **Key** = **G major** (tonal center = G)
- **Mode** = since the key is G major, and all chords are diatonic, **it's in the Ionian mode**.

But — is there evidence of **modal flavor**? Let's check the **tonal center**.

The progression doesn't resolve clearly to G, but:

- The **F#dim** appears *constantly* — every chord except the last few is F#dim — it’s almost a pedal or drone element.
- The **bass notes** are moving: F# → F# → F# → F# → F# → F# → E → F# → F# → F# → F# → F# → E → F#

**Bass line**: F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - **E** - **F#** - F# - F# - F# - F# - **E** - F#

So the bass is mostly **F#**, with **E** appearing twice — as the 7th and 13th chords.

That’s interesting.

### **Bass line pattern**:  
F# (x6) → **E** → F# → F# (x4) → **E** → F#

So the bass is **F#** (major 7th of G) for most of the time, with **E** (major 6th) as a passing tone.

This is **not typical** of a standard cadence to G.

Moreover, the **Cmaj7/E** is **E-G-B-C** — this is the **E minor 7th inversion?** Wait: Cmaj7/E = E, G, B, C → that’s **E half-diminished**? No!

Wait — let's spell **Cmaj7/E**:

- Cmaj7 = C-E-G-B  
- With E in bass: E-G-B-C

What is this chord?  
- Notes: E, G, B, C → that's **E minor 7th (Em7)**?  
  - Em7 = E-G-B-D — **no D**, has **C** instead → so **E,G,B,C** = **Cmaj7/E**

But **Cmaj7/E** = **E, G, B, C**

This is **functionally** a **Cmaj7**, but in first inversion. However, **in the context of G major**, it’s IVmaj7.

BUT — E is the 6th scale degree in G major. So we’re having a **Cmaj7 chord with the 6th in the bass** — which is unusual.

More importantly — **when the bass is on E, and the chord is Cmaj7**, it can imply **E Phrygian** or **E minor**, but **Cmaj7 contains B natural** (not Bb), so it’s not Phrygian.

Actually, the combination of **F#dim + E bass** creates the sound of:

- **F#dim = F#-A-C**
- **E in bass**

So together: **E - F# - A - C**

That’s **E, F#, A, C**

What's that chord?  
- E root: E, F#, A, C →  
  - E-F# = major 2nd  
  - E-A = perfect 4th  
  - E-C = minor 7th

That’s **E6/9sus4?** Not standard.

Actually, **E, F#, A, C** = **F#m7(b5) in second inversion?**

No — it’s equivalent to **F# half-diminished seventh (F#m7♭5)**: F#-A-C-E — which is **exactly the same notes as E, F#, A, C** — just reordered!

Yes!

So **Cmaj7/E = E, G, B, C**

But **F#dim + E** = F#-A-C + E → F#-A-C-E → **F#m7♭5**

Wait — we have **F#dim** (F#-A-C) and then an **E in the bass** → so the full harmony is F#-A-C-E → **F#m7♭5** — the **iiø7 chord in G major**?

Wait! In G major:

- ii = A minor  
- iiø7 = Bm7♭5 → **B-D-F#**

We don’t have B here.

Hold on — we’re getting confused.

Let me clarify:

F#dim7 = F#-A-C-E → that’s the **vii°7 chord in G major**!

Yes!

In G major:

- vii°7 = **F#-A-C-E** → F# half-diminished seventh — the leading-tone 7th chord.

So **F#dim** in the progression is likely **intended as F#m7♭5**, even if written as F#dim (which sometimes implies just the triad).

In jazz/pop contexts, “F#dim” often implies F#m7♭5 or F#dim7 depending on context.

So we can assume **F#dim = F#m7♭5 = vii°7**

That’s the **leading tone chord** in G major — strongly tonicizing G.

So why is it repeated so much?

And we have **Cmaj7/E** = E-G-B-C — which is the same as **Em7**? No, Em7 is E-G-B-D — we have C, not D.

Cmaj7/E = E, G, B, C — that’s **Cmaj7 with E in bass**.

In G major, C is the IV chord. So IVmaj7.

BUT — E is the VI degree — so we have **IVmaj7 with VI in bass** → creates a **floating quality**.

However, the **most stable harmonic resolution** in this progression is from **F#dim → G** — but G never appears as root!

Wait — **G/F#** appears — that’s G major **with F# in the bass**.

G/F# = bass note F#, chord = G major → so it’s **G major in first inversion**.

So when we have **G/F#**, we are getting a **G triad** with the leading tone in the bass.

That’s a **very strong cadential sound**: F#→G — the leading tone resolving up to tonic.

In fact:  
- F#dim7 → G/F# → G → but here G/F# is the **first inversion of G**, so it’s **G without the root in bass**.

So the progression is built **around F# as a pedal tone**, and the chords above it function like this:

F#dim — F# is the root of the chord  
D/F# — D chord, F# bass  
Am/E — A chord, E bass  
G/F# — G chord, F# bass  
Cmaj7/E — C chord, E bass  
F#dim — F# dim, F# bass

The **bass motion** is: **F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - E - F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - E - F#**

So we have **two E bass notes** — both times associated with **Am** and **Cmaj7**.

That suggests **A minor** and **C major** are "supported" by E — which is the 6th scale degree of G.

In this context, **F# is acting as a sustained note** — like a drone — and the chords are changing above it.

But **every time the chord is F#dim or F#m7♭5**, we feel tension, and **G/F#** provides a kind of **resolution**, albeit incomplete (since G is not in root position).

Also, at the very end: **Cmaj7/E → F#dim**

That’s **IVmaj7 → vii°7** — classic plagal + leading tone motion — *toward* G, but it doesn’t land on G.

So — **is G the tonic?**

- **F# is the leading tone** — it wants to resolve to G
- **G/F#** chord is present — meaning G is the harmonic goal
- **No G root** — but presence of **G/F#** suggests G is the underlying harmony
- No chord is actually **G root position** — but **G/F#** is G major with F# in the bass — still G major harmony

Therefore:

> ✅ **The key is G major.**  
> ✅ **The mode is Ionian** (standard major scale).

The progression is written in **G major**, using primarily diatonic chords, with **F#dim (vii°7)** acting as a recurring tension chord, often unresolved, and **G/F#** implying the tonic without stating it in root position.

It has a **floating, unresolved, ambient quality** — common in post-rock, jazz, or modern pop — but **harmonically anchored in G major**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: G major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (major)**

The progression is in **G Ionian**, with **F#dim (vii°7)** as a recurring melodic/harmonic tension, often resolving conceptually — though not always literally — to G. The tonic (G root) is implied via the G/F# chord, especially in the cadential moments.
