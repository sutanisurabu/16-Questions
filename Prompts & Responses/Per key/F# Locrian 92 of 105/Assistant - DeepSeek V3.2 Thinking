**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Am/E, G/F#, F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Cmaj7/E, F#dim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are a lot of F#dim chords, that might be a clue. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or leading tones in music theory.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

1. F#dim

2. F#dim

3. D/F#

4. D/F#

5. F#dim

6. F#dim

7. Am/E

8. G/F#

9. F#dim

10. F#dim

11. D/F#

12. D/F#

13. F#dim

14. F#dim

15. Cmaj7/E

16. F#dim

Now, I see that D/F# is a D major chord with an F# in the bass, so it's essentially a D chord in first inversion. Similarly, Am/E is an A minor chord with E in the bass, so first inversion, and G/F# is G major with F# in the bass, which is also first inversion. Cmaj7/E is C major 7th with E in the bass, so first inversion.

But the key might be related to the diminished chords. F#dim is a diminished seventh chord. Let me recall what notes are in F#dim. A diminished seventh chord is made up of minor thirds. So F#dim would be F#, A, C, Eb? Wait, in music theory, we often use enharmonic equivalents, but let's think in terms of half steps.

F# diminished seventh: root, minor third, diminished fifth, diminished seventh. So from F#: F# to A is minor third? F# to A is actually a major third? No, let's calculate.

F# to G is half step, G to G# is half, but from F# to A: F# to G is semitone, G to G# is semitone, G# to A is semitone? No, from F# to A is two whole steps? Let's think in terms of intervals.

The minor third from F# would be A, because from F# to A is three half steps, which is a minor third? Actually, from F# to A is three half steps: F# to G (1), G to G# (2), G# to A (3). Yes, three half steps is a minor third. But in standard tuning, F# to A is actually a minor third? F# to A is a minor third only if we consider F# as the root? Let's clarify.

In music theory, a minor third is three half steps. From F# to A: F# to G is 1 half step, G to G# is 2, G# to A is 3? But G# is not the same as A? No, from F# to A directly: the distance is F# to G (1 semitone), G to A (2 semitones)? No, from F# to A is two semitones? Let's list the notes: F#, G, G#, A. So from F# to A is three semitones: F# to G (1), G to G# (2), G# to A (3). Yes, three semitones, which is a minor third.

But in terms of chord quality, a diminished chord has a root, minor third, and diminished fifth. So for F#dim: root F#, minor third A, diminished fifth C? From F# to C: F# to G (1), G to G# (2), G# to A (3), A to A# (4), A# to B (5), B to C (6)? From F# to C is six half steps, which is a diminished fifth? Let's see: a perfect fifth from F# would be C#, so from F# to C is one half step less than perfect fifth, so yes, diminished fifth. So F#dim triad is F#, A, C.

But a diminished seventh chord adds a diminished seventh, which from F# would be Eb? From F# to Eb: F# to E is two half steps down? From F# to E is one half step down? No, from F# to Eb: let's think in half steps. From F# to E is one half step down? F# is higher than E? In terms of pitch, F# is above E, so from F# down to E is one semitone, but we're going up? For chord construction, we stack thirds.

So from F# up a minor third to A, then from A up a minor third to C, then from C up a minor third to Eb. So F#dim7 is F#, A, C, Eb.

But in the progression, it's written as F#dim, which might imply diminished seventh, or it might be just diminished triad? In chord symbols, "dim" usually means diminished seventh, but sometimes it can mean diminished triad. However, in context, it might be functioning as a leading tone chord.

Now, looking at the other chords: D/F# is D major with F# bass, so notes D, F#, A. But since it's over F# bass, it's like a D chord with F# in bass.

Similarly, Am/E is A, C, E with E bass, so it's A minor with E bass.

G/F# is G, B, D with F# bass.

Cmaj7/E is C, E, G, B with E bass.

Now, to find the key, I need to see what key these chords belong to. Let's consider the F#dim chord. F#dim is often used as a vii° chord in a key. For example, in G major, the vii° chord is F#dim. In G minor, the vii° chord is also F#dim? In minor keys, the vii° chord is based on the raised seventh scale degree.

Let's list possible keys where F#dim is the vii° chord.

If F# is the leading tone, then the tonic would be G. So in G major or G minor.

But let's see the other chords: D is the V chord in G major, and G is the I chord, but here we have G/F#, which is G with F# bass, so it might be a passing thing.

Also, Am is the ii chord in G major, and Cmaj7 is the IV chord in G major? In G major, the chords are G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim. So yes, Am is ii, C is IV, D is V, F#dim is vii°.

But we have Am/E, which is still Am, and G/F#, which is G with F# bass, and Cmaj7/E, which is C with E bass.

So in G major, all these chords fit: F#dim (vii°), D (V), Am (ii), G (I), C (IV).

But the progression ends with Cmaj7/E and F#dim. If it's in G major, ending on F#dim might not be stable, but it could be a transitional ending.

Also, the progression has multiple F#dim and D/F#, which might be functioning as dominant preparations.

Now, let's consider the bass movement. The bass notes are often F#, since many chords have F# in the bass. From the progression: when it's F#dim, the bass is F#? But F#dim has F# as root, so bass is F#. D/F# has bass F#, so bass is F#. G/F# has bass F#, so bass is F#. And Cmaj7/E has bass E, but then back to F#dim with bass F#.

So the bass is frequently on F#, and only briefly on E for Cmaj7/E.

This suggests that F# is a important bass note, perhaps a pedal point or something.

In terms of key, if F# is the bass, and it's part of the dominant function in G major, since F# is the leading tone to G.

But let's see the chord before the end: Cmaj7/E to F#dim. Cmaj7 is IV in G, and F#dim is vii°, so IV to vii° is a common progression, leading to I, but here it doesn't go to I, it ends on vii°, which is unusual but possible.

Perhaps the key is G major, and the mode is Ionian, but with emphasis on the diminished chord.

Another thought: sometimes diminished chords are used in minor keys. In G minor, the vii° chord would be F#dim, but in G minor, the natural scale has F natural, so the leading tone is F# only in harmonic or melodic minor. So in G harmonic minor, the vii° chord is F#dim.

But in G minor, the chord D is still V, but D major would require an F#, which is the raised seventh, so in G harmonic minor, V is D major, and vii° is F#dim.

Similarly, Am is not in G minor; in G minor, the ii chord would be A diminished, since G minor scale is G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, so ii is A diminished, but here we have Am, which is A minor, so that has C natural, whereas in G minor, C is natural, but A minor has A, C, E, so C natural, which is in G natural minor? G natural minor has Bb and Eb, so A minor would have A, C, E, and C is natural, which is in G natural minor, but the third of A minor is C, which is the fourth of G minor, so in G natural minor, the ii chord is A diminished? Let's list chords in G natural minor: i: Gm, ii°: Adim, III: Bb, iv: Cm, v: Dm, VI: Eb, VII: F. So Am is not in G natural minor. But in G harmonic minor, the scale is G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#. So chords: i: Gm, ii°: Adim, III+: Bbaug, iv: Cm, V: D, VI: Eb, vii°: F#dim. So Am is not in G harmonic minor either. Am would require A, C, E, but in G harmonic minor, the notes are A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#, G, so E is not in the scale; E is not in G harmonic minor. So Am cannot be in G minor. Therefore, the key cannot be G minor because of the Am chord.

So probably, the key is G major.

But let's confirm with the Cmaj7 chord. In G major, C is IV, and Cmaj7 is fine.

So all chords fit in G major: F#dim (vii°), D (V), Am (ii), G (I), C (IV).

Now, the progression has Am/E, which is ii6 in first inversion, and G/F#, which is I with leading tone in bass, and Cmaj7/E, which is IV6 with third in bass.

The frequent use of F#dim and D/F# suggests that we are emphasizing the leading tone F# and the dominant D.

The progression ends with Cmaj7/E to F#dim. In G major, IV to vii° is a deceptive progression if it goes to vi, but here it ends on vii°, which is unstable, but perhaps it's a transitional ending or it implies a resolution to G.

Perhaps the mode is not strictly Ionian, but since all chords are diatomic to G major, it should be Ionian.

But let's see the sequence: it starts with F#dim repeatedly, then D/F#, then F#dim, then Am/E and G/F#, then F#dim, then D/F#, then F#dim, then Cmaj7/E and F#dim.

The bass is mostly on F#, with only Am/E having E bass and Cmaj7/E having E bass, but G/F# has F# bass, so bass is on F# for most of the time.

This might suggest that F# is a pedal point, and the key is G, with F# as the leading tone pedal.

In terms of mode, since it's in G major, it's Ionian.

But let's see if there is any modulation or other key.

Another possibility: sometimes diminished chords can be part of other keys. For example, F#dim is also the ii° chord in E minor? In E minor, the ii° chord is F#dim, but then we have D chord, which in E minor would be VII? In E minor natural, VII is D major, but ii° is F#dim only in harmonic minor? Let's see E harmonic minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D#. So chords: i: Em, ii°: F#dim, III+: Gaug, iv: Am, V: B, VI: C, vii°: D#dim. So D major is not in E harmonic minor. D major has D, F#, A, but in E harmonic minor, F# is there, but D natural? In E harmonic minor, the seventh is D#, so D natural is not in the scale. So D major would not fit in E minor.

Similarly, in other keys, F#dim might be used, but with D major and Am and C, it seems best fit for G major.

Moreover, the chord G/F# is directly pointing to G as tonic.

So I think the key is G major.

Therefore, key: G major, mode: Ionian.

But the question says "determine key and mode". Mode might refer to the scale mode, which in this case is Ionian, but since it's major, we often just say major.

In classical terms, mode is Ionian for major.

But sometimes in modern music, mode might refer to something else, but here it seems straightforward.

So I'll go with key of G major.

The chord progression primarily consists of chords diatonic to G major: F#dim (vii°), D (V), Am (ii), G (I), and Cmaj7 (IV). The frequent use of F#dim and D/F# emphasizes the leading tone F# and dominant function, pointing towards G as the tonic. The progression ends on F#dim, which is unstable but common in transitional passages, and the bass movement often features F# as a pedal point, reinforcing the dominant harmony.

Thus, the key is **G major**, and the mode is **Ionian**.
