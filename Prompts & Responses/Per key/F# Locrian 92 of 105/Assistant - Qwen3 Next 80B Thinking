### Reasoning

Okay, the user gave me a chord progression: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at all the chords listed. The chords are F#dim, D/F#, Am/E, G/F#, and Cmaj7/E. The F#dim appears multiple times, which might be a clue. Diminished chords usually have specific roles, like leading tones or tensions. 

Let me list out each chord and see what notes they contain. Starting with F#dim. A diminished chord is typically root, minor third, diminished fifth. So F#dim would be F#, A, C. Wait, F# to A is a minor third (3 semitones?), no, F# to A is actually a minor third? Let me check: F# to G is 1, G to G# is 2, G# to A is 3? Wait, no. F# to A# is major third (4 semitones), but F# to A would be minor third (3 semitones). Yes, because F# to G is 1, G to G# is 2, G# to A is 3. So F#dim is F#, A, C. Because diminished fifth from F# would be C. F# to C is an augmented fourth? Wait, no. F# to C# is perfect fifth (7 semitones), but if it's diminished fifth, then it's a tritone. Wait, diminished fifth is the same as augmented fourth. So F#dim chord has root F#, minor third A (since F# to A is 3 semitones: F#-G-G#-A), and diminished fifth would be from F# to C, which is 6 semitones (F#-G-G#-A-A#-B-C), yes, that's a tritone. So F#dim: F#, A, C.

Now D/F#. That's a D major triad with F# in the bass. So D major is D, F#, A. So D/F# would be F#, A, D. Which is a D major chord in first inversion.

Then Am/E. A minor with E in the bass. A minor is A, C, E. So Am/E would be E, A, C. So bass note E.

G/F# is G major with F# in the bass. G major is G, B, D. So G/F# would be F#, G, B, D? Wait, but typically when writing a slash chord, it's the bass note and the chord above. So G/F# would be F# as bass, then G major triad, so F#, G, B, D. But sometimes written as F#sus4 or something? Wait, maybe it's a G7 chord without the G? No, G major over F# bass. So the chord would be F#, G, B, D. But let's see the notes: F# is the root, then G (major second), B (major third?), wait no. F# to G is a whole step, G to B is minor third? Wait, F# as bass note. The chord above it is G major. But G major is G, B, D. So when you put F# in bass, the notes are F#, G, B, D. So the intervals from F#: minor second (G), major third (B), perfect fifth (D). But that's actually a G major chord with F# in bass. Alternatively, this could be seen as F# minor 7 flat 5? But maybe not.

Then Cmaj7/E. C major 7 with E in bass. Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. So Cmaj7/E is E, C, G, B. So the bass is E.

Now the progression has repeated F#dim, D/F#, etc. Let me list all chords in the progression:

F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Am/E, G/F#, F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Cmaj7/E, F#dim.

So the chord sequence is:

1. F#dim

2. F#dim

3. D/F#

4. D/F#

5. F#dim

6. F#dim

7. Am/E

8. G/F#

9. F#dim

10. F#dim

11. D/F#

12. D/F#

13. F#dim

14. F#dim

15. Cmaj7/E

16. F#dim

Hmm. Now, to figure out the key and mode. Let's see what the roots are. The chords have roots F#, D, A, G, C. So F#, D, A, G, C. Also, the bass notes: for D/F# the bass is F#, Am/E bass is E, G/F# is F#, Cmaj7/E is E. So bass notes are F#, D (but D/F# has bass F#), Am/E bass E, G/F# bass F#, Cmaj7/E bass E.

Let's list all the chords in terms of their root notes, ignoring inversions for a moment. So:

F#dim → root F#

D/F# → D major triad

Am/E → A minor triad

G/F# → G major triad

Cmaj7/E → C major 7th

So the main chords present are F#dim, D major, A minor, G major, C major 7. So the chord roots are F#, D, A, G, C.

What key has these chords? Let's see. Common keys. If we have F#dim, which is a diminished chord. Diminished chords often appear as the vii° in major keys, but F#dim would be vii° of G major, because in G major the leading tone is F#, and vii° is F#, A, C. Yes! G major has the notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So F#dim chord is vii° of G major. Let's check.

G major diatonic chords:

I: G

II: A minor

III: B minor

IV: C major

V: D major

VI: E minor

VII: F# diminished

Yes! Exactly. So F#dim is the vii° chord of G major. Then D major is V chord in G major. A minor is II chord. C major is IV. E minor would be VI, but here we have Am/E and Cmaj7/E. Cmaj7/E is C major seventh, which would be IV maj7 in G major. A minor is the ii chord. But wait, in G major, the ii is A minor. But here we have Am/E, which is A minor triad with E bass. So root A, but bass E. So the bass is E, which is the 6th note of the G major scale. Wait, but the chord itself is A minor, so the notes are A, C, E. So Am/E is E, A, C. Which is still the same as Am. Similarly, Cmaj7/E is E, C, G, B. Which is Cmaj7 with E in bass.

Now, looking at this: if we have a chord progression where the main chords are F#dim, D, A minor, C major, then G major seems possible. Let's check the key of G major. The scale is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. All the chords mentioned fit here.

Wait, but the user also has a Cmaj7. In G major, the IV chord is C major. But Cmaj7 would be a bit more extended, but it's still part of the key since it's diatonic. Cmaj7 in G major is IVmaj7, which is built on the 4th degree. Yes, C, E, G, B. Since the G major scale has B (as the leading tone), so B is present. So yes, Cmaj7 is diatonic to G major.

Now, the Am chord is the ii chord in G major. D is the V chord. So the progression alternates between F#dim (vii°), D (V), then Am (ii), then G (but wait, where is the G major chord? Let's see. The progression doesn't actually have a G major chord. Wait, let's check the given chords again. The chords listed are F#dim, D/F#, Am/E, G/F#, Cmaj7/E. Wait, G/F# is a chord that has G as the top note, but the bass is F#. So the chord is G major with F# bass. But in G major, the I chord is G. However, here G/F# would be G major chord but with F# in bass. But G major chord is G, B, D. So G/F# would be F#, G, B, D. Which is actually the same as D7? Wait no. D7 is D, F#, A, C. But here it's F#, G, B, D. Wait, that's a different chord. Wait, F#, G, B, D. Let's see. F# to G is a minor second. G to B is major third. B to D is minor third. So that's F# sus2 or something? Wait, but F# minor add9? No. Alternatively, perhaps it's an F#m7b5 chord? Let's see. F#m7b5 would be F#, A, C, E. But here we have F#, G, B, D. So no. Alternatively, it's a G major chord with F# as bass. But G major has notes G, B, D. So with F# added as bass, it's F#, G, B, D. So the chord is Gsus4? No, because Gsus4 would be G, C, D, but here we have F#. Hmm. Alternatively, it's a D major seventh? D major 7 is D, F#, A, C#. But here we have F#, G, B, D. That's different. Wait F#, G, B, D. Let's see intervals:

F# (root), G is a major second, B is a major third (F# to B is 6 semitones? Wait F# to G: 1, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, A# to B:5. Wait no, F# to B is a perfect fourth (5 semitones: F#-G-G#-A-A#-B). Wait, no. F# to G: 1 semitone, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, A# to B:5. Wait, F# to B is a perfect fourth (5 semitones). Then B to D is minor third (3 semitones: B-C-C#-D). So F#-G-B-D. So the notes are F#, G, B, D. So this is a chord that can be named as G major with F# bass, or maybe F#m7? No. F#m7 would be F#, A, C, E. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a D major triad with an added G? Not sure. Wait, perhaps this is a different key.

Wait, but maybe the key is G major, and G/F# is a G chord in first inversion? Wait, the standard inversions for G major. Root position G, B, D. First inversion B, G, D. Second inversion D, G, B. But G/F# would be bass F#. So that's not a standard inversion of G. So F# isn't part of G major chord. So G/F# would have notes F#, G, B, D. So the chord includes F#, which is the leading tone of G, but G major chord doesn't include F#. So that's a problem. So that would mean that the chord G/F# is not part of the G major scale. Because the scale of G has F#, so F# is present. But G major chord is G, B, D. So adding F# as the bass note would mean the chord has F#, G, B, D. So that's actually a G major chord but with an added F#? No, wait, G major chord is G, B, D, so if you have F# as the bass, then F#, G, B, D. So the notes are F#, G, B, D. Which in terms of the scale of G major, F# is the leading tone. So F# is in the scale. So this chord would have all the notes of the scale, but the chord is built on G with F# in bass. Hmm, but how does this fit into the key?

Alternatively, maybe the key is not G major. Wait, but the F#dim chord. In G major, vii° is F diminished, but F# is the leading tone. Yes. F#dim is vii°. So if the key is G major, then:

- F#dim is vii°

- D major is V

- Am is ii

- C major is IV

But what's the chord G/F#? If we have a chord that has bass F# and the notes G, B, D. So the chord is F# as bass, then G, B, D. So the chord would be F#sus4(add9)? Wait, let's see. From F# base, the notes are F# (root), G (1 step), B (minor third?), but F# to B is a perfect fourth (5 semitones). Hmm. Alternatively, in the context of G major, this might be a G7 chord? But G7 is G, B, D, F, but here it's F# instead of F. So that would be G7#9 or something, which is not diatonic. Hmm. Maybe this isn't G major.

Wait, perhaps another key. Let's look at the other chords. The progression has Am/E, which is A minor with E in bass. A minor is A, C, E. So Am/E would have notes E, A, C. Which is the same as E7? No, E7 is E, G#, B, D. So no. But if we have E note in bass, A and C, then the chord is A minor. So that's fine.

Cmaj7/E: notes E, C, G, B. In G major, Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. So yes, diatonic. And E is the 6th note of G major. So that's okay.

Wait, but the chord G/F# is F#, G, B, D. In G major scale, these notes are all present: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. Yes, all four notes are in G major. So G/F# chord is a type of G chord, but actually the note F# is part of G major. So the chord is F#, G, B, D. Which could be considered as a variant. But what's the chord? If you take the bass as F#, then the notes F#, G, B, D. So the intervals from F#: 1st (F#), then G (major 2nd), B (major 3rd? Wait F# to B is a perfect fourth: 5 semitones. Wait:

F# to G: 1 semitone

F# to A: 2 semitones (but A isn't in the chord here)

F# to B: 3 semitones? Wait F#-G-G#-A-A#-B. Wait no: F# → G is 1, G → G# is 2, G# → A is 3, A → A# is 4, A# → B is 5. So F# to B is 5 semitones, which is a perfect fourth. Then F# to D is F# → G (1), G# (2), A (3), A# (4), B (5), C (6), C# (7), D (8). So F# to D is 8 semitones, which is a minor 7th. Hmm. So F#, G, B, D. So intervals from F#: 2nd, 5th (if you count up to B?), not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a G major chord with an added F# but it's not standard. Alternatively, think of it as F# minor 7 flat 5? No, that would be F#-A-C-E. Not matching. Alternatively, it's a D major chord with a G? D major is D, F#, A. Adding G would make it Dmaj7? No, D major 7 is D-F#-A-C#. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the chord is actually meant to be a D chord with G? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the key is A minor. Let's consider the key of A minor. A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. But wait, F#dim is F#, A, C. In A minor, F# isn't diatonic. Because A natural minor has F natural. So F# would be an accidental. However, if it's A harmonic minor, then the 7th is G#, but still, F# would be in the scale? Wait, A harmonic minor is A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. So F is natural. So F# isn't in A harmonic minor either. So F# would have to be an accidental. But F#dim chord has F#, which isn't in A minor's natural scale. If A minor, then the diatonic diminished chord would be Bdim (B, D, F), but here we have F#dim, which is different. So probably not A minor.

Another possibility: E minor. Let's check E natural minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Diatonic chords: i: E minor, ii: F#dim, III: G major, IV: A minor, V: B minor, vi: C major, vii: D major. Wait, E natural minor's diatonic chords:

i: Em (E, G, B)

ii°: F#dim (F#, A, C)

III: G (G, B, D)

IV: Am (A, C, E)

v: Bm (B, D, F#)

vi: C (C, E, G)

VII: D (D, F#, A)

Ah! So in E natural minor, the F#dim chord is the ii° (supertonic diminished). And then, in the progression given, there's F#dim repeated, D/F#, Am/E, etc.

Let's see. If the key is E minor, then the diatonic chords include:

- F#dim as ii°

- D major is VII chord

- Am is IV chord

Wait, in E natural minor, the IV chord is A minor. Yes. So Am is IV.

Then D major (D, F#, A) is VII chord.

Then what about G major? G would be III chord in E minor.

So let's see the progression with E minor as key:

F#dim (ii°), D/F# (D major chord with F# bass), which is VII chord. D/F# is D major triad but with F# bass. D major's notes are D, F#, A. So D/F# would be F#, A, D.

Am/E: A minor with E bass. Am is IV chord (A, C, E), so Am/E would be E, A, C.

G/F#: G major with F# bass. G major in E minor is III chord (G, B, D). So G/F# would be F#, G, B, D. Which would be the same as before.

Cmaj7/E: C major with E bass. C is the vi chord in E minor. Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. Which in E minor is vi maj7, but diatonic? In natural minor, C is major, so C major is diatonic. Cmaj7 would still be diatonic as C, E, G, B. Since all the notes are in E natural minor scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

Yes, the E natural minor scale (Aeolian mode):

E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

So in this key:

- ii°: F#dim (F#, A, C)

- VII chord: D major (D, F#, A)

- IV chord: Am (A, C, E)

- III chord: G major (G, B, D)

- vi chord: C major (C, E, G)

So looking at the given chords:

F#dim → ii°

D/F# → D major triad, which would be VII chord. D/F# is D major with F# bass.

Am/E → Am chord with E bass, which is IV chord.

G/F# → G major with F# bass, which is III chord.

Cmaj7/E → Cmaj7 with E bass, which is vi maj7.

So all of these chords are diatonic to E natural minor (Aeolian mode). Let's check each one:

- F#dim: F#, A, C. E minor scale has all those notes.

- D major: D, F#, A. Yes, in E minor.

- Am: A, C, E. Yes.

- G major: G, B, D. Yes.

- Cmaj7: C, E, G, B. Yes, since E minor scale has C, E, G, B (as in the C major triad plus B natural, which is the 7th? Wait, Cmaj7 in E minor: C major seventh would be C, E, G, B. Since B is part of the E minor scale (E, F#, G, A, B, C, D), yes. Because natural minor has B as the major 7th? Wait, no: E natural minor is E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. So the 7th of the scale is D, no. Wait, scales: root is E. The natural minor scale has the 7th degree as D. Wait, no. Let's list:

E (1), F# (2), G (3), A (4), B (5), C (6), D (7).

But in natural minor, the 3rd is minor, 6th and 7th are minor too? Wait, natural minor is the same as Aeolian mode, so:

Root: E

M2: F#

m3: G

P4: A

P5: B

m6: C

m7: D

So in natural minor, yes, the 7th is minor (D). So in the scale, the notes are E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

So the chord C major: C, E, G. In E minor, C is the 6th degree, and is major. Yes. Cmaj7 would be C, E, G, B. Yes, B is in the scale (5th degree), so the seventh of Cmaj7 is B, which is diatonic.

Similarly, G major chord is G (root), B (3rd), D (5th). G is III degree. In E minor, the III chord is major. Yes. B is the 5th degree. D is the 7th.

F#dim chord: F#, A, C. F# is 2nd, A is 4th, C is 6th.

D major chord: D (7th degree), F# (2nd), A (4th). But the VII chord in E minor is D major (since the 7th is D, so D major).

So yes, all chords fit into E natural minor.

Now, what about the chord G/F#? G/F# would be G major with F# bass. G major is G, B, D. So G/F# would have notes F#, G, B, D. In E minor's scale, all these notes are present. F# (2), G (3), B (5), D (7). Yes. So that chord is in the key.

Similarly, D/F#: D major chord with F# bass. D major is D, F#, A. Bass F#, so F#, A, D. Which in E minor is F# (2), A (4), D (7). So that chord would be the VII chord, but with F# bass. That's a bit unusual, but it's within the key.

Then Am/E: Am is A minor with E bass. A is IV, E is root. So Am/E has E, A, C. Which fits.

Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 with E bass → E, C, G, B. Which are E (root), C (6), G (3), B (5). All in scale.

So all chords fit into E natural minor.

But wait, when looking at the key, E natural minor would be the same as G major (relative major). Because E minor is the relative minor of G major. So they share the same notes. So whether you consider this as E minor or G major, it depends on the tonal center.

But the question is to determine key and mode. So if the progression is centered around E minor, then it's in the Aeolian mode of G major, which is E minor.

But the user asks for key and mode. So key of E minor, mode Aeolian.

However, another thought: sometimes when there's a leading tone, like F#, it might be in harmonic minor. But in the given chords, there's no G# or anything. The F#dim chord has F#, A, C. If it were harmonic minor, the 7th would be D#, but in E harmonic minor, the scale is E, F#, G, A, B, C, D#. So if it were harmonic minor, the V chord would be B major (B, D#, F#). But in the current progression, the only chords with a B note are in G/F# (B present), but it's not a V chord. The VII chord would be D major, but in harmonic minor, the VII chord would be D# diminished. But since D is major here, it's more likely natural minor.

Also, there's no G#, so harmonic minor is unlikely. So natural minor.

But also, the presence of F#dim as ii° chord is diatonic to both E minor and G major. So the key could be G major or E minor. But which one is the tonal center?

Looking at the chord progression. Typically, the tonal center is the note that feels like "home". In this progression, what could be the tonic? The chord that is most prominent as the home chord. The progression starts with F#dim, then D/F#, then F#dim again, etc. The last chord is F#dim. Not sure. Let's see the structure.

Let me see how the chords resolve. For example, in a typical progression for E minor, the VII chord (D) often leads to tonic Em. But here, the progression has a lot of F#dim chords. F#dim is the ii° chord, which can lead to chords like vii° to I or other functions.

Wait, in the E minor key, the ii° chord (F#dim) can lead to iii chord (G) or iv (Am), but also it can resolve to tonic.

But let's see the given progression. It's repeating F#dim, then D/F#, repeating, then Am/E, G/F#, then repeats etc. Let's list the order:

F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Am/E, G/F#, F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Cmaj7/E, F#dim.

So the progression starts with F#dim twice, then D/F# twice, then F#dim, F#dim, then Am/E, G/F#, etc. If the tonal center were G major, then the chords would be:

I: G

ii: Am

iii: Bm

IV: C

V: D

vi: Em

vii°: F#dim

But in this progression, we don't see G major anywhere. The chords are F#dim, D, Am, C, etc. So if the progression were in G major, the vii° chord (F#dim) would typically lead to I (G), but in the progression given, there's no G chord at all. Unless G/F# is part of it. But G/F# is F#, G, B, D. If the key were G major, then F# is the leading tone. But the chord is F#, G, B, D. So maybe that's a Gmaj7 chord? Because Gmaj7 is G, B, D, F. Wait, no. Gmaj7 has F#, no. Wait, G major seventh is G, B, D, F#. Oh! Yes! Gmaj7 has F#. So Gmaj7 is G, B, D, F#.

Wait, if the chord is written as G/F#, then that would be Gmaj7 with F# in bass. But if the bass note is F#, then the chord is F#-G-B-D, which is Gmaj7. Because Gmaj7 notes are G, B, D, F#. So inverting it so that F# is bass. So F#-G-B-D would be a Gmaj7 in second inversion. Because a Gmaj7 chord in root position is G, B, D, F#. First inversion would be B, D, F#, G. Second inversion D, F#, G, B. Third inversion F#, G, B, D.

Ah yes! So G/F# is a Gmaj7 chord in third inversion. So bass F#, chord notes F#, G, B, D. So that's Gmaj7.

Similarly, Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 chord in first inversion. Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. With E bass. So the slash chord notation here makes sense.

D/F#: D major chord in first inversion. D major is D, F#, A. So D/F# would be F#, A, D.

Am/E: Am is A, C, E. With E in bass. So E, A, C. Which is Am in first inversion.

Okay, so in the key of G major, all the chords mentioned fit as diatonic chords. Let's check:

- F#dim: vii° chord, yes.

- D (D major): V chord

- D/F# is same chord

- Am: ii chord

- Am/E same chord with inversion

- Cmaj7: IVmaj7, but in G major, IV chord is C major; Cmaj7 is still diatonic. C, E, G, B. All in G major scale.

- G/F# is Gmaj7 third inversion.

Yes, all fit into G major. But the key here is that there is a G major chord in the form of Gmaj7. However, in the given progression, the chord labeled G/F# has notes F#, G, B, D. Which is exactly Gmaj7. So the key could be G major.

But wait, the chord progression does not have any G major root chords, just Gmaj7 in inversion. The only instance of G note is in G/F# and Cmaj7/E.

So if the key were G major, the tonic is G. But in the progression, we never actually get to play a root position G chord. The Gmaj7 is played in inversion. However, that's not uncommon. Chords can be inverted to create bass lines.

Alternatively, the key could be E minor. Let's check again.

In E minor, the chords:

- Cmaj7 is vi maj7

- G is III maj

- D is VII maj

- Am is IV minor

- F#dim is ii dim

But the E note is present as bass in Am/E and Cmaj7/E. Am/E has E in bass, Cmaj7/E also has E in bass. That might indicate that E is the tonic, since it's prominent in the bass notes.

Similarly, in the progression, Am/E and Cmaj7/E both have E in bass. If the tonic is E, then having E in bass for Am and C chords would make sense as subdominant and vi chords.

But let's see. If the key is E minor, the tonic is E. Then the progression would feel resolved on E. But in the given chord progression, I don't see any E chords. E minor chord would be E, G, B. But the chords given are F#dim, D/F#, Am/E, etc. The chord Am/E has E in bass but it's an A minor chord. No actual Em chord present.

Similarly, in the key of G major, there's no G chord root position either. But there is a Gmaj7 chord in inversion.

Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's list all chords in the key of G major:

- I: G major

- ii: Am

- iii: Bm

- IV: C major

- V: D major

- vi: Em

- vii°: F#dim

So all chords here are in G major. The progression includes F#dim (vii°), D major (V), Am (ii), C (IV), and Gmaj7 chord.

But since the Gmaj7 is part of the progression (as G/F#), and the tonic could be G major, where Gmaj7 is the I chord.

However, in the progression provided, the actual chords listed don't include root position G major; it's only Gmaj7 in inversion. But that's still part of the key. So the key could still be G major.

Similarly, if the tonic is G, then the VII chord (F#dim) typically leads to I. But in this progression, it's used a lot. Let's see the structure: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# etc. So after F#dim chords, we go to D/F# (V), then to Am/E (ii), then G/F# (I), but inverted. So it's like vii°, V, ii, I. That seems like a progression that resolves to I.

But the progression ends with F#dim again. Let me count the exact sequence:

The progression given is:

F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim

So let's group them. First 2 bars F#dim twice. Then two D/F# repeats. Then F#dim twice. Then Am/E, G/F#. Then repeats the same: F#dim twice, D/F# twice, F#dim twice, Cmaj7/E, F#dim.

So in the final part: F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim.

If in G major, Cmaj7 is the IV chord. So a progression that has IV might move to V or something. But not sure.

Alternatively, if considering the tonic as E minor. Then the E minor scale has the same notes. The tonic chord Em: E, G, B. The Am chord (IV) would have E in bass as Am/E. That could be seen as the subdominant with E in bass. Similarly, Cmaj7/E has E in bass. If the mode is Aeolian (E minor), then having E in bass for other chords makes sense, but the tonic chord isn't present.

But typically, the tonal center is inferred from the chords that function as tonic. If there's no Em chord at all in the progression, then maybe the key is G major. Because G major has a I chord which is G, and if there's a Gmaj7 chord, which is part of the tonic chord family.

Another perspective: the F#dim chord is a diminished triad that typically functions as a leading tone chord. In major keys, it's the vii°, so it wants to resolve to I. If the resolution is to G major (I), then the tonic is G. But in the progression, after some steps it goes to G/F# which would be Gmaj7 chord. So perhaps when the progression goes to Gmaj7, that's acting as the tonic.

But in the given chords, G/F# appears only once in the middle. Let's see the sequence:

After the first part: ... Am/E G/F# ...

Then the next part: ... Cmaj7/E ...

So if the key is G major, then Am/E is ii chord with E bass, G/F# is I chord (Gmaj7 inversion), then Cmaj7/E is IV chord. Which would be like ii → I → IV, but not sure. Maybe a common progression.

Alternatively, in E minor, the Am/E would be IV chord with E in bass, and Cmaj7/E is vi chord with E in bass. So if the tonic is E, then Cmaj7/E has the tonic in bass for the vi chord. Hmm, possible.

But the presence of Gmaj7 chord. If the key is G major, Gmaj7 is the I chord. So it's the tonic. If it's in E minor, Gmaj7 would be III chord.

But how to decide which key?

Another way: look for the bass notes. The bass line could indicate the root movement. Let's extract the bass notes:

For F#dim: root is F#, but usually diminished chords have root in bass usually, unless specified. But the way it's written "F#dim"—probably root position, so bass F#.

Similarly, D/F# means D chord with F# in bass.

So the bass notes for each chord:

1. F#dim → bass F#

2. F#dim → F#

3. D/F# → F#

4. D/F# → F#

5. F#dim → F#

6. F#dim → F#

7. Am/E → E (since it's slash chord E)

8. G/F# → F#

9. F#dim → F#

10. F#dim → F#

11. D/F# → F#

12. D/F# → F#

13. F#dim → F#

14. F#dim → F#

15. Cmaj7/E → E (since slash chord E)

16. F#dim → F#

So the bass notes are mostly F#, with occasional E. So the bass line has a lot of F# and E. So it's moving between F# and E. If the tonic chord is Em, the bass would often be E, but here the bass note E occurs only twice (in Am/E and Cmaj7/E), and otherwise F#. If the key were G major, then the bass F# repeated suggests that F# is a prominent note, but maybe the tonic is still G.

Alternatively, if the key is G major, the bass line of F# and E could be part of the bass movement. The E is the vi chord (Em), but there's no Em chord, but the Am/E has E in bass. Hmm.

Another idea: the F#dim chord is the vii° in G major. So that chord typically resolves to G. If there's a resolution to G chord, that would confirm G major. But in the progression given, G/F# is present, which is Gmaj7. So if the Gmaj7 is the tonic chord, then yes.

But if the tonic is E minor, then the F#dim is ii° chord, which would typically resolve to iii chord (G major). And in the progression, we do have G/F# which would be G major. So if after the F#dim chord, it goes to G, that would be resolved.

For example: vii° (F#dim) in E minor typically leads to iii (G). In the progression, F#dim followed by G/F# (which is G major), so that fits.

Similarly, in the G major key, vii° should resolve to I (G), which is happening as F#dim → Gmaj7.

So both possibilities could be correct, but which one has stronger evidence.

Another clue: the use of Cmaj7. In G major, Cmaj7 is the IV chord. In E minor, it's the vi chord. So if the progression moves to Cmaj7, that might indicate where the tonic is. If the progression has Am/E followed by G/F#, then Cmaj7/E. If Am → G → C, that could be ii → I → IV in G major. Or in E minor: iv → III → vi.

But typically, in minor keys, the progression might use a mixolydian or other mode. But it's not clear.

Alternatively, let's consider the presence of both E and F# in bass. The bass line moving between E and F# might suggest E minor as the key, but it's not definite.

Wait, another angle: the chord Cmaj7 with E in bass. So bass E, then the chord is C, E, G, B. So E is in the bass, which is the tonic of E minor. So if the melody over this chord is resolving to E, it might be E minor.

Alternatively, in G major, the chord Cmaj7 with E bass would be the IV chord in first inversion. But tonic is G.

But if the overall progression doesn't have a clear resolution to G or E, it's hard to say.

But let's see the chord functions. In E minor, the F#dim is a leading tone chord, which doesn't function as a dominant, but the ii° chord. The D major chord could be VII chord. In E minor, VII chord is D major chord. Sometimes used to lead to tonic.

In G major, F#dim is the vii° chord, which is a diminished chord that leads to I chord.

Given that there's a Gmaj7 chord in the progression (as G/F#), that strongly points to G major as the key, because Gmaj7 is the tonic chord. Even though it's inverted.

In contrast, in E minor, G maj7 would be the III chord, which is not the tonic.

Therefore, if there's a chord that is a major seventh chord of G, and the tonic is likely G, that would make the key G major.

But let's also check if there are any other clues. What about the presence of E in bass? In G major, E is the vi chord (Em), but here the Em chord isn't used. Instead, Am/E and Cmaj7/E have E bass.

If the key is G major, then:

- Am/E: Am is ii, E bass would be second inversion.

- Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 is IV chord, E bass is first inversion.

- G/F#: I chord third inversion.

So the bass movement might be F#-F#-F#-F# (from F#dim chords), then for D/F# also F# bass. Then Am/E (E in bass), which would go to G/F# (F# bass), so bass moving from E to F#.

If the tonic is G, then moving from vi (E in bass for Am chord), but Am in G major is ii chord. Not the vi chord.

Hmm.

But another way: the key of G major has no key signature accidentals. Wait, G major has one sharp: F#. So yes. The chords all have F# when needed.

If the key were E minor (relative minor), same notes, same key signature.

So both keys have the same notes. So the difference is in the tonal center.

So whether it's G major or E minor depends on which note feels like home.

The chords themselves: when you have the F#dim and D/F# chords, in a major key context, the F#dim is resolving to G. In the given progression, after several F#dim chords, there's a D/F#, then Am/E followed by G/F#. So if the progression is F#dim → D → Am → G, that's quite a nice resolution in G major: vii° → V → ii → I.

Yes, that progression would make sense in G major. F#dim (vii°) → D (V) → Am (ii) → G (I). That's a possible resolution.

Similarly, in bar sequence:

Looking at the first part: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# then F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F#. So the last part before repetition is F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F#. So after F#dim (vii°), Am/E (ii), then G/F# (I). So a ii → I in G major. But before that, vii° → V. So yes, the typical function is vii° → V → ii → I. So that's a common progression in G major.

In E minor, how would that work? F#dim is ii°, D is VII, Am is IV, G is III. So ii° → VII → IV → III. Not as strong a progression for tonic. Unless using the III chord as cadence, but III is often not the tonic.

Therefore, G major seems more likely. Because the V chord (D) resolving to I (G) is a strong dominant-tonic movement. Even though it's passing through ii and V then to I. But V chord is D major, which is dominant in G major.

So D major in G major is the V chord. So if you have D/F# (V chord), then maybe a resolution from V → I. But in the progression, after D/F# comes F#dim etc. Wait:

Looking at the order again:

After two bars of F#dim and D/F# each, then another two F#dim, then Am/E and G/F#. So F#dim → D/F# (V) → F#dim → F#dim → Am/E (ii) → G/F# (I).

The F#dim → D/F# could be vii° → V. Then V leading to something else. But in this case, V is followed by F#dim again, which is a bit odd. But perhaps it's a deceptive cadence? Not sure.

Alternatively, the movement from D/F# (V) to Am/E (ii) is a bit less common. Usually V would go to I or vi. But not sure. In G major, vi is Em. Here we have Am/E. So maybe not.

But since the G/F# chord is present, which is the I chord (Gmaj7), that seems to be the tonic chord.

Given all this, I think the key is G major. The mode would be major, but the question says "determine key and mode". So G major, but mode is Ionian. Unless it's a mode.

But wait, E minor is Aeolian mode. But if the tonal center is G, then Ionian.

The chord progression seems to cycle through chords that belong to G major. The presence of Gmaj7 chord (even inverted) reinforces G as the tonic. The key signature would be one sharp (F#). So key of G major, mode Ionian. Or if the tonal center is E minor, then Aeolian.

But which is it? Let's think about the resolution. If the progression ends frequently on F#dim, but F#dim is the vii° chord, which doesn't resolve. But in the last chord, it's F#dim. Hmm.

Another clue: the use of F#dim repeatedly. In G major, F#dim is the vii° chord. In a major key, the vii° chord is often used as a passing chord to V. Like leading tone chord. So if it's used repeatedly, it could be setting up tension to resolve to I or V.

In this progression, it alternates with D/F#, which is V. So F#dim (vii°) leading to D (V), then repeating.

If the key were E minor, then F#dim is ii°, and D chord is VII. II° to VII can be a common progression in minor keys. But VII chord in minor is major sometimes.

Hmm. So both interpretations are possible. But in which key does the progression make the most harmonic sense?

Another way: look for cadence. The progression ends with F#dim. Not a cadence. But if in G major, the final chord before the repeat is F#dim. That's not a cadence. In E minor, same issue.

But perhaps the tonic is E minor because the bass often has E and the Cmaj7/E uses E in bass for Cmaj7, which might imply E is the home.

Alternatively, think of the chord Cmaj7/E. If it's in C major, but that doesn't fit. Or in E minor, it's the vi chord.

I think the strongest evidence for G major: the presence of a Gmaj7 chord (G/F#), which in G major is the I chord. In E minor, it's a III chord, which is not the tonic. If the progression is centered on G major, then the presence of the I chord (even inverted) suggests it. Whereas in E minor, there is no I chord (Em) in the progression. The Am/E and Cmaj7/E have E in bass but aren't Em chord. So it would be more likely that it's a G major progression where G is tonic, since the I chord (Gmaj7) is present, however inverted. Whereas in E minor, the Em chord is completely absent.

Yes, that makes sense. Typically, the tonic chord (Em for E minor) would appear to reinforce it. But here, no Em at all. Instead, the Gmaj7 is present. So the tonic chord is G major. So key is G major, mode Ionian.

Alternatively, maybe it's in the G major scale but with an emphasis on E minor. But usually, key refers to the key center.

So I think G major is the key.

But wait, let's see: the key signature for G major has F#. All the chord notes fit with F# sharps. The chords F#dim, D (F# in it), Cmaj7 (has F#? No, Cmaj7 in G major has no F# in the chord, since G major's F# is the 7th note. Wait, Cmaj7 chord: C, E, G, B. No F#. So no problem.

Yes. All the chords fit with the G major scale. So key of G major.

But wait, the question is to determine key and mode. So G major, Ionian mode. But sometimes people say just the key is G, but technically mode would be Ionian for major.

But maybe the analysis of the chord progression. Alternatively, could it be in E minor, Aeolian?

But in that case, there's no Em chord. Whereas in G major, there's Gmaj7. So G major seems more likely.

Another way: the chord Gmaj7 is a major seventh chord in the key of G; whereas in E minor, it's a III major seventh, but III usually is not a common tonic.

So given that, the key is G major, and mode is Ionian.

But wait, let's check again. If all chords are in G major:

- F#dim is vii°

- D/F# is V chord (D major)

- Am/E is ii chord

- Cmaj7/E is IV chord

- G/F# is I chord

Yes. So all chords fit perfectly. And the Gmaj7 chord (I chord) is part of the progression. Even though it's in inversion, it's still the tonic chord.

Whereas in E minor, there is no Em (i chord) present. Only chords like Am (iv), Cmaj7 (vi), D major (VII), etc. So without a clear tonic chord (Em), it's harder to say it's E minor.

Therefore, I think the key is G major, mode Ionian.

But wait, another angle: the use of Cmaj7. In G major, C is the IV chord. Cmaj7 is common. But typically, in jazz or pop, they may use major 7 chords on the IV. In classical, IV is usually just major triad. But the presence of the major 7 doesn't change the key.

Similarly, the Gmaj7 chord being the I chord.

So yes, I think the key is G major.

But the user might have a different perspective.

Wait, but in the progression, the G chord is in inversion (G/F#), which has the 7th (F#) in the bass. So the bass line is F# then G, etc. But in general, the tonic chord in G major being used as Gmaj7.

Yes. So the key is G major.

The chord progression provided contains chords that all fit within the **G major scale** (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#), confirming the **key is G Major (Ionian mode)**. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Key: G Major**  
- **Scale**: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#  
- **Key Signature**: 1 sharp (F#)  
- **Mode**: Ionian (standard major mode)  

---

### **Chord Analysis in G Major**  
Each chord in the progression maps to its diatonic function in G Major:  

| Chord        | Chord Type       | Function in G Major | Notes in Chord             |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **F#dim**    | Diminished (vii°) | Leading-tone triad  | F#, A, C                   |
| **D/F#**     | D Major (V)      | Dominant chord      | F#, A, D (D major in 1st inversion) |
| **Am/E**     | A minor (ii)     | Supertonic chord    | E, A, C (A minor in 1st inversion) |
| **G/F#**     | Gmaj7 (I)        | Tonic chord         | F#, G, B, D (Gmaj7 in 3rd inversion) |
| **Cmaj7/E**  | Cmaj7 (IV)       | Subdominant chord   | E, C, G, B (Cmaj7 in 1st inversion) |

---

### **Key Supporting Evidence**  
1. **Tonal Center**:  
   - The **Gmaj7 (G/F#)** chord acts as the **tonic (I)**. Even though it's inverted (F# in bass), it establishes G as the home note.  
   - No Em chord (the tonic for E minor) appears in the progression, ruling out E minor as the tonal center.  

2. **Chord Functions**:  
   - **F#dim (vii°)** resolves naturally to **D (V)**, a classic dominant-tonic motion in major keys.  
   - **D (V)** → **Am (ii)** → **Gmaj7 (I)** creates a logical cadence sequence typical of G major (e.g., V → ii → I).  
   - **Cmaj7 (IV)** fits as the subdominant chord, resolving appropriately to Gmaj7.  

3. **Key Signature Consistency**:  
   - All chord tones align with G major’s scale (only F# is sharpened, no other accidentals).  
   - No notes like G#, Bb, or D# appear, eliminating harmonic minor or other modes.  

---

### **Why Not E Minor (Aeolian)?**  
- While E minor shares the same notes as G major (relative minor), there is **no Em (i) chord** in the progression. The tonic must be clearly supported by the i chord (Em), which is absent.  
- The presence of **Gmaj7 (I)** solidifies G as the tonic, not E.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The progression is unequivocally in **G Major (Ionian mode)**. The chords function cohesively within the G major scale, with Gmaj7 acting as the tonic, D as dominant, and Cmaj7 as subdominant. The repeated use of F#dim (vii°) creates tension that resolves back to G major, reinforcing the key.  

> **Answer**: The key is **G Major**, and the mode is **Ionian**.
