### Analysis of Chord Progression
The given progression is:  
**F#dim - F#dim - D/F# - D/F# - F#dim - F#dim - Am/E - G/F# - F#dim - F#dim - D/F# - D/F# - F#dim - F#dim - Cmaj7/E - F#dim**

This is a repetitive, cyclical sequence with a clear functional harmony, emphasizing tension and release. I'll break down the key determination step by step, focusing on roots, functions, and overall tonality.

#### Step 1: Root Notes and Chord Types (Ignoring Inversions for Now)
- Roots: F# (dim), F# (dim), D (maj), D (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), A (min), G (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), D (maj), D (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), C (maj7), F# (dim).
- Chord qualities:
  - Diminished: F#dim (F#-A-C).
  - Major: D (D-F#-A), G (G-B-D), Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B).
  - Minor: Am (A-C-E).
- All these chords are **fully diatonic** (no accidentals outside the parent scale) to the G major scale:  
  **G - A - B - C - D - E - F#**.  
  - F#dim = vii° (leading-tone diminished).  
  - D = V (dominant).  
  - Am = ii (supertonic minor).  
  - G = I (tonic).  
  - Cmaj7 = IVmaj7 (subdominant with added 7th).  

No chords require borrowed notes, modulations, or chromaticism, pointing to a single key center.

#### Step 2: Functional Harmony and Progression Structure
- The progression is built around **tension-resolution patterns** typical of major keys:  
  - **F#dim - D/F#** pairs: vii° - V (or V6 in inversion). This is a common pre-dominant motion that strongly pulls toward the tonic (G). The repetition heightens expectation.  
  - **Am/E - G/F#**: ii (in 6/4 inversion) - I (with non-standard slash). This acts as a ii-V/ii or subdominant approach to the tonic, resolving the earlier tension.  
  - Final **Cmaj7/E - F#dim**: IVmaj7 (in 3/5 inversion) - vii°. This builds subdominant color before looping back to vii° (implying resolution to I, even if not explicitly stated).  
- Overall flow: It's a loop of **vii° - V - ii - I - (IV - vii°)**, with the F#dim acting as a recurring "pivot" chord. This is classic for G major, where vii° (F#dim) creates leading-tone pull (F# → G) to resolve everything.  
- No strong minor-key indicators (e.g., no i chord like Gm, no ♭3 like B♭, no Phrygian cadences). The presence of major I (G) and IV (C) confirms major tonality.

#### Step 3: Inversions and Bass Line
- Bass notes: Primarily F# (pedal-like under F#dim, D/F#, G/F#), with E inserts (under Am/E and Cmaj7/E).  
  - This creates a descending bass motif (F# → E), common in major keys for smooth voice leading.  
  - D/F# = V6 (first inversion, F# in bass).  
  - Am/E = ii⁶₄ (second inversion, E = 5th of Am in bass).  
  - G/F# = I with F# bass (unconventional for strict triads, as F# isn't in G-B-D; it may imply a G7/F# context—G-B-D-F with F# bass variant—or a pedal bass line. In practice, this functions as a tonic arrival with added tension).  
  - Cmaj7/E = IV with E bass (3rd or 5th in bass, depending on voicing).  
- The bass reinforces G major by staying within the scale (F# and E are notes 7 and 6), without introducing foreign tones.

#### Step 4: Key and Mode Determination
- **Key: G major**.  
  - G is the clear tonic: The progression orbits around it (G chord appears explicitly, and everything resolves toward it). F#dim (vii°) and D (V) are dominant forces pulling to G, while Am (ii) and C (IV) provide subdominant support. This matches standard pop/jazz/ballad progressions in G major (e.g., similar to elements in songs like "I Got Rhythm" variations or "The Way You Look Tonight").  
- **Mode: Major (Ionian)**.  
  - All chords align with the major scale—no minor v, no ♭VII, or other modal shifts. The bright, resolved quality (major I and IVmaj7) confirms Ionian mode over something like Mixolydian (which might flatten the 7th more prominently).

#### Potential Context or Song Match
This progression has a nostalgic, standards-like feel (repetitive diminished chords + inversions suggest a mid-20th-century jazz or pop influence). It resembles parts of "As Time Goes By" (from Casablanca) or similar torch songs in G major, but could be original. If this is from a specific piece, more melody/context would refine it.

If you provide the melody, time signature, or song title, I can refine this further!
