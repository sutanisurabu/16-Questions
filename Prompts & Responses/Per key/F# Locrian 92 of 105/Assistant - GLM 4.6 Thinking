**Assistant - GLM 4.6 Thinking**

### Reasoning


1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user has provided a sequence of chords and wants to know the key and mode. The chords are: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#min Cmaj7/E F#dim.

2.  **Initial Impression & Simplification:**
    *   The first thing that jumps out is the repetition and the prominent use of F#dim. This is a very strong clue. A diminished chord that's used this persistently is often the leading tone chord (viio) to the tonic.
    *   If F#dim is the leading tone chord (viio), then the tonic would be G major. Let's test this hypothesis.
    *   Let's simplify the chord progression by removing the repetitions:
        *   F#dim
        *   D/F#
        *   Am/E
        *   G/F#
        *   Cmaj7/E
        *   F#dim (again)

3.  **Hypothesis 1: Key of G Major**
    *   **Tonic:** G
    *   **Key Signature:** F#, C#
    *   **Diatonic Chords:**
        *   I: Gmaj7
        *   ii: Amin7
        *   iii: Bmin7
        *   IV: Cmaj7
        *   V: D7
        *   vi: Emin7
        *   viio: F#dim7 (or F#m7b5)
    *   **Analyze the chords against G Major:**
        *   **F#dim:** This is the viio chord. It fits perfectly. It strongly wants to resolve to G. The fact that it's everywhere reinforces this. The G/F# chord later on is just a G major triad with an F# in the bass, which is essentially a V6/4 (or I6/4) depending on context, but the F# bass keeps that leading tone tension going.
        *   **D/F#:** This is a V chord (D major) with its third in the bass. This is a very common chord in G major. This is a strong point *for* G major.
        *   **Am/E:** An A minor chord with an E in the bass. Am is the ii chord in G major. The E in the bass is the 5th of the Am chord. This is a standard ii chord voicing. This fits.
        *   **G/F#:** This is a G major chord with an F# in the bass. G is the I chord. This is a I chord with a leading tone in the bass, creating a strong pull back to the root. It's essentially a Gmaj7(no 5th) or a G(6) with a weird bass, but functionally it's the tonic.
        *   **Cmaj7/E:** This is a Cmaj7 chord with an E in the bass. Cmaj7 is the IV chord in G major. The E in the bass is the third of the chord. This fits perfectly.
        *   **Final F#dim:** Back to the leading tone.

4.  **Conclusion for G Major:** All the chords *except one* fit diatonically into the key of G major. The progression is heavily centered around the pull between F#dim (the leading tone) and G (the tonic). The other chords (D, Am, C) are the primary diatonic chords (V, ii, IV) used to create movement in a major key. This looks very strong.

5.  **Investigate the "Odd Man Out":** What about the `F#min` in `F#min Cmaj7/E`?
    *   The user wrote `F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#min Cmaj7/E F#dim`.
    *   Wait, I misread that last bit. It's `F#dim ... F#min Cmaj7/E F#dim`. Okay, let's re-evaluate. There's an F#min chord.
    *   **F#min:** This chord is *not* in the key of G major. In G major, the F# chord is diminished (F# A C). F#min would be F# A C#.
    *   So, where does F#min come from?
        *   It could be a secondary dominant or a borrowed chord.
        *   Is F#min a secondary dominant? F#min is the ii chord in E major. E is the vi chord in G major. So, F#min could be a `ii/vi`. This is plausible. A `ii/vi` -> `vi` progression is common. But the next chord is Cmaj7/E, not Em. So a `ii/vi` function doesn't make immediate sense here.
        *   Is F#min a borrowed chord? It could be borrowed from G minor (the parallel minor). In G minor, the chords are: Gm, Aø, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F#dim. No F#min there.
        *   Let's reconsider the context: `...F#dim F#min Cmaj7/E F#dim`. The F#min is sandwiched between two F#dim chords. This is interesting. It could be a chromatic passing chord. The C# in the F#min chord could be a chromatic tone that resolves down to the C in the following Cmaj7 chord. Let's see:
            *   F#dim: F# - A - C
            *   F#min: F# - A - C# (the C# is the chromatic tone)
            *   Cmaj7/E: E - G - B - C (the C# resolves down a semitone to C)
            *   This is a very common and beautiful-sounding chromatic voice-leading technique. The C# acts as a leading tone to the C (or the D in the D/F# if that came next).

6.  **Re-evaluating the Mode Question:**
    *   The user asked for the *key and mode*.
    *   The analysis points overwhelmingly to G **Major** as the tonal center. The chords function as ii, IV, V, I, and viio in G major. The F#min is a chromatic embellishment.
    *   Could it be a mode?
        *   **G Dorian?** G A Bb C D E F#. The F# would be a natural 7, and the F#dim would be a vii chord. But D would be minor (Dm), not major (D/F#). So, no.
        *   **G Mixolydian?** G A B C D E F. The F# would be a major 7, which is not diatonic to Mixolydian. The F#dim chord would be a #vii°, which is a common secondary dominant leading to the tonic, but the rest of the progression feels too "major-y" (D major, Cmaj7).
        *   **G Lydian?** G A B C# D E F#. The F#dim works, but C would be C# major, not Cmaj7. And D would be D major, which fits. But the Cmaj7 is a huge problem for Lydian.
        *   **G Aeolian?** G A Bb C D Eb F. No. F# is not diatonic. D would be minor.
        *   **G Phrygian?** G Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb. Definitely not.
        *   **G Locrian?** G Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb. Definitely not.

7.  **Final Conclusion Formation:**
    *   The key is **G Major**.
    *   The "mode" is simply **Major** (or Ionian). It's not a modal progression in the traditional sense; it's a functional diatonic progression in a major key with a chromatic passing chord.
    *   The tonal center is clearly G. The F#dim chord acts as the dominant function (specifically, the leading tone chord, viio7), constantly creating tension that resolves to G (or a G-based chord like G/F#).
    *   The other chords (D/F#, Am/E, Cmaj7/E) are the V, ii, and IV chords of G major respectively, which are the building blocks of tonal harmony.
    *   The F#min chord is a chromatic mediant or, more likely in this context, a chromatic passing chord. The C# in the F#min chord chromatically descends to C in the Cmaj7 chord, creating a smooth melodic line.

8.  **Structure the Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **Key: G Major (Ionian Mode)**.
    *   Provide a detailed breakdown of why.
    *   Explain the role of each chord relative to G major.
        *   **F#dim:** The leading tone chord (vii°7), constantly pulling to the tonic, G.
        *   **D/F#:** The dominant chord (V).
        *   **Cmaj7/E:** The subdominant chord (IV).
        *   **Am/E:** The supertonic chord (ii).
        *   **G/F#:** The tonic chord (I) with the leading tone in the bass.
    *   Address the "odd" chord: the F#min. Explain it as a chromatic passing chord, detailing the voice-leading of the C# moving down to C. This shows a deeper understanding.
    *   Summarize why it's not another key or mode. Briefly explain why the diatonic chords of other modes don't fit (e.g., D would be minor in G Dorian, C would be C# in G Lydian).
    *   Conclude by reinforcing the initial answer. The progression is a functional, diatonic progression in G Major, with strong emphasis on the dominant-tonic pull (F#dim -> G) and a single, elegant chromatic embellishment.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **G Major**.

The mode is the standard **Major (or Ionian)** mode. While the progression uses some interesting chromaticism, its foundation is firmly in the key of G Major.

### Detailed Analysis:

Let's break down the chords and their function within the key of G Major (G-A-B-C-D-E-F#).

1.  **The Tonal Center: F#dim**
    The most frequently occurring chord is **F#dim**. In the key of G Major, the F# diminished chord is the **leading tone chord (vii°)**. Its entire purpose is to create tension that strongly wants to resolve to the tonic chord, G major. The constant repetition of F#dim establishes G as the "home" key you're waiting to hear.

2.  **Diatonic Chords that Fit G Major:**
    *   **D/F#:** This is a **D major** chord with an F# in the bass. D major is the **dominant chord (V)** in the key of G major. This is the second-strongest piece of evidence.
    *   **Cmaj7/E:** This is a **C major 7** chord with an E in the bass. C major is the **subdominant chord (IV)** in G major. This fits perfectly.
    *   **Am/E:** This is an **A minor** chord with an E in the bass. A minor is the **supertonic chord (ii)** in G major. This also fits perfectly.
    *   **G/F#:** This is a **G major** chord with an F# in the bass. This is the **tonic chord (I)**, but it uses the leading tone (F#) as the bass note, which maintains that tension even while playing the "home" chord.

3.  **The Chromatic Chord: F#min**
    The progression includes one chord that is not diatonic to G major: **F#min**.
    *   The chords just before and after it are F#dim and Cmaj7.
    *   F#dim: **F# - A - C**
    *   **F#min: F# - A - C#**
    *   Cmaj7: **C - E - G - B**

    The F#min chord is likely being used as a **chromatic passing chord**. Notice the beautiful voice-leading: the C# from the F#min chord resolves down by a semitone to the C in the Cmaj7 chord. This is a common and sophisticated technique to add color and smooth melodic motion between chords.

### Summary of Chord Functions in G Major:

*   **F#dim:** vii° (leading tone, creates tension)
*   **D/F#:** V (dominant, creates tension)
*   **Am/E:** ii (pre-dominant)
*   **Cmaj7/E:** IV (subdominant)
*   **G/F#:** I (tonic, resolution)
*   **F#min:** Chromatic passing chord

### Why it's not another mode:

*   **G Dorian:** The D chord would be D minor (Dm), not D major.
*   **G Lydian:** The C chord would be C# major (C#maj7), not Cmaj7.
*   **G Mixolydian:** The F# would be F natural (F), not F#.

The presence of a major D chord, a major C chord, and an F# leading tone all point conclusively to **G Major**.
