### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Hmm, this looks interesting. First, I need to recall what diminished chords typically do in music theory. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or as leading chords because of their instability.

Let me write down the chords again to visualize: F#dim appears a lot, followed by D/F#, then Am/E, G/F#, and Cmaj7/E. The repeated F#dim suggests it's pivoting around that chord. Diminished chords usually lead to chords a half step away. For example, F#dim might lead to G major or G minor since F# to G is a half step.

Wait, but here we have D/F#, which is D major in first inversion (with F# in the bass). D major has F# as its third, so D/F# makes sense. Then Am/E—A minor with E in the bass. That's A minor, so the chord is Am. G/F# is G major with F# in the bass, so the bass note is F#, which is the seventh of G7. But here it's written as G/F#, so it's probably a G major chord with F# in the bass, making it a first inversion? Wait, no—G major's root is G, so G/F# would be G major with F# as the bass note, which is the major seventh, but in standard notation, G/F# usually means G major chord over F# bass. Actually, F# is not part of G major (G-B-D), so G/F# might imply a G7 chord? Because G7 has F#. Oh, that's a key point. G7 is G-B-D-F#, so G/F# could be shorthand for G7 in third inversion, where F# is the bass note. That makes sense because F# is the seventh of G7. Similarly, D/F#—D major is D-F#-A, so D/F# is first inversion, which is common.

Looking at the progression: starting with F#dim, then D/F# (which is D major over F#). F#dim to D major—F#dim has notes F#-A-C-Eb (assuming fully diminished, so it's F#-A-C-Eb, but sometimes it's half-diminished, like F#m7b5, which would be F#-A-C-E). The progression uses F#dim repeatedly, so I need to clarify if it's fully dim or half-dim. In common practice, F#dim often refers to the fully diminished seventh chord, which is F#-A-C-Eb. But in modern contexts, especially in pop or rock, it might be the half-diminished (F#m7b5). However, given the context here, since it's resolving to D/F#, which has F# as the bass, it might be functioning as a passing chord.

Let me list the chords with possible resolutions:

- F#dim → D/F#: F#dim to D major. If F#dim is F#-A-C-Eb, then Eb could resolve down to D (in D major). But D major has D-F#-A, so A is common, C might resolve to B or D, but it's messy. Alternatively, F#dim might be acting as a secondary dominant or leading to G.

Wait, another approach: look for the tonic. The progression ends with Cmaj7/E, which is C major with E in the bass. Cmaj7 is C-E-G-B, so Cmaj7/E is first inversion. But then it ends with F#dim, which is unresolved. That's odd because progressions usually resolve to the tonic. Here it ends on F#dim, which is unstable, so it might be a loop. But the user might be presenting a repeating progression.

Also, notice the inversions: D/F#, Am/E, G/F#, Cmaj7/E. The bass notes: F# for D/F#, E for Am/E, F# for G/F#, E for Cmaj7/E. So bass alternates between F# and E. Interesting pattern—it's like a pedal point on E and F#, but alternating.

Bass notes: F# (F#dim), F# (F#dim), F# (D/F#), F# (D/F#), F# (F#dim), F# (F#dim), E (Am/E), F# (G/F#), F# (F#dim), F# (F#dim), F# (D/F#), F# (D/F#), F# (F#dim), F# (F#dim), E (Cmaj7/E), F#dim. Wait, no—the progression is: F#dim (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), D/F# (bass F#), D/F# (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), Am/E (bass E), G/F# (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), D/F# (bass F#), D/F# (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), Cmaj7/E (bass E), F#dim (bass F#). So bass alternates between F# and E in sections. Specifically, blocks of four F#-bass chords: F#dim twice, D/F# twice, then F#dim twice, then Am/E (E bass), G/F# (F# bass), then F#dim twice, D/F# twice, F#dim twice, Cmaj7/E (E bass), then F#dim.

This alternating bass on E and F# suggests that E and F# are important notes. F# is the leading tone to G, and E is the mediant in G major. But let's think about keys where F# is prominent.

Common keys: G major has F# as the leading tone. D major also has F#. F# minor has F# as tonic. But let's check chords.

First, assume the key is G major. Chords in G major: G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim. Oh! F#dim is the vii° chord in G major. That's a classic diminished chord—vii°7 in major keys is often used as a passing chord or leading to I.

In G major, F#dim is B-D-F#? Wait, no: vii° in G major is F#-A-C. But a fully diminished seventh would add Eb (for F#dim7), but in diatonic harmony, it's usually the half-diminished or just triad. However, in many contexts, especially jazz, dim chords are often fully diminished.

But in G major, the diatonic vii° chord is F#-A-C (diminished triad), and if extended to seventh, it would be F#-A-C-E (half-diminished, since E is the natural 7th from F# in G major scale). But F#dim7 would be F#-A-C-Eb, which is chromatic.

Now, looking at the progression: D/F#—in G major, D major is the V chord (since G: I=G, ii=Am, iii=Bm, IV=C, V=D, vi=Em, vii°=F#dim). So D is V, and D/F# is V6 (first inversion of V).

Am/E: A minor is ii chord in G major, and Am/E is ii6 (first inversion).

G/F#: G major is I, but here it's G/F#, which would be I6 if it were G major chord, but G major with F# bass—F# is not in the G major triad (G-B-D), so this can't be I6. Unless it's a different chord. If G/F# implies G7, then G7 is V7 in C major, but we're considering G major now. Wait, in G major, G7 is not diatonic; it would be a secondary dominant.

But in the progression, we have G/F#, which is listed as a chord. If it's G7 in third inversion (F# in bass), then G7 would be V7 of C, but if we're in G major, G7 is the tonic chord with a dominant seventh, which is common in blues or other styles but not pure diatonic.

Cmaj7/E: in G major, C major is IV, so Cmaj7 is IVmaj7, which is common.

And F#dim is vii°.

So let's map the chords to G major:

- F#dim = vii°
- D/F# = V6 (since D is V)
- Am/E = ii6
- G/F# = this is problematic. If it's G major chord with F# bass, but G doesn't have F#, so it's not a standard inversion. But if it's G7 (G-B-D-F#), then G7 is V7 of C, which is not in G major. However, in G major, G7 could function as a dominant to C, but C is IV in G, so it's a secondary dominant leading to IV. But that's possible.

Wait, the chord is written as G/F#, which in chord notation usually means a G chord with F# in the bass, so the chord is G major triad (G-B-D), bass F#. So it's not G7, because G7 would include F#. But the notation G/F# specifically indicates the bass note, so the chord quality is G major, over F# bass. That creates an F#-G-B-D voicing, which implies F#m7b5 or something else, but actually, it's a G major chord in first inversion? No—first inversion of G major would be B in bass (G/B), second inversion D (G/D), so G/F# is not a standard inversion; it's a non-chord tone in the bass.

This suggests that G/F# is actually functioning as a dominant chord. Specifically, G7/F# is G7 in third inversion, which is common as a leading chord to Am or other chords. But in the progression, it's followed by F#dim, which is unusual.

Let's step back. The repeated F#dim and the chords around it. F#dim appears between D/F# and Am/E sections.

Perhaps the key is E minor. E natural minor has G major, but F#dim—E natural minor: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D. So F# is the supertonic, which would be F#m, not dim. But in harmonic minor, E harmonic minor has D#, so chords are i=E, ii°=F#dim, III+=Gaug, iv=Am, V=B, VI=C, vii°=D#dim. In E harmonic minor, F#dim is ii°, which is a diminished triad (F#-A-C). Fully diminished seventh would be F#-A-C-Eb, but in harmonic minor, the seventh degree is D#, so F#dim7 would have Eb, which is enharmonic to D#, but not diatonic.

In E harmonic minor, F#dim is ii°, and it typically goes to G#dim or something, but let's see. D/F#—D major is not diatonic to E minor; diatonic would be Dm. Am is iv in E minor. G/F#—G major is III in E minor, but with F# bass, it's odd. Cmaj7 is VI in E minor.

This is getting messy. Another thought: the bass alternates E and F#, which are a half step apart. This is reminiscent of a circle of fifths movement or chromatic mediants, but let's list the root chords ignoring inversions.

Roots: F# (dim), F# (dim), D (maj), D (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), A (min), G (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), D (maj), D (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), C (maj7), F# (dim).

So the root progression is: F#-F#-D-D-F#-F#-A-G-F#-F#-D-D-F#-F#-C-F#.

Notice that D to A is a fifth down (or fourth up), A to G is a whole step down, G to C is a fourth up. But the F# chords are pervasive.

Another angle: F#dim is often used as a substitute for D7, since F#dim is the upper structure of D7b9. D7 is D-F#-A-C, and D7b9 is D-F#-A-C-Eb, so the top three notes F#-A-C-Eb form F#dim7. So F#dim7 can function as a dominant chord leading to G. For example, F#dim7 → G.

In this progression, when F#dim is followed by D/F#, that might not fit, but D/F# is D major, which has F# in the bass. If F#dim is acting as a dominant to G, but here it's going to D, which is the V of G. So in G major: F#dim (vii°) → D (V), which is a common progression (vii° to V is less common than vii° to I, but possible).

Then D/F# to F#dim: that's V to vii°, which is unusual; usually vii° leads to I or V.

But let's see the sequence: F#dim -> D/F# (twice), then F#dim -> Am/E. If in G major, Am is ii, so F#dim (vii°) to Am (ii) is a common resolution (vii° to ii is rare; usually vii° goes to I).

Standard resolution for vii° is to I. For example, in G: F#dim -> G.

Here, we have F#dim followed by Am/E, which is ii. So F#dim -> ii. That's not standard.

Unless the key is A major or something else.

Try key of A major: chords are A, Bm, C#m, D, E, F#m, G#dim.

G#dim is the vii°, but here the dim chord is F#dim, which is not in A major.

Key of D major: chords D, Em, F#m, G, A, Bm, C#dim. So C#dim is vii°, not F#dim.

F#dim would be the III chord? In D major, F#m is iii, not dim.

Key of E major: E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim. So D#dim is vii°, F#m is ii.

Not matching.

Now, minor keys. D minor: D, Edim, F, G, A, Bdim, C. So Edim is ii°.

C minor: C, Ddim, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bbbim (usually Bbmaj) — diatonic diminished are ii° and vii°.

Let's try F# minor. F# natural minor: F#-G#-A-B-C#-D-E. So chords: i=F#m, ii°=G#dim, III=Am, iv=Bm, v=C#m, VI=D, VII=E.

But the progression has F#dim, which is not i; i is F#m.

F# harmonic minor: F#-G#-A-B-C#-D-E#. So chords: i=F#m, ii°=G#dim, III+=Aaug, iv=Bm, V=C# (major), VI=D, vii°=E#dim (which is enharmonic to Fdim).

Not matching.

E harmonic minor: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D#. So chords: i=Em, ii°=F#dim, III+=Gaug, iv=Am, V=B, VI=C, vii°=D#dim.

Here, F#dim is ii°, which matches the chord given.

In E harmonic minor, ii° is F#dim (F#-A-C), and it typically resolves to V (B) or III+ (Gaug), but let's see the progression.

The chords:

- F#dim: ii° in E harmonic minor

- D/F#: D major—in E harmonic minor, D is VI, so D major is VI. D/F# is VI with F# in bass. F# is the 3rd of D, so it's first inversion.

- Am/E: A minor—in E minor, iv is Am, so Am/E is iv with E in bass (first inversion)

- G/F#: G major—in E minor, III is G major (in natural minor), but in harmonic minor, III is augmented (G+), but here it's G major, which is borrowing from natural minor or melodic minor. G major is not diatonic to harmonic minor; harmonic minor has G natural (since scale has G natural, not G#). E harmonic minor scale: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D#. So G is natural, so triad on G is G-B-D? B is in the scale, D is natural? E harmonic minor: notes E,F#,G,A,B,C,D#. So G note, B note (since B is fifth), D# note. So triad on G would be G-B-D#, which is G augmented. But here it's G major (G-B-D natural), which is not diatonic. So it's likely borrowing from natural minor, where E natural minor has G natural, so G major is III. In E natural minor: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D, so triads: i=Em, ii=F#m, III=GM, iv=Am, v=Bm, VI=C, VII=D. So G major is III.

- Cmaj7/E: C major—in E natural minor, VI is C, so C major is VI. Cmaj7 is VI with seventh.

So let's map in E natural minor:

- F#dim: in natural minor, ii is F#m, not dim. So F#dim doesn't diatonic to natural minor.

In E natural minor, the ii chord is F#m, which is minor.

But here the chord is F#dim, which is diminished, so it suggests harmonic minor.

In E harmonic minor, ii° is F#dim, which fits.

D chord: in E harmonic minor, VI is C#? Wait no: E harmonic minor scale: E F# G A B C D#. So:

- i: E-G#? Wait, E harmonic minor: tonic E, intervals minor, minor, major, minor, major, diminished augmented? Standard: E harmonic minor: E (i), F# (ii°), G (III+), A (iv), B (V), C (VI), D# (vii°).

Roots:

- E: E G B → Em

- F#: F# A C → F#dim

- G: G B D# → G augmented

- A: A C E → Am

- B: B D# F# → B major

- C: C E G → C major

- D#: D# F# A → D#dim

So D major is not in E harmonic minor; the VI chord is C major, not D.

D natural minor: D Eb F G A Bb C. But not relevant.

Another idea: the progression might be in Dorian mode. Dorian on E: E F# G A B C# D. So chords: i=Em, ii=F#m, III=GM, IV=Am, v=Bm, VI=C, VII=D.

But F#dim isn't diatonic; ii is F#m.

The diminished chord suggests leading tone behavior, which in minor keys is when harmonic minor is used.

Perhaps the key is B minor. B harmonic minor: B C# D E F# G A#. Chords: i=Bm, ii°=C#dim, III+=Daug, iv=Em, V=F# (major), VI=G, vii°=A#dim.

F# major is V, but F#dim is not present.

Wait, what about G# minor? But F# is the major seventh, which is high.

Let's list the notes across all chords to find the key signature.

Chords:

- F#dim: typically F# A C Eb (if fully dim)

- D/F#: D F# A

- Am/E: A C E

- G/F#: G B D F#? Or G B D? If G/F#, and it's a major chord, then notes G,B,D with F# bass.

- Cmaj7/E: C E G B with E bass.

So collecting all notes: F#, A, C, Eb (from F#dim), D (from D), E (from Am/E and Cmaj7/E), G (from G and C), B (from D and G), and C from F#dim and Am.

Notes found: C, D, E, F#, G, A, B, and Eb.

Eb is a chromatic note. If Eb is present (from F#dim7), then it's a chromaticism.

In the key of D major, which has two sharps (F#, C#), we have Eb, which is outside. But if it's E minor, with one sharp (F#), Eb is also outside.

However, in harmonic minor, the vii° chord is diminished and includes the flat sixth scale degree. For example, in E harmonic minor, the scale has D#, but the ii° chord is F# A C, which has C natural (which is flat sixth relative to tonic? E scale: 1= E, 2=F#, 3=G, 4=A, 5=B, 6=C, 7=D#. So C is the minor sixth, which is natural in the scale.

In E harmonic minor, the notes are E, F#, G, A, B, C, D#. So C is diatonic (it's the sixth degree, which is natural in harmonic minor). So the note C is in the scale.

F#dim chord in E harmonic minor: F# (2), A (4), C (6). Yes, all diatonic. So F#dim (triad) is diatonic to E harmonic minor.

G chord: in E harmonic minor, the III chord is augmented (G-B-D#), but here it's G major (G-B-D). D natural is not in E harmonic minor; it has D#. So G major would require D natural, which is a borrowed note from natural minor.

Similarly, D major: in E harmonic minor, VI is C major, not D. D major would have notes D-F#-A. F# is in the scale (2nd degree), A is 4th, but D is not in E harmonic minor (which has D#). So D major is chromatic—it's the major V in E minor, but in harmonic minor, V is B major, not D.

Wait a minute—in E minor, the diatonic V chord is Bm (in natural minor) or B major (in harmonic minor). D major is not diatonic; it's the VI in C# minor or something.

Let's think differently. The chord D/F# has F# in bass, and it's D major. D major in the context of G major is V, as G major's V is D.

And F#dim is vii° in G major.

Am is ii in G major.

G is I in G major.

C is IV in G major.

So in G major:

- F#dim = vii° (diatonic diminished triad)

- D/F# = V6

- Am/E = ii6

- G/F# = this is the problem. If G/F# is meant to be G major with F# bass, but G major doesn't have F#, so it's an altered chord. But in the context, it might be a misinterpretation. Perhaps G/F# is indicating a G7 chord in third inversion, since G7 has F# as the seventh. In jazz notation, G/F# could imply G7/F#, which is common.

Similarly, Cmaj7/E is Cmaj7 in first inversion.

So let's assume that G/F# is G7/F#, meaning G dominant seventh chord with F# in the bass (which is the third inversion). This is common; for example, V7 in third inversion often leads to I or other chords.

In G major, G7 is not diatonic (diatonic V is D7), but G7 could be the tonic chord with a dominant seventh, which is used for color.

But let's see the progression in G major:

F#dim (vii°) → D/F# (V6): vii° to V is possible but not strongest. Usually vii° goes to I.

Then D/F# → F#dim: V to vii°, which is backtracking.

F#dim → Am/E (ii6): vii° to ii, which is unusual.

Am/E → G/F# (I7 if G7): ii to I, which is good, but G/F# here.

Then G/F# → F#dim: I to vii°, which is odd.

After that, it goes back to D/F#, etc.

Another idea: perhaps the key is A minor. A natural minor: A B C D E F G. Chords: i=Am, ii°=Bdim, III=C, iv=Dm, v=Em, VI=F, VII=G.

F#dim not present. A harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#. Chords: i=Am, ii°=Bdim, III+=Caug, iv=Dm, V=E (major), VI=F, vii°=G#dim.

Still no F#dim.

F# is not the root of diatonic chords here.

Let's look at the chord Cmaj7/E. Cmaj7 is C-E-G-B, so with E bass, it's first inversion. Cmaj7 typically functions as IV in G major or I in C, but here the progression has F#dim a lot, which points away from C major.

D/F#—D major over F# bass. D major is the I chord in D major, but D major's diatonic dim chord is C#dim, not F#dim.

Wait, in D major, F#m is iii, not dim.

Perhaps it's a modulation or borrowed chords.

Another approach: the F#dim is used as a passing chord between two chords a half step away. Diminished chords often serve to connect chords whose roots are a half step apart.

For example, F#dim can lead to G, as it's built on the leading tone of G.

In this progression, F#dim is followed by D/F#—not a half step (D is a minor third below F#). F# to D is a minor third down.

F#dim to Am: F# to A is minor third up.

Not helpful.

Perhaps the bass movement is more important. The bass alternates E and F#, which are very close.

E and F# are a whole step apart. In the bass, this suggests a pedal or ostinato on E and F#.

The root chords when bass is F#: F#dim, D major, G major (if G/F# is G chord)

Roots on E: Am, Cmaj7

So when bass is F#: roots F#, D, G

When bass is E: roots A, C

F# and E bass notes. So the harmony might be centered around chords that share these bass notes.

In key of D major: D's dominant is A, but here we have G.

Perhaps the key is G major, and the bass alternates between the fifth (D) and something—wait, F# is the third of D, etc.

Let's consider the following: the progression might be in G major, and the F#dim is vii°7, which is common in jazz and classical as a substitute for V7/vi or something, but let's see common functions.

F#dim7 chord: F# A C Eb

In key of G: F# is leading tone, so F#dim7 can be seen as vii°7.

vii°7 in G major is F#-A-C-Eb (if we consider harmonic major or just using Eb).

The notes of F#dim7 are all a minor third apart: F#-A-C-Eb.

This chord has dominant function and can resolve to G major (F#→G, A→G or B, C→B, Eb→D).

In the progression, F#dim does go to D/F# sometimes: D is D-F#-A.

So F# (root) → F# (bass of D/F#), A (third of F#dim) → A (fifth of D), C (fifth of F#dim) → ? D's notes are D-F#-A, so C might resolve down to B or up to C, but it's not in D. Eb might resolve to D (in D chord).

For example: F#dim (F#-A-C-Eb) → D (D-F#-A): Eb resolves to D, C might go to B (but B not in D), or C->C (suspended), but typically dominant resolution.

Standard: vii°7 to I: F#dim7 → G.

Here, it sometimes goes to D, which is V of G.

So vii°/V resolving to V: in G major, V is D, so vii° of V is C#dim, not F#dim.

F# is the leading tone of G, so vii° of I.

Not directly related to V.

But in some theories, vii° can lead to V as a variant.

Let's look at the sequence where it goes F#dim -> Am/E.

F#dim to Am: F#-A-C-Eb to A-C-E.

Common tones: A and C. Eb → E (half step up), F# → G or A? F# to A is major third.

Eb to E is a half step resolution, which is characteristic.

In fact, Eb is the seventh of G7, so F#dim7 contains notes that can resolve to Am: for example, as an applied vii° to Am.

Specifically, to go to Am, the leading tone would be G#dim7 for A minor, but F#dim7 is a half step lower.

F#dim7 to G would be direct, but to Am is a third away.

Another thought: in C major, F#dim would be the vii° of vii, but not helpful.

Wait, let's list all the root chords and see if there's a pattern:

The progression is: F#dim, F#dim, D, D, F#dim, F#dim, A, G, F#dim, F#dim, D, D, F#dim, F#dim, C, F#dim.

Grouping: (F#2 D2) (F#2 A G) (F#2 D2) (F#2 C) F#.

It's like a AABA song form but harmonic.

Notice that D, A, G, C are all major or minor chords in G major: D is V, A is not in key (Am would be ii), G is I, C is IV.

Am is ii in G major, which fits.

So chords in G major:

- D = V

- Am = ii

- G = I

- C = IV

F#dim = vii°

So the progression uses vii° to connect these diatonic chords.

For example: vii° (F#dim) can lead to I (G), but here it sometimes leads to V (D), or ii (Am).

In practice, diminished chords can be used flexibly.

Let's test a resolution:

- F#dim to D: as a passing chord. F#dim contains A and C, which are in D (D-F#-A), so it works.

- F#dim to Am: F#dim has A and C, which are in Am (A-C-E), so common tones.

- F#dim to G: F#dim has F# (leading tone to G), A (third of F, but for G it's the fourth), etc.

- F#dim to C: F#dim to C—F# to G (for C, it's the seventh? C is C-E-G, F# is tritone away).

In jazz, dim chords are often used as passing to major/minor chords a half step away, but here the resolutions are to chords a minor third or fourth away.

Another key insight: The chord F#dim is repeated frequently, and the progression has D/F# (which shares F#), so F# is a common tone in bass for most chords.

This suggests that the tonic might not be G, but somewhere else.

Consider the chord Cmaj7/E. Cmaj7 is a major seventh chord, often used as IV in G, or ii in Bb, but let's stay.

The cadence at the end: ... F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim.

Cmaj7 to F#dim. C to F# is a tritone, which is very strong. In fact, C7 would be the dominant of F, but here it's Cmaj7.

In the key of F# minor, C major is the V chord? F# minor: F# G# A B C# D E. So V is C# major, not C.

F natural minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb. Not relevant.

What if the key is D major? D major: D E F# G A B C#.

Chords: D, Em, F#m, G, A, Bm, C#dim.

C major would be a borrowed chord (from Dorian or something), Am is iv.

G is IV.

F#dim is not diatonic; it would be F#m.

Unless it's a chromatic chord.

Perhaps the key is A, and F#dim is a secondary leading tone.

Let's try functional analysis.

Assume the key is G major:

- F#dim = vii° (subtonic diminished)

- D = V

- Am = ii

- G = I

- C = IV

Progression could be vii° - V - vii° - ii - I - etc.

But the specific sequence: two F#dim, two D, two F#dim, then Am, G, two F#dim, two D, two F#dim, C, F#dim.

In G major, this makes some sense as a cycle: V (D) to I (G) but with lots of vii° decoration.

The cadence before the end: D, D, F#dim, F#dim, C, F#dim.

From D (V) to C (IV) is a backdoor cadence in jazz, often used to resolve to I. But here it goes to F#dim.

Backdoor progression is typically ii-V-I, but IV-VI-ii-V or similar.

In G major, C (IV) moving to D (V) is common, but here C is followed by F#dim.

C to F#dim: C to F# is tritone, which is the interval of a dominant resolution. Specifically, C7 would resolve to F, and F# is the flattened fifth of C7 (C7 has G-Bb-D-F, but if it's C7#5 or something). Wait, F# is the tritone from C (C to F# is six semitones).

The chord F#dim contains the tritone C-F# (enharmonic to F#-C), which is the same tritone as in C7 (Bb-F, but enharmonically F# is Gb, so C to Gb is the tritone).

So F#dim is the upper structure of C7b9: C7b9 is C-Eb-F#-Ab-Bbb(=A), so the notes Eb-F#-A-C form F#dim7 (F#dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb).

Yes! F#dim7 is equivalent to the dominant seventh flat nine chord of C (C7b9) without the root.

For example, C7b9 = C E G Bb Db (in thirds), but often spelled as C7b9 = C-Eb-F#-Bb, and the upper structure F#-A-C-Eb is F#dim7.

So F#dim7 functions as a dominant chord leading to C major.

Similarly, in the key of C, vii°7 is Bdim7, not F#dim.

But as a secondary dominant, F#dim7 can be the vii°7 of G, leading to G, or as the dominant of C, leading to C.

In this progression, we see F#dim resolving to Cmaj7 in the last part: ... F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E.

If F#dim is acting as C7b9 (without root), then it would lead strongly to C major.

Indeed, F#dim7 to C major: the resolution would be F#→G (but to C, it should be E to F or something). Wait:

F#dim7: F#-A-C-Eb

C major: C-E-G

Resolutions:

- F# → G (half step up to fifth of C)

- A → G or A → A (common tone)

- C → C or B

- Eb → D or E

The strongest resolution: Eb → D (to fifth of C), and F# → G (to fifth), but standard dominant resolution would have the third and seventh resolving: for C7, Bb-Eb resolve to A-D or something. But here, since it's functioning as C7b9, the Eb (b9) would resolve down to D, and the F# (#9 or b5) would resolve down to E or up to G.

In practice, F#dim7 is very commonly used as a substitute dominant chord leading to C major.

Similarly, earlier in the progression, we have F#dim leading to Am. If Am is the vi in C major, then F#dim could be the vii° of vi, but let's check:

In C major, vi is Am, and the vii° of vi would be G#dim. But F#dim is a half step lower.

F# to G# is a whole step, so not directly.

But if we consider Am, its leading tone is G#, so G#dim would lead to Am.

F#dim is related to D minor or something.

Back to the resolving to C: the progression ends with F#dim going to Cmaj7, which is strong evidence that C is a temporary tonic, and F#dim is the dominant of C.

Similarly, look at other cadences: when F#dim goes to G/F#. If G is the I in G major, but C is IV in G.

But if F#dim is dominant of C, then G would be V of C? In C major, G is V, so G7 would lead to C.

In the progression: Am/E -> G/F# -> F#dim.

Am to G: common pre-dominant to dominant.

G/F# is likely G7, as it has F# (the seventh), so G7 to C would be V7-I.

But here G7 goes to F#dim, which then goes to Cmaj7.

That makes sense: G7 (V7) -> vii° of C (which is Bdim) but here it's F#dim.

Wait, G7 to C, but the chord before C is F#dim.

In standard resolution, G7 -> C.

But if there's a passing dim chord: for example, G7 can go to Bdim (which is vii° of C) as a substitute, but Bdim and F#dim are different.

Bdim is B-D-F, F#dim is F#-A-C.

Not the same.

However, in some contexts, diminished chords can be used chromatically.

But the specific instance where F#dim resolves directly to C (as in the end: F#dim Cmaj7) suggests F#dim is the dominant of C.

Therefore, the progression is modulating or using C as a tonic at that point.

Given the repetitions, it's likely that the progression is in C major, with F#dim acting as the secondary dominant leading to C.

But F# is not diatonic to C major; C major has no sharps. F#dim is chromatic.

In C major, the vii° chord is Bdim, not F#dim.

So why F#dim?

F#dim7 is the vii°7 of G, but also equivalent to C7b9 (dominant of C).

So it's functioning as a V7b9 of C.

Similarly, earlier when it goes to D: D is not related to C directly. D in C major is V of V (since V of C is G, V of G is D).

So D major is V/V in C major.

And F#dim could be vii°/V/V or something.

Breakdown in key of C:

- C major: C Dm Em F G Am Bdim

Progression chords:

- F#dim: not diatonic; could be vii° of G, which is the V chord. So F#dim = vii°/V (vii° of G)

- D/F#: D major is V/V (since V of G is D)

- Am/E: Am is vi in C, so Am/E is vi6

- G/F#: G major is V in C, and G/F# is likely V7 (G7) in third inversion (since G7 has F#)

- Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 is I with seventh, first inversion

Ah! This makes sense.

In C major:

- G7 is the dominant chord (V7), which has notes G-B-D-F#

- Therefore, G/F# is G7 in third inversion (F# is the bass note)

- D major is V/V (secondary dominant), as it leads to G (the V)

- F#dim—specifically, F#dim7, which is enharmonically equivalent to the upper structure of C7b9, but in the context of V7, it's related. For the V/V (D major), the vii°/V/V would be C#dim7. However, F#dim7 is the vii°7 of G (V in C).

Let's clarify:

- In C major, V is G. The vii°7 of G (in its key) is F#dim7 (F#-A-C-Eb). So F#dim7 functions as vii°7/V, leading to V (G).

Standard progression: vii°7/V → V

e.g., F#dim7 → G

Which is exactly what we have: F#dim → G/F# (which is G7 or G major; if G/F# is G7, then it's vii°7/V → V7)

Similarly, D major is V/V (secondary dominant), leading to V (G).

V/V → V is a common progression: e.g., D7 → G

Here, D (major) → G7 (implied by G/F#)

And F#dim (vii°7/V) → G7

Also, the progression has parts where F#dim → Am. Am is vi in C, which is a common backdoor substitute, but vii°/V to vi isn't standard.

However, in the sequence: after G/F# (V7), we have F#dim, which might be a chromatic passing chord.

But let's map the whole thing to C major:

- F#dim: vii°7/V (of C, leading to G)

- D/F#: V/V

- Am/E: vi

- G/F#: V7 (G dominant seventh)

- Cmaj7/E: I

The progression can be seen as:

[vii°7/V - V/V] repeated with variations, then [vii°7/V - vi - V7 - vii°7/V], then back.

Specifically, the pattern is:

(F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F#) x2 but with interruption.

Breaking it:

1. F#dim (vii°7/V), F#dim (vii°7/V), D/F# (V/V), D/F# (V/V)

2. F#dim (vii°7/V), F#dim (vii°7/V), Am/E (vi), G/F# (V7)

3. F#dim (vii°7/V), F#dim (vii°7/V), D/F# (V/V), D/F# (V/V)

4. F#dim (vii°7/V), F#dim (vii°7/V), Cmaj7/E (I), F#dim (vii°7/V)

This shows that the primary key is C major, with G as the dominant, and D as the secondary dominant.

The F#dim chords are almost always acting as vii°7/V, leading to or from G (the V).

Exceptions: when it leads to D or Am.

- F#dim to D: vii°7/V to V/V. Is this a standard progression? vii°7/V typically leads to V, but V/V is the dominant of V, so it might not directly connect. However, F#dim7 and D7 share common tones (F#dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb; D7 = D-F#-A-C), so three common notes! Therefore, F#dim7 is enharmonically equivalent to D7b9 without the root: D7b9 = D-F#-A-C-Eb. So F#dim7 = {F#,A,C,Eb} which is the same as the upper four notes of D7b9. So F#dim7 functions as a rootless D7b9 chord.

Ah! That's critical.

So F#dim7 = D7b9 (without D root)

Therefore, anytime we see F#dim, it can be interpreted as a D7b9 chord, implying the dominant function to G (since D is V/V in C, but D7 is V7/V leading to G).

Similarly, when F#dim resolves to G, it's the dominant (of V) resolving.

When F#dim is followed by D/F#, that's D7b9 to D major—wait, D/F# is D major first inversion, so root D. Why would D7b9 go to D major? That doesn't make sense; dominants should resolve to the tonic.

But in the progression: F#dim → D/F#

If F#dim is D7b9 (no root), then D7b9 should resolve to G, not to D.

Unless it's a deceptive resolution or something else.

Perhaps the chord D/F# is a red herring—it might be functioning as a predominant.

Another resolution: F#dim7 to Am. If F#dim7 = G7b9 (wait, G7b9 has F# as third? G7b9 = G-B-D-F-Ab, so not matching).

F#dim7 is symmetrical and can resolve to four different keys, a minor third apart.

But in this context, the strongest resolutions are to G (after G/F# section) and to C (at the end).

Specifically, the last resolution: F#dim directly to Cmaj7, with no intervening G. If F#dim7 = C7b9, then it resolves to C.

And when it goes to G/F#, if G/F# is G7, then F#dim might not directly resolve to it.

Wait, the section: Am/E -> G/F# -> F#dim

Am to G: ii to I in G minor, but here it's probably ii-V in C: Am is vi, G is V, so vi-V is a backdoor to V-I.

Then G7 (as V7) to what? —> F#dim, which then goes to C.

But in a full cadence: G7 -> C.

Why insert F#dim? It could be a passing chord: G7 => F#dim7 (which is G7 with alterations) => C.

In fact, G7 can be altered to have raised fifth: G7#5 = G-B-D#-F, and D# is enharmonic to Eb, so G7#5 = G-B-Eb-F, but F#dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb, which shares Eb.

Not exactly, but chromatically it works.

The best fit is that the primary key is C major.

Evidence:

- Cmaj7/E is present, which is I.

- G is likely V (as G/F# suggests G7 dominant)

- D is V/V

- Am is vi

- F#dim functions as either vii°7/V (leading to G) or as C7b9 (leading to C)

In the progression, F#dim leads to both D and G and C and Am, but the strongest cadential motion is to C at the end.

Also, the chord Cmaj7/E is a resolution point.

Moreover, in the key of C, the progression makes sense with applied dominants.

Summary:

- The tonic chord is C major (evidenced by Cmaj7 as a resolution chord)

- F#dim acts as:

  - D7b9 (vii°7 of G, or V/V7) when resolving to G

  - C7b9 (vii°7 of C) when resolving to C

But since it resolves to C at the end, and Cmaj7 is the most stable chord presented (besides the dim chords, which are unstable), C is likely the tonic.

G/F# is G7 (V7), as F# is the minor seventh.

D/F# is first inversion of D major, which is V/V.

Am/E is vi in first inversion.

Thus, the key is C major.

Mode: Since all chords are major/minor as per diatonic in major scale, it's Ionian mode (major scale).

Confirmation:

- In C major:

  - D major: V/V

  - G major (with F# implying G7): V

  - Cmaj7: I

  - Am: vi

  - F#dim: chromatic, functioning as V7/V or V7b9 of C

The progression uses secondary dominants and a common diminished passing chord.

Therefore, key is C major.

Based on the chord progression you provided—**F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim**—I'll analyze the key and mode step by step. The progression heavily relies on functional harmony, chromaticism, and common jazz/pop chord substitutions. **The key is C major (Ionian mode)**, and here's why:

---

### **Key Evidence: C Major**
1. **Cmaj7/E as the Tonic Resolution**:
   - The chord `Cmaj7/E` (C major 7th in first inversion) appears near the end. This is a strong indicator of **C as the tonic (I chord)**, as major 7th chords like Cmaj7 are most stable and resolving when functioning as the "home" chord. The `/E` bass note (E) is the 3rd of Cmaj7, reinforcing its role as I.

2. **G/F# as the Dominant (V7)**:
   - `G/F#` is **G7 in third inversion** (G dominant 7th with F# in the bass). In C major, G7 is the **dominant chord (V7)**, which strongly pulls toward C (I). The `F#` in the bass is the minor 7th of G7 (G-B-D-F#), confirming its function as V7. This is not a diatonic G major chord (G-B-D) but a dominant 7th, essential for cadential motion.

3. **F#dim as a Leading-Tone Diminished Chord**:
   - `F#dim` is **F# diminished 7th** (F#-A-C-Eb), which functions in two critical ways in C major:
     - As **vii°7/V** (the leading-tone chord of G, the dominant key), resolving to G7 (V7). This is a standard chromatic passing chord toward the dominant.
     - As **C7b9 without the root** (a common substitution for dominant chords). For example:
       - C7b9 = C-Eb-G-Bb-Db, and its upper structure (Eb-G-Bb-Db) is identical to F#dim7 (enharmonically Gb-Eb-Bb-Db). Thus, F#dim7 here acts as a **V7b9/♭VI** leading to C (I), especially clear in the final cadence: `F#dim → Cmaj7/E`.

4. **D/F# as the Secondary Dominant (V/V)**:
   - `D/F#` is **D major in first inversion** (D-F#-A with F# in bass). In C major, D major is **V/V** (the dominant of G, which is V of C). It creates tension leading to G7 (V), reinforcing the C major tonal center. For example, `D/F# → G/F#` is a classic V/V → V progression.

5. **Am/E as the Submediant (vi)**:
   - `Am/E` is **A minor in first inversion** (A-C-E with E in bass). In C major, Am is **vi**, a diatonic pre-dominant chord. Its appearance fits naturally within C major harmony (e.g., vi → V → I).

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **G Major?**  
  F#dim is vii° in G major, and D/F# is V6. But `G/F#` (implied G7) would be tonic-dominant in G, yet the progression ends on `Cmaj7/E`, not G. G major also lacks the strong Cmaj7 resolution, making it less likely.

- **E Minor?**  
  F#dim is ii° in E harmonic minor, but D major (VI) and G major (III) are non-diatonic (harmonic minor requires G#dim/D#dim). The progression favors major chords (D, G, C) over minor, and **Am/E is vi in C**, not iv in E minor.

- **D Major?**  
  D/F# is I6, but F#dim isn't diatonic (D major has C#dim as vii°). Cmaj7 (IV) and Am (ii) don't resolve as convincingly.

- **A Minor?**  
  Am is i, but F#dim isn't diatonic (A minor has Bdim as ii°), and D major is not present in natural/harmonic/melodic minor.

**Key takeaway**: The progression orbits **C major** through clear dominant-to-tonic resolutions (G7 → C, F#dim → C), with secondary dominants (`D/F#` as V/V) and chromatic passing chords (`F#dim`) supporting C as the tonal center.

---

### **Mode: Ionian (Major Scale)**
- All diatonic chords (C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim) align with **C Ionian** (C-D-E-F-G-A-B).
- Chromaticism (F#dim, G7) is functional (secondary dominants/diminished substitutions), not modal mixture:
  - `F#dim` is a standard *vii°7/V* leading to G7 (V7).
  - `G/F#` is V7, not modal.
- **No characteristic mode signatures**:
  - **Dorian** would have F# (e.g., Bm Dorian), but here F# is chromatic (not a mode tonic).
  - **Mixolydian** would have Bb (G7 in C Mixolydian), but we have natural B (in Cmaj7).
  - **Lydian** would have F# (F# in C Lydian), but no F# in melody or harmony beyond the passing F#dim.

### **Progression Breakdown in C Major**
| Chord       | Function in C Major          | Role                                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **F#dim**   | **vii°7/V**                  | Leading tone to G7 (V7); also equivalent to C7b9 for direct V7→I pull. |
| **D/F#**    | **V/V (first inversion)**    | Secondary dominant leading to G7 (V).                                |
| **Am/E**    | **vi (first inversion)**     | Pre-dominant, setting up G7 (V).                                     |
| **G/F#**    | **V7 (third inversion)**     | Dominant 7th, pulling to C (I).                                      |
| **Cmaj7/E** | **I (first inversion)**      | Tonic resolution; the most stable chord in the progression.          |

**Cadential Flow**:  
- The structure uses **F#dim** as a pivot between V/V (D), V (G7), and I (C):  
  `...D (V/V) → G7 (V) → F#dim (chromatic passing) → C (I)...`  
- The final resolution `F#dim → Cmaj7/E` is unambiguous: F#dim7 is the classic V7b9 substitute for cadencing to C.

---

### **Why F#dim Appears So Frequently**
- It's a **symmetrical diminished chord** (intervals of minor 3rds: F#-A-C-Eb), making it harmonically flexible.
- In C major, it serves as:
  1. **vii°7 of G** (resolving to G7).
  2. **Upper structure of C7b9** (resolving to C).
  3. **Passing chord** between D and G (e.g., `D/F# → F#dim → G7` uses shared tones F#-A-C).
- Its repetition creates tension without fully resolving, typical in jazz/pop (e.g., Bill Evans-inspired harmony).

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **C major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian**  
- **Why**: The progression centers on C as the tonic (evidenced by Cmaj7), with G7 as V, D as V/V, and F#dim as a functional chromatic chord leading back to C. All elements align with C Ionian scale harmony, with no modal mixture or alternative tonic.

This progression is **common in jazz/pop** (e.g., Steely Dan, Radiohead) for its rich chromatic voice leading while firmly rooted in C major. If you have a melody or more context, I can refine this further!
