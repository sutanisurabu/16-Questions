This chord progression is quite unusual and doesn't clearly fit into a standard major, minor, or even common modal key. The intensive use of the diminished triad ($\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}: \text{F}\sharp - \text{A} - \text{C}$) makes it highly unstable and suggests a very chromatic or symmetrical approach.

Let's analyze the chords and their potential functions:

1.  **Chords Present:** $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$, $\text{D}/\text{F}\sharp$, $\text{A}(\text{m})/\text{E}$ ($\text{Am}/\text{E}$ is $\text{E} - \text{A} - \text{C}$), $\text{G}/\text{F}\sharp$, $\text{Cmaj7}/\text{E}$ ($\text{E} - \text{G} - \text{B} - \text{D}$).

2.  **Harmonic Structure:**
    *   The core chord is $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ ($\text{F}\sharp - \text{A} - \text{C}$).
    *   The bass moves stepwise or chromatically ($\text{F}\sharp \rightarrow \text{E} \rightarrow \text{F}\sharp \rightarrow \text{E}$).

### Analysis of Potential Keys

The key must contain the frequent notes $\text{F}\sharp$, $\text{A}$, $\text{C}$, and support the presence of $\text{D}$, $\text{E}$, $\text{G}$, and $\text{B}$ (from $\text{Cmaj7}$ and $\text{D}/\text{F}\sharp$).

#### Hypothesis 1: A Minor (Aeolian)

*   **Notes in A Minor:** A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
*   **Fit:** $\text{Am}/\text{E}$ and $\text{Cmaj7}/\text{E}$ (III chord) fit perfectly.
*   **Problem:** The core chord is $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$. The key of A minor has $\text{F}$ natural, making an $\text{F}\sharp$ chord (a common Neapolitan or chromatic passing chord, but not a central tonic feature) a significant deviation. $\text{F}\sharp$ is the raised submediant ($\text{vi}\uparrow$).

#### Hypothesis 2: D Major/B Minor

*   **Notes in D Major:** D, E, F$\sharp$, G, A, B, C$\sharp$.
*   **Fit:** $\text{D}$ chord fits. $\text{F}\sharp$ fits.
*   **Problem:** The dominant presence of $\text{C}$ natural (in $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$, $\text{Am}$, and $\text{Cmaj7}$) clashes directly with the $\text{C}\sharp$ required for D major or harmonic/melodic B minor.

#### Hypothesis 3: C Major

*   **Notes in C Major:** C, D, E, F, G, A, B.
*   **Fit:** $\text{Cmaj7}$, $\text{D}/\text{F}\sharp$ (II/V relationship), $\text{Am}$ fit.
*   **Problem:** The dominant presence of $\text{F}\sharp$ (the raised subdominant, $\#\text{IV}$) strongly suggests a highly modulatory or non-diatonic approach. $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ in C major is often a chromatic passing chord leading to $\text{G}$ ($\text{V}$) or $\text{Am}$ ($\text{vi}$).

### Conclusion on Key and Mode

Given the extremely high frequency of the $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ chord and its repeated oscillation, this progression is likely driven less by typical diatonic function and more by **symmetrical or chromatic movement**, often found in Romantic or Post-Tonal music (like that of Wagner or Debussy).

However, the chords that *resolve* or offer momentary stability ($\text{Am}/\text{E}$ and $\text{Cmaj7}/\text{E}$) point strongly toward the region of **A minor/C major**.

The progression seems to be:

$$ \text{F}\sharp\text{dim} \rightarrow \text{D}/\text{F}\sharp \rightarrow \text{A} \text{ minor } \approx \text{vi} \text{ (in C)} $$
$$ \text{F}\sharp\text{dim} \rightarrow \text{D}/\text{F}\sharp \rightarrow \text{Cmaj7} \approx \text{I} \text{ (in C)} $$

The main tonal center that includes the majority of diatonic chords is **C Major** (or A Minor). The repeated $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ functions as a coloristic chromatic chord, often enhancing the pull toward the local chords $\text{Am}$ and $\text{C}$.

### Final Determination

**Key:** **C Major / A Minor** (Tonal Region)

**Mode:** While the underlying diatonic material points to **Ionian (C Major)** or **Aeolian (A Minor)**, the persistent use of $\text{F}\sharp$ means the progression is not strictly modal but is **chromatic** within the context of the C/Am tonal center.

*The function of the $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ chord is likely the $\#\text{iv}^{\circ}$ or a member of the octatonic scale used functionally to create tension and leading-tone motion.*
