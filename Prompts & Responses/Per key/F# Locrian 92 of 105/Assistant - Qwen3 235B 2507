Let's analyze the chord progression you provided:

```
F#dim  F#dim  D/F#  D/F#
F#dim  F#dim  Am/E  G/F#
F#dim  F#dim  D/F#  D/F#
F#dim  F#dim  Cmaj7/E  F#dim
```

### Step 1: List the chords
First, identify the root and quality of each chord:
- **F#dim** = F# diminished (F# A C)
- **D/F#** = D major over F# in bass → D major chord (D F# A), bass = F#
- **Am/E** = A minor over E → Am (A C E), bass = E
- **G/F#** = G major over F# → G (G B D), bass = F#
- **Cmaj7/E** = C major 7 over E → Cmaj7 (C E G B), bass = E

So the chord roots are:
- F# (dim)
- D
- A
- G
- C

But the bass motion and harmonic function suggest we should look at the underlying key.

### Step 2: Look for Tonal Center
Although F#dim appears frequently, diminished chords are usually **passing** or **auxiliary**, not tonic. So F# is likely **not** the tonic.

Notice that several chords have **F# in the bass**:
- D/F# → D major with F# in bass → suggests F# might be a melodic or pedal tone
- G/F# → G major with F# in bass
- This F# in the bass across different chords suggests a possible **bass pedal point** on F#.

But the actual **chord roots** are: F#, D, A, G, C — which include diatonic chords from **C major** or **A minor**.

Let’s map out the chords:
- F#dim = F# A C → this is the **vii° of G major**, or **ii° of E minor**, but not diatonic to C major.
  - But wait: in **C major**, the diatonic chords are:
    - C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim
    - No F#dim here.

F#dim is not diatonic to **C major** — but it is diatonic to **G major** (where F#dim is vii°). But we have chords like **D major**, **G major**, **Cmaj7**, **Am**, which are major chords on D and G — both **not minor** in this progression.

So the presence of:
- D **major** (not Dm)
- G **major** (not Gm)
- C major
- Am

points toward **C major** as a key — **but D major is not diatonic** to C major (it would be Dm). So we have a **non-diatonic** D major chord.

Ah! This suggests **modal mixture** or **borrowing**, or possibly **mode** usage.

But here’s the clue: **F#dim** appears frequently and functions as a **passing chord** between D/F# and Am/E or similar.

Let’s analyze the bass line:
Bass notes:
- F#, F#, F#, F#
- F#, F#, E, F#
- F#, F#, F#, F#
- F#, F#, E, F#

So bass is mostly **F#**, with two instances of **E** (under Am and Cmaj7).

So perhaps it's a **pedal tone** piece with the bass holding or returning to **F#**, while chords change above.

But F# is **not** the root of a tonic chord — we never get an F# major or minor tonic.

Wait — perhaps this is in **E minor**?

Let’s check **E minor** (natural minor): E F# G A B C D

Diatonic chords in **E natural minor**:
- Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bdim, C, Dm

But we have:
- F#dim ✅
- D/F# — D major? But in E minor, D should be **minor**, not major.
- G/F# — G major ✅ (III in E minor)
- Am/E — Am ✅ (iv)
- Cmaj7/E — C major ✅ (VI)

So if **D were Dm**, it would fit E minor. But it's **D major** — so D major (D F# A) — F# is shared, but the **F natural** in Dm is raised to **F#**, which makes it **harmonic minor**?

Wait — in **E harmonic minor**, the scale is: E F# G A B C D#

→ D#dim is the ii° chord.

But we have **F#dim** (F# A C) — that’s **not** in E harmonic minor (F# would be F# A C#, not C natural).

So C natural → points back to **natural minor**.

But then D should be minor.

Hmm.

Alternative idea: **D major is borrowed?**

Wait — what if the key is **A minor**?

A natural minor: A B C D E F G
Diatonic chords:
- Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G

We have:
- F#dim? Not diatonic — A minor has no F#.
- D major? A minor has Dm.

No.

Wait — what about **C major**?

C major: C D E F G A B
Chords: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim

But we have:
- D major (not Dm)
- G major (G is major, OK)
- Cmaj7 (OK)
- Am (OK)
- F#dim? Not in C major.

But F#dim is enharmonically the **vii° of G**, and G is in C major.

So maybe **F#dim is being used as a chromatic passing chord** between G and Am? Or between D and Am?

Let’s look at the **voice leading**.

Try this example:
- D/F# → F# is bass
- Next chord: F#dim → moves to same bass, but chord changes from D (D F# A) to F#dim (F# A C)
  - So the D drops to C, the F# stays, A stays.
  - So it's like D/F# → F#dim = D → C in the upper voice.
  - Then back to D/F#? Yes — so likely, F#dim is a **passing chord** between D and D.

But sequence is:
F#dim → F#dim → D/F# → D/F#

That’s descending chromatic line in upper voice?

Let’s assign approximate root movement or voice leading.

Alternatively — maybe this is in **F# Phrygian**?

F# Phrygian: F# G A B C D E

Yes! That’s a possibility.

Let’s check:
- F# Phrygian scale: F# (1) G (2) A (3) B (4) C (5) D (6) E (7)

So scale degrees:
- i = F# minor
- But we have **F#dim**, which would be **i°** — not normal for Phrygian, which should have minor tonic.

But F#dim = F# A C → A is **minor third**, C is **diminished fifth** — so it's **diminished**, not minor.

In F# Phrygian, the tonic chord should be F# minor (F# A C#), not F# A C.

So **C instead of C#** → that’s not F# Phrygian.

We have C natural throughout — so C, not C#.

So the scale includes: F#, G, A, B, C, D, E

That’s **F# Locrian**? F# Locrian: 1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7
- F# G A B C D E → yes, that matches.

So **F# Locrian** is the 7th mode of **G major**.

Lochrian scale: F# G A B C D E

Chords diatonic to G major:

- F#dim (vii°) ✅
- D major? D major is **not** in G major — G major has **D minor**.

G major: G A B C D E F#
Diatonic vii° = F#dim ✅
But Dm, not D major.

But we have **D major** — again, D F# A → has F#, but **F# is not in D major chord as a harmonic root**.

Wait — **D/F#** is D major with F# in bass.

But **D major chord** is not in G major.

Wait — unless this is **modal mixture**.

Wait — what if the key is **B minor**?

B minor: B C# D E F# G A

No C natural — C# instead.

We have **C natural** in F#dim and Cmaj7 — so not B minor.

We have:
- F#dim (F# A C)
- D major (D F# A)
- Am (A C E)
- G (G B D)
- Cmaj7 (C E G B)

So all notes used: F#, A, C, D, G, B, E — that’s:
C D E F# G A B

That’s the **C Lydian** scale: C D E F# G A B

Yes!

### C Lydian: C D E F# G A B

Diatonic chords in C Lydian (mode of G major):
- I = C major ✅ (Cmaj7/E used)
- II = D major ✅ (D/F# used)
- iii = Em → but we have Em? No — we have F#dim and Am.

Wait — let’s build chords in C Lydian:

1. C E G → C major ✅
2. D F# A → D major ✅
3. E G B → Em — but we don’t use Em; we use F#dim and Am
4. F# A C → F#dim ✅
5. G B D → G major ✅
6. A C E → Am ✅
7. B D F# → Bdim — not used

So all chords in the progression are **diatonic to C Lydian**:
- D major = II
- F#dim = iv°
- Am = vi
- G = V
- Cmaj7 = I
- All fit

And the bass note F# appears because:
- D/F# = II with F# in bass (third of chord)
- F#dim = iv° chord
- G/F# = V with F# in third
- Am/E and Cmaj7/E = vi and I with E in bass

So the frequent **F# in bass** is not a tonic, but a **pedal tone** or **voice-leading device** — emphasizing the raised 4th (F#), which is characteristic of **Lydian mode**.

### Conclusion:

- **Key center**: **C**
- **Mode**: **Lydian**
- This is a **C Lydian** progression, emphasizing the #4 (F#) through bass pedal and the use of F#dim and D/F#.

The repeated F#dim functions as a **passing chord** between D/F# and Am/E or G/F#, exploiting the chromatic descending motion in inner voices (e.g. D → C → B), while maintaining F# in the bass.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key**: C  
**Mode**: **Lydian**  
**Tonal center**: C, with characteristic #4 (F#) creating the Lydian color.
