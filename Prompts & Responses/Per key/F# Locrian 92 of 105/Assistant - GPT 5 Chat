Let’s analyze the progression:

**Chord sequence:**
```
F#dim | F#dim | D/F# | D/F# | F#dim | F#dim | Am/E | G/F# |
F#dim | F#dim | D/F# | D/F# | F#dim | F#dim | Cmaj7/E | F#dim
```

### Step 1. Identify chord components

- **F#dim** = F# – A – C  
- **D/F#** = F# – A – D  
- **Am/E** = A – C – E  
- **G/F#** = F# – G – B – D  
- **Cmaj7/E** = E – G – B – C  

You can see recurring tones: **F#, A, C, D, E, G, B.**

### Step 2. Note relationships

- **F#dim** is the leading-tone diminished chord in **G major** (vii°) — strongly implying **G** as a tonal center.  
- **D/F#** (the dominant in G) and **G/F#** (the tonic with dominant bass) also reinforce G-related harmony.  
- **Am/E** (ii chord in G) and **Cmaj7/E** (IV with a major 7) fit naturally in **G major** as well.

### Step 3. Determine key

All chords fit inside **G major** (or its relative, **E minor**). Let’s check accidentals:

- In G major: {G, A, B, C, D, E, F#} → all chord tones fit.  
- No D# or C# appears to suggest modulation.

The **F#dim** recurring so frequently might imply a minor setting (since it could act as ii° in E minor), but the harmonic motion toward **D** and **G** suggests **G major** more than **E minor**, because we lack a strong tonic **E**-based resolution.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

- **Key:** G major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major)  

Alternatively, you could interpret it as **E natural minor (Aeolian)** if you hear **F#dim** resolving inward to **E** — but the harmonic evidence more strongly supports **G major (Ionian)**.
