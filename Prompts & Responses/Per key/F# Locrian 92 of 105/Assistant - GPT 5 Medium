### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I'm looking at the notes G, B, D, and F#. G/F# is interesting because it appears to hint at Gmaj7/F#, but since the root G is not in the bass, it serves more as a passing bass line. I notice a pattern that suggests an F# pedal, with some moments of E. The key probably relates to either D major or G major. The chords used include D major, G major, Am, Cmaj7, and F# diminished.**Examining chord structure**

I'm looking at the pitch collection of these chords: F# A C; D F# A; A C E; G B D F#; C E G B. The notes are C, D, E, F#, G, A, and B, which fit perfectly into the G major scale. The diminished triad on F# is indeed F# diminished in G major, making it the vii° triad. D major serves as the V chord in G. Am acts as ii, and I've realized that G/F# is Imaj7 with a leading tone bass.**Analyzing harmonic functions**

Cmaj7 acts as IVmaj7, and when I think of Cmaj7/E, it appears as IVmaj7 in first inversion due to the E bass note. That's an interesting point since Cmaj7’s B is the seventh scale degree in both C major and G major. The collection matches G major (Ionian). The F# pedal adds tension with its leading-tone bass line. Alternatively, this could fit in E natural minor, where F# dim is the ii° chord, making D major the VII. It’s fascinating how these relationships unfold!**Exploring tonal centers**

The bass pedal on F# seems to support E minor, but E tonic appears under Am/E and Cmaj7/E. However, there’s no E minor chord in sight. The sequence returns to F#dim, creating a feeling of a prelude in G major, where F# functions as the leading tone (vii°). If I consider G as the center, then the other chords align — particularly D/F# as V6 and G/F# as Imaj7. This suggests G major (Ionian) is likely the key, rather than E minor.**Determining the key and mode**

The use of D major indicates G major instead of E minor harmonic, as E harmonic minor would typically have B major, which isn’t present. The repeating F# pedal seems to gravitate towards G, even though we only encounter G as G/F#. The piece ends on F#dim, lacking a resolution to either E or G. Therefore, I conclude the sequence is diatonic to G major. The analysis suggests G major (Ionian) is the key, while E minor (Aeolian) remains a possibility, but the evidence strongly points to G major.

G major (Ionian).

Rationale: All chords are diatonic to G major/E minor (notes: G A B C D E F#). In G major:
- F#dim = vii°
- D/F# = V6
- Am/E = ii6/4
- G/F# = Imaj7 over leading tone
- Cmaj7/E = IVmaj7/3

The persistent F# bass is a leading-tone pedal. While the same set fits E natural minor (relative), the functions read most naturally in G major.
