### Analysis of the Chord Progression

The given progression is:  
**F#dim – F#dim – D/F# – D/F# – F#dim – F#dim – Am/E – G/F# – F#dim – F#dim – D/F# – D/F# – F#dim – F#dim – Cmaj7/E – F#dim**

This is a repeating, vamp-like structure with heavy emphasis on inversions (slash chords) and the bass notes F# (dominant) and E (subdominant/mediant). I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step, based on harmonic function, diatonic relationships, and scale degrees.

#### Step 1: Key Identification
- **Diatonic Chords and Scale Fit**:
  - All chords in this progression are diatonic to **G major** (no non-diatonic accidentals or borrowed chords required).
    - F#dim = vii° (fully diminished seventh: F#–A–C–E♭/D♯; leading-tone chord, common in major keys).
    - D (from D/F#) = V (dominant: D–F#–A).
    - Am (from Am/E) = ii (supertonic minor: A–C–E).
    - G (from G/F#) = I (tonic: G–B–D).
    - Cmaj7 (from Cmaj7/E) = IV (subdominant major seventh: C–E–G–B; the maj7 is diatonic).
  - The G major scale is: **G – A – B – C – D – E – F#** (one sharp: F#).
  - Notes used: Primarily from this scale (A, B, C, D, E, F#, G). The E♭ in F#dim is enharmonically D♯, which fits as the double-flat 7th (bb7) of the vii° chord—standard in major keys.
  - No evidence of modal mixture, chromaticism, or pivot to another key. The progression circles around the tonic (G), dominant (D), and leading tone (F#), resolving tension without shifting centers.

- **Bass Line and Inversions**:
  - Bass emphasizes **F#** (scale degree 7, leading tone) throughout, creating tension toward G (tonic). The brief E bass (scale degree 6) appears in Am/E and Cmaj7/E, acting as a subdominant pivot (e.g., 6/4 or first-inversion feel).
  - This isn't "walking" bass but a pedal-like F# ostinato, common in jazz/pop turnarounds in major keys. It reinforces G major without implying a minor or modal shift.

- **Root Movement and Function**:
  - Simplified roots (ignoring inversions): vii° → V → vii° → ii → I → vii° → V → vii° → IV → vii°.
  - This is a classic **dominant-tonic turnaround** (V–I via vii°), extended with ii–IV for color. It builds tension on vii°/V and releases to I, solidly anchoring in G major.
  - No strong pull to a relative minor (E minor) or parallel mode—e.g., no Bm (iii in G, i in E minor) or flattened notes like A♭/G# for mixolydian/phrygian.

- **Why Not Other Keys?**
  - **E minor (relative minor)**: Possible, but unlikely. F#dim would be v° (not vii°), and Cmaj7 (IV in G) becomes ♭VII (non-diatonic without borrowing). Bass F# feels more like leading to G than tonicizing E minor.
  - **D major**: D/F# fits as I, but F#dim (vii°/♭ii°) and Am/E (v/v over III) introduce non-diatonic tension without resolution to D.
  - **F# minor**: F#dim isn't diatonic (would expect G#dim as ii°), and G major chord clashes.
  - No modal ambiguity (e.g., no dorian ♭3 or mixolydian ♭7 emphasis).

#### Step 2: Mode Determination
- **Primary Mode: Ionian (Major)**.
  - The progression uses the full major scale without alterations:
    - No flattened 3rd (B♮, not B♭, confirms major).
    - No flattened 7th (F♮ absent; F# is sharpened leading tone).
    - Tonic (G) feels stable and bright, with dominant resolution (V–I) typical of Ionian/major harmony.
  - Harmonic language is tonal major: strong V–I cadence implied (even if unresolved at the end), with ii–IV as diatonic fillers. This evokes classic pop/jazz standards (e.g., similar to turnarounds in "Autumn Leaves" or "All of Me," though not an exact match).
  - Not modal in a strict sense—no drone, no avoidance of leading tone, no characteristic modal cadence (e.g., no phrygian E–F or lydian #4 emphasis).

#### Overall Interpretation
- **Key**: G major.
- **Mode**: Ionian.
- **Style/Context**: This feels like a jazz or pop ballad turnaround/vamp, possibly from a song like a standard or original composition emphasizing suspended tension on F#. It could loop indefinitely or resolve to G major. If this is from a specific tune, it aligns with G-major-centric repertoire.

If you provide more context (e.g., melody, full song, or genre), I can refine this further!
