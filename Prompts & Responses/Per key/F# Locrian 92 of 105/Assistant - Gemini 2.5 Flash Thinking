### Reasoning

**Assessing Harmonic Context**

I'm now carefully examining the chord progression, dissecting each chord's notes to understand their relationships. I am looking at how they connect and what kind of harmonic tension they create. My focus is on identifying any repeating patterns, considering potential modulations, and starting to anticipate the overall tonal center.


**Pinpointing Harmonic Function**

The chord analysis is complete; I have identified all the notes within each chord and their functions within the sequence. The initial pattern featuring repeated F#dim and D/F# chords is now clearer. My focus is on the role of the inversions and non-diatonic chords (like G/F#) in establishing or subverting a key. I suspect the Lydian mode, but the presence of the G/F# (V of vi) has made me rethink the original context.


**Examining Harmonic Functionality**

I'm now determining the harmonic roles of each chord within the sequence. F#dim, appearing frequently, is a dominant substitute, and the D/F# functions strongly as a tonic. I am considering the implications of the G/F# (V of vi), and the Cmaj7/E, within the broader context of a potential key. I will now examine whether the key is C Lydian (more likely) or G Major.


**Deciphering Chord Roles**

My assessment now involves connecting the chords. The frequent F#dim, paired with the subsequent D/F#, hints at a V-I or a dominant-tonic relationship, but in an unconventional key. I have to decide if the G/F# functions as a passing chord or has a more structural role. Finally, I will determine if the Cmaj7/E has more bearing on the tonal center.


**Examining Potential Tonics**

I am now thoroughly considering how the repeated F#dim functions within the sequence. My current hypothesis centers around C Lydian due to the prominence of F#, but the recurring D/F# is pushing me toward G Major as well. The presence of G/F#, although brief, influences this decision.


**Examining Key and Mode**

My analysis suggests that the chord sequence most likely centers on either G Major or C Lydian due to the note collection. The strong presence of F#dim poses a challenge. I'm now weighing the implications of each possibility, considering the unconventional function of the F#dim in both potential contexts, and debating the influence of the Cmaj7/E chord.


**Evaluating Sequence and Structure**

I'm now determining the overall form of the chord progression, looking for clear points of resolution or cadence. I'm focusing on the relationship between F#dim and D/F#, trying to see how they create harmonic motion and, perhaps, act as building blocks. I'm reassessing the key, given that F#dim is prevalent.


**Confirming Mode and Key**

I've determined that the note collection strongly suggests C Lydian. I'm now certain about the identification of C Lydian as the mode, confirming the prominent roles of D/F# (II) and Am/E (vi). The F#dim chord is the diminished chord built on the raised 4th, characteristic of Lydian harmony. The form will be based around C and D.


**Finalizing Mode and Structure**

I've determined that C Lydian is the most likely mode. The prominent F#dim chord, and the focus on the notes C, D, E, F#, G, A, and B, confirms this assessment. The structure leans towards a cyclical pattern. The frequent changes from F#dim to D/F# emphasize the raised 4th and dominant-like qualities of the progression.




This chord progression features a distinct set of notes and harmonic relationships that point strongly towards a specific mode.

1.  **Analyze the notes and scale:**
    The unique notes found across all chords are: C, D, E, F\#, G, A, B.
    This collection of notes is the **C Major scale with a raised 4th ($\hat{4}$)**, which is F\# instead of F natural.

2.  **Determine Possible Keys/Modes:**
    The scale C, D, E, F\#, G, A, B corresponds precisely to the **Lydian Mode** built on C.

    *   C Ionian (Major): C D E **F** G A B
    *   C Lydian: C D E **F\#** G A B

3.  **Analyze Chord Functions in C Lydian:**
    If C is the tonic (I):
    *   **Cmaj7/E** = I (Tonic chord). This serves as a strong indicator of the tonic center.
    *   **D/F\#** = II (The supertonic chord in Lydian is Major, D, F\#, A).
    *   **Am/E** = vi (The submediant chord).
    *   **G/F\#** = V (Dominant).
    *   **F\#dim (F\#, A, C)** = This chord is built on the raised 4th scale degree ($\hat{4}$). In Lydian, the chord built on $\hat{4}$ is typically an F\# half-diminished chord (F\#m7b5, F\# A C E). The use of the F\# diminished triad here serves to strongly emphasize the characteristic F\# tone of the Lydian mode. Its pervasive usage confirms the importance of this altered degree.

4.  **Conclusion:**
The consistent usage of Cmaj7 (I), D major (II), and A minor (vi), paired with the strong emphasis on F# (via D/F\# and F\#dim), confirms that the key center is C, utilizing the mode that incorporates the raised fourth degree.
