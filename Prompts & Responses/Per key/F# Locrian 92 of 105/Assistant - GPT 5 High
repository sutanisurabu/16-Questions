### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to analyze the provided chord progression: "F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim." The goal is to determine the key and mode based on this sequence, which likely comes from a song. 

The recurring chords are notable, particularly the presence of several slash chords indicating specific bass notes. Given the structure and common notes, it seems that the F#dim and D/F# chords connect effectively through voice-leading.**Exploring key and chords**

I’m breaking down the chords: Am/E (A C E), G/F# (G B D), and Cmaj7/E (C E G B). These suggest the key might be G major, given it has one sharp, with E minor as a relative option. 

In G major, the F#dim chord fits as the vii° chord. The D/F# is a V 6/3 (first inversion), and G/F# adds a leading tone. This gives a G major 7 feel but is missing the root. It's interesting to see how these chords interact!**Clarifying chord analysis**

The chord I’m working with is essentially Gmaj7/F#, indicating a third inversion of Gmaj7, but I'm dealing with just G/F#. With F# in the bass, it feels like a seventh between F# and G is acting as a second. If we include the seventh, it makes sense to call it Gmaj7/F#. 

In G major, Am/E functions as the ii6/4 chord, with E in the bass for a second inversion. G/F# acts as a I6/5 chord, utilizing the leading tone in the bass.**Evaluating chord function and key**

Cmaj7/E is functioning as the IVmaj7 in first inversion, with E in the bass. This means in G major, the chord structure has F#dim as the vii°, D major as V, Am as ii, C as IV, and G as I. 

The bassline moves from F# to E (Am/E), then back, showing a repeating F# pattern. This points to the key being G major in Ionian mode. However, I’m considering if D major could be another option, but F#dim isn’t diatonic there.**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing if the key could be E minor relative to G major. The E natural minor scale contains E, F#, G, A, B, C, D, leading to diatonic chords, where F#dim functions as ii° in E minor. D/F# acts as VII, while G/F# and Am/E fit as III/F# and iv/E, respectively. 

However, the repeated F#dim and presence of D major suggest G major as the primary tonality. I'd conclude that the key is G major (Ionian) based on these harmonic functions.

Key: G major
Mode: Ionian

Why: All chords are diatonic to G major. F#dim = vii°, D/F# = V6, Am/E = ii6/4, G/F# ≈ I with leading‑tone bass, Cmaj7/E = IVmaj7 in first inversion. While the same set fits E natural minor (Aeolian), the presence and use of D (V in G, only VII in E minor) point to G as the tonal center.
