Let’s break this down step by step.

## 1. List the chords and their likely functions

The progression is:  

**F#dim** – **F#dim** – **D/F#** – **D/F#** – **F#dim** – **F#dim** – **Am/E** – **G/F#** – **F#dim** – **F#dim** – **D/F#** – **D/F#** – **F#dim** – **F#dim** – **Cmaj7/E** – **F#dim**

## 2. Identify F#dim’s possible function

F#dim is a diminished triad (F#–A–C).  
In a full diminished 7th context, F#dim7 = F#–A–C–Eb.  
But here it’s just the triad, so it could be acting as a **common-tone diminished** or **leading-tone diminished** of G major or G minor.

Let’s check keys:

- In **G major**: F#dim = vii° (F#–A–C), which is diatonic.
- In **G minor**: F#dim is not diatonic (G minor has F♮), so it would be a secondary leading-tone chord or borrowed.

## 3. Look at surrounding chords

D/F# – D major with F# in bass.  
In G major, D is V, D/F# is V with 3rd in bass.  
F#dim shares notes A and C with D7 (D–F#–A–C) — in fact, F#dim = D7(b9) without the root D. So F#dim often works as a rootless D7b9, i.e., dominant function to G.

Am/E – Am is vi in C major, but in G major it’s ii. Am/E = A–C–E with E bass.  
G/F# – G major with F# bass = G major triad with F# in bass, which is like a D/F# with G in the melody? Actually G/F# = G–B–D–F# = Gmaj7? No, that’s Gmaj7/F#. But here it’s G triad with F# bass, so notes: F#–G–B–D. That’s not a standard tertian chord — it’s like an F#m7b5 (F#–A–C–E) but with G and B instead of A and C? Let’s check: F#–G–B–D.  
Spell: F# + G + B + D. That’s actually an F#dim7 (F#–A–C–Eb) but with G and B replacing A and Eb? No, that’s messy. Let’s rearrange: F#–G–B–D.  
If we put G in bass: G–B–D–F# = Gmaj7. But here F# is in bass, so it’s Gmaj7/F#. Yes! So G/F# is **first inversion of Gmaj7**.  

So G/F**#** → F#dim is chromatic bass movement F# → F#.

## 4. Check the final cadence

Before last F#dim we have Cmaj7/E.  
C–E–G–B with E bass.  
In G major, C is IV. Cmaj7 is IVmaj7.  
So progression: Cmaj7/E → F#dim → ? (loop back probably).  
F#dim is vii°/G, so Cmaj7 → F#dim is IV → vii° in G, a deceptive or incomplete cadence.

## 5. Determine key from overall harmonic pull

D/F# is V in G major.  
Am is ii in G major (or vi in C major).  
G/F# is Imaj7 in first inversion in G major.  
Cmaj7 is IV in G major.  

Everything fits **G major**:

- F#dim = vii° (common as passing chord between I and V6 or as approach to G)
- D/F# = V6
- Am = ii
- G/F# = I6 (maj7)
- Cmaj7 = IVmaj7

---

## 6. Mode

All chords are diatonic to G major except F#dim is the *only* diminished triad, but it’s the normal leading-tone chord in major.  
So the mode is **G major** (Ionian).

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{G \text{ major}}
\]
