The chord progression you've provided is:

**F#dim – F#dim – D/F# – D/F# – F#dim – F#dim – Am/E – G/F# – F#dim – F#dim – D/F# – D/F# – F#dim – F#dim – Cmaj7/E – F#dim**

---

### Step 1: Look for a tonal center
We can start by identifying whether there’s a recurring or emphasized chord that might indicate the key. The **F#dim** chord appears very frequently—almost every other chord—so it may be **functioning as a leading tone chord** (vii°) in some key.

In classical harmony, a diminished chord built on the **7th scale degree** (vii°) strongly resolves to the **tonic (I)**. For example:
- In **A minor**: G#° → Am
- In **E major**: D#° → E

But here we have **F#dim**, which contains the notes: **F# – A – C**

Let’s examine what key would treat **F#dim** as vii°:
- In **G major/minor**: F#° = vii° (notes: F# A C) → resolves to G
- In **G natural minor**: Yes, F#° is vii°
- In **G harmonic minor**: Also F#° (raised 7th)

So **F#° is the vii° chord in G minor (or G major, but less common because vii° in major is less functional)**.

However, **we don’t see a G major or G minor chord** in the progression—no G in root position at all. But we **do see G/F#**, which is a **G major chord with F# in the bass**—essentially a **G/F# = F# G B**, which strongly implies **G as the root**, with a leading tone in the bass.

Also notable: **Am/E** = A minor with E in the bass → E is the 5th of Am, but also the **dominant (V) of Am**. However, **Am is vi in C major**, and **ii in G major**.

Also: **D/F#** = D major with F# in bass → this is **D major**, the **V chord in G major/minor**.

And **Cmaj7/E** = C major 7 with E in bass → Cmaj7 is **IV in G major**, and **bVI in E minor**, but **in G major/minor**, C is the subdominant.

So let’s consider **G minor** as a candidate.

---

### Step 2: Analyze chords in context of G minor

In **G natural minor (Aeolian)**:
- i = Gm
- ii° = Adim
- III = Bb
- iv = Cm
- v = Dm
- VI = Eb
- VII = F

But our chords include **D major (D/F#)**, which is **not in G natural minor**—but **is in G harmonic minor** (where the 7th is raised: F#), making **D major = V chord**.

In **G harmonic minor**:
- i = Gm
- ii° = Adim
- III+ = Bb+ (augmented)
- iv = Cm
- V = D (major)
- VI = Eb
- vii° = F#dim

So **F#dim = vii°**, **D = V**, both fit **G harmonic minor**.

Now check other chords:

- **Am/E**: A minor = **ii chord** in G harmonic minor? Wait—in G minor, the ii chord is **A diminished**, not A minor. But **Am** is from **G melodic minor (ascending)** or borrowed from other modes.
  
  However, **Am/E** might be better interpreted as a **first inversion of A minor**, which could be a **modal mixture** or passing chord.

- **G/F#**: This is a **G major chord over F#**. But **G major is the tonic chord**—but in minor key, the i chord is **G minor**, not G major. However, **G major (Picardy third)** is common at cadences, but here it's just a passing chord.

  But wait: **G/F#** = notes F#, G, B. This is essentially an **F# diminished chord with a G added**—or a **dominant #9 sound**? Alternatively, it can be seen as a **tritone substitution** or passing chord.

- **Cmaj7/E**: Cmaj7 = C E G B. In G harmonic minor, the **iv chord is C minor**, not C major. So Cmaj7 is **not diatonic to G harmonic minor**.

  But **Cmaj7** appears in **E minor** as **bIII**, or in **A minor** as **IV**, or in **G major** as **IV**.

Wait—let’s test **E minor**.

---

### Step 3: Try E minor

E natural minor (Aeolian): E F# G A B C D  
E harmonic minor: E F# G A B C D#

Chords:
- vii° in E minor = D#° → not F#°
- F#dim = F# A C → This is **ii°** in E minor? No, ii in E minor is **F# dim** only in **E harmonic minor**? Wait:

In E harmonic minor:
- Scale: E F# G A B C D#
- Chord on F# = F# dim? F#–A–C = yes, that’s a diminished triad → **ii°**

But **ii° in minor keys is not common as a central chord**—usually the emphasis is on V or i.

Also, **D/F#** = D major → In E minor, D major is **flat-VII**, which is common in rock/pop but not a strong tonal center.

Cmaj7/E = Cmaj7 → in E minor, that’s **bVI7**, which is a common borrowed chord (from E Phrygian or major), but again, not strongly pointing to E.

Do we see an **E minor chord**? No. The bass notes include E (in Am/E and Cmaj7/E), but no Em chord.

So E minor is unlikely.

---

### Step 4: Try A minor

A natural minor: A B C D E F G  
A harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#

F#dim in A minor:
- F#–A–C → This is the **vii° chord in A harmonic minor?** Let's see: A harmonic minor = A B C D E F G#
- The 7th degree is G#, so vii° would be G#° = G# B D → not F#°

But F# is the **raised 6th** in A minor (melodic minor). In **A melodic minor (ascending)**: A B C D E F# G#

Chord on F# = F#–A–C → diminished → that’s the **vi° chord** in A melodic minor.

But again, not a strong functional chord.

D major = V of G, but in A minor, D is **IV**, and D major is common (from harmonic/melodic minor).

Cmaj7 = **bVII** in A minor? No, C is **bIII**, which is common.

Still, the recurrence of **F#dim** and **D/F#** suggests **F# is acting as leading tone → G**.

Also, **G/F#** strongly implies **resolution to G** (even if G major, not minor).

Now note: **Am/E** = A minor/E → E is the 5th, but E is **V of A minor**. But if the key is G, then Am is **ii**, and E in bass = **E is V**, so Am/E = a way to emphasize the dominant.

Similarly, **Cmaj7/E**: Cmaj7 with E bass = E–G–B–C → this forms an **E7b13** or **E7sus4♭9**? Actually, E G B C = E–G–B–C = **E half-diminished?** No, E–G–B is **Em**, add C = **Em7**? Wait: Em7 = E G B D. So C is not in Em7.

But Cmaj7/E = E in bass + Cmaj7 = E C E G B → notes: C E G B. Over E, this is **C/E**, which is a **first inversion C major**, often used as a **passing chord between D/F# and F#dim**.

Voice leading:  
D/F# → C/E → F#dim  
F# → E → F# (bass toggles)  
A → G → A  
C → B → C

This is **chromatic voice leading**, especially in the bass: F# → E → F#, and upper voices move stepwise.

This progression is heavily **chromatic**, but the **functional harmony** still points to **G** as tonic—especially because:

- F#° = vii° of G  
- D = V of G  
- G/F# = a **cadential 6/4-like** chord (tonic with leading tone in bass)  
- C = IV in G

So even though the tonic **G chord is not explicitly stated in root position**, it is **strongly implied** by the surrounding chords.

Also, **Cmaj7/E → F#dim**: Cmaj7 contains E, G, B, C. F#dim = F# A C. The C is common, E → F#, G → A, B → C. Again, strong chromatic motion to F#dim, which wants to resolve to G.

---

### Step 5: Consider mode

If the key is **G minor**, and we’re using:
- F#° (vii° from harmonic minor)
- D major (V from harmonic minor)
- Cmaj7 (not in harmonic minor, but could be borrowed from melodic minor or used as modal mixture)

But **Cmaj7** suggests the **6th degree is major (E natural)**, which is true in **natural minor**, but natural minor doesn’t have D major.

However, **G Dorian** has: G A Bb C D E F G → D is minor, so no.

**G harmonic minor**: has D major and F#°, but C is minor.

So the presence of **C major (in Cmaj7)** suggests either:
- A temporary shift (modal mixture from G major/ Mixolydian)
- Or the piece is actually in **E minor**, where Cmaj7 is bVI, D is bVII, F#° is ii° — but again, weak.

Alternatively, consider **C major** as the key?

In C major:
- F#° = #iv° → not diatonic, but used as a **chromatic passing chord** (e.g., between F and G)
- D/F# = V/V (secondary dominant to G)
- Am/E = vi6
- G/F# = V with leading tone in bass
- Cmaj7/E = I6

This makes sense! In **C major**, the progression could be:

- F#° = chromatic passing chord (commonly used between F and G, or as vii°/V)
- D/F# = A7 without the 7th? No, D is V/V (secondary dominant to G)
- G = V
- C = I

So the progression might be **tonicizing G (V of C)**, but then **resolving back to C**.

But the progression **ends on F#dim**, not C. So it’s **not conclusively in C**.

However, if we look at the chords:

**D/F# → C/E → F#dim**

In C major, this is:
- D/F# = V/V
- C/E = I6
- F#dim = vii°/V → leads back to G

But again, no G chord.

But wait—**Am/E → G/F#**: Am is vi, G is V in C major. So Am/E → G/F# = vi → V (with inversions)

And **Cmaj7/E** = I6

So many chords fit **C major** with secondary dominants and chromatic chords.

But why so much **F#dim**? In C major, F#° is **vii° of V** (G), so it functions as a **leading-tone chord to G**, which is the dominant.

So the entire progression might be **hovering around the dominant (G)** of **C major**, creating tension without resolving to C.

But the presence of **D major** (V/V) and **F#° (vii°/V)**, **G/F# (V)**, and **C (I)** suggests the **home key is C major**, and the progression is **emphasizing the dominant area**.

Yet the **repetition of F#dim and D/F#** without resolution to G or C makes it ambiguous.

---

### Final Analysis

The most consistent interpretation is that the **tonal center is G**, and the mode is **G harmonic minor**, with possible modal mixture (e.g., C major instead of C minor).

Why?
- F#° is vii° → G
- D major is V → G
- G/F# implies G tonic
- Cmaj7 is a borrowed chord (from G major or melodic minor)

Even though Cmaj7 isn’t in G harmonic minor, **borrowed subdominant chords (like C major)** are common in minor keys (e.g., "minor key with Picardy subdominant").

Moreover, the **bass motion F# → E → F#** centers around **F#**, the leading tone to G.

Thus, the **key is G minor**, and the **mode is harmonic minor** (due to the presence of D major and F#°).

✅ **Answer: Key = G minor, Mode = Harmonic minor**.
