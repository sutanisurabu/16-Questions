Determine key and mode

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to analyze the provided chord progression: "F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim." The goal is to determine the key and mode based on this sequence, which likely comes from a song. 

The recurring chords are notable, particularly the presence of several slash chords indicating specific bass notes. Given the structure and common notes, it seems that the F#dim and D/F# chords connect effectively through voice-leading.**Exploring key and chords**

I’m breaking down the chords: Am/E (A C E), G/F# (G B D), and Cmaj7/E (C E G B). These suggest the key might be G major, given it has one sharp, with E minor as a relative option. 

In G major, the F#dim chord fits as the vii° chord. The D/F# is a V 6/3 (first inversion), and G/F# adds a leading tone. This gives a G major 7 feel but is missing the root. It's interesting to see how these chords interact!**Clarifying chord analysis**

The chord I’m working with is essentially Gmaj7/F#, indicating a third inversion of Gmaj7, but I'm dealing with just G/F#. With F# in the bass, it feels like a seventh between F# and G is acting as a second. If we include the seventh, it makes sense to call it Gmaj7/F#. 

In G major, Am/E functions as the ii6/4 chord, with E in the bass for a second inversion. G/F# acts as a I6/5 chord, utilizing the leading tone in the bass.**Evaluating chord function and key**

Cmaj7/E is functioning as the IVmaj7 in first inversion, with E in the bass. This means in G major, the chord structure has F#dim as the vii°, D major as V, Am as ii, C as IV, and G as I. 

The bassline moves from F# to E (Am/E), then back, showing a repeating F# pattern. This points to the key being G major in Ionian mode. However, I’m considering if D major could be another option, but F#dim isn’t diatonic there.**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing if the key could be E minor relative to G major. The E natural minor scale contains E, F#, G, A, B, C, D, leading to diatonic chords, where F#dim functions as ii° in E minor. D/F# acts as VII, while G/F# and Am/E fit as III/F# and iv/E, respectively. 

However, the repeated F#dim and presence of D major suggest G major as the primary tonality. I'd conclude that the key is G major (Ionian) based on these harmonic functions.

Key: G major
Mode: Ionian

Why: All chords are diatonic to G major. F#dim = vii°, D/F# = V6, Am/E = ii6/4, G/F# ≈ I with leading‑tone bass, Cmaj7/E = IVmaj7 in first inversion. While the same set fits E natural minor (Aeolian), the presence and use of D (V in G, only VII in E minor) point to G as the tonal center.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I'm looking at the notes G, B, D, and F#. G/F# is interesting because it appears to hint at Gmaj7/F#, but since the root G is not in the bass, it serves more as a passing bass line. I notice a pattern that suggests an F# pedal, with some moments of E. The key probably relates to either D major or G major. The chords used include D major, G major, Am, Cmaj7, and F# diminished.**Examining chord structure**

I'm looking at the pitch collection of these chords: F# A C; D F# A; A C E; G B D F#; C E G B. The notes are C, D, E, F#, G, A, and B, which fit perfectly into the G major scale. The diminished triad on F# is indeed F# diminished in G major, making it the vii° triad. D major serves as the V chord in G. Am acts as ii, and I've realized that G/F# is Imaj7 with a leading tone bass.**Analyzing harmonic functions**

Cmaj7 acts as IVmaj7, and when I think of Cmaj7/E, it appears as IVmaj7 in first inversion due to the E bass note. That's an interesting point since Cmaj7’s B is the seventh scale degree in both C major and G major. The collection matches G major (Ionian). The F# pedal adds tension with its leading-tone bass line. Alternatively, this could fit in E natural minor, where F# dim is the ii° chord, making D major the VII. It’s fascinating how these relationships unfold!**Exploring tonal centers**

The bass pedal on F# seems to support E minor, but E tonic appears under Am/E and Cmaj7/E. However, there’s no E minor chord in sight. The sequence returns to F#dim, creating a feeling of a prelude in G major, where F# functions as the leading tone (vii°). If I consider G as the center, then the other chords align — particularly D/F# as V6 and G/F# as Imaj7. This suggests G major (Ionian) is likely the key, rather than E minor.**Determining the key and mode**

The use of D major indicates G major instead of E minor harmonic, as E harmonic minor would typically have B major, which isn’t present. The repeating F# pedal seems to gravitate towards G, even though we only encounter G as G/F#. The piece ends on F#dim, lacking a resolution to either E or G. Therefore, I conclude the sequence is diatonic to G major. The analysis suggests G major (Ionian) is the key, while E minor (Aeolian) remains a possibility, but the evidence strongly points to G major.

G major (Ionian).

Rationale: All chords are diatonic to G major/E minor (notes: G A B C D E F#). In G major:
- F#dim = vii°
- D/F# = V6
- Am/E = ii6/4
- G/F# = Imaj7 over leading tone
- Cmaj7/E = IVmaj7/3

The persistent F# bass is a leading-tone pedal. While the same set fits E natural minor (relative), the functions read most naturally in G major.

### Reasoning

**Interpreting chord progressions**

I’m working on interpreting the sequence of slash chords and diminished chords. The progression includes many F#dim and D/F#, suggesting a key area around D major or minor. D/F# represents a D major triad in first inversion, while F#dim is the leading-tone diminished triad in G major. The F#dim triad also relates to E harmonic minor. It looks like F#dim serves as the leading tone in both G major and G minor.**Examining harmonic minor chords**

I’m looking at G harmonic minor, which uses F# as a leading tone. The diminished triad F# A C serves as vii° in G minor. D/F# represents a D major chord with F# in the bass, functioning as V6 in G major. Also, Am/E indicates an A minor chord with E in the bass, suggesting a ii6/4 situation. G/F# suggests a G major chord with F# as bass, possibly forming a Gmaj7/F#. The details are really coming together!**Analyzing chord functions**

I notice that F# isn’t part of the G major triad, but when used as a slash chord, it functions as a leading-tone passing tone between G (the tonic) and Em (the vi). In G major, F#dim is likely functioning as vii°. Analyzing the chord sequence, there’s significant repetition of F#dim and D/F#, creating an ostinato. So, the key might be G major, with a pedal leading-tone F#. The Cmaj7/E indicates a first inversion of IVmaj7, adding depth to the progression.**Confirming diatonic chords in G major**

It looks like Cmaj7 functions as the IV7 chord in G major because it contains the notes C, E, G, and B—all part of G major. Am/E is the ii chord, with E in the bass, which is diatonically sound too. G/F# acts as the I chord with a leading tone in the bass, while D/F# serves as V, also diatonic. All these fit nicely into G major, reinforcing that the key is G major (Ionian). However, the strong presence of F# in the bass could introduce a Locrian feel.**Determining key and mode**

All the chords fit G major, particularly with Cmaj7/E reinforcing the tonality. Even though F# may suggest E minor, the progression lacks Em chords, leaning more towards G major. The presence of F#dim and D/F# indicates a diatonic function, supporting G major as the tonal center. Additionally, the final resolution points to G rather than E. Overall, I conclude that the key is G major and the mode is Ionian, as the chords consistently align with that framework.**Consolidating key analysis**

Although I could analyze the progression in E natural minor due to chords like Am/E, Cmaj7/E, and G/F#, the tonal center isn't E, as the piece doesn't resolve to Em. I’m concluding that the key is G major (Ionian). While it's possible to see it as E natural minor if the context supports E, the absence of an Em chord leans towards G major. The breakdown includes diatonic chords, leading to the conclusion: Key: G major; Mode: Ionian. An alternate interpretation as E Aeolian is possible.

Key: G major
Mode: Ionian

Why: Every chord is diatonic to G major:
- F#dim = vii°
- D/F# = V6
- Am/E = ii6/4
- G/F# = I with the major 7th in the bass (passing)
- Cmaj7/E = IVmaj7/3

These functions center on G, with F# acting as the leading tone. Note: The same set fits E natural minor (relative), but there’s no clear i (Em) cadence; the emphasis on F#→G motion points to G major.

### Analysis of the Chord Progression

The given progression is:  
**F#dim – F#dim – D/F# – D/F# – F#dim – F#dim – Am/E – G/F# – F#dim – F#dim – D/F# – D/F# – F#dim – F#dim – Cmaj7/E – F#dim**

This is a repeating, vamp-like structure with heavy emphasis on inversions (slash chords) and the bass notes F# (dominant) and E (subdominant/mediant). I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step, based on harmonic function, diatonic relationships, and scale degrees.

#### Step 1: Key Identification
- **Diatonic Chords and Scale Fit**:
  - All chords in this progression are diatonic to **G major** (no non-diatonic accidentals or borrowed chords required).
    - F#dim = vii° (fully diminished seventh: F#–A–C–E♭/D♯; leading-tone chord, common in major keys).
    - D (from D/F#) = V (dominant: D–F#–A).
    - Am (from Am/E) = ii (supertonic minor: A–C–E).
    - G (from G/F#) = I (tonic: G–B–D).
    - Cmaj7 (from Cmaj7/E) = IV (subdominant major seventh: C–E–G–B; the maj7 is diatonic).
  - The G major scale is: **G – A – B – C – D – E – F#** (one sharp: F#).
  - Notes used: Primarily from this scale (A, B, C, D, E, F#, G). The E♭ in F#dim is enharmonically D♯, which fits as the double-flat 7th (bb7) of the vii° chord—standard in major keys.
  - No evidence of modal mixture, chromaticism, or pivot to another key. The progression circles around the tonic (G), dominant (D), and leading tone (F#), resolving tension without shifting centers.

- **Bass Line and Inversions**:
  - Bass emphasizes **F#** (scale degree 7, leading tone) throughout, creating tension toward G (tonic). The brief E bass (scale degree 6) appears in Am/E and Cmaj7/E, acting as a subdominant pivot (e.g., 6/4 or first-inversion feel).
  - This isn't "walking" bass but a pedal-like F# ostinato, common in jazz/pop turnarounds in major keys. It reinforces G major without implying a minor or modal shift.

- **Root Movement and Function**:
  - Simplified roots (ignoring inversions): vii° → V → vii° → ii → I → vii° → V → vii° → IV → vii°.
  - This is a classic **dominant-tonic turnaround** (V–I via vii°), extended with ii–IV for color. It builds tension on vii°/V and releases to I, solidly anchoring in G major.
  - No strong pull to a relative minor (E minor) or parallel mode—e.g., no Bm (iii in G, i in E minor) or flattened notes like A♭/G# for mixolydian/phrygian.

- **Why Not Other Keys?**
  - **E minor (relative minor)**: Possible, but unlikely. F#dim would be v° (not vii°), and Cmaj7 (IV in G) becomes ♭VII (non-diatonic without borrowing). Bass F# feels more like leading to G than tonicizing E minor.
  - **D major**: D/F# fits as I, but F#dim (vii°/♭ii°) and Am/E (v/v over III) introduce non-diatonic tension without resolution to D.
  - **F# minor**: F#dim isn't diatonic (would expect G#dim as ii°), and G major chord clashes.
  - No modal ambiguity (e.g., no dorian ♭3 or mixolydian ♭7 emphasis).

#### Step 2: Mode Determination
- **Primary Mode: Ionian (Major)**.
  - The progression uses the full major scale without alterations:
    - No flattened 3rd (B♮, not B♭, confirms major).
    - No flattened 7th (F♮ absent; F# is sharpened leading tone).
    - Tonic (G) feels stable and bright, with dominant resolution (V–I) typical of Ionian/major harmony.
  - Harmonic language is tonal major: strong V–I cadence implied (even if unresolved at the end), with ii–IV as diatonic fillers. This evokes classic pop/jazz standards (e.g., similar to turnarounds in "Autumn Leaves" or "All of Me," though not an exact match).
  - Not modal in a strict sense—no drone, no avoidance of leading tone, no characteristic modal cadence (e.g., no phrygian E–F or lydian #4 emphasis).

#### Overall Interpretation
- **Key**: G major.
- **Mode**: Ionian.
- **Style/Context**: This feels like a jazz or pop ballad turnaround/vamp, possibly from a song like a standard or original composition emphasizing suspended tension on F#. It could loop indefinitely or resolve to G major. If this is from a specific tune, it aligns with G-major-centric repertoire.

If you provide more context (e.g., melody, full song, or genre), I can refine this further!

### Analysis of Chord Progression
The given progression is:  
**F#dim - F#dim - D/F# - D/F# - F#dim - F#dim - Am/E - G/F# - F#dim - F#dim - D/F# - D/F# - F#dim - F#dim - Cmaj7/E - F#dim**

This is a repetitive, cyclical sequence with a clear functional harmony, emphasizing tension and release. I'll break down the key determination step by step, focusing on roots, functions, and overall tonality.

#### Step 1: Root Notes and Chord Types (Ignoring Inversions for Now)
- Roots: F# (dim), F# (dim), D (maj), D (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), A (min), G (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), D (maj), D (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), C (maj7), F# (dim).
- Chord qualities:
  - Diminished: F#dim (F#-A-C).
  - Major: D (D-F#-A), G (G-B-D), Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B).
  - Minor: Am (A-C-E).
- All these chords are **fully diatonic** (no accidentals outside the parent scale) to the G major scale:  
  **G - A - B - C - D - E - F#**.  
  - F#dim = vii° (leading-tone diminished).  
  - D = V (dominant).  
  - Am = ii (supertonic minor).  
  - G = I (tonic).  
  - Cmaj7 = IVmaj7 (subdominant with added 7th).  

No chords require borrowed notes, modulations, or chromaticism, pointing to a single key center.

#### Step 2: Functional Harmony and Progression Structure
- The progression is built around **tension-resolution patterns** typical of major keys:  
  - **F#dim - D/F#** pairs: vii° - V (or V6 in inversion). This is a common pre-dominant motion that strongly pulls toward the tonic (G). The repetition heightens expectation.  
  - **Am/E - G/F#**: ii (in 6/4 inversion) - I (with non-standard slash). This acts as a ii-V/ii or subdominant approach to the tonic, resolving the earlier tension.  
  - Final **Cmaj7/E - F#dim**: IVmaj7 (in 3/5 inversion) - vii°. This builds subdominant color before looping back to vii° (implying resolution to I, even if not explicitly stated).  
- Overall flow: It's a loop of **vii° - V - ii - I - (IV - vii°)**, with the F#dim acting as a recurring "pivot" chord. This is classic for G major, where vii° (F#dim) creates leading-tone pull (F# → G) to resolve everything.  
- No strong minor-key indicators (e.g., no i chord like Gm, no ♭3 like B♭, no Phrygian cadences). The presence of major I (G) and IV (C) confirms major tonality.

#### Step 3: Inversions and Bass Line
- Bass notes: Primarily F# (pedal-like under F#dim, D/F#, G/F#), with E inserts (under Am/E and Cmaj7/E).  
  - This creates a descending bass motif (F# → E), common in major keys for smooth voice leading.  
  - D/F# = V6 (first inversion, F# in bass).  
  - Am/E = ii⁶₄ (second inversion, E = 5th of Am in bass).  
  - G/F# = I with F# bass (unconventional for strict triads, as F# isn't in G-B-D; it may imply a G7/F# context—G-B-D-F with F# bass variant—or a pedal bass line. In practice, this functions as a tonic arrival with added tension).  
  - Cmaj7/E = IV with E bass (3rd or 5th in bass, depending on voicing).  
- The bass reinforces G major by staying within the scale (F# and E are notes 7 and 6), without introducing foreign tones.

#### Step 4: Key and Mode Determination
- **Key: G major**.  
  - G is the clear tonic: The progression orbits around it (G chord appears explicitly, and everything resolves toward it). F#dim (vii°) and D (V) are dominant forces pulling to G, while Am (ii) and C (IV) provide subdominant support. This matches standard pop/jazz/ballad progressions in G major (e.g., similar to elements in songs like "I Got Rhythm" variations or "The Way You Look Tonight").  
- **Mode: Major (Ionian)**.  
  - All chords align with the major scale—no minor v, no ♭VII, or other modal shifts. The bright, resolved quality (major I and IVmaj7) confirms Ionian mode over something like Mixolydian (which might flatten the 7th more prominently).

#### Potential Context or Song Match
This progression has a nostalgic, standards-like feel (repetitive diminished chords + inversions suggest a mid-20th-century jazz or pop influence). It resembles parts of "As Time Goes By" (from Casablanca) or similar torch songs in G major, but could be original. If this is from a specific piece, more melody/context would refine it.

If you provide the melody, time signature, or song title, I can refine this further!

### Reasoning

**Assessing Chord Progressions**

I've just begun a deep dive into the given chord progression. My initial scan focused on the unusual diminished chords, and I'm already formulating some first impressions about the overall feel and potential direction. I'm keen to dissect the harmonic movement and identify any interesting melodic implications.


**Deconstructing the Diminished**

I'm now focusing on the diminished chords, and their potential role in this progression. My current thinking is centered on the function of these F#dim chords, they're everywhere! Exploring how they're used and how they relate to the more stable chords, such as D/F# and Cmaj7/E, is key. I'm also considering the potential key(s) or modes based on these relationships, and I'm prepared for a bit of modulation.


**Considering Leading Tones**

I'm now contemplating the potential leading-tone resolution of the F# diminished chord. I'm exploring its relationship to the other chords in the sequence, specifically how the lack of a clear resolution to G challenges my initial assumptions. I'm carefully analyzing the bassline movement and the overall melodic contour to find alternative tonal centers.


**Evaluating Expected Resolutions**

I'm now focusing on how the F#dim chords *don't* always resolve as expected to G. The D/F# and Am/E chords that follow instead highlight common tone relationships, creating an interesting ambiguity. I'm exploring the implications of these non-traditional resolutions, and their impact on the overall harmonic direction. The repeated use of G/F# also adds to the tension and pushes us to the G major key.


**Assessing Key Signatures**

Now, I'm analyzing the other chords within the sequence to confirm my hypothesis regarding the key of G major. Specifically, I'm checking to see if the Am, D/F#, G/F#, and Cmaj7/E chords fit the diatonic profile. It looks promising, with some potential for interesting coloristic choices.


**Revisiting Harmonic Direction**

Now I'm reassessing the role of the E in the bassline and its relationship to the F#dim chords, particularly in resolving the tension from the F# diminished chords. Considering the frequent presence of the Am/E chord, I'm examining how this specific chord shapes the overall tonal landscape. The repeated movement toward the E in the bassline suggests a possible cadence point.


**Identifying Overall Tonality**

My analysis now extends to the G/F# chord, and its role as a pivot point in this progression. The non-traditional resolution of the diminished chord, along with the consistent use of the G/F# chord, suggests a strong pull towards G major, though it does not explicitly land there. I'm noting the consistent bassline of F# that drives this harmonic motion.


**Assessing Key Signatures**

Now, I'm examining how the shared notes between the chords create a sense of cohesion within this progression, and how it might resolve (or not). The D/F# acts like a dominant, given the bassline. I'm exploring whether a more definitive resolution can be established.


**Re-examining Final Cadence**

I'm now focusing on the final F#dim chord. The lack of resolution creates a sense of incompleteness, reinforcing my decision about E minor. I'm exploring the implications this has for the overall composition and the effect the composer might have intended to achieve.


**Reassessing Pedal Tones**

I'm now investigating the relationship between the frequent occurrence of the F# diminished chord and the recurring F# in the bass. I am starting to suspect that this bass note might function as a pedal tone, and if so, how it affects the resolution of the diminished chords. The D/F# acts as a dominant chord, emphasizing the G key.




Based on a harmonic analysis of the chord progression, the key is **E minor**.

Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. Identifying the Notes and Chords

First, let's identify the notes in the primary chords of the progression:
*   **F#dim:** F# - A - C
*   **D/F#:** D - F# - A (with F# in the bass)
*   **Am/E:** A - C - E (with E in the bass)
*   **G/F#:** G - B - D (with F# in the bass)
*   **Cmaj7/E:** C - E - G - B (with E in the bass)

The collection of notes used (A, B, C, D, E, F#, G) perfectly fits the **E natural minor scale** (E-F#-G-A-B-C-D) and its relative major, **G major** (G-A-B-C-D-E-F#). This means the key is either G major or E minor.

### 2. Determining the Tonal Center (E minor vs. G Major)

While all the chords exist in both keys, the way they are used points strongly towards E minor as the tonic center.

Here's the chord analysis in the key of **E minor**:

*   **F#dim (F# - A - C):** This is the **ii°** chord. A diminished supertonic is common in minor keys.
*   **D/F# (D - F# - A):** This is the **VII** chord (a D major triad). It's built on the subtonic (the 7th note of the natural minor scale).
*   **Am/E (A - C - E):** This is the **iv** chord, the minor subdominant. Placing the tonic note **E** in the bass strongly reinforces the sense of E as the tonal center.
*   **G/F# (G - B - D):** This is the **III** chord (a G major triad), built on the mediant.
*   **Cmaj7/E (C - E - G - B):** This is the **VImaj7** chord. Again, the bass note **E** here acts as a pedal, anchoring the harmony to E minor.

### 3. Why Not G Major?

If the key were G major, the chords would be analyzed as:
*   **F#dim:** vii° (the leading-tone chord, which should resolve to G).
*   **D/F#:** V (the dominant chord).
*   **Am/E:** ii (the supertonic).
*   **G/F#:** I (the tonic).
*   **Cmaj7/E:** IV (the subdominant).

While these functions make sense, the progression never resolves to a stable, root-position G major chord. Instead, the harmony repeatedly emphasizes chords with E in the bass (`Am/E`, `Cmaj7/E`) and the F#dim is used relentlessly, creating a sense of tension and moodiness that is far more characteristic of a minor key. The progression ends on F#dim, leaving the listener hanging on the `ii°` chord of E minor, which is a classic way to create an unresolved, looping, or mysterious feeling.

### Conclusion

*   **Key:** **E minor**
*   **Mode:** **Aeolian (Natural Minor)**. The chords are derived directly from the E natural minor scale, with no alterations (like the raised 7th, D#, that would indicate harmonic minor).

The progression is tonally ambiguous by design, but the consistent use of E in the bass and the overall dark, unresolved mood make **E minor** the clear tonal center.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Hmm, this looks interesting. First, I need to recall what diminished chords typically do in music theory. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or as leading chords because of their instability.

Let me write down the chords again to visualize: F#dim appears a lot, followed by D/F#, then Am/E, G/F#, and Cmaj7/E. The repeated F#dim suggests it's pivoting around that chord. Diminished chords usually lead to chords a half step away. For example, F#dim might lead to G major or G minor since F# to G is a half step.

Wait, but here we have D/F#, which is D major in first inversion (with F# in the bass). D major has F# as its third, so D/F# makes sense. Then Am/E—A minor with E in the bass. That's A minor, so the chord is Am. G/F# is G major with F# in the bass, so the bass note is F#, which is the seventh of G7. But here it's written as G/F#, so it's probably a G major chord with F# in the bass, making it a first inversion? Wait, no—G major's root is G, so G/F# would be G major with F# as the bass note, which is the major seventh, but in standard notation, G/F# usually means G major chord over F# bass. Actually, F# is not part of G major (G-B-D), so G/F# might imply a G7 chord? Because G7 has F#. Oh, that's a key point. G7 is G-B-D-F#, so G/F# could be shorthand for G7 in third inversion, where F# is the bass note. That makes sense because F# is the seventh of G7. Similarly, D/F#—D major is D-F#-A, so D/F# is first inversion, which is common.

Looking at the progression: starting with F#dim, then D/F# (which is D major over F#). F#dim to D major—F#dim has notes F#-A-C-Eb (assuming fully diminished, so it's F#-A-C-Eb, but sometimes it's half-diminished, like F#m7b5, which would be F#-A-C-E). The progression uses F#dim repeatedly, so I need to clarify if it's fully dim or half-dim. In common practice, F#dim often refers to the fully diminished seventh chord, which is F#-A-C-Eb. But in modern contexts, especially in pop or rock, it might be the half-diminished (F#m7b5). However, given the context here, since it's resolving to D/F#, which has F# as the bass, it might be functioning as a passing chord.

Let me list the chords with possible resolutions:

- F#dim → D/F#: F#dim to D major. If F#dim is F#-A-C-Eb, then Eb could resolve down to D (in D major). But D major has D-F#-A, so A is common, C might resolve to B or D, but it's messy. Alternatively, F#dim might be acting as a secondary dominant or leading to G.

Wait, another approach: look for the tonic. The progression ends with Cmaj7/E, which is C major with E in the bass. Cmaj7 is C-E-G-B, so Cmaj7/E is first inversion. But then it ends with F#dim, which is unresolved. That's odd because progressions usually resolve to the tonic. Here it ends on F#dim, which is unstable, so it might be a loop. But the user might be presenting a repeating progression.

Also, notice the inversions: D/F#, Am/E, G/F#, Cmaj7/E. The bass notes: F# for D/F#, E for Am/E, F# for G/F#, E for Cmaj7/E. So bass alternates between F# and E. Interesting pattern—it's like a pedal point on E and F#, but alternating.

Bass notes: F# (F#dim), F# (F#dim), F# (D/F#), F# (D/F#), F# (F#dim), F# (F#dim), E (Am/E), F# (G/F#), F# (F#dim), F# (F#dim), F# (D/F#), F# (D/F#), F# (F#dim), F# (F#dim), E (Cmaj7/E), F#dim. Wait, no—the progression is: F#dim (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), D/F# (bass F#), D/F# (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), Am/E (bass E), G/F# (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), D/F# (bass F#), D/F# (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), F#dim (bass F#), Cmaj7/E (bass E), F#dim (bass F#). So bass alternates between F# and E in sections. Specifically, blocks of four F#-bass chords: F#dim twice, D/F# twice, then F#dim twice, then Am/E (E bass), G/F# (F# bass), then F#dim twice, D/F# twice, F#dim twice, Cmaj7/E (E bass), then F#dim.

This alternating bass on E and F# suggests that E and F# are important notes. F# is the leading tone to G, and E is the mediant in G major. But let's think about keys where F# is prominent.

Common keys: G major has F# as the leading tone. D major also has F#. F# minor has F# as tonic. But let's check chords.

First, assume the key is G major. Chords in G major: G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim. Oh! F#dim is the vii° chord in G major. That's a classic diminished chord—vii°7 in major keys is often used as a passing chord or leading to I.

In G major, F#dim is B-D-F#? Wait, no: vii° in G major is F#-A-C. But a fully diminished seventh would add Eb (for F#dim7), but in diatonic harmony, it's usually the half-diminished or just triad. However, in many contexts, especially jazz, dim chords are often fully diminished.

But in G major, the diatonic vii° chord is F#-A-C (diminished triad), and if extended to seventh, it would be F#-A-C-E (half-diminished, since E is the natural 7th from F# in G major scale). But F#dim7 would be F#-A-C-Eb, which is chromatic.

Now, looking at the progression: D/F#—in G major, D major is the V chord (since G: I=G, ii=Am, iii=Bm, IV=C, V=D, vi=Em, vii°=F#dim). So D is V, and D/F# is V6 (first inversion of V).

Am/E: A minor is ii chord in G major, and Am/E is ii6 (first inversion).

G/F#: G major is I, but here it's G/F#, which would be I6 if it were G major chord, but G major with F# bass—F# is not in the G major triad (G-B-D), so this can't be I6. Unless it's a different chord. If G/F# implies G7, then G7 is V7 in C major, but we're considering G major now. Wait, in G major, G7 is not diatonic; it would be a secondary dominant.

But in the progression, we have G/F#, which is listed as a chord. If it's G7 in third inversion (F# in bass), then G7 would be V7 of C, but if we're in G major, G7 is the tonic chord with a dominant seventh, which is common in blues or other styles but not pure diatonic.

Cmaj7/E: in G major, C major is IV, so Cmaj7 is IVmaj7, which is common.

And F#dim is vii°.

So let's map the chords to G major:

- F#dim = vii°
- D/F# = V6 (since D is V)
- Am/E = ii6
- G/F# = this is problematic. If it's G major chord with F# bass, but G doesn't have F#, so it's not a standard inversion. But if it's G7 (G-B-D-F#), then G7 is V7 of C, which is not in G major. However, in G major, G7 could function as a dominant to C, but C is IV in G, so it's a secondary dominant leading to IV. But that's possible.

Wait, the chord is written as G/F#, which in chord notation usually means a G chord with F# in the bass, so the chord is G major triad (G-B-D), bass F#. So it's not G7, because G7 would include F#. But the notation G/F# specifically indicates the bass note, so the chord quality is G major, over F# bass. That creates an F#-G-B-D voicing, which implies F#m7b5 or something else, but actually, it's a G major chord in first inversion? No—first inversion of G major would be B in bass (G/B), second inversion D (G/D), so G/F# is not a standard inversion; it's a non-chord tone in the bass.

This suggests that G/F# is actually functioning as a dominant chord. Specifically, G7/F# is G7 in third inversion, which is common as a leading chord to Am or other chords. But in the progression, it's followed by F#dim, which is unusual.

Let's step back. The repeated F#dim and the chords around it. F#dim appears between D/F# and Am/E sections.

Perhaps the key is E minor. E natural minor has G major, but F#dim—E natural minor: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D. So F# is the supertonic, which would be F#m, not dim. But in harmonic minor, E harmonic minor has D#, so chords are i=E, ii°=F#dim, III+=Gaug, iv=Am, V=B, VI=C, vii°=D#dim. In E harmonic minor, F#dim is ii°, which is a diminished triad (F#-A-C). Fully diminished seventh would be F#-A-C-Eb, but in harmonic minor, the seventh degree is D#, so F#dim7 would have Eb, which is enharmonic to D#, but not diatonic.

In E harmonic minor, F#dim is ii°, and it typically goes to G#dim or something, but let's see. D/F#—D major is not diatonic to E minor; diatonic would be Dm. Am is iv in E minor. G/F#—G major is III in E minor, but with F# bass, it's odd. Cmaj7 is VI in E minor.

This is getting messy. Another thought: the bass alternates E and F#, which are a half step apart. This is reminiscent of a circle of fifths movement or chromatic mediants, but let's list the root chords ignoring inversions.

Roots: F# (dim), F# (dim), D (maj), D (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), A (min), G (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), D (maj), D (maj), F# (dim), F# (dim), C (maj7), F# (dim).

So the root progression is: F#-F#-D-D-F#-F#-A-G-F#-F#-D-D-F#-F#-C-F#.

Notice that D to A is a fifth down (or fourth up), A to G is a whole step down, G to C is a fourth up. But the F# chords are pervasive.

Another angle: F#dim is often used as a substitute for D7, since F#dim is the upper structure of D7b9. D7 is D-F#-A-C, and D7b9 is D-F#-A-C-Eb, so the top three notes F#-A-C-Eb form F#dim7. So F#dim7 can function as a dominant chord leading to G. For example, F#dim7 → G.

In this progression, when F#dim is followed by D/F#, that might not fit, but D/F# is D major, which has F# in the bass. If F#dim is acting as a dominant to G, but here it's going to D, which is the V of G. So in G major: F#dim (vii°) → D (V), which is a common progression (vii° to V is less common than vii° to I, but possible).

Then D/F# to F#dim: that's V to vii°, which is unusual; usually vii° leads to I or V.

But let's see the sequence: F#dim -> D/F# (twice), then F#dim -> Am/E. If in G major, Am is ii, so F#dim (vii°) to Am (ii) is a common resolution (vii° to ii is rare; usually vii° goes to I).

Standard resolution for vii° is to I. For example, in G: F#dim -> G.

Here, we have F#dim followed by Am/E, which is ii. So F#dim -> ii. That's not standard.

Unless the key is A major or something else.

Try key of A major: chords are A, Bm, C#m, D, E, F#m, G#dim.

G#dim is the vii°, but here the dim chord is F#dim, which is not in A major.

Key of D major: chords D, Em, F#m, G, A, Bm, C#dim. So C#dim is vii°, not F#dim.

F#dim would be the III chord? In D major, F#m is iii, not dim.

Key of E major: E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim. So D#dim is vii°, F#m is ii.

Not matching.

Now, minor keys. D minor: D, Edim, F, G, A, Bdim, C. So Edim is ii°.

C minor: C, Ddim, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bbbim (usually Bbmaj) — diatonic diminished are ii° and vii°.

Let's try F# minor. F# natural minor: F#-G#-A-B-C#-D-E. So chords: i=F#m, ii°=G#dim, III=Am, iv=Bm, v=C#m, VI=D, VII=E.

But the progression has F#dim, which is not i; i is F#m.

F# harmonic minor: F#-G#-A-B-C#-D-E#. So chords: i=F#m, ii°=G#dim, III+=Aaug, iv=Bm, V=C# (major), VI=D, vii°=E#dim (which is enharmonic to Fdim).

Not matching.

E harmonic minor: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D#. So chords: i=Em, ii°=F#dim, III+=Gaug, iv=Am, V=B, VI=C, vii°=D#dim.

Here, F#dim is ii°, which matches the chord given.

In E harmonic minor, ii° is F#dim (F#-A-C), and it typically resolves to V (B) or III+ (Gaug), but let's see the progression.

The chords:

- F#dim: ii° in E harmonic minor

- D/F#: D major—in E harmonic minor, D is VI, so D major is VI. D/F# is VI with F# in bass. F# is the 3rd of D, so it's first inversion.

- Am/E: A minor—in E minor, iv is Am, so Am/E is iv with E in bass (first inversion)

- G/F#: G major—in E minor, III is G major (in natural minor), but in harmonic minor, III is augmented (G+), but here it's G major, which is borrowing from natural minor or melodic minor. G major is not diatonic to harmonic minor; harmonic minor has G natural (since scale has G natural, not G#). E harmonic minor scale: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D#. So G is natural, so triad on G is G-B-D? B is in the scale, D is natural? E harmonic minor: notes E,F#,G,A,B,C,D#. So G note, B note (since B is fifth), D# note. So triad on G would be G-B-D#, which is G augmented. But here it's G major (G-B-D natural), which is not diatonic. So it's likely borrowing from natural minor, where E natural minor has G natural, so G major is III. In E natural minor: E-F#-G-A-B-C-D, so triads: i=Em, ii=F#m, III=GM, iv=Am, v=Bm, VI=C, VII=D. So G major is III.

- Cmaj7/E: C major—in E natural minor, VI is C, so C major is VI. Cmaj7 is VI with seventh.

So let's map in E natural minor:

- F#dim: in natural minor, ii is F#m, not dim. So F#dim doesn't diatonic to natural minor.

In E natural minor, the ii chord is F#m, which is minor.

But here the chord is F#dim, which is diminished, so it suggests harmonic minor.

In E harmonic minor, ii° is F#dim, which fits.

D chord: in E harmonic minor, VI is C#? Wait no: E harmonic minor scale: E F# G A B C D#. So:

- i: E-G#? Wait, E harmonic minor: tonic E, intervals minor, minor, major, minor, major, diminished augmented? Standard: E harmonic minor: E (i), F# (ii°), G (III+), A (iv), B (V), C (VI), D# (vii°).

Roots:

- E: E G B → Em

- F#: F# A C → F#dim

- G: G B D# → G augmented

- A: A C E → Am

- B: B D# F# → B major

- C: C E G → C major

- D#: D# F# A → D#dim

So D major is not in E harmonic minor; the VI chord is C major, not D.

D natural minor: D Eb F G A Bb C. But not relevant.

Another idea: the progression might be in Dorian mode. Dorian on E: E F# G A B C# D. So chords: i=Em, ii=F#m, III=GM, IV=Am, v=Bm, VI=C, VII=D.

But F#dim isn't diatonic; ii is F#m.

The diminished chord suggests leading tone behavior, which in minor keys is when harmonic minor is used.

Perhaps the key is B minor. B harmonic minor: B C# D E F# G A#. Chords: i=Bm, ii°=C#dim, III+=Daug, iv=Em, V=F# (major), VI=G, vii°=A#dim.

F# major is V, but F#dim is not present.

Wait, what about G# minor? But F# is the major seventh, which is high.

Let's list the notes across all chords to find the key signature.

Chords:

- F#dim: typically F# A C Eb (if fully dim)

- D/F#: D F# A

- Am/E: A C E

- G/F#: G B D F#? Or G B D? If G/F#, and it's a major chord, then notes G,B,D with F# bass.

- Cmaj7/E: C E G B with E bass.

So collecting all notes: F#, A, C, Eb (from F#dim), D (from D), E (from Am/E and Cmaj7/E), G (from G and C), B (from D and G), and C from F#dim and Am.

Notes found: C, D, E, F#, G, A, B, and Eb.

Eb is a chromatic note. If Eb is present (from F#dim7), then it's a chromaticism.

In the key of D major, which has two sharps (F#, C#), we have Eb, which is outside. But if it's E minor, with one sharp (F#), Eb is also outside.

However, in harmonic minor, the vii° chord is diminished and includes the flat sixth scale degree. For example, in E harmonic minor, the scale has D#, but the ii° chord is F# A C, which has C natural (which is flat sixth relative to tonic? E scale: 1= E, 2=F#, 3=G, 4=A, 5=B, 6=C, 7=D#. So C is the minor sixth, which is natural in the scale.

In E harmonic minor, the notes are E, F#, G, A, B, C, D#. So C is diatonic (it's the sixth degree, which is natural in harmonic minor). So the note C is in the scale.

F#dim chord in E harmonic minor: F# (2), A (4), C (6). Yes, all diatonic. So F#dim (triad) is diatonic to E harmonic minor.

G chord: in E harmonic minor, the III chord is augmented (G-B-D#), but here it's G major (G-B-D). D natural is not in E harmonic minor; it has D#. So G major would require D natural, which is a borrowed note from natural minor.

Similarly, D major: in E harmonic minor, VI is C major, not D. D major would have notes D-F#-A. F# is in the scale (2nd degree), A is 4th, but D is not in E harmonic minor (which has D#). So D major is chromatic—it's the major V in E minor, but in harmonic minor, V is B major, not D.

Wait a minute—in E minor, the diatonic V chord is Bm (in natural minor) or B major (in harmonic minor). D major is not diatonic; it's the VI in C# minor or something.

Let's think differently. The chord D/F# has F# in bass, and it's D major. D major in the context of G major is V, as G major's V is D.

And F#dim is vii° in G major.

Am is ii in G major.

G is I in G major.

C is IV in G major.

So in G major:

- F#dim = vii° (diatonic diminished triad)

- D/F# = V6

- Am/E = ii6

- G/F# = this is the problem. If G/F# is meant to be G major with F# bass, but G major doesn't have F#, so it's an altered chord. But in the context, it might be a misinterpretation. Perhaps G/F# is indicating a G7 chord in third inversion, since G7 has F# as the seventh. In jazz notation, G/F# could imply G7/F#, which is common.

Similarly, Cmaj7/E is Cmaj7 in first inversion.

So let's assume that G/F# is G7/F#, meaning G dominant seventh chord with F# in the bass (which is the third inversion). This is common; for example, V7 in third inversion often leads to I or other chords.

In G major, G7 is not diatonic (diatonic V is D7), but G7 could be the tonic chord with a dominant seventh, which is used for color.

But let's see the progression in G major:

F#dim (vii°) → D/F# (V6): vii° to V is possible but not strongest. Usually vii° goes to I.

Then D/F# → F#dim: V to vii°, which is backtracking.

F#dim → Am/E (ii6): vii° to ii, which is unusual.

Am/E → G/F# (I7 if G7): ii to I, which is good, but G/F# here.

Then G/F# → F#dim: I to vii°, which is odd.

After that, it goes back to D/F#, etc.

Another idea: perhaps the key is A minor. A natural minor: A B C D E F G. Chords: i=Am, ii°=Bdim, III=C, iv=Dm, v=Em, VI=F, VII=G.

F#dim not present. A harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#. Chords: i=Am, ii°=Bdim, III+=Caug, iv=Dm, V=E (major), VI=F, vii°=G#dim.

Still no F#dim.

F# is not the root of diatonic chords here.

Let's look at the chord Cmaj7/E. Cmaj7 is C-E-G-B, so with E bass, it's first inversion. Cmaj7 typically functions as IV in G major or I in C, but here the progression has F#dim a lot, which points away from C major.

D/F#—D major over F# bass. D major is the I chord in D major, but D major's diatonic dim chord is C#dim, not F#dim.

Wait, in D major, F#m is iii, not dim.

Perhaps it's a modulation or borrowed chords.

Another approach: the F#dim is used as a passing chord between two chords a half step away. Diminished chords often serve to connect chords whose roots are a half step apart.

For example, F#dim can lead to G, as it's built on the leading tone of G.

In this progression, F#dim is followed by D/F#—not a half step (D is a minor third below F#). F# to D is a minor third down.

F#dim to Am: F# to A is minor third up.

Not helpful.

Perhaps the bass movement is more important. The bass alternates E and F#, which are very close.

E and F# are a whole step apart. In the bass, this suggests a pedal or ostinato on E and F#.

The root chords when bass is F#: F#dim, D major, G major (if G/F# is G chord)

Roots on E: Am, Cmaj7

So when bass is F#: roots F#, D, G

When bass is E: roots A, C

F# and E bass notes. So the harmony might be centered around chords that share these bass notes.

In key of D major: D's dominant is A, but here we have G.

Perhaps the key is G major, and the bass alternates between the fifth (D) and something—wait, F# is the third of D, etc.

Let's consider the following: the progression might be in G major, and the F#dim is vii°7, which is common in jazz and classical as a substitute for V7/vi or something, but let's see common functions.

F#dim7 chord: F# A C Eb

In key of G: F# is leading tone, so F#dim7 can be seen as vii°7.

vii°7 in G major is F#-A-C-Eb (if we consider harmonic major or just using Eb).

The notes of F#dim7 are all a minor third apart: F#-A-C-Eb.

This chord has dominant function and can resolve to G major (F#→G, A→G or B, C→B, Eb→D).

In the progression, F#dim does go to D/F# sometimes: D is D-F#-A.

So F# (root) → F# (bass of D/F#), A (third of F#dim) → A (fifth of D), C (fifth of F#dim) → ? D's notes are D-F#-A, so C might resolve down to B or up to C, but it's not in D. Eb might resolve to D (in D chord).

For example: F#dim (F#-A-C-Eb) → D (D-F#-A): Eb resolves to D, C might go to B (but B not in D), or C->C (suspended), but typically dominant resolution.

Standard: vii°7 to I: F#dim7 → G.

Here, it sometimes goes to D, which is V of G.

So vii°/V resolving to V: in G major, V is D, so vii° of V is C#dim, not F#dim.

F# is the leading tone of G, so vii° of I.

Not directly related to V.

But in some theories, vii° can lead to V as a variant.

Let's look at the sequence where it goes F#dim -> Am/E.

F#dim to Am: F#-A-C-Eb to A-C-E.

Common tones: A and C. Eb → E (half step up), F# → G or A? F# to A is major third.

Eb to E is a half step resolution, which is characteristic.

In fact, Eb is the seventh of G7, so F#dim7 contains notes that can resolve to Am: for example, as an applied vii° to Am.

Specifically, to go to Am, the leading tone would be G#dim7 for A minor, but F#dim7 is a half step lower.

F#dim7 to G would be direct, but to Am is a third away.

Another thought: in C major, F#dim would be the vii° of vii, but not helpful.

Wait, let's list all the root chords and see if there's a pattern:

The progression is: F#dim, F#dim, D, D, F#dim, F#dim, A, G, F#dim, F#dim, D, D, F#dim, F#dim, C, F#dim.

Grouping: (F#2 D2) (F#2 A G) (F#2 D2) (F#2 C) F#.

It's like a AABA song form but harmonic.

Notice that D, A, G, C are all major or minor chords in G major: D is V, A is not in key (Am would be ii), G is I, C is IV.

Am is ii in G major, which fits.

So chords in G major:

- D = V

- Am = ii

- G = I

- C = IV

F#dim = vii°

So the progression uses vii° to connect these diatonic chords.

For example: vii° (F#dim) can lead to I (G), but here it sometimes leads to V (D), or ii (Am).

In practice, diminished chords can be used flexibly.

Let's test a resolution:

- F#dim to D: as a passing chord. F#dim contains A and C, which are in D (D-F#-A), so it works.

- F#dim to Am: F#dim has A and C, which are in Am (A-C-E), so common tones.

- F#dim to G: F#dim has F# (leading tone to G), A (third of F, but for G it's the fourth), etc.

- F#dim to C: F#dim to C—F# to G (for C, it's the seventh? C is C-E-G, F# is tritone away).

In jazz, dim chords are often used as passing to major/minor chords a half step away, but here the resolutions are to chords a minor third or fourth away.

Another key insight: The chord F#dim is repeated frequently, and the progression has D/F# (which shares F#), so F# is a common tone in bass for most chords.

This suggests that the tonic might not be G, but somewhere else.

Consider the chord Cmaj7/E. Cmaj7 is a major seventh chord, often used as IV in G, or ii in Bb, but let's stay.

The cadence at the end: ... F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim.

Cmaj7 to F#dim. C to F# is a tritone, which is very strong. In fact, C7 would be the dominant of F, but here it's Cmaj7.

In the key of F# minor, C major is the V chord? F# minor: F# G# A B C# D E. So V is C# major, not C.

F natural minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb. Not relevant.

What if the key is D major? D major: D E F# G A B C#.

Chords: D, Em, F#m, G, A, Bm, C#dim.

C major would be a borrowed chord (from Dorian or something), Am is iv.

G is IV.

F#dim is not diatonic; it would be F#m.

Unless it's a chromatic chord.

Perhaps the key is A, and F#dim is a secondary leading tone.

Let's try functional analysis.

Assume the key is G major:

- F#dim = vii° (subtonic diminished)

- D = V

- Am = ii

- G = I

- C = IV

Progression could be vii° - V - vii° - ii - I - etc.

But the specific sequence: two F#dim, two D, two F#dim, then Am, G, two F#dim, two D, two F#dim, C, F#dim.

In G major, this makes some sense as a cycle: V (D) to I (G) but with lots of vii° decoration.

The cadence before the end: D, D, F#dim, F#dim, C, F#dim.

From D (V) to C (IV) is a backdoor cadence in jazz, often used to resolve to I. But here it goes to F#dim.

Backdoor progression is typically ii-V-I, but IV-VI-ii-V or similar.

In G major, C (IV) moving to D (V) is common, but here C is followed by F#dim.

C to F#dim: C to F# is tritone, which is the interval of a dominant resolution. Specifically, C7 would resolve to F, and F# is the flattened fifth of C7 (C7 has G-Bb-D-F, but if it's C7#5 or something). Wait, F# is the tritone from C (C to F# is six semitones).

The chord F#dim contains the tritone C-F# (enharmonic to F#-C), which is the same tritone as in C7 (Bb-F, but enharmonically F# is Gb, so C to Gb is the tritone).

So F#dim is the upper structure of C7b9: C7b9 is C-Eb-F#-Ab-Bbb(=A), so the notes Eb-F#-A-C form F#dim7 (F#dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb).

Yes! F#dim7 is equivalent to the dominant seventh flat nine chord of C (C7b9) without the root.

For example, C7b9 = C E G Bb Db (in thirds), but often spelled as C7b9 = C-Eb-F#-Bb, and the upper structure F#-A-C-Eb is F#dim7.

So F#dim7 functions as a dominant chord leading to C major.

Similarly, in the key of C, vii°7 is Bdim7, not F#dim.

But as a secondary dominant, F#dim7 can be the vii°7 of G, leading to G, or as the dominant of C, leading to C.

In this progression, we see F#dim resolving to Cmaj7 in the last part: ... F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E.

If F#dim is acting as C7b9 (without root), then it would lead strongly to C major.

Indeed, F#dim7 to C major: the resolution would be F#→G (but to C, it should be E to F or something). Wait:

F#dim7: F#-A-C-Eb

C major: C-E-G

Resolutions:

- F# → G (half step up to fifth of C)

- A → G or A → A (common tone)

- C → C or B

- Eb → D or E

The strongest resolution: Eb → D (to fifth of C), and F# → G (to fifth), but standard dominant resolution would have the third and seventh resolving: for C7, Bb-Eb resolve to A-D or something. But here, since it's functioning as C7b9, the Eb (b9) would resolve down to D, and the F# (#9 or b5) would resolve down to E or up to G.

In practice, F#dim7 is very commonly used as a substitute dominant chord leading to C major.

Similarly, earlier in the progression, we have F#dim leading to Am. If Am is the vi in C major, then F#dim could be the vii° of vi, but let's check:

In C major, vi is Am, and the vii° of vi would be G#dim. But F#dim is a half step lower.

F# to G# is a whole step, so not directly.

But if we consider Am, its leading tone is G#, so G#dim would lead to Am.

F#dim is related to D minor or something.

Back to the resolving to C: the progression ends with F#dim going to Cmaj7, which is strong evidence that C is a temporary tonic, and F#dim is the dominant of C.

Similarly, look at other cadences: when F#dim goes to G/F#. If G is the I in G major, but C is IV in G.

But if F#dim is dominant of C, then G would be V of C? In C major, G is V, so G7 would lead to C.

In the progression: Am/E -> G/F# -> F#dim.

Am to G: common pre-dominant to dominant.

G/F# is likely G7, as it has F# (the seventh), so G7 to C would be V7-I.

But here G7 goes to F#dim, which then goes to Cmaj7.

That makes sense: G7 (V7) -> vii° of C (which is Bdim) but here it's F#dim.

Wait, G7 to C, but the chord before C is F#dim.

In standard resolution, G7 -> C.

But if there's a passing dim chord: for example, G7 can go to Bdim (which is vii° of C) as a substitute, but Bdim and F#dim are different.

Bdim is B-D-F, F#dim is F#-A-C.

Not the same.

However, in some contexts, diminished chords can be used chromatically.

But the specific instance where F#dim resolves directly to C (as in the end: F#dim Cmaj7) suggests F#dim is the dominant of C.

Therefore, the progression is modulating or using C as a tonic at that point.

Given the repetitions, it's likely that the progression is in C major, with F#dim acting as the secondary dominant leading to C.

But F# is not diatonic to C major; C major has no sharps. F#dim is chromatic.

In C major, the vii° chord is Bdim, not F#dim.

So why F#dim?

F#dim7 is the vii°7 of G, but also equivalent to C7b9 (dominant of C).

So it's functioning as a V7b9 of C.

Similarly, earlier when it goes to D: D is not related to C directly. D in C major is V of V (since V of C is G, V of G is D).

So D major is V/V in C major.

And F#dim could be vii°/V/V or something.

Breakdown in key of C:

- C major: C Dm Em F G Am Bdim

Progression chords:

- F#dim: not diatonic; could be vii° of G, which is the V chord. So F#dim = vii°/V (vii° of G)

- D/F#: D major is V/V (since V of G is D)

- Am/E: Am is vi in C, so Am/E is vi6

- G/F#: G major is V in C, and G/F# is likely V7 (G7) in third inversion (since G7 has F#)

- Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 is I with seventh, first inversion

Ah! This makes sense.

In C major:

- G7 is the dominant chord (V7), which has notes G-B-D-F#

- Therefore, G/F# is G7 in third inversion (F# is the bass note)

- D major is V/V (secondary dominant), as it leads to G (the V)

- F#dim—specifically, F#dim7, which is enharmonically equivalent to the upper structure of C7b9, but in the context of V7, it's related. For the V/V (D major), the vii°/V/V would be C#dim7. However, F#dim7 is the vii°7 of G (V in C).

Let's clarify:

- In C major, V is G. The vii°7 of G (in its key) is F#dim7 (F#-A-C-Eb). So F#dim7 functions as vii°7/V, leading to V (G).

Standard progression: vii°7/V → V

e.g., F#dim7 → G

Which is exactly what we have: F#dim → G/F# (which is G7 or G major; if G/F# is G7, then it's vii°7/V → V7)

Similarly, D major is V/V (secondary dominant), leading to V (G).

V/V → V is a common progression: e.g., D7 → G

Here, D (major) → G7 (implied by G/F#)

And F#dim (vii°7/V) → G7

Also, the progression has parts where F#dim → Am. Am is vi in C, which is a common backdoor substitute, but vii°/V to vi isn't standard.

However, in the sequence: after G/F# (V7), we have F#dim, which might be a chromatic passing chord.

But let's map the whole thing to C major:

- F#dim: vii°7/V (of C, leading to G)

- D/F#: V/V

- Am/E: vi

- G/F#: V7 (G dominant seventh)

- Cmaj7/E: I

The progression can be seen as:

[vii°7/V - V/V] repeated with variations, then [vii°7/V - vi - V7 - vii°7/V], then back.

Specifically, the pattern is:

(F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F#) x2 but with interruption.

Breaking it:

1. F#dim (vii°7/V), F#dim (vii°7/V), D/F# (V/V), D/F# (V/V)

2. F#dim (vii°7/V), F#dim (vii°7/V), Am/E (vi), G/F# (V7)

3. F#dim (vii°7/V), F#dim (vii°7/V), D/F# (V/V), D/F# (V/V)

4. F#dim (vii°7/V), F#dim (vii°7/V), Cmaj7/E (I), F#dim (vii°7/V)

This shows that the primary key is C major, with G as the dominant, and D as the secondary dominant.

The F#dim chords are almost always acting as vii°7/V, leading to or from G (the V).

Exceptions: when it leads to D or Am.

- F#dim to D: vii°7/V to V/V. Is this a standard progression? vii°7/V typically leads to V, but V/V is the dominant of V, so it might not directly connect. However, F#dim7 and D7 share common tones (F#dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb; D7 = D-F#-A-C), so three common notes! Therefore, F#dim7 is enharmonically equivalent to D7b9 without the root: D7b9 = D-F#-A-C-Eb. So F#dim7 = {F#,A,C,Eb} which is the same as the upper four notes of D7b9. So F#dim7 functions as a rootless D7b9 chord.

Ah! That's critical.

So F#dim7 = D7b9 (without D root)

Therefore, anytime we see F#dim, it can be interpreted as a D7b9 chord, implying the dominant function to G (since D is V/V in C, but D7 is V7/V leading to G).

Similarly, when F#dim resolves to G, it's the dominant (of V) resolving.

When F#dim is followed by D/F#, that's D7b9 to D major—wait, D/F# is D major first inversion, so root D. Why would D7b9 go to D major? That doesn't make sense; dominants should resolve to the tonic.

But in the progression: F#dim → D/F#

If F#dim is D7b9 (no root), then D7b9 should resolve to G, not to D.

Unless it's a deceptive resolution or something else.

Perhaps the chord D/F# is a red herring—it might be functioning as a predominant.

Another resolution: F#dim7 to Am. If F#dim7 = G7b9 (wait, G7b9 has F# as third? G7b9 = G-B-D-F-Ab, so not matching).

F#dim7 is symmetrical and can resolve to four different keys, a minor third apart.

But in this context, the strongest resolutions are to G (after G/F# section) and to C (at the end).

Specifically, the last resolution: F#dim directly to Cmaj7, with no intervening G. If F#dim7 = C7b9, then it resolves to C.

And when it goes to G/F#, if G/F# is G7, then F#dim might not directly resolve to it.

Wait, the section: Am/E -> G/F# -> F#dim

Am to G: ii to I in G minor, but here it's probably ii-V in C: Am is vi, G is V, so vi-V is a backdoor to V-I.

Then G7 (as V7) to what? —> F#dim, which then goes to C.

But in a full cadence: G7 -> C.

Why insert F#dim? It could be a passing chord: G7 => F#dim7 (which is G7 with alterations) => C.

In fact, G7 can be altered to have raised fifth: G7#5 = G-B-D#-F, and D# is enharmonic to Eb, so G7#5 = G-B-Eb-F, but F#dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb, which shares Eb.

Not exactly, but chromatically it works.

The best fit is that the primary key is C major.

Evidence:

- Cmaj7/E is present, which is I.

- G is likely V (as G/F# suggests G7 dominant)

- D is V/V

- Am is vi

- F#dim functions as either vii°7/V (leading to G) or as C7b9 (leading to C)

In the progression, F#dim leads to both D and G and C and Am, but the strongest cadential motion is to C at the end.

Also, the chord Cmaj7/E is a resolution point.

Moreover, in the key of C, the progression makes sense with applied dominants.

Summary:

- The tonic chord is C major (evidenced by Cmaj7 as a resolution chord)

- F#dim acts as:

  - D7b9 (vii°7 of G, or V/V7) when resolving to G

  - C7b9 (vii°7 of C) when resolving to C

But since it resolves to C at the end, and Cmaj7 is the most stable chord presented (besides the dim chords, which are unstable), C is likely the tonic.

G/F# is G7 (V7), as F# is the minor seventh.

D/F# is first inversion of D major, which is V/V.

Am/E is vi in first inversion.

Thus, the key is C major.

Mode: Since all chords are major/minor as per diatonic in major scale, it's Ionian mode (major scale).

Confirmation:

- In C major:

  - D major: V/V

  - G major (with F# implying G7): V

  - Cmaj7: I

  - Am: vi

  - F#dim: chromatic, functioning as V7/V or V7b9 of C

The progression uses secondary dominants and a common diminished passing chord.

Therefore, key is C major.

Based on the chord progression you provided—**F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim**—I'll analyze the key and mode step by step. The progression heavily relies on functional harmony, chromaticism, and common jazz/pop chord substitutions. **The key is C major (Ionian mode)**, and here's why:

---

### **Key Evidence: C Major**
1. **Cmaj7/E as the Tonic Resolution**:
   - The chord `Cmaj7/E` (C major 7th in first inversion) appears near the end. This is a strong indicator of **C as the tonic (I chord)**, as major 7th chords like Cmaj7 are most stable and resolving when functioning as the "home" chord. The `/E` bass note (E) is the 3rd of Cmaj7, reinforcing its role as I.

2. **G/F# as the Dominant (V7)**:
   - `G/F#` is **G7 in third inversion** (G dominant 7th with F# in the bass). In C major, G7 is the **dominant chord (V7)**, which strongly pulls toward C (I). The `F#` in the bass is the minor 7th of G7 (G-B-D-F#), confirming its function as V7. This is not a diatonic G major chord (G-B-D) but a dominant 7th, essential for cadential motion.

3. **F#dim as a Leading-Tone Diminished Chord**:
   - `F#dim` is **F# diminished 7th** (F#-A-C-Eb), which functions in two critical ways in C major:
     - As **vii°7/V** (the leading-tone chord of G, the dominant key), resolving to G7 (V7). This is a standard chromatic passing chord toward the dominant.
     - As **C7b9 without the root** (a common substitution for dominant chords). For example:
       - C7b9 = C-Eb-G-Bb-Db, and its upper structure (Eb-G-Bb-Db) is identical to F#dim7 (enharmonically Gb-Eb-Bb-Db). Thus, F#dim7 here acts as a **V7b9/♭VI** leading to C (I), especially clear in the final cadence: `F#dim → Cmaj7/E`.

4. **D/F# as the Secondary Dominant (V/V)**:
   - `D/F#` is **D major in first inversion** (D-F#-A with F# in bass). In C major, D major is **V/V** (the dominant of G, which is V of C). It creates tension leading to G7 (V), reinforcing the C major tonal center. For example, `D/F# → G/F#` is a classic V/V → V progression.

5. **Am/E as the Submediant (vi)**:
   - `Am/E` is **A minor in first inversion** (A-C-E with E in bass). In C major, Am is **vi**, a diatonic pre-dominant chord. Its appearance fits naturally within C major harmony (e.g., vi → V → I).

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **G Major?**  
  F#dim is vii° in G major, and D/F# is V6. But `G/F#` (implied G7) would be tonic-dominant in G, yet the progression ends on `Cmaj7/E`, not G. G major also lacks the strong Cmaj7 resolution, making it less likely.

- **E Minor?**  
  F#dim is ii° in E harmonic minor, but D major (VI) and G major (III) are non-diatonic (harmonic minor requires G#dim/D#dim). The progression favors major chords (D, G, C) over minor, and **Am/E is vi in C**, not iv in E minor.

- **D Major?**  
  D/F# is I6, but F#dim isn't diatonic (D major has C#dim as vii°). Cmaj7 (IV) and Am (ii) don't resolve as convincingly.

- **A Minor?**  
  Am is i, but F#dim isn't diatonic (A minor has Bdim as ii°), and D major is not present in natural/harmonic/melodic minor.

**Key takeaway**: The progression orbits **C major** through clear dominant-to-tonic resolutions (G7 → C, F#dim → C), with secondary dominants (`D/F#` as V/V) and chromatic passing chords (`F#dim`) supporting C as the tonal center.

---

### **Mode: Ionian (Major Scale)**
- All diatonic chords (C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim) align with **C Ionian** (C-D-E-F-G-A-B).
- Chromaticism (F#dim, G7) is functional (secondary dominants/diminished substitutions), not modal mixture:
  - `F#dim` is a standard *vii°7/V* leading to G7 (V7).
  - `G/F#` is V7, not modal.
- **No characteristic mode signatures**:
  - **Dorian** would have F# (e.g., Bm Dorian), but here F# is chromatic (not a mode tonic).
  - **Mixolydian** would have Bb (G7 in C Mixolydian), but we have natural B (in Cmaj7).
  - **Lydian** would have F# (F# in C Lydian), but no F# in melody or harmony beyond the passing F#dim.

### **Progression Breakdown in C Major**
| Chord       | Function in C Major          | Role                                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **F#dim**   | **vii°7/V**                  | Leading tone to G7 (V7); also equivalent to C7b9 for direct V7→I pull. |
| **D/F#**    | **V/V (first inversion)**    | Secondary dominant leading to G7 (V).                                |
| **Am/E**    | **vi (first inversion)**     | Pre-dominant, setting up G7 (V).                                     |
| **G/F#**    | **V7 (third inversion)**     | Dominant 7th, pulling to C (I).                                      |
| **Cmaj7/E** | **I (first inversion)**      | Tonic resolution; the most stable chord in the progression.          |

**Cadential Flow**:  
- The structure uses **F#dim** as a pivot between V/V (D), V (G7), and I (C):  
  `...D (V/V) → G7 (V) → F#dim (chromatic passing) → C (I)...`  
- The final resolution `F#dim → Cmaj7/E` is unambiguous: F#dim7 is the classic V7b9 substitute for cadencing to C.

---

### **Why F#dim Appears So Frequently**
- It's a **symmetrical diminished chord** (intervals of minor 3rds: F#-A-C-Eb), making it harmonically flexible.
- In C major, it serves as:
  1. **vii°7 of G** (resolving to G7).
  2. **Upper structure of C7b9** (resolving to C).
  3. **Passing chord** between D and G (e.g., `D/F# → F#dim → G7` uses shared tones F#-A-C).
- Its repetition creates tension without fully resolving, typical in jazz/pop (e.g., Bill Evans-inspired harmony).

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **C major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian**  
- **Why**: The progression centers on C as the tonic (evidenced by Cmaj7), with G7 as V, D as V/V, and F#dim as a functional chromatic chord leading back to C. All elements align with C Ionian scale harmony, with no modal mixture or alternative tonic.

This progression is **common in jazz/pop** (e.g., Steely Dan, Radiohead) for its rich chromatic voice leading while firmly rooted in C major. If you have a melody or more context, I can refine this further!

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression you provided:

```
F#dim  F#dim  D/F#  D/F#
F#dim  F#dim  Am/E  G/F#
F#dim  F#dim  D/F#  D/F#
F#dim  F#dim  Cmaj7/E  F#dim
```

### Step 1: List the chords
First, identify the root and quality of each chord:
- **F#dim** = F# diminished (F# A C)
- **D/F#** = D major over F# in bass → D major chord (D F# A), bass = F#
- **Am/E** = A minor over E → Am (A C E), bass = E
- **G/F#** = G major over F# → G (G B D), bass = F#
- **Cmaj7/E** = C major 7 over E → Cmaj7 (C E G B), bass = E

So the chord roots are:
- F# (dim)
- D
- A
- G
- C

But the bass motion and harmonic function suggest we should look at the underlying key.

### Step 2: Look for Tonal Center
Although F#dim appears frequently, diminished chords are usually **passing** or **auxiliary**, not tonic. So F# is likely **not** the tonic.

Notice that several chords have **F# in the bass**:
- D/F# → D major with F# in bass → suggests F# might be a melodic or pedal tone
- G/F# → G major with F# in bass
- This F# in the bass across different chords suggests a possible **bass pedal point** on F#.

But the actual **chord roots** are: F#, D, A, G, C — which include diatonic chords from **C major** or **A minor**.

Let’s map out the chords:
- F#dim = F# A C → this is the **vii° of G major**, or **ii° of E minor**, but not diatonic to C major.
  - But wait: in **C major**, the diatonic chords are:
    - C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim
    - No F#dim here.

F#dim is not diatonic to **C major** — but it is diatonic to **G major** (where F#dim is vii°). But we have chords like **D major**, **G major**, **Cmaj7**, **Am**, which are major chords on D and G — both **not minor** in this progression.

So the presence of:
- D **major** (not Dm)
- G **major** (not Gm)
- C major
- Am

points toward **C major** as a key — **but D major is not diatonic** to C major (it would be Dm). So we have a **non-diatonic** D major chord.

Ah! This suggests **modal mixture** or **borrowing**, or possibly **mode** usage.

But here’s the clue: **F#dim** appears frequently and functions as a **passing chord** between D/F# and Am/E or similar.

Let’s analyze the bass line:
Bass notes:
- F#, F#, F#, F#
- F#, F#, E, F#
- F#, F#, F#, F#
- F#, F#, E, F#

So bass is mostly **F#**, with two instances of **E** (under Am and Cmaj7).

So perhaps it's a **pedal tone** piece with the bass holding or returning to **F#**, while chords change above.

But F# is **not** the root of a tonic chord — we never get an F# major or minor tonic.

Wait — perhaps this is in **E minor**?

Let’s check **E minor** (natural minor): E F# G A B C D

Diatonic chords in **E natural minor**:
- Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bdim, C, Dm

But we have:
- F#dim ✅
- D/F# — D major? But in E minor, D should be **minor**, not major.
- G/F# — G major ✅ (III in E minor)
- Am/E — Am ✅ (iv)
- Cmaj7/E — C major ✅ (VI)

So if **D were Dm**, it would fit E minor. But it's **D major** — so D major (D F# A) — F# is shared, but the **F natural** in Dm is raised to **F#**, which makes it **harmonic minor**?

Wait — in **E harmonic minor**, the scale is: E F# G A B C D#

→ D#dim is the ii° chord.

But we have **F#dim** (F# A C) — that’s **not** in E harmonic minor (F# would be F# A C#, not C natural).

So C natural → points back to **natural minor**.

But then D should be minor.

Hmm.

Alternative idea: **D major is borrowed?**

Wait — what if the key is **A minor**?

A natural minor: A B C D E F G
Diatonic chords:
- Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G

We have:
- F#dim? Not diatonic — A minor has no F#.
- D major? A minor has Dm.

No.

Wait — what about **C major**?

C major: C D E F G A B
Chords: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim

But we have:
- D major (not Dm)
- G major (G is major, OK)
- Cmaj7 (OK)
- Am (OK)
- F#dim? Not in C major.

But F#dim is enharmonically the **vii° of G**, and G is in C major.

So maybe **F#dim is being used as a chromatic passing chord** between G and Am? Or between D and Am?

Let’s look at the **voice leading**.

Try this example:
- D/F# → F# is bass
- Next chord: F#dim → moves to same bass, but chord changes from D (D F# A) to F#dim (F# A C)
  - So the D drops to C, the F# stays, A stays.
  - So it's like D/F# → F#dim = D → C in the upper voice.
  - Then back to D/F#? Yes — so likely, F#dim is a **passing chord** between D and D.

But sequence is:
F#dim → F#dim → D/F# → D/F#

That’s descending chromatic line in upper voice?

Let’s assign approximate root movement or voice leading.

Alternatively — maybe this is in **F# Phrygian**?

F# Phrygian: F# G A B C D E

Yes! That’s a possibility.

Let’s check:
- F# Phrygian scale: F# (1) G (2) A (3) B (4) C (5) D (6) E (7)

So scale degrees:
- i = F# minor
- But we have **F#dim**, which would be **i°** — not normal for Phrygian, which should have minor tonic.

But F#dim = F# A C → A is **minor third**, C is **diminished fifth** — so it's **diminished**, not minor.

In F# Phrygian, the tonic chord should be F# minor (F# A C#), not F# A C.

So **C instead of C#** → that’s not F# Phrygian.

We have C natural throughout — so C, not C#.

So the scale includes: F#, G, A, B, C, D, E

That’s **F# Locrian**? F# Locrian: 1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7
- F# G A B C D E → yes, that matches.

So **F# Locrian** is the 7th mode of **G major**.

Lochrian scale: F# G A B C D E

Chords diatonic to G major:

- F#dim (vii°) ✅
- D major? D major is **not** in G major — G major has **D minor**.

G major: G A B C D E F#
Diatonic vii° = F#dim ✅
But Dm, not D major.

But we have **D major** — again, D F# A → has F#, but **F# is not in D major chord as a harmonic root**.

Wait — **D/F#** is D major with F# in bass.

But **D major chord** is not in G major.

Wait — unless this is **modal mixture**.

Wait — what if the key is **B minor**?

B minor: B C# D E F# G A

No C natural — C# instead.

We have **C natural** in F#dim and Cmaj7 — so not B minor.

We have:
- F#dim (F# A C)
- D major (D F# A)
- Am (A C E)
- G (G B D)
- Cmaj7 (C E G B)

So all notes used: F#, A, C, D, G, B, E — that’s:
C D E F# G A B

That’s the **C Lydian** scale: C D E F# G A B

Yes!

### C Lydian: C D E F# G A B

Diatonic chords in C Lydian (mode of G major):
- I = C major ✅ (Cmaj7/E used)
- II = D major ✅ (D/F# used)
- iii = Em → but we have Em? No — we have F#dim and Am.

Wait — let’s build chords in C Lydian:

1. C E G → C major ✅
2. D F# A → D major ✅
3. E G B → Em — but we don’t use Em; we use F#dim and Am
4. F# A C → F#dim ✅
5. G B D → G major ✅
6. A C E → Am ✅
7. B D F# → Bdim — not used

So all chords in the progression are **diatonic to C Lydian**:
- D major = II
- F#dim = iv°
- Am = vi
- G = V
- Cmaj7 = I
- All fit

And the bass note F# appears because:
- D/F# = II with F# in bass (third of chord)
- F#dim = iv° chord
- G/F# = V with F# in third
- Am/E and Cmaj7/E = vi and I with E in bass

So the frequent **F# in bass** is not a tonic, but a **pedal tone** or **voice-leading device** — emphasizing the raised 4th (F#), which is characteristic of **Lydian mode**.

### Conclusion:

- **Key center**: **C**
- **Mode**: **Lydian**
- This is a **C Lydian** progression, emphasizing the #4 (F#) through bass pedal and the use of F#dim and D/F#.

The repeated F#dim functions as a **passing chord** between D/F# and Am/E or G/F#, exploiting the chromatic descending motion in inner voices (e.g. D → C → B), while maintaining F# in the bass.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key**: C  
**Mode**: **Lydian**  
**Tonal center**: C, with characteristic #4 (F#) creating the Lydian color.

Okay, the user gave me a chord progression: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at all the chords listed. The chords are F#dim, D/F#, Am/E, G/F#, and Cmaj7/E. The F#dim appears multiple times, which might be a clue. Diminished chords usually have specific roles, like leading tones or tensions. 

Let me list out each chord and see what notes they contain. Starting with F#dim. A diminished chord is typically root, minor third, diminished fifth. So F#dim would be F#, A, C. Wait, F# to A is a minor third (3 semitones?), no, F# to A is actually a minor third? Let me check: F# to G is 1, G to G# is 2, G# to A is 3? Wait, no. F# to A# is major third (4 semitones), but F# to A would be minor third (3 semitones). Yes, because F# to G is 1, G to G# is 2, G# to A is 3. So F#dim is F#, A, C. Because diminished fifth from F# would be C. F# to C is an augmented fourth? Wait, no. F# to C# is perfect fifth (7 semitones), but if it's diminished fifth, then it's a tritone. Wait, diminished fifth is the same as augmented fourth. So F#dim chord has root F#, minor third A (since F# to A is 3 semitones: F#-G-G#-A), and diminished fifth would be from F# to C, which is 6 semitones (F#-G-G#-A-A#-B-C), yes, that's a tritone. So F#dim: F#, A, C.

Now D/F#. That's a D major triad with F# in the bass. So D major is D, F#, A. So D/F# would be F#, A, D. Which is a D major chord in first inversion.

Then Am/E. A minor with E in the bass. A minor is A, C, E. So Am/E would be E, A, C. So bass note E.

G/F# is G major with F# in the bass. G major is G, B, D. So G/F# would be F#, G, B, D? Wait, but typically when writing a slash chord, it's the bass note and the chord above. So G/F# would be F# as bass, then G major triad, so F#, G, B, D. But sometimes written as F#sus4 or something? Wait, maybe it's a G7 chord without the G? No, G major over F# bass. So the chord would be F#, G, B, D. But let's see the notes: F# is the root, then G (major second), B (major third?), wait no. F# to G is a whole step, G to B is minor third? Wait, F# as bass note. The chord above it is G major. But G major is G, B, D. So when you put F# in bass, the notes are F#, G, B, D. So the intervals from F#: minor second (G), major third (B), perfect fifth (D). But that's actually a G major chord with F# in bass. Alternatively, this could be seen as F# minor 7 flat 5? But maybe not.

Then Cmaj7/E. C major 7 with E in bass. Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. So Cmaj7/E is E, C, G, B. So the bass is E.

Now the progression has repeated F#dim, D/F#, etc. Let me list all chords in the progression:

F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Am/E, G/F#, F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Cmaj7/E, F#dim.

So the chord sequence is:

1. F#dim

2. F#dim

3. D/F#

4. D/F#

5. F#dim

6. F#dim

7. Am/E

8. G/F#

9. F#dim

10. F#dim

11. D/F#

12. D/F#

13. F#dim

14. F#dim

15. Cmaj7/E

16. F#dim

Hmm. Now, to figure out the key and mode. Let's see what the roots are. The chords have roots F#, D, A, G, C. So F#, D, A, G, C. Also, the bass notes: for D/F# the bass is F#, Am/E bass is E, G/F# is F#, Cmaj7/E is E. So bass notes are F#, D (but D/F# has bass F#), Am/E bass E, G/F# bass F#, Cmaj7/E bass E.

Let's list all the chords in terms of their root notes, ignoring inversions for a moment. So:

F#dim → root F#

D/F# → D major triad

Am/E → A minor triad

G/F# → G major triad

Cmaj7/E → C major 7th

So the main chords present are F#dim, D major, A minor, G major, C major 7. So the chord roots are F#, D, A, G, C.

What key has these chords? Let's see. Common keys. If we have F#dim, which is a diminished chord. Diminished chords often appear as the vii° in major keys, but F#dim would be vii° of G major, because in G major the leading tone is F#, and vii° is F#, A, C. Yes! G major has the notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So F#dim chord is vii° of G major. Let's check.

G major diatonic chords:

I: G

II: A minor

III: B minor

IV: C major

V: D major

VI: E minor

VII: F# diminished

Yes! Exactly. So F#dim is the vii° chord of G major. Then D major is V chord in G major. A minor is II chord. C major is IV. E minor would be VI, but here we have Am/E and Cmaj7/E. Cmaj7/E is C major seventh, which would be IV maj7 in G major. A minor is the ii chord. But wait, in G major, the ii is A minor. But here we have Am/E, which is A minor triad with E bass. So root A, but bass E. So the bass is E, which is the 6th note of the G major scale. Wait, but the chord itself is A minor, so the notes are A, C, E. So Am/E is E, A, C. Which is still the same as Am. Similarly, Cmaj7/E is E, C, G, B. Which is Cmaj7 with E in bass.

Now, looking at this: if we have a chord progression where the main chords are F#dim, D, A minor, C major, then G major seems possible. Let's check the key of G major. The scale is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. All the chords mentioned fit here.

Wait, but the user also has a Cmaj7. In G major, the IV chord is C major. But Cmaj7 would be a bit more extended, but it's still part of the key since it's diatonic. Cmaj7 in G major is IVmaj7, which is built on the 4th degree. Yes, C, E, G, B. Since the G major scale has B (as the leading tone), so B is present. So yes, Cmaj7 is diatonic to G major.

Now, the Am chord is the ii chord in G major. D is the V chord. So the progression alternates between F#dim (vii°), D (V), then Am (ii), then G (but wait, where is the G major chord? Let's see. The progression doesn't actually have a G major chord. Wait, let's check the given chords again. The chords listed are F#dim, D/F#, Am/E, G/F#, Cmaj7/E. Wait, G/F# is a chord that has G as the top note, but the bass is F#. So the chord is G major with F# bass. But in G major, the I chord is G. However, here G/F# would be G major chord but with F# in bass. But G major chord is G, B, D. So G/F# would be F#, G, B, D. Which is actually the same as D7? Wait no. D7 is D, F#, A, C. But here it's F#, G, B, D. Wait, that's a different chord. Wait, F#, G, B, D. Let's see. F# to G is a minor second. G to B is major third. B to D is minor third. So that's F# sus2 or something? Wait, but F# minor add9? No. Alternatively, perhaps it's an F#m7b5 chord? Let's see. F#m7b5 would be F#, A, C, E. But here we have F#, G, B, D. So no. Alternatively, it's a G major chord with F# as bass. But G major has notes G, B, D. So with F# added as bass, it's F#, G, B, D. So the chord is Gsus4? No, because Gsus4 would be G, C, D, but here we have F#. Hmm. Alternatively, it's a D major seventh? D major 7 is D, F#, A, C#. But here we have F#, G, B, D. That's different. Wait F#, G, B, D. Let's see intervals:

F# (root), G is a major second, B is a major third (F# to B is 6 semitones? Wait F# to G: 1, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, A# to B:5. Wait no, F# to B is a perfect fourth (5 semitones: F#-G-G#-A-A#-B). Wait, no. F# to G: 1 semitone, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, A# to B:5. Wait, F# to B is a perfect fourth (5 semitones). Then B to D is minor third (3 semitones: B-C-C#-D). So F#-G-B-D. So the notes are F#, G, B, D. So this is a chord that can be named as G major with F# bass, or maybe F#m7? No. F#m7 would be F#, A, C, E. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a D major triad with an added G? Not sure. Wait, perhaps this is a different key.

Wait, but maybe the key is G major, and G/F# is a G chord in first inversion? Wait, the standard inversions for G major. Root position G, B, D. First inversion B, G, D. Second inversion D, G, B. But G/F# would be bass F#. So that's not a standard inversion of G. So F# isn't part of G major chord. So G/F# would have notes F#, G, B, D. So the chord includes F#, which is the leading tone of G, but G major chord doesn't include F#. So that's a problem. So that would mean that the chord G/F# is not part of the G major scale. Because the scale of G has F#, so F# is present. But G major chord is G, B, D. So adding F# as the bass note would mean the chord has F#, G, B, D. So that's actually a G major chord but with an added F#? No, wait, G major chord is G, B, D, so if you have F# as the bass, then F#, G, B, D. So the notes are F#, G, B, D. Which in terms of the scale of G major, F# is the leading tone. So F# is in the scale. So this chord would have all the notes of the scale, but the chord is built on G with F# in bass. Hmm, but how does this fit into the key?

Alternatively, maybe the key is not G major. Wait, but the F#dim chord. In G major, vii° is F diminished, but F# is the leading tone. Yes. F#dim is vii°. So if the key is G major, then:

- F#dim is vii°

- D major is V

- Am is ii

- C major is IV

But what's the chord G/F#? If we have a chord that has bass F# and the notes G, B, D. So the chord is F# as bass, then G, B, D. So the chord would be F#sus4(add9)? Wait, let's see. From F# base, the notes are F# (root), G (1 step), B (minor third?), but F# to B is a perfect fourth (5 semitones). Hmm. Alternatively, in the context of G major, this might be a G7 chord? But G7 is G, B, D, F, but here it's F# instead of F. So that would be G7#9 or something, which is not diatonic. Hmm. Maybe this isn't G major.

Wait, perhaps another key. Let's look at the other chords. The progression has Am/E, which is A minor with E in bass. A minor is A, C, E. So Am/E would have notes E, A, C. Which is the same as E7? No, E7 is E, G#, B, D. So no. But if we have E note in bass, A and C, then the chord is A minor. So that's fine.

Cmaj7/E: notes E, C, G, B. In G major, Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. So yes, diatonic. And E is the 6th note of G major. So that's okay.

Wait, but the chord G/F# is F#, G, B, D. In G major scale, these notes are all present: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. Yes, all four notes are in G major. So G/F# chord is a type of G chord, but actually the note F# is part of G major. So the chord is F#, G, B, D. Which could be considered as a variant. But what's the chord? If you take the bass as F#, then the notes F#, G, B, D. So the intervals from F#: 1st (F#), then G (major 2nd), B (major 3rd? Wait F# to B is a perfect fourth: 5 semitones. Wait:

F# to G: 1 semitone

F# to A: 2 semitones (but A isn't in the chord here)

F# to B: 3 semitones? Wait F#-G-G#-A-A#-B. Wait no: F# → G is 1, G → G# is 2, G# → A is 3, A → A# is 4, A# → B is 5. So F# to B is 5 semitones, which is a perfect fourth. Then F# to D is F# → G (1), G# (2), A (3), A# (4), B (5), C (6), C# (7), D (8). So F# to D is 8 semitones, which is a minor 7th. Hmm. So F#, G, B, D. So intervals from F#: 2nd, 5th (if you count up to B?), not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a G major chord with an added F# but it's not standard. Alternatively, think of it as F# minor 7 flat 5? No, that would be F#-A-C-E. Not matching. Alternatively, it's a D major chord with a G? D major is D, F#, A. Adding G would make it Dmaj7? No, D major 7 is D-F#-A-C#. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the chord is actually meant to be a D chord with G? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the key is A minor. Let's consider the key of A minor. A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. But wait, F#dim is F#, A, C. In A minor, F# isn't diatonic. Because A natural minor has F natural. So F# would be an accidental. However, if it's A harmonic minor, then the 7th is G#, but still, F# would be in the scale? Wait, A harmonic minor is A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. So F is natural. So F# isn't in A harmonic minor either. So F# would have to be an accidental. But F#dim chord has F#, which isn't in A minor's natural scale. If A minor, then the diatonic diminished chord would be Bdim (B, D, F), but here we have F#dim, which is different. So probably not A minor.

Another possibility: E minor. Let's check E natural minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Diatonic chords: i: E minor, ii: F#dim, III: G major, IV: A minor, V: B minor, vi: C major, vii: D major. Wait, E natural minor's diatonic chords:

i: Em (E, G, B)

ii°: F#dim (F#, A, C)

III: G (G, B, D)

IV: Am (A, C, E)

v: Bm (B, D, F#)

vi: C (C, E, G)

VII: D (D, F#, A)

Ah! So in E natural minor, the F#dim chord is the ii° (supertonic diminished). And then, in the progression given, there's F#dim repeated, D/F#, Am/E, etc.

Let's see. If the key is E minor, then the diatonic chords include:

- F#dim as ii°

- D major is VII chord

- Am is IV chord

Wait, in E natural minor, the IV chord is A minor. Yes. So Am is IV.

Then D major (D, F#, A) is VII chord.

Then what about G major? G would be III chord in E minor.

So let's see the progression with E minor as key:

F#dim (ii°), D/F# (D major chord with F# bass), which is VII chord. D/F# is D major triad but with F# bass. D major's notes are D, F#, A. So D/F# would be F#, A, D.

Am/E: A minor with E bass. Am is IV chord (A, C, E), so Am/E would be E, A, C.

G/F#: G major with F# bass. G major in E minor is III chord (G, B, D). So G/F# would be F#, G, B, D. Which would be the same as before.

Cmaj7/E: C major with E bass. C is the vi chord in E minor. Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. Which in E minor is vi maj7, but diatonic? In natural minor, C is major, so C major is diatonic. Cmaj7 would still be diatonic as C, E, G, B. Since all the notes are in E natural minor scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

Yes, the E natural minor scale (Aeolian mode):

E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

So in this key:

- ii°: F#dim (F#, A, C)

- VII chord: D major (D, F#, A)

- IV chord: Am (A, C, E)

- III chord: G major (G, B, D)

- vi chord: C major (C, E, G)

So looking at the given chords:

F#dim → ii°

D/F# → D major triad, which would be VII chord. D/F# is D major with F# bass.

Am/E → Am chord with E bass, which is IV chord.

G/F# → G major with F# bass, which is III chord.

Cmaj7/E → Cmaj7 with E bass, which is vi maj7.

So all of these chords are diatonic to E natural minor (Aeolian mode). Let's check each one:

- F#dim: F#, A, C. E minor scale has all those notes.

- D major: D, F#, A. Yes, in E minor.

- Am: A, C, E. Yes.

- G major: G, B, D. Yes.

- Cmaj7: C, E, G, B. Yes, since E minor scale has C, E, G, B (as in the C major triad plus B natural, which is the 7th? Wait, Cmaj7 in E minor: C major seventh would be C, E, G, B. Since B is part of the E minor scale (E, F#, G, A, B, C, D), yes. Because natural minor has B as the major 7th? Wait, no: E natural minor is E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. So the 7th of the scale is D, no. Wait, scales: root is E. The natural minor scale has the 7th degree as D. Wait, no. Let's list:

E (1), F# (2), G (3), A (4), B (5), C (6), D (7).

But in natural minor, the 3rd is minor, 6th and 7th are minor too? Wait, natural minor is the same as Aeolian mode, so:

Root: E

M2: F#

m3: G

P4: A

P5: B

m6: C

m7: D

So in natural minor, yes, the 7th is minor (D). So in the scale, the notes are E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

So the chord C major: C, E, G. In E minor, C is the 6th degree, and is major. Yes. Cmaj7 would be C, E, G, B. Yes, B is in the scale (5th degree), so the seventh of Cmaj7 is B, which is diatonic.

Similarly, G major chord is G (root), B (3rd), D (5th). G is III degree. In E minor, the III chord is major. Yes. B is the 5th degree. D is the 7th.

F#dim chord: F#, A, C. F# is 2nd, A is 4th, C is 6th.

D major chord: D (7th degree), F# (2nd), A (4th). But the VII chord in E minor is D major (since the 7th is D, so D major).

So yes, all chords fit into E natural minor.

Now, what about the chord G/F#? G/F# would be G major with F# bass. G major is G, B, D. So G/F# would have notes F#, G, B, D. In E minor's scale, all these notes are present. F# (2), G (3), B (5), D (7). Yes. So that chord is in the key.

Similarly, D/F#: D major chord with F# bass. D major is D, F#, A. Bass F#, so F#, A, D. Which in E minor is F# (2), A (4), D (7). So that chord would be the VII chord, but with F# bass. That's a bit unusual, but it's within the key.

Then Am/E: Am is A minor with E bass. A is IV, E is root. So Am/E has E, A, C. Which fits.

Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 with E bass → E, C, G, B. Which are E (root), C (6), G (3), B (5). All in scale.

So all chords fit into E natural minor.

But wait, when looking at the key, E natural minor would be the same as G major (relative major). Because E minor is the relative minor of G major. So they share the same notes. So whether you consider this as E minor or G major, it depends on the tonal center.

But the question is to determine key and mode. So if the progression is centered around E minor, then it's in the Aeolian mode of G major, which is E minor.

But the user asks for key and mode. So key of E minor, mode Aeolian.

However, another thought: sometimes when there's a leading tone, like F#, it might be in harmonic minor. But in the given chords, there's no G# or anything. The F#dim chord has F#, A, C. If it were harmonic minor, the 7th would be D#, but in E harmonic minor, the scale is E, F#, G, A, B, C, D#. So if it were harmonic minor, the V chord would be B major (B, D#, F#). But in the current progression, the only chords with a B note are in G/F# (B present), but it's not a V chord. The VII chord would be D major, but in harmonic minor, the VII chord would be D# diminished. But since D is major here, it's more likely natural minor.

Also, there's no G#, so harmonic minor is unlikely. So natural minor.

But also, the presence of F#dim as ii° chord is diatonic to both E minor and G major. So the key could be G major or E minor. But which one is the tonal center?

Looking at the chord progression. Typically, the tonal center is the note that feels like "home". In this progression, what could be the tonic? The chord that is most prominent as the home chord. The progression starts with F#dim, then D/F#, then F#dim again, etc. The last chord is F#dim. Not sure. Let's see the structure.

Let me see how the chords resolve. For example, in a typical progression for E minor, the VII chord (D) often leads to tonic Em. But here, the progression has a lot of F#dim chords. F#dim is the ii° chord, which can lead to chords like vii° to I or other functions.

Wait, in the E minor key, the ii° chord (F#dim) can lead to iii chord (G) or iv (Am), but also it can resolve to tonic.

But let's see the given progression. It's repeating F#dim, then D/F#, repeating, then Am/E, G/F#, then repeats etc. Let's list the order:

F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Am/E, G/F#, F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Cmaj7/E, F#dim.

So the progression starts with F#dim twice, then D/F# twice, then F#dim, F#dim, then Am/E, G/F#, etc. If the tonal center were G major, then the chords would be:

I: G

ii: Am

iii: Bm

IV: C

V: D

vi: Em

vii°: F#dim

But in this progression, we don't see G major anywhere. The chords are F#dim, D, Am, C, etc. So if the progression were in G major, the vii° chord (F#dim) would typically lead to I (G), but in the progression given, there's no G chord at all. Unless G/F# is part of it. But G/F# is F#, G, B, D. If the key were G major, then F# is the leading tone. But the chord is F#, G, B, D. So maybe that's a Gmaj7 chord? Because Gmaj7 is G, B, D, F. Wait, no. Gmaj7 has F#, no. Wait, G major seventh is G, B, D, F#. Oh! Yes! Gmaj7 has F#. So Gmaj7 is G, B, D, F#.

Wait, if the chord is written as G/F#, then that would be Gmaj7 with F# in bass. But if the bass note is F#, then the chord is F#-G-B-D, which is Gmaj7. Because Gmaj7 notes are G, B, D, F#. So inverting it so that F# is bass. So F#-G-B-D would be a Gmaj7 in second inversion. Because a Gmaj7 chord in root position is G, B, D, F#. First inversion would be B, D, F#, G. Second inversion D, F#, G, B. Third inversion F#, G, B, D.

Ah yes! So G/F# is a Gmaj7 chord in third inversion. So bass F#, chord notes F#, G, B, D. So that's Gmaj7.

Similarly, Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 chord in first inversion. Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. With E bass. So the slash chord notation here makes sense.

D/F#: D major chord in first inversion. D major is D, F#, A. So D/F# would be F#, A, D.

Am/E: Am is A, C, E. With E in bass. So E, A, C. Which is Am in first inversion.

Okay, so in the key of G major, all the chords mentioned fit as diatonic chords. Let's check:

- F#dim: vii° chord, yes.

- D (D major): V chord

- D/F# is same chord

- Am: ii chord

- Am/E same chord with inversion

- Cmaj7: IVmaj7, but in G major, IV chord is C major; Cmaj7 is still diatonic. C, E, G, B. All in G major scale.

- G/F# is Gmaj7 third inversion.

Yes, all fit into G major. But the key here is that there is a G major chord in the form of Gmaj7. However, in the given progression, the chord labeled G/F# has notes F#, G, B, D. Which is exactly Gmaj7. So the key could be G major.

But wait, the chord progression does not have any G major root chords, just Gmaj7 in inversion. The only instance of G note is in G/F# and Cmaj7/E.

So if the key were G major, the tonic is G. But in the progression, we never actually get to play a root position G chord. The Gmaj7 is played in inversion. However, that's not uncommon. Chords can be inverted to create bass lines.

Alternatively, the key could be E minor. Let's check again.

In E minor, the chords:

- Cmaj7 is vi maj7

- G is III maj

- D is VII maj

- Am is IV minor

- F#dim is ii dim

But the E note is present as bass in Am/E and Cmaj7/E. Am/E has E in bass, Cmaj7/E also has E in bass. That might indicate that E is the tonic, since it's prominent in the bass notes.

Similarly, in the progression, Am/E and Cmaj7/E both have E in bass. If the tonic is E, then having E in bass for Am and C chords would make sense as subdominant and vi chords.

But let's see. If the key is E minor, the tonic is E. Then the progression would feel resolved on E. But in the given chord progression, I don't see any E chords. E minor chord would be E, G, B. But the chords given are F#dim, D/F#, Am/E, etc. The chord Am/E has E in bass but it's an A minor chord. No actual Em chord present.

Similarly, in the key of G major, there's no G chord root position either. But there is a Gmaj7 chord in inversion.

Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's list all chords in the key of G major:

- I: G major

- ii: Am

- iii: Bm

- IV: C major

- V: D major

- vi: Em

- vii°: F#dim

So all chords here are in G major. The progression includes F#dim (vii°), D major (V), Am (ii), C (IV), and Gmaj7 chord.

But since the Gmaj7 is part of the progression (as G/F#), and the tonic could be G major, where Gmaj7 is the I chord.

However, in the progression provided, the actual chords listed don't include root position G major; it's only Gmaj7 in inversion. But that's still part of the key. So the key could still be G major.

Similarly, if the tonic is G, then the VII chord (F#dim) typically leads to I. But in this progression, it's used a lot. Let's see the structure: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# etc. So after F#dim chords, we go to D/F# (V), then to Am/E (ii), then G/F# (I), but inverted. So it's like vii°, V, ii, I. That seems like a progression that resolves to I.

But the progression ends with F#dim again. Let me count the exact sequence:

The progression given is:

F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim

So let's group them. First 2 bars F#dim twice. Then two D/F# repeats. Then F#dim twice. Then Am/E, G/F#. Then repeats the same: F#dim twice, D/F# twice, F#dim twice, Cmaj7/E, F#dim.

So in the final part: F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim.

If in G major, Cmaj7 is the IV chord. So a progression that has IV might move to V or something. But not sure.

Alternatively, if considering the tonic as E minor. Then the E minor scale has the same notes. The tonic chord Em: E, G, B. The Am chord (IV) would have E in bass as Am/E. That could be seen as the subdominant with E in bass. Similarly, Cmaj7/E has E in bass. If the mode is Aeolian (E minor), then having E in bass for other chords makes sense, but the tonic chord isn't present.

But typically, the tonal center is inferred from the chords that function as tonic. If there's no Em chord at all in the progression, then maybe the key is G major. Because G major has a I chord which is G, and if there's a Gmaj7 chord, which is part of the tonic chord family.

Another perspective: the F#dim chord is a diminished triad that typically functions as a leading tone chord. In major keys, it's the vii°, so it wants to resolve to I. If the resolution is to G major (I), then the tonic is G. But in the progression, after some steps it goes to G/F# which would be Gmaj7 chord. So perhaps when the progression goes to Gmaj7, that's acting as the tonic.

But in the given chords, G/F# appears only once in the middle. Let's see the sequence:

After the first part: ... Am/E G/F# ...

Then the next part: ... Cmaj7/E ...

So if the key is G major, then Am/E is ii chord with E bass, G/F# is I chord (Gmaj7 inversion), then Cmaj7/E is IV chord. Which would be like ii → I → IV, but not sure. Maybe a common progression.

Alternatively, in E minor, the Am/E would be IV chord with E in bass, and Cmaj7/E is vi chord with E in bass. So if the tonic is E, then Cmaj7/E has the tonic in bass for the vi chord. Hmm, possible.

But the presence of Gmaj7 chord. If the key is G major, Gmaj7 is the I chord. So it's the tonic. If it's in E minor, Gmaj7 would be III chord.

But how to decide which key?

Another way: look for the bass notes. The bass line could indicate the root movement. Let's extract the bass notes:

For F#dim: root is F#, but usually diminished chords have root in bass usually, unless specified. But the way it's written "F#dim"—probably root position, so bass F#.

Similarly, D/F# means D chord with F# in bass.

So the bass notes for each chord:

1. F#dim → bass F#

2. F#dim → F#

3. D/F# → F#

4. D/F# → F#

5. F#dim → F#

6. F#dim → F#

7. Am/E → E (since it's slash chord E)

8. G/F# → F#

9. F#dim → F#

10. F#dim → F#

11. D/F# → F#

12. D/F# → F#

13. F#dim → F#

14. F#dim → F#

15. Cmaj7/E → E (since slash chord E)

16. F#dim → F#

So the bass notes are mostly F#, with occasional E. So the bass line has a lot of F# and E. So it's moving between F# and E. If the tonic chord is Em, the bass would often be E, but here the bass note E occurs only twice (in Am/E and Cmaj7/E), and otherwise F#. If the key were G major, then the bass F# repeated suggests that F# is a prominent note, but maybe the tonic is still G.

Alternatively, if the key is G major, the bass line of F# and E could be part of the bass movement. The E is the vi chord (Em), but there's no Em chord, but the Am/E has E in bass. Hmm.

Another idea: the F#dim chord is the vii° in G major. So that chord typically resolves to G. If there's a resolution to G chord, that would confirm G major. But in the progression given, G/F# is present, which is Gmaj7. So if the Gmaj7 is the tonic chord, then yes.

But if the tonic is E minor, then the F#dim is ii° chord, which would typically resolve to iii chord (G major). And in the progression, we do have G/F# which would be G major. So if after the F#dim chord, it goes to G, that would be resolved.

For example: vii° (F#dim) in E minor typically leads to iii (G). In the progression, F#dim followed by G/F# (which is G major), so that fits.

Similarly, in the G major key, vii° should resolve to I (G), which is happening as F#dim → Gmaj7.

So both possibilities could be correct, but which one has stronger evidence.

Another clue: the use of Cmaj7. In G major, Cmaj7 is the IV chord. In E minor, it's the vi chord. So if the progression moves to Cmaj7, that might indicate where the tonic is. If the progression has Am/E followed by G/F#, then Cmaj7/E. If Am → G → C, that could be ii → I → IV in G major. Or in E minor: iv → III → vi.

But typically, in minor keys, the progression might use a mixolydian or other mode. But it's not clear.

Alternatively, let's consider the presence of both E and F# in bass. The bass line moving between E and F# might suggest E minor as the key, but it's not definite.

Wait, another angle: the chord Cmaj7 with E in bass. So bass E, then the chord is C, E, G, B. So E is in the bass, which is the tonic of E minor. So if the melody over this chord is resolving to E, it might be E minor.

Alternatively, in G major, the chord Cmaj7 with E bass would be the IV chord in first inversion. But tonic is G.

But if the overall progression doesn't have a clear resolution to G or E, it's hard to say.

But let's see the chord functions. In E minor, the F#dim is a leading tone chord, which doesn't function as a dominant, but the ii° chord. The D major chord could be VII chord. In E minor, VII chord is D major chord. Sometimes used to lead to tonic.

In G major, F#dim is the vii° chord, which is a diminished chord that leads to I chord.

Given that there's a Gmaj7 chord in the progression (as G/F#), that strongly points to G major as the key, because Gmaj7 is the tonic chord. Even though it's inverted.

In contrast, in E minor, G maj7 would be the III chord, which is not the tonic.

Therefore, if there's a chord that is a major seventh chord of G, and the tonic is likely G, that would make the key G major.

But let's also check if there are any other clues. What about the presence of E in bass? In G major, E is the vi chord (Em), but here the Em chord isn't used. Instead, Am/E and Cmaj7/E have E bass.

If the key is G major, then:

- Am/E: Am is ii, E bass would be second inversion.

- Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 is IV chord, E bass is first inversion.

- G/F#: I chord third inversion.

So the bass movement might be F#-F#-F#-F# (from F#dim chords), then for D/F# also F# bass. Then Am/E (E in bass), which would go to G/F# (F# bass), so bass moving from E to F#.

If the tonic is G, then moving from vi (E in bass for Am chord), but Am in G major is ii chord. Not the vi chord.

Hmm.

But another way: the key of G major has no key signature accidentals. Wait, G major has one sharp: F#. So yes. The chords all have F# when needed.

If the key were E minor (relative minor), same notes, same key signature.

So both keys have the same notes. So the difference is in the tonal center.

So whether it's G major or E minor depends on which note feels like home.

The chords themselves: when you have the F#dim and D/F# chords, in a major key context, the F#dim is resolving to G. In the given progression, after several F#dim chords, there's a D/F#, then Am/E followed by G/F#. So if the progression is F#dim → D → Am → G, that's quite a nice resolution in G major: vii° → V → ii → I.

Yes, that progression would make sense in G major. F#dim (vii°) → D (V) → Am (ii) → G (I). That's a possible resolution.

Similarly, in bar sequence:

Looking at the first part: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# then F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F#. So the last part before repetition is F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F#. So after F#dim (vii°), Am/E (ii), then G/F# (I). So a ii → I in G major. But before that, vii° → V. So yes, the typical function is vii° → V → ii → I. So that's a common progression in G major.

In E minor, how would that work? F#dim is ii°, D is VII, Am is IV, G is III. So ii° → VII → IV → III. Not as strong a progression for tonic. Unless using the III chord as cadence, but III is often not the tonic.

Therefore, G major seems more likely. Because the V chord (D) resolving to I (G) is a strong dominant-tonic movement. Even though it's passing through ii and V then to I. But V chord is D major, which is dominant in G major.

So D major in G major is the V chord. So if you have D/F# (V chord), then maybe a resolution from V → I. But in the progression, after D/F# comes F#dim etc. Wait:

Looking at the order again:

After two bars of F#dim and D/F# each, then another two F#dim, then Am/E and G/F#. So F#dim → D/F# (V) → F#dim → F#dim → Am/E (ii) → G/F# (I).

The F#dim → D/F# could be vii° → V. Then V leading to something else. But in this case, V is followed by F#dim again, which is a bit odd. But perhaps it's a deceptive cadence? Not sure.

Alternatively, the movement from D/F# (V) to Am/E (ii) is a bit less common. Usually V would go to I or vi. But not sure. In G major, vi is Em. Here we have Am/E. So maybe not.

But since the G/F# chord is present, which is the I chord (Gmaj7), that seems to be the tonic chord.

Given all this, I think the key is G major. The mode would be major, but the question says "determine key and mode". So G major, but mode is Ionian. Unless it's a mode.

But wait, E minor is Aeolian mode. But if the tonal center is G, then Ionian.

The chord progression seems to cycle through chords that belong to G major. The presence of Gmaj7 chord (even inverted) reinforces G as the tonic. The key signature would be one sharp (F#). So key of G major, mode Ionian. Or if the tonal center is E minor, then Aeolian.

But which is it? Let's think about the resolution. If the progression ends frequently on F#dim, but F#dim is the vii° chord, which doesn't resolve. But in the last chord, it's F#dim. Hmm.

Another clue: the use of F#dim repeatedly. In G major, F#dim is the vii° chord. In a major key, the vii° chord is often used as a passing chord to V. Like leading tone chord. So if it's used repeatedly, it could be setting up tension to resolve to I or V.

In this progression, it alternates with D/F#, which is V. So F#dim (vii°) leading to D (V), then repeating.

If the key were E minor, then F#dim is ii°, and D chord is VII. II° to VII can be a common progression in minor keys. But VII chord in minor is major sometimes.

Hmm. So both interpretations are possible. But in which key does the progression make the most harmonic sense?

Another way: look for cadence. The progression ends with F#dim. Not a cadence. But if in G major, the final chord before the repeat is F#dim. That's not a cadence. In E minor, same issue.

But perhaps the tonic is E minor because the bass often has E and the Cmaj7/E uses E in bass for Cmaj7, which might imply E is the home.

Alternatively, think of the chord Cmaj7/E. If it's in C major, but that doesn't fit. Or in E minor, it's the vi chord.

I think the strongest evidence for G major: the presence of a Gmaj7 chord (G/F#), which in G major is the I chord. In E minor, it's a III chord, which is not the tonic. If the progression is centered on G major, then the presence of the I chord (even inverted) suggests it. Whereas in E minor, there is no I chord (Em) in the progression. The Am/E and Cmaj7/E have E in bass but aren't Em chord. So it would be more likely that it's a G major progression where G is tonic, since the I chord (Gmaj7) is present, however inverted. Whereas in E minor, the Em chord is completely absent.

Yes, that makes sense. Typically, the tonic chord (Em for E minor) would appear to reinforce it. But here, no Em at all. Instead, the Gmaj7 is present. So the tonic chord is G major. So key is G major, mode Ionian.

Alternatively, maybe it's in the G major scale but with an emphasis on E minor. But usually, key refers to the key center.

So I think G major is the key.

But wait, let's see: the key signature for G major has F#. All the chord notes fit with F# sharps. The chords F#dim, D (F# in it), Cmaj7 (has F#? No, Cmaj7 in G major has no F# in the chord, since G major's F# is the 7th note. Wait, Cmaj7 chord: C, E, G, B. No F#. So no problem.

Yes. All the chords fit with the G major scale. So key of G major.

But wait, the question is to determine key and mode. So G major, Ionian mode. But sometimes people say just the key is G, but technically mode would be Ionian for major.

But maybe the analysis of the chord progression. Alternatively, could it be in E minor, Aeolian?

But in that case, there's no Em chord. Whereas in G major, there's Gmaj7. So G major seems more likely.

Another way: the chord Gmaj7 is a major seventh chord in the key of G; whereas in E minor, it's a III major seventh, but III usually is not a common tonic.

So given that, the key is G major, and mode is Ionian.

But wait, let's check again. If all chords are in G major:

- F#dim is vii°

- D/F# is V chord (D major)

- Am/E is ii chord

- Cmaj7/E is IV chord

- G/F# is I chord

Yes. So all chords fit perfectly. And the Gmaj7 chord (I chord) is part of the progression. Even though it's in inversion, it's still the tonic chord.

Whereas in E minor, there is no Em (i chord) present. Only chords like Am (iv), Cmaj7 (vi), D major (VII), etc. So without a clear tonic chord (Em), it's harder to say it's E minor.

Therefore, I think the key is G major, mode Ionian.

But wait, another angle: the use of Cmaj7. In G major, C is the IV chord. Cmaj7 is common. But typically, in jazz or pop, they may use major 7 chords on the IV. In classical, IV is usually just major triad. But the presence of the major 7 doesn't change the key.

Similarly, the Gmaj7 chord being the I chord.

So yes, I think the key is G major.

But the user might have a different perspective.

Wait, but in the progression, the G chord is in inversion (G/F#), which has the 7th (F#) in the bass. So the bass line is F# then G, etc. But in general, the tonic chord in G major being used as Gmaj7.

Yes. So the key is G major.

The chord progression provided contains chords that all fit within the **G major scale** (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#), confirming the **key is G Major (Ionian mode)**. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Key: G Major**  
- **Scale**: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#  
- **Key Signature**: 1 sharp (F#)  
- **Mode**: Ionian (standard major mode)  

---

### **Chord Analysis in G Major**  
Each chord in the progression maps to its diatonic function in G Major:  

| Chord        | Chord Type       | Function in G Major | Notes in Chord             |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **F#dim**    | Diminished (vii°) | Leading-tone triad  | F#, A, C                   |
| **D/F#**     | D Major (V)      | Dominant chord      | F#, A, D (D major in 1st inversion) |
| **Am/E**     | A minor (ii)     | Supertonic chord    | E, A, C (A minor in 1st inversion) |
| **G/F#**     | Gmaj7 (I)        | Tonic chord         | F#, G, B, D (Gmaj7 in 3rd inversion) |
| **Cmaj7/E**  | Cmaj7 (IV)       | Subdominant chord   | E, C, G, B (Cmaj7 in 1st inversion) |

---

### **Key Supporting Evidence**  
1. **Tonal Center**:  
   - The **Gmaj7 (G/F#)** chord acts as the **tonic (I)**. Even though it's inverted (F# in bass), it establishes G as the home note.  
   - No Em chord (the tonic for E minor) appears in the progression, ruling out E minor as the tonal center.  

2. **Chord Functions**:  
   - **F#dim (vii°)** resolves naturally to **D (V)**, a classic dominant-tonic motion in major keys.  
   - **D (V)** → **Am (ii)** → **Gmaj7 (I)** creates a logical cadence sequence typical of G major (e.g., V → ii → I).  
   - **Cmaj7 (IV)** fits as the subdominant chord, resolving appropriately to Gmaj7.  

3. **Key Signature Consistency**:  
   - All chord tones align with G major’s scale (only F# is sharpened, no other accidentals).  
   - No notes like G#, Bb, or D# appear, eliminating harmonic minor or other modes.  

---

### **Why Not E Minor (Aeolian)?**  
- While E minor shares the same notes as G major (relative minor), there is **no Em (i) chord** in the progression. The tonic must be clearly supported by the i chord (Em), which is absent.  
- The presence of **Gmaj7 (I)** solidifies G as the tonic, not E.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The progression is unequivocally in **G Major (Ionian mode)**. The chords function cohesively within the G major scale, with Gmaj7 acting as the tonic, D as dominant, and Cmaj7 as subdominant. The repeated use of F#dim (vii°) creates tension that resolves back to G major, reinforcing the key.  

> **Answer**: The key is **G Major**, and the mode is **Ionian**.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

```
F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Cmaj7/E F#dim
```

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: List all unique chords (with bass notes)**

We'll simplify the notation by identifying the **chord quality** and **root** (even with inversions):

1. **F#dim** → F# diminished triad = F# A C  
2. **D/F#** → D major triad with F# in bass → inversion of D major  
3. **Am/E** → A minor triad with E in bass → inversion of A minor  
4. **G/F#** → G major triad with F# in bass → inversion of G major  
5. **Cmaj7/E** → C major 7th chord with E in bass → inversion of Cmaj7

So the **chord roots** (ignoring inversion) are:

- F#dim (x6)
- D (x4)
- A (x1)
- G (x1)
- C (x1)

So the **chord roots** used are: **F#, D, A, G, C**

---

### **Step 2: Find the key that contains these roots**

Let’s consider which **major key** contains **C, D, G, A, F#** as scale degrees.

List the notes of possible major keys:

#### Try **E major**:
- E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D# → no C, no G natural, no D natural ❌

#### Try **A major**:
- A, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G# → has F#, A, D# — but we have **D natural**, **G natural**, **C natural** ❌

#### Try **D major**:
- D, E, F#, G, A, B, C# → Has D, F#, G, A → all good! But we have **C natural** (Cmaj7) — but D major has **C#**, not C natural ❌

#### Try **G major**:
- G, A, B, C, D, E, F# → ✅ **All roots are here!**
  - G → yes
  - A → yes
  - C → yes
  - D → yes
  - F# → yes

**Perfect!** All chord roots (G, A, C, D, F#) are in **G major**.

Also, the only "outlier" chord is **F#dim** — which is the **vii° chord** in G major.

Let’s map the diatonic chords of **G major**:

| Scale Degree | Chord       | Type     |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| I            | G           | Maj      |
| II           | A           | Min      |
| III          | B           | Min      |
| IV           | C           | Maj      |
| V            | D           | Maj      |
| VI           | E           | Min      |
| VII          | F#          | Dim      |

Our chords:
- **F#dim** → VII° ✅
- **D** → V ✅
- **A** → II ✅
- **G** → I? → Wait, we have **G/F#** — that’s G major in first inversion, so **G root** ✅
- **Cmaj7** → IVmaj7 ✅
- **Am/E** → A minor with E bass → A minor is II, so ✅

The presence of **Cmaj7** doesn’t hurt — diatonic IV chord in G major is C major, and Cmaj7 is just an extended tone (B natural, which is in G major: G-A-B-C-D-E-F# → yes, B is in scale).

**So, all chords are diatonic to G major.**

---

### **Step 3: Analyze mode?**

The question asks for **key and mode**.

- **Key** = **G major** (tonal center = G)
- **Mode** = since the key is G major, and all chords are diatonic, **it's in the Ionian mode**.

But — is there evidence of **modal flavor**? Let's check the **tonal center**.

The progression doesn't resolve clearly to G, but:

- The **F#dim** appears *constantly* — every chord except the last few is F#dim — it’s almost a pedal or drone element.
- The **bass notes** are moving: F# → F# → F# → F# → F# → F# → E → F# → F# → F# → F# → F# → E → F#

**Bass line**: F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - **E** - **F#** - F# - F# - F# - F# - **E** - F#

So the bass is mostly **F#**, with **E** appearing twice — as the 7th and 13th chords.

That’s interesting.

### **Bass line pattern**:  
F# (x6) → **E** → F# → F# (x4) → **E** → F#

So the bass is **F#** (major 7th of G) for most of the time, with **E** (major 6th) as a passing tone.

This is **not typical** of a standard cadence to G.

Moreover, the **Cmaj7/E** is **E-G-B-C** — this is the **E minor 7th inversion?** Wait: Cmaj7/E = E, G, B, C → that’s **E half-diminished**? No!

Wait — let's spell **Cmaj7/E**:

- Cmaj7 = C-E-G-B  
- With E in bass: E-G-B-C

What is this chord?  
- Notes: E, G, B, C → that's **E minor 7th (Em7)**?  
  - Em7 = E-G-B-D — **no D**, has **C** instead → so **E,G,B,C** = **Cmaj7/E**

But **Cmaj7/E** = **E, G, B, C**

This is **functionally** a **Cmaj7**, but in first inversion. However, **in the context of G major**, it’s IVmaj7.

BUT — E is the 6th scale degree in G major. So we’re having a **Cmaj7 chord with the 6th in the bass** — which is unusual.

More importantly — **when the bass is on E, and the chord is Cmaj7**, it can imply **E Phrygian** or **E minor**, but **Cmaj7 contains B natural** (not Bb), so it’s not Phrygian.

Actually, the combination of **F#dim + E bass** creates the sound of:

- **F#dim = F#-A-C**
- **E in bass**

So together: **E - F# - A - C**

That’s **E, F#, A, C**

What's that chord?  
- E root: E, F#, A, C →  
  - E-F# = major 2nd  
  - E-A = perfect 4th  
  - E-C = minor 7th

That’s **E6/9sus4?** Not standard.

Actually, **E, F#, A, C** = **F#m7(b5) in second inversion?**

No — it’s equivalent to **F# half-diminished seventh (F#m7♭5)**: F#-A-C-E — which is **exactly the same notes as E, F#, A, C** — just reordered!

Yes!

So **Cmaj7/E = E, G, B, C**

But **F#dim + E** = F#-A-C + E → F#-A-C-E → **F#m7♭5**

Wait — we have **F#dim** (F#-A-C) and then an **E in the bass** → so the full harmony is F#-A-C-E → **F#m7♭5** — the **iiø7 chord in G major**?

Wait! In G major:

- ii = A minor  
- iiø7 = Bm7♭5 → **B-D-F#**

We don’t have B here.

Hold on — we’re getting confused.

Let me clarify:

F#dim7 = F#-A-C-E → that’s the **vii°7 chord in G major**!

Yes!

In G major:

- vii°7 = **F#-A-C-E** → F# half-diminished seventh — the leading-tone 7th chord.

So **F#dim** in the progression is likely **intended as F#m7♭5**, even if written as F#dim (which sometimes implies just the triad).

In jazz/pop contexts, “F#dim” often implies F#m7♭5 or F#dim7 depending on context.

So we can assume **F#dim = F#m7♭5 = vii°7**

That’s the **leading tone chord** in G major — strongly tonicizing G.

So why is it repeated so much?

And we have **Cmaj7/E** = E-G-B-C — which is the same as **Em7**? No, Em7 is E-G-B-D — we have C, not D.

Cmaj7/E = E, G, B, C — that’s **Cmaj7 with E in bass**.

In G major, C is the IV chord. So IVmaj7.

BUT — E is the VI degree — so we have **IVmaj7 with VI in bass** → creates a **floating quality**.

However, the **most stable harmonic resolution** in this progression is from **F#dim → G** — but G never appears as root!

Wait — **G/F#** appears — that’s G major **with F# in the bass**.

G/F# = bass note F#, chord = G major → so it’s **G major in first inversion**.

So when we have **G/F#**, we are getting a **G triad** with the leading tone in the bass.

That’s a **very strong cadential sound**: F#→G — the leading tone resolving up to tonic.

In fact:  
- F#dim7 → G/F# → G → but here G/F# is the **first inversion of G**, so it’s **G without the root in bass**.

So the progression is built **around F# as a pedal tone**, and the chords above it function like this:

F#dim — F# is the root of the chord  
D/F# — D chord, F# bass  
Am/E — A chord, E bass  
G/F# — G chord, F# bass  
Cmaj7/E — C chord, E bass  
F#dim — F# dim, F# bass

The **bass motion** is: **F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - E - F# - F# - F# - F# - F# - E - F#**

So we have **two E bass notes** — both times associated with **Am** and **Cmaj7**.

That suggests **A minor** and **C major** are "supported" by E — which is the 6th scale degree of G.

In this context, **F# is acting as a sustained note** — like a drone — and the chords are changing above it.

But **every time the chord is F#dim or F#m7♭5**, we feel tension, and **G/F#** provides a kind of **resolution**, albeit incomplete (since G is not in root position).

Also, at the very end: **Cmaj7/E → F#dim**

That’s **IVmaj7 → vii°7** — classic plagal + leading tone motion — *toward* G, but it doesn’t land on G.

So — **is G the tonic?**

- **F# is the leading tone** — it wants to resolve to G
- **G/F#** chord is present — meaning G is the harmonic goal
- **No G root** — but presence of **G/F#** suggests G is the underlying harmony
- No chord is actually **G root position** — but **G/F#** is G major with F# in the bass — still G major harmony

Therefore:

> ✅ **The key is G major.**  
> ✅ **The mode is Ionian** (standard major scale).

The progression is written in **G major**, using primarily diatonic chords, with **F#dim (vii°7)** acting as a recurring tension chord, often unresolved, and **G/F#** implying the tonic without stating it in root position.

It has a **floating, unresolved, ambient quality** — common in post-rock, jazz, or modern pop — but **harmonically anchored in G major**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: G major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (major)**

The progression is in **G Ionian**, with **F#dim (vii°7)** as a recurring melodic/harmonic tension, often resolving conceptually — though not always literally — to G. The tonic (G root) is implied via the G/F# chord, especially in the cadential moments.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

The chord progression you've provided is:

**F#dim – F#dim – D/F# – D/F# – F#dim – F#dim – Am/E – G/F# – F#dim – F#dim – D/F# – D/F# – F#dim – F#dim – Cmaj7/E – F#dim**

---

### Step 1: Look for a tonal center
We can start by identifying whether there’s a recurring or emphasized chord that might indicate the key. The **F#dim** chord appears very frequently—almost every other chord—so it may be **functioning as a leading tone chord** (vii°) in some key.

In classical harmony, a diminished chord built on the **7th scale degree** (vii°) strongly resolves to the **tonic (I)**. For example:
- In **A minor**: G#° → Am
- In **E major**: D#° → E

But here we have **F#dim**, which contains the notes: **F# – A – C**

Let’s examine what key would treat **F#dim** as vii°:
- In **G major/minor**: F#° = vii° (notes: F# A C) → resolves to G
- In **G natural minor**: Yes, F#° is vii°
- In **G harmonic minor**: Also F#° (raised 7th)

So **F#° is the vii° chord in G minor (or G major, but less common because vii° in major is less functional)**.

However, **we don’t see a G major or G minor chord** in the progression—no G in root position at all. But we **do see G/F#**, which is a **G major chord with F# in the bass**—essentially a **G/F# = F# G B**, which strongly implies **G as the root**, with a leading tone in the bass.

Also notable: **Am/E** = A minor with E in the bass → E is the 5th of Am, but also the **dominant (V) of Am**. However, **Am is vi in C major**, and **ii in G major**.

Also: **D/F#** = D major with F# in bass → this is **D major**, the **V chord in G major/minor**.

And **Cmaj7/E** = C major 7 with E in bass → Cmaj7 is **IV in G major**, and **bVI in E minor**, but **in G major/minor**, C is the subdominant.

So let’s consider **G minor** as a candidate.

---

### Step 2: Analyze chords in context of G minor

In **G natural minor (Aeolian)**:
- i = Gm
- ii° = Adim
- III = Bb
- iv = Cm
- v = Dm
- VI = Eb
- VII = F

But our chords include **D major (D/F#)**, which is **not in G natural minor**—but **is in G harmonic minor** (where the 7th is raised: F#), making **D major = V chord**.

In **G harmonic minor**:
- i = Gm
- ii° = Adim
- III+ = Bb+ (augmented)
- iv = Cm
- V = D (major)
- VI = Eb
- vii° = F#dim

So **F#dim = vii°**, **D = V**, both fit **G harmonic minor**.

Now check other chords:

- **Am/E**: A minor = **ii chord** in G harmonic minor? Wait—in G minor, the ii chord is **A diminished**, not A minor. But **Am** is from **G melodic minor (ascending)** or borrowed from other modes.
  
  However, **Am/E** might be better interpreted as a **first inversion of A minor**, which could be a **modal mixture** or passing chord.

- **G/F#**: This is a **G major chord over F#**. But **G major is the tonic chord**—but in minor key, the i chord is **G minor**, not G major. However, **G major (Picardy third)** is common at cadences, but here it's just a passing chord.

  But wait: **G/F#** = notes F#, G, B. This is essentially an **F# diminished chord with a G added**—or a **dominant #9 sound**? Alternatively, it can be seen as a **tritone substitution** or passing chord.

- **Cmaj7/E**: Cmaj7 = C E G B. In G harmonic minor, the **iv chord is C minor**, not C major. So Cmaj7 is **not diatonic to G harmonic minor**.

  But **Cmaj7** appears in **E minor** as **bIII**, or in **A minor** as **IV**, or in **G major** as **IV**.

Wait—let’s test **E minor**.

---

### Step 3: Try E minor

E natural minor (Aeolian): E F# G A B C D  
E harmonic minor: E F# G A B C D#

Chords:
- vii° in E minor = D#° → not F#°
- F#dim = F# A C → This is **ii°** in E minor? No, ii in E minor is **F# dim** only in **E harmonic minor**? Wait:

In E harmonic minor:
- Scale: E F# G A B C D#
- Chord on F# = F# dim? F#–A–C = yes, that’s a diminished triad → **ii°**

But **ii° in minor keys is not common as a central chord**—usually the emphasis is on V or i.

Also, **D/F#** = D major → In E minor, D major is **flat-VII**, which is common in rock/pop but not a strong tonal center.

Cmaj7/E = Cmaj7 → in E minor, that’s **bVI7**, which is a common borrowed chord (from E Phrygian or major), but again, not strongly pointing to E.

Do we see an **E minor chord**? No. The bass notes include E (in Am/E and Cmaj7/E), but no Em chord.

So E minor is unlikely.

---

### Step 4: Try A minor

A natural minor: A B C D E F G  
A harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#

F#dim in A minor:
- F#–A–C → This is the **vii° chord in A harmonic minor?** Let's see: A harmonic minor = A B C D E F G#
- The 7th degree is G#, so vii° would be G#° = G# B D → not F#°

But F# is the **raised 6th** in A minor (melodic minor). In **A melodic minor (ascending)**: A B C D E F# G#

Chord on F# = F#–A–C → diminished → that’s the **vi° chord** in A melodic minor.

But again, not a strong functional chord.

D major = V of G, but in A minor, D is **IV**, and D major is common (from harmonic/melodic minor).

Cmaj7 = **bVII** in A minor? No, C is **bIII**, which is common.

Still, the recurrence of **F#dim** and **D/F#** suggests **F# is acting as leading tone → G**.

Also, **G/F#** strongly implies **resolution to G** (even if G major, not minor).

Now note: **Am/E** = A minor/E → E is the 5th, but E is **V of A minor**. But if the key is G, then Am is **ii**, and E in bass = **E is V**, so Am/E = a way to emphasize the dominant.

Similarly, **Cmaj7/E**: Cmaj7 with E bass = E–G–B–C → this forms an **E7b13** or **E7sus4♭9**? Actually, E G B C = E–G–B–C = **E half-diminished?** No, E–G–B is **Em**, add C = **Em7**? Wait: Em7 = E G B D. So C is not in Em7.

But Cmaj7/E = E in bass + Cmaj7 = E C E G B → notes: C E G B. Over E, this is **C/E**, which is a **first inversion C major**, often used as a **passing chord between D/F# and F#dim**.

Voice leading:  
D/F# → C/E → F#dim  
F# → E → F# (bass toggles)  
A → G → A  
C → B → C

This is **chromatic voice leading**, especially in the bass: F# → E → F#, and upper voices move stepwise.

This progression is heavily **chromatic**, but the **functional harmony** still points to **G** as tonic—especially because:

- F#° = vii° of G  
- D = V of G  
- G/F# = a **cadential 6/4-like** chord (tonic with leading tone in bass)  
- C = IV in G

So even though the tonic **G chord is not explicitly stated in root position**, it is **strongly implied** by the surrounding chords.

Also, **Cmaj7/E → F#dim**: Cmaj7 contains E, G, B, C. F#dim = F# A C. The C is common, E → F#, G → A, B → C. Again, strong chromatic motion to F#dim, which wants to resolve to G.

---

### Step 5: Consider mode

If the key is **G minor**, and we’re using:
- F#° (vii° from harmonic minor)
- D major (V from harmonic minor)
- Cmaj7 (not in harmonic minor, but could be borrowed from melodic minor or used as modal mixture)

But **Cmaj7** suggests the **6th degree is major (E natural)**, which is true in **natural minor**, but natural minor doesn’t have D major.

However, **G Dorian** has: G A Bb C D E F G → D is minor, so no.

**G harmonic minor**: has D major and F#°, but C is minor.

So the presence of **C major (in Cmaj7)** suggests either:
- A temporary shift (modal mixture from G major/ Mixolydian)
- Or the piece is actually in **E minor**, where Cmaj7 is bVI, D is bVII, F#° is ii° — but again, weak.

Alternatively, consider **C major** as the key?

In C major:
- F#° = #iv° → not diatonic, but used as a **chromatic passing chord** (e.g., between F and G)
- D/F# = V/V (secondary dominant to G)
- Am/E = vi6
- G/F# = V with leading tone in bass
- Cmaj7/E = I6

This makes sense! In **C major**, the progression could be:

- F#° = chromatic passing chord (commonly used between F and G, or as vii°/V)
- D/F# = A7 without the 7th? No, D is V/V (secondary dominant to G)
- G = V
- C = I

So the progression might be **tonicizing G (V of C)**, but then **resolving back to C**.

But the progression **ends on F#dim**, not C. So it’s **not conclusively in C**.

However, if we look at the chords:

**D/F# → C/E → F#dim**

In C major, this is:
- D/F# = V/V
- C/E = I6
- F#dim = vii°/V → leads back to G

But again, no G chord.

But wait—**Am/E → G/F#**: Am is vi, G is V in C major. So Am/E → G/F# = vi → V (with inversions)

And **Cmaj7/E** = I6

So many chords fit **C major** with secondary dominants and chromatic chords.

But why so much **F#dim**? In C major, F#° is **vii° of V** (G), so it functions as a **leading-tone chord to G**, which is the dominant.

So the entire progression might be **hovering around the dominant (G)** of **C major**, creating tension without resolving to C.

But the presence of **D major** (V/V) and **F#° (vii°/V)**, **G/F# (V)**, and **C (I)** suggests the **home key is C major**, and the progression is **emphasizing the dominant area**.

Yet the **repetition of F#dim and D/F#** without resolution to G or C makes it ambiguous.

---

### Final Analysis

The most consistent interpretation is that the **tonal center is G**, and the mode is **G harmonic minor**, with possible modal mixture (e.g., C major instead of C minor).

Why?
- F#° is vii° → G
- D major is V → G
- G/F# implies G tonic
- Cmaj7 is a borrowed chord (from G major or melodic minor)

Even though Cmaj7 isn’t in G harmonic minor, **borrowed subdominant chords (like C major)** are common in minor keys (e.g., "minor key with Picardy subdominant").

Moreover, the **bass motion F# → E → F#** centers around **F#**, the leading tone to G.

Thus, the **key is G minor**, and the **mode is harmonic minor** (due to the presence of D major and F#°).

✅ **Answer: Key = G minor, Mode = Harmonic minor**.

### Reasoning

**Assessing Harmonic Context**

I'm now carefully examining the chord progression, dissecting each chord's notes to understand their relationships. I am looking at how they connect and what kind of harmonic tension they create. My focus is on identifying any repeating patterns, considering potential modulations, and starting to anticipate the overall tonal center.


**Pinpointing Harmonic Function**

The chord analysis is complete; I have identified all the notes within each chord and their functions within the sequence. The initial pattern featuring repeated F#dim and D/F# chords is now clearer. My focus is on the role of the inversions and non-diatonic chords (like G/F#) in establishing or subverting a key. I suspect the Lydian mode, but the presence of the G/F# (V of vi) has made me rethink the original context.


**Examining Harmonic Functionality**

I'm now determining the harmonic roles of each chord within the sequence. F#dim, appearing frequently, is a dominant substitute, and the D/F# functions strongly as a tonic. I am considering the implications of the G/F# (V of vi), and the Cmaj7/E, within the broader context of a potential key. I will now examine whether the key is C Lydian (more likely) or G Major.


**Deciphering Chord Roles**

My assessment now involves connecting the chords. The frequent F#dim, paired with the subsequent D/F#, hints at a V-I or a dominant-tonic relationship, but in an unconventional key. I have to decide if the G/F# functions as a passing chord or has a more structural role. Finally, I will determine if the Cmaj7/E has more bearing on the tonal center.


**Examining Potential Tonics**

I am now thoroughly considering how the repeated F#dim functions within the sequence. My current hypothesis centers around C Lydian due to the prominence of F#, but the recurring D/F# is pushing me toward G Major as well. The presence of G/F#, although brief, influences this decision.


**Examining Key and Mode**

My analysis suggests that the chord sequence most likely centers on either G Major or C Lydian due to the note collection. The strong presence of F#dim poses a challenge. I'm now weighing the implications of each possibility, considering the unconventional function of the F#dim in both potential contexts, and debating the influence of the Cmaj7/E chord.


**Evaluating Sequence and Structure**

I'm now determining the overall form of the chord progression, looking for clear points of resolution or cadence. I'm focusing on the relationship between F#dim and D/F#, trying to see how they create harmonic motion and, perhaps, act as building blocks. I'm reassessing the key, given that F#dim is prevalent.


**Confirming Mode and Key**

I've determined that the note collection strongly suggests C Lydian. I'm now certain about the identification of C Lydian as the mode, confirming the prominent roles of D/F# (II) and Am/E (vi). The F#dim chord is the diminished chord built on the raised 4th, characteristic of Lydian harmony. The form will be based around C and D.


**Finalizing Mode and Structure**

I've determined that C Lydian is the most likely mode. The prominent F#dim chord, and the focus on the notes C, D, E, F#, G, A, and B, confirms this assessment. The structure leans towards a cyclical pattern. The frequent changes from F#dim to D/F# emphasize the raised 4th and dominant-like qualities of the progression.




This chord progression features a distinct set of notes and harmonic relationships that point strongly towards a specific mode.

1.  **Analyze the notes and scale:**
    The unique notes found across all chords are: C, D, E, F\#, G, A, B.
    This collection of notes is the **C Major scale with a raised 4th ($\hat{4}$)**, which is F\# instead of F natural.

2.  **Determine Possible Keys/Modes:**
    The scale C, D, E, F\#, G, A, B corresponds precisely to the **Lydian Mode** built on C.

    *   C Ionian (Major): C D E **F** G A B
    *   C Lydian: C D E **F\#** G A B

3.  **Analyze Chord Functions in C Lydian:**
    If C is the tonic (I):
    *   **Cmaj7/E** = I (Tonic chord). This serves as a strong indicator of the tonic center.
    *   **D/F\#** = II (The supertonic chord in Lydian is Major, D, F\#, A).
    *   **Am/E** = vi (The submediant chord).
    *   **G/F\#** = V (Dominant).
    *   **F\#dim (F\#, A, C)** = This chord is built on the raised 4th scale degree ($\hat{4}$). In Lydian, the chord built on $\hat{4}$ is typically an F\# half-diminished chord (F\#m7b5, F\# A C E). The use of the F\# diminished triad here serves to strongly emphasize the characteristic F\# tone of the Lydian mode. Its pervasive usage confirms the importance of this altered degree.

4.  **Conclusion:**
The consistent usage of Cmaj7 (I), D major (II), and A minor (vi), paired with the strong emphasis on F# (via D/F\# and F\#dim), confirms that the key center is C, utilizing the mode that incorporates the raised fourth degree.

***

**Key:** C

**Mode:** Lydian

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

This chord progression is quite unusual and doesn't clearly fit into a standard major, minor, or even common modal key. The intensive use of the diminished triad ($\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}: \text{F}\sharp - \text{A} - \text{C}$) makes it highly unstable and suggests a very chromatic or symmetrical approach.

Let's analyze the chords and their potential functions:

1.  **Chords Present:** $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$, $\text{D}/\text{F}\sharp$, $\text{A}(\text{m})/\text{E}$ ($\text{Am}/\text{E}$ is $\text{E} - \text{A} - \text{C}$), $\text{G}/\text{F}\sharp$, $\text{Cmaj7}/\text{E}$ ($\text{E} - \text{G} - \text{B} - \text{D}$).

2.  **Harmonic Structure:**
    *   The core chord is $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ ($\text{F}\sharp - \text{A} - \text{C}$).
    *   The bass moves stepwise or chromatically ($\text{F}\sharp \rightarrow \text{E} \rightarrow \text{F}\sharp \rightarrow \text{E}$).

### Analysis of Potential Keys

The key must contain the frequent notes $\text{F}\sharp$, $\text{A}$, $\text{C}$, and support the presence of $\text{D}$, $\text{E}$, $\text{G}$, and $\text{B}$ (from $\text{Cmaj7}$ and $\text{D}/\text{F}\sharp$).

#### Hypothesis 1: A Minor (Aeolian)

*   **Notes in A Minor:** A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
*   **Fit:** $\text{Am}/\text{E}$ and $\text{Cmaj7}/\text{E}$ (III chord) fit perfectly.
*   **Problem:** The core chord is $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$. The key of A minor has $\text{F}$ natural, making an $\text{F}\sharp$ chord (a common Neapolitan or chromatic passing chord, but not a central tonic feature) a significant deviation. $\text{F}\sharp$ is the raised submediant ($\text{vi}\uparrow$).

#### Hypothesis 2: D Major/B Minor

*   **Notes in D Major:** D, E, F$\sharp$, G, A, B, C$\sharp$.
*   **Fit:** $\text{D}$ chord fits. $\text{F}\sharp$ fits.
*   **Problem:** The dominant presence of $\text{C}$ natural (in $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$, $\text{Am}$, and $\text{Cmaj7}$) clashes directly with the $\text{C}\sharp$ required for D major or harmonic/melodic B minor.

#### Hypothesis 3: C Major

*   **Notes in C Major:** C, D, E, F, G, A, B.
*   **Fit:** $\text{Cmaj7}$, $\text{D}/\text{F}\sharp$ (II/V relationship), $\text{Am}$ fit.
*   **Problem:** The dominant presence of $\text{F}\sharp$ (the raised subdominant, $\#\text{IV}$) strongly suggests a highly modulatory or non-diatonic approach. $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ in C major is often a chromatic passing chord leading to $\text{G}$ ($\text{V}$) or $\text{Am}$ ($\text{vi}$).

### Conclusion on Key and Mode

Given the extremely high frequency of the $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ chord and its repeated oscillation, this progression is likely driven less by typical diatonic function and more by **symmetrical or chromatic movement**, often found in Romantic or Post-Tonal music (like that of Wagner or Debussy).

However, the chords that *resolve* or offer momentary stability ($\text{Am}/\text{E}$ and $\text{Cmaj7}/\text{E}$) point strongly toward the region of **A minor/C major**.

The progression seems to be:

$$ \text{F}\sharp\text{dim} \rightarrow \text{D}/\text{F}\sharp \rightarrow \text{A} \text{ minor } \approx \text{vi} \text{ (in C)} $$
$$ \text{F}\sharp\text{dim} \rightarrow \text{D}/\text{F}\sharp \rightarrow \text{Cmaj7} \approx \text{I} \text{ (in C)} $$

The main tonal center that includes the majority of diatonic chords is **C Major** (or A Minor). The repeated $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ functions as a coloristic chromatic chord, often enhancing the pull toward the local chords $\text{Am}$ and $\text{C}$.

### Final Determination

**Key:** **C Major / A Minor** (Tonal Region)

**Mode:** While the underlying diatonic material points to **Ionian (C Major)** or **Aeolian (A Minor)**, the persistent use of $\text{F}\sharp$ means the progression is not strictly modal but is **chromatic** within the context of the C/Am tonal center.

*The function of the $\text{F}\sharp\text{dim}$ chord is likely the $\#\text{iv}^{\circ}$ or a member of the octatonic scale used functionally to create tension and leading-tone motion.*

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's break this down step by step to determine the key and mode.

### Step 1: Identify the notes in each chord
We'll extract the notes for each chord to analyze the overall pitch collection.

1. **F#dim**: F# A C  
2. **D/F#**: D F# A (same as D major, with F# in the bass)  
3. **Am/E**: A C E (same as A minor, with E in the bass)  
4. **G/F#**: G B D F# (G major with F# in the bass, implying Gmaj7 or F# added)  
5. **Cmaj7/E**: C E G B (Cmaj7 with E in the bass)  

### Step 2: Compile all unique notes
From the chords, the unique notes are:  
**F#, A, C, D, E, G, B**  

This gives us:  
- **F#** (not in C major, but appears in D major or G major)  
- **A, C, D, E, G, B** (all in C major except F#)  

### Step 3: Analyze the tonal center
The progression revolves around **F#dim** and **D/F#**, suggesting **D major** as a likely key because:
- F#dim is the **vii° chord in G major** or **ii° in E minor**, but it also functions as **vii°/V in D major** (leading to G, which appears as G/F#).  
- D/F# is the **I chord in D major**.  

### Step 4: Check for mode or minor tonic
The presence of **Am/E (vi in D major)** and **Cmaj7/E (IV in D major)** supports **D major**, not B minor (the relative minor), because:
- B minor would emphasize B, D, F# (i chord), but **B is absent as a root**.  
- The **F#dim** is **vii° in G major**, but here it’s likely **vii°/V in D major** (F# A C is the leading-tone chord resolving to G).  

### Step 5: Rule out other keys
- **G major**: F#dim is vii°, but the absence of a G major tonic (except as G/F#) and the prominence of D/F# weakens this.  
- **E minor**: F#dim is ii°, but E minor’s tonic (E) is only present in Am/E and Cmaj7/E, not as a root.  

### Final Determination
The **tonal center is D major**, with the **F#dim functioning as vii°/V** (leading to G/F#). The progression is **diatonic to D major**, not modal (no borrowed chords or chromaticism outside D major).  

**Answer:**  
**Key: D Major**  
**Mode: Ionian (standard major)**

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let’s analyze the progression:

**Chord sequence:**
```
F#dim | F#dim | D/F# | D/F# | F#dim | F#dim | Am/E | G/F# |
F#dim | F#dim | D/F# | D/F# | F#dim | F#dim | Cmaj7/E | F#dim
```

---

### Step 1. Identify chord components

- **F#dim** = F# – A – C  
- **D/F#** = F# – A – D  
- **Am/E** = A – C – E  
- **G/F#** = F# – G – B – D  
- **Cmaj7/E** = E – G – B – C  

You can see recurring tones: **F#, A, C, D, E, G, B.**

---

### Step 2. Note relationships

- **F#dim** is the leading-tone diminished chord in **G major** (vii°) — strongly implying **G** as a tonal center.  
- **D/F#** (the dominant in G) and **G/F#** (the tonic with dominant bass) also reinforce G-related harmony.  
- **Am/E** (ii chord in G) and **Cmaj7/E** (IV with a major 7) fit naturally in **G major** as well.  

---

### Step 3. Determine key

All chords fit inside **G major** (or its relative, **E minor**). Let’s check accidentals:

- In G major: {G, A, B, C, D, E, F#} → all chord tones fit.  
- No D# or C# appears to suggest modulation.

The **F#dim** recurring so frequently might imply a minor setting (since it could act as ii° in E minor), but the harmonic motion toward **D** and **G** suggests **G major** more than **E minor**, because we lack a strong tonic **E**-based resolution.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

- **Key:** G major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major)  

Alternatively, you could interpret it as **E natural minor (Aeolian)** if you hear **F#dim** resolving inward to **E** — but the harmonic evidence more strongly supports **G major (Ionian)**.

First, I have this chord progression: F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Am/E, G/F#, F#dim, F#dim, D/F#, D/F#, F#dim, F#dim, Cmaj7/E, F#dim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since there are a lot of F#dim chords, that might be a clue. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or leading tones in music theory.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

1. F#dim

2. F#dim

3. D/F#

4. D/F#

5. F#dim

6. F#dim

7. Am/E

8. G/F#

9. F#dim

10. F#dim

11. D/F#

12. D/F#

13. F#dim

14. F#dim

15. Cmaj7/E

16. F#dim

Now, I see that D/F# is a D major chord with an F# in the bass, so it's essentially a D chord in first inversion. Similarly, Am/E is an A minor chord with E in the bass, so first inversion, and G/F# is G major with F# in the bass, which is also first inversion. Cmaj7/E is C major 7th with E in the bass, so first inversion.

But the key might be related to the diminished chords. F#dim is a diminished seventh chord. Let me recall what notes are in F#dim. A diminished seventh chord is made up of minor thirds. So F#dim would be F#, A, C, Eb? Wait, in music theory, we often use enharmonic equivalents, but let's think in terms of half steps.

F# diminished seventh: root, minor third, diminished fifth, diminished seventh. So from F#: F# to A is minor third? F# to A is actually a major third? No, let's calculate.

F# to G is half step, G to G# is half, but from F# to A: F# to G is semitone, G to G# is semitone, G# to A is semitone? No, from F# to A is two whole steps? Let's think in terms of intervals.

The minor third from F# would be A, because from F# to A is three half steps, which is a minor third? Actually, from F# to A is three half steps: F# to G (1), G to G# (2), G# to A (3). Yes, three half steps is a minor third. But in standard tuning, F# to A is actually a minor third? F# to A is a minor third only if we consider F# as the root? Let's clarify.

In music theory, a minor third is three half steps. From F# to A: F# to G is 1 half step, G to G# is 2, G# to A is 3? But G# is not the same as A? No, from F# to A directly: the distance is F# to G (1 semitone), G to A (2 semitones)? No, from F# to A is two semitones? Let's list the notes: F#, G, G#, A. So from F# to A is three semitones: F# to G (1), G to G# (2), G# to A (3). Yes, three semitones, which is a minor third.

But in terms of chord quality, a diminished chord has a root, minor third, and diminished fifth. So for F#dim: root F#, minor third A, diminished fifth C? From F# to C: F# to G (1), G to G# (2), G# to A (3), A to A# (4), A# to B (5), B to C (6)? From F# to C is six half steps, which is a diminished fifth? Let's see: a perfect fifth from F# would be C#, so from F# to C is one half step less than perfect fifth, so yes, diminished fifth. So F#dim triad is F#, A, C.

But a diminished seventh chord adds a diminished seventh, which from F# would be Eb? From F# to Eb: F# to E is two half steps down? From F# to E is one half step down? No, from F# to Eb: let's think in half steps. From F# to E is one half step down? F# is higher than E? In terms of pitch, F# is above E, so from F# down to E is one semitone, but we're going up? For chord construction, we stack thirds.

So from F# up a minor third to A, then from A up a minor third to C, then from C up a minor third to Eb. So F#dim7 is F#, A, C, Eb.

But in the progression, it's written as F#dim, which might imply diminished seventh, or it might be just diminished triad? In chord symbols, "dim" usually means diminished seventh, but sometimes it can mean diminished triad. However, in context, it might be functioning as a leading tone chord.

Now, looking at the other chords: D/F# is D major with F# bass, so notes D, F#, A. But since it's over F# bass, it's like a D chord with F# in bass.

Similarly, Am/E is A, C, E with E bass, so it's A minor with E bass.

G/F# is G, B, D with F# bass.

Cmaj7/E is C, E, G, B with E bass.

Now, to find the key, I need to see what key these chords belong to. Let's consider the F#dim chord. F#dim is often used as a vii° chord in a key. For example, in G major, the vii° chord is F#dim. In G minor, the vii° chord is also F#dim? In minor keys, the vii° chord is based on the raised seventh scale degree.

Let's list possible keys where F#dim is the vii° chord.

If F# is the leading tone, then the tonic would be G. So in G major or G minor.

But let's see the other chords: D is the V chord in G major, and G is the I chord, but here we have G/F#, which is G with F# bass, so it might be a passing thing.

Also, Am is the ii chord in G major, and Cmaj7 is the IV chord in G major? In G major, the chords are G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim. So yes, Am is ii, C is IV, D is V, F#dim is vii°.

But we have Am/E, which is still Am, and G/F#, which is G with F# bass, and Cmaj7/E, which is C with E bass.

So in G major, all these chords fit: F#dim (vii°), D (V), Am (ii), G (I), C (IV).

But the progression ends with Cmaj7/E and F#dim. If it's in G major, ending on F#dim might not be stable, but it could be a transitional ending.

Also, the progression has multiple F#dim and D/F#, which might be functioning as dominant preparations.

Now, let's consider the bass movement. The bass notes are often F#, since many chords have F# in the bass. From the progression: when it's F#dim, the bass is F#? But F#dim has F# as root, so bass is F#. D/F# has bass F#, so bass is F#. G/F# has bass F#, so bass is F#. And Cmaj7/E has bass E, but then back to F#dim with bass F#.

So the bass is frequently on F#, and only briefly on E for Cmaj7/E.

This suggests that F# is a important bass note, perhaps a pedal point or something.

In terms of key, if F# is the bass, and it's part of the dominant function in G major, since F# is the leading tone to G.

But let's see the chord before the end: Cmaj7/E to F#dim. Cmaj7 is IV in G, and F#dim is vii°, so IV to vii° is a common progression, leading to I, but here it doesn't go to I, it ends on vii°, which is unusual but possible.

Perhaps the key is G major, and the mode is Ionian, but with emphasis on the diminished chord.

Another thought: sometimes diminished chords are used in minor keys. In G minor, the vii° chord would be F#dim, but in G minor, the natural scale has F natural, so the leading tone is F# only in harmonic or melodic minor. So in G harmonic minor, the vii° chord is F#dim.

But in G minor, the chord D is still V, but D major would require an F#, which is the raised seventh, so in G harmonic minor, V is D major, and vii° is F#dim.

Similarly, Am is not in G minor; in G minor, the ii chord would be A diminished, since G minor scale is G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, so ii is A diminished, but here we have Am, which is A minor, so that has C natural, whereas in G minor, C is natural, but A minor has A, C, E, so C natural, which is in G natural minor? G natural minor has Bb and Eb, so A minor would have A, C, E, and C is natural, which is in G natural minor, but the third of A minor is C, which is the fourth of G minor, so in G natural minor, the ii chord is A diminished? Let's list chords in G natural minor: i: Gm, ii°: Adim, III: Bb, iv: Cm, v: Dm, VI: Eb, VII: F. So Am is not in G natural minor. But in G harmonic minor, the scale is G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#. So chords: i: Gm, ii°: Adim, III+: Bbaug, iv: Cm, V: D, VI: Eb, vii°: F#dim. So Am is not in G harmonic minor either. Am would require A, C, E, but in G harmonic minor, the notes are A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#, G, so E is not in the scale; E is not in G harmonic minor. So Am cannot be in G minor. Therefore, the key cannot be G minor because of the Am chord.

So probably, the key is G major.

But let's confirm with the Cmaj7 chord. In G major, C is IV, and Cmaj7 is fine.

So all chords fit in G major: F#dim (vii°), D (V), Am (ii), G (I), C (IV).

Now, the progression has Am/E, which is ii6 in first inversion, and G/F#, which is I with leading tone in bass, and Cmaj7/E, which is IV6 with third in bass.

The frequent use of F#dim and D/F# suggests that we are emphasizing the leading tone F# and the dominant D.

The progression ends with Cmaj7/E to F#dim. In G major, IV to vii° is a deceptive progression if it goes to vi, but here it ends on vii°, which is unstable, but perhaps it's a transitional ending or it implies a resolution to G.

Perhaps the mode is not strictly Ionian, but since all chords are diatomic to G major, it should be Ionian.

But let's see the sequence: it starts with F#dim repeatedly, then D/F#, then F#dim, then Am/E and G/F#, then F#dim, then D/F#, then F#dim, then Cmaj7/E and F#dim.

The bass is mostly on F#, with only Am/E having E bass and Cmaj7/E having E bass, but G/F# has F# bass, so bass is on F# for most of the time.

This might suggest that F# is a pedal point, and the key is G, with F# as the leading tone pedal.

In terms of mode, since it's in G major, it's Ionian.

But let's see if there is any modulation or other key.

Another possibility: sometimes diminished chords can be part of other keys. For example, F#dim is also the ii° chord in E minor? In E minor, the ii° chord is F#dim, but then we have D chord, which in E minor would be VII? In E minor natural, VII is D major, but ii° is F#dim only in harmonic minor? Let's see E harmonic minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D#. So chords: i: Em, ii°: F#dim, III+: Gaug, iv: Am, V: B, VI: C, vii°: D#dim. So D major is not in E harmonic minor. D major has D, F#, A, but in E harmonic minor, F# is there, but D natural? In E harmonic minor, the seventh is D#, so D natural is not in the scale. So D major would not fit in E minor.

Similarly, in other keys, F#dim might be used, but with D major and Am and C, it seems best fit for G major.

Moreover, the chord G/F# is directly pointing to G as tonic.

So I think the key is G major.

Therefore, key: G major, mode: Ionian.

But the question says "determine key and mode". Mode might refer to the scale mode, which in this case is Ionian, but since it's major, we often just say major.

In classical terms, mode is Ionian for major.

But sometimes in modern music, mode might refer to something else, but here it seems straightforward.

So I'll go with key of G major.

The chord progression primarily consists of chords diatonic to G major: F#dim (vii°), D (V), Am (ii), G (I), and Cmaj7 (IV). The frequent use of F#dim and D/F# emphasizes the leading tone F# and dominant function, pointing towards G as the tonic. The progression ends on F#dim, which is unstable but common in transitional passages, and the bass movement often features F# as a pedal point, reinforcing the dominant harmony.

Thus, the key is **G major**, and the mode is **Ionian**.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.  

---

## 1. List the chords and their likely functions

The progression is:  

**F#dim** – **F#dim** – **D/F#** – **D/F#** – **F#dim** – **F#dim** – **Am/E** – **G/F#** – **F#dim** – **F#dim** – **D/F#** – **D/F#** – **F#dim** – **F#dim** – **Cmaj7/E** – **F#dim**

---

## 2. Identify F#dim’s possible function

F#dim is a diminished triad (F#–A–C).  
In a full diminished 7th context, F#dim7 = F#–A–C–Eb.  
But here it’s just the triad, so it could be acting as a **common-tone diminished** or **leading-tone diminished** of G major or G minor.

Let’s check keys:

- In **G major**: F#dim = vii° (F#–A–C), which is diatonic.
- In **G minor**: F#dim is not diatonic (G minor has F♮), so it would be a secondary leading-tone chord or borrowed.

---

## 3. Look at surrounding chords

D/F# – D major with F# in bass.  
In G major, D is V, D/F# is V with 3rd in bass.  
F#dim shares notes A and C with D7 (D–F#–A–C) — in fact, F#dim = D7(b9) without the root D. So F#dim often works as a rootless D7b9, i.e., dominant function to G.

Am/E – Am is vi in C major, but in G major it’s ii. Am/E = A–C–E with E bass.  
G/F# – G major with F# bass = G major triad with F# in bass, which is like a D/F# with G in the melody? Actually G/F# = G–B–D–F# = Gmaj7? No, that’s Gmaj7/F#. But here it’s G triad with F# bass, so notes: F#–G–B–D. That’s not a standard tertian chord — it’s like an F#m7b5 (F#–A–C–E) but with G and B instead of A and C? Let’s check: F#–G–B–D.  
Spell: F# + G + B + D. That’s actually an F#dim7 (F#–A–C–Eb) but with G and B replacing A and Eb? No, that’s messy. Let’s rearrange: F#–G–B–D.  
If we put G in bass: G–B–D–F# = Gmaj7. But here F# is in bass, so it’s Gmaj7/F#. Yes! So G/F# is **first inversion of Gmaj7**.  

So G/F**#** → F#dim is chromatic bass movement F# → F#.

---

## 4. Check the final cadence

Before last F#dim we have Cmaj7/E.  
C–E–G–B with E bass.  
In G major, C is IV. Cmaj7 is IVmaj7.  
So progression: Cmaj7/E → F#dim → ? (loop back probably).  
F#dim is vii°/G, so Cmaj7 → F#dim is IV → vii° in G, a deceptive or incomplete cadence.

---

## 5. Determine key from overall harmonic pull

D/F# is V in G major.  
Am is ii in G major (or vi in C major).  
G/F# is Imaj7 in first inversion in G major.  
Cmaj7 is IV in G major.  

Everything fits **G major**:

- F#dim = vii° (common as passing chord between I and V6 or as approach to G)
- D/F# = V6
- Am = ii
- G/F# = I6 (maj7)
- Cmaj7 = IVmaj7

---

## 6. Mode

All chords are diatonic to G major except F#dim is the *only* diminished triad, but it’s the normal leading-tone chord in major.  
So the mode is **G major** (Ionian).

---

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{G \text{ major}}
\]

### Reasoning


1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user has provided a sequence of chords and wants to know the key and mode. The chords are: F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#min Cmaj7/E F#dim.

2.  **Initial Impression & Simplification:**
    *   The first thing that jumps out is the repetition and the prominent use of F#dim. This is a very strong clue. A diminished chord that's used this persistently is often the leading tone chord (viio) to the tonic.
    *   If F#dim is the leading tone chord (viio), then the tonic would be G major. Let's test this hypothesis.
    *   Let's simplify the chord progression by removing the repetitions:
        *   F#dim
        *   D/F#
        *   Am/E
        *   G/F#
        *   Cmaj7/E
        *   F#dim (again)

3.  **Hypothesis 1: Key of G Major**
    *   **Tonic:** G
    *   **Key Signature:** F#, C#
    *   **Diatonic Chords:**
        *   I: Gmaj7
        *   ii: Amin7
        *   iii: Bmin7
        *   IV: Cmaj7
        *   V: D7
        *   vi: Emin7
        *   viio: F#dim7 (or F#m7b5)
    *   **Analyze the chords against G Major:**
        *   **F#dim:** This is the viio chord. It fits perfectly. It strongly wants to resolve to G. The fact that it's everywhere reinforces this. The G/F# chord later on is just a G major triad with an F# in the bass, which is essentially a V6/4 (or I6/4) depending on context, but the F# bass keeps that leading tone tension going.
        *   **D/F#:** This is a V chord (D major) with its third in the bass. This is a very common chord in G major. This is a strong point *for* G major.
        *   **Am/E:** An A minor chord with an E in the bass. Am is the ii chord in G major. The E in the bass is the 5th of the Am chord. This is a standard ii chord voicing. This fits.
        *   **G/F#:** This is a G major chord with an F# in the bass. G is the I chord. This is a I chord with a leading tone in the bass, creating a strong pull back to the root. It's essentially a Gmaj7(no 5th) or a G(6) with a weird bass, but functionally it's the tonic.
        *   **Cmaj7/E:** This is a Cmaj7 chord with an E in the bass. Cmaj7 is the IV chord in G major. The E in the bass is the third of the chord. This fits perfectly.
        *   **Final F#dim:** Back to the leading tone.

4.  **Conclusion for G Major:** All the chords *except one* fit diatonically into the key of G major. The progression is heavily centered around the pull between F#dim (the leading tone) and G (the tonic). The other chords (D, Am, C) are the primary diatonic chords (V, ii, IV) used to create movement in a major key. This looks very strong.

5.  **Investigate the "Odd Man Out":** What about the `F#min` in `F#min Cmaj7/E`?
    *   The user wrote `F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#dim Am/E G/F# F#dim F#dim D/F# D/F# F#dim F#min Cmaj7/E F#dim`.
    *   Wait, I misread that last bit. It's `F#dim ... F#min Cmaj7/E F#dim`. Okay, let's re-evaluate. There's an F#min chord.
    *   **F#min:** This chord is *not* in the key of G major. In G major, the F# chord is diminished (F# A C). F#min would be F# A C#.
    *   So, where does F#min come from?
        *   It could be a secondary dominant or a borrowed chord.
        *   Is F#min a secondary dominant? F#min is the ii chord in E major. E is the vi chord in G major. So, F#min could be a `ii/vi`. This is plausible. A `ii/vi` -> `vi` progression is common. But the next chord is Cmaj7/E, not Em. So a `ii/vi` function doesn't make immediate sense here.
        *   Is F#min a borrowed chord? It could be borrowed from G minor (the parallel minor). In G minor, the chords are: Gm, Aø, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F#dim. No F#min there.
        *   Let's reconsider the context: `...F#dim F#min Cmaj7/E F#dim`. The F#min is sandwiched between two F#dim chords. This is interesting. It could be a chromatic passing chord. The C# in the F#min chord could be a chromatic tone that resolves down to the C in the following Cmaj7 chord. Let's see:
            *   F#dim: F# - A - C
            *   F#min: F# - A - C# (the C# is the chromatic tone)
            *   Cmaj7/E: E - G - B - C (the C# resolves down a semitone to C)
            *   This is a very common and beautiful-sounding chromatic voice-leading technique. The C# acts as a leading tone to the C (or the D in the D/F# if that came next).

6.  **Re-evaluating the Mode Question:**
    *   The user asked for the *key and mode*.
    *   The analysis points overwhelmingly to G **Major** as the tonal center. The chords function as ii, IV, V, I, and viio in G major. The F#min is a chromatic embellishment.
    *   Could it be a mode?
        *   **G Dorian?** G A Bb C D E F#. The F# would be a natural 7, and the F#dim would be a vii chord. But D would be minor (Dm), not major (D/F#). So, no.
        *   **G Mixolydian?** G A B C D E F. The F# would be a major 7, which is not diatonic to Mixolydian. The F#dim chord would be a #vii°, which is a common secondary dominant leading to the tonic, but the rest of the progression feels too "major-y" (D major, Cmaj7).
        *   **G Lydian?** G A B C# D E F#. The F#dim works, but C would be C# major, not Cmaj7. And D would be D major, which fits. But the Cmaj7 is a huge problem for Lydian.
        *   **G Aeolian?** G A Bb C D Eb F. No. F# is not diatonic. D would be minor.
        *   **G Phrygian?** G Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb. Definitely not.
        *   **G Locrian?** G Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb. Definitely not.

7.  **Final Conclusion Formation:**
    *   The key is **G Major**.
    *   The "mode" is simply **Major** (or Ionian). It's not a modal progression in the traditional sense; it's a functional diatonic progression in a major key with a chromatic passing chord.
    *   The tonal center is clearly G. The F#dim chord acts as the dominant function (specifically, the leading tone chord, viio7), constantly creating tension that resolves to G (or a G-based chord like G/F#).
    *   The other chords (D/F#, Am/E, Cmaj7/E) are the V, ii, and IV chords of G major respectively, which are the building blocks of tonal harmony.
    *   The F#min chord is a chromatic mediant or, more likely in this context, a chromatic passing chord. The C# in the F#min chord chromatically descends to C in the Cmaj7 chord, creating a smooth melodic line.

8.  **Structure the Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **Key: G Major (Ionian Mode)**.
    *   Provide a detailed breakdown of why.
    *   Explain the role of each chord relative to G major.
        *   **F#dim:** The leading tone chord (vii°7), constantly pulling to the tonic, G.
        *   **D/F#:** The dominant chord (V).
        *   **Cmaj7/E:** The subdominant chord (IV).
        *   **Am/E:** The supertonic chord (ii).
        *   **G/F#:** The tonic chord (I) with the leading tone in the bass.
    *   Address the "odd" chord: the F#min. Explain it as a chromatic passing chord, detailing the voice-leading of the C# moving down to C. This shows a deeper understanding.
    *   Summarize why it's not another key or mode. Briefly explain why the diatonic chords of other modes don't fit (e.g., D would be minor in G Dorian, C would be C# in G Lydian).
    *   Conclude by reinforcing the initial answer. The progression is a functional, diatonic progression in G Major, with strong emphasis on the dominant-tonic pull (F#dim -> G) and a single, elegant chromatic embellishment.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **G Major**.

The mode is the standard **Major (or Ionian)** mode. While the progression uses some interesting chromaticism, its foundation is firmly in the key of G Major.

---

### Detailed Analysis:

Let's break down the chords and their function within the key of G Major (G-A-B-C-D-E-F#).

1.  **The Tonal Center: F#dim**
    The most frequently occurring chord is **F#dim**. In the key of G Major, the F# diminished chord is the **leading tone chord (vii°)**. Its entire purpose is to create tension that strongly wants to resolve to the tonic chord, G major. The constant repetition of F#dim establishes G as the "home" key you're waiting to hear.

2.  **Diatonic Chords that Fit G Major:**
    *   **D/F#:** This is a **D major** chord with an F# in the bass. D major is the **dominant chord (V)** in the key of G major. This is the second-strongest piece of evidence.
    *   **Cmaj7/E:** This is a **C major 7** chord with an E in the bass. C major is the **subdominant chord (IV)** in G major. This fits perfectly.
    *   **Am/E:** This is an **A minor** chord with an E in the bass. A minor is the **supertonic chord (ii)** in G major. This also fits perfectly.
    *   **G/F#:** This is a **G major** chord with an F# in the bass. This is the **tonic chord (I)**, but it uses the leading tone (F#) as the bass note, which maintains that tension even while playing the "home" chord.

3.  **The Chromatic Chord: F#min**
    The progression includes one chord that is not diatonic to G major: **F#min**.
    *   The chords just before and after it are F#dim and Cmaj7.
    *   F#dim: **F# - A - C**
    *   **F#min: F# - A - C#**
    *   Cmaj7: **C - E - G - B**

    The F#min chord is likely being used as a **chromatic passing chord**. Notice the beautiful voice-leading: the C# from the F#min chord resolves down by a semitone to the C in the Cmaj7 chord. This is a common and sophisticated technique to add color and smooth melodic motion between chords.

### Summary of Chord Functions in G Major:

*   **F#dim:** vii° (leading tone, creates tension)
*   **D/F#:** V (dominant, creates tension)
*   **Am/E:** ii (pre-dominant)
*   **Cmaj7/E:** IV (subdominant)
*   **G/F#:** I (tonic, resolution)
*   **F#min:** Chromatic passing chord

### Why it's not another mode:

*   **G Dorian:** The D chord would be D minor (Dm), not D major.
*   **G Lydian:** The C chord would be C# major (C#maj7), not Cmaj7.
*   **G Mixolydian:** The F# would be F natural (F), not F#.

The presence of a major D chord, a major C chord, and an F# leading tone all point conclusively to **G Major**.
