### Reasoning

**Interpreting chord progressions**

I’m working on interpreting the sequence of slash chords and diminished chords. The progression includes many F#dim and D/F#, suggesting a key area around D major or minor. D/F# represents a D major triad in first inversion, while F#dim is the leading-tone diminished triad in G major. The F#dim triad also relates to E harmonic minor. It looks like F#dim serves as the leading tone in both G major and G minor.**Examining harmonic minor chords**

I’m looking at G harmonic minor, which uses F# as a leading tone. The diminished triad F# A C serves as vii° in G minor. D/F# represents a D major chord with F# in the bass, functioning as V6 in G major. Also, Am/E indicates an A minor chord with E in the bass, suggesting a ii6/4 situation. G/F# suggests a G major chord with F# as bass, possibly forming a Gmaj7/F#. The details are really coming together!**Analyzing chord functions**

I notice that F# isn’t part of the G major triad, but when used as a slash chord, it functions as a leading-tone passing tone between G (the tonic) and Em (the vi). In G major, F#dim is likely functioning as vii°. Analyzing the chord sequence, there’s significant repetition of F#dim and D/F#, creating an ostinato. So, the key might be G major, with a pedal leading-tone F#. The Cmaj7/E indicates a first inversion of IVmaj7, adding depth to the progression.**Confirming diatonic chords in G major**

It looks like Cmaj7 functions as the IV7 chord in G major because it contains the notes C, E, G, and B—all part of G major. Am/E is the ii chord, with E in the bass, which is diatonically sound too. G/F# acts as the I chord with a leading tone in the bass, while D/F# serves as V, also diatonic. All these fit nicely into G major, reinforcing that the key is G major (Ionian). However, the strong presence of F# in the bass could introduce a Locrian feel.**Determining key and mode**

All the chords fit G major, particularly with Cmaj7/E reinforcing the tonality. Even though F# may suggest E minor, the progression lacks Em chords, leaning more towards G major. The presence of F#dim and D/F# indicates a diatonic function, supporting G major as the tonal center. Additionally, the final resolution points to G rather than E. Overall, I conclude that the key is G major and the mode is Ionian, as the chords consistently align with that framework.**Consolidating key analysis**

Although I could analyze the progression in E natural minor due to chords like Am/E, Cmaj7/E, and G/F#, the tonal center isn't E, as the piece doesn't resolve to Em. I’m concluding that the key is G major (Ionian). While it's possible to see it as E natural minor if the context supports E, the absence of an Em chord leans towards G major. The breakdown includes diatonic chords, leading to the conclusion: Key: G major; Mode: Ionian. An alternate interpretation as E Aeolian is possible.

Key: G major
Mode: Ionian

Why: Every chord is diatonic to G major:
- F#dim = vii°
- D/F# = V6
- Am/E = ii6/4
- G/F# = I with the major 7th in the bass (passing)
- Cmaj7/E = IVmaj7/3

These functions center on G, with F# acting as the leading tone. Note: The same set fits E natural minor (relative), but there’s no clear i (Em) cadence; the emphasis on F#→G motion points to G major.
