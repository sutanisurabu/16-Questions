Let's break this down step by step to determine the key and mode.

### Step 1: Identify the notes in each chord
We'll extract the notes for each chord to analyze the overall pitch collection.

1. **F#dim**: F# A C  
2. **D/F#**: D F# A (same as D major, with F# in the bass)  
3. **Am/E**: A C E (same as A minor, with E in the bass)  
4. **G/F#**: G B D F# (G major with F# in the bass, implying Gmaj7 or F# added)  
5. **Cmaj7/E**: C E G B (Cmaj7 with E in the bass)  

### Step 2: Compile all unique notes
From the chords, the unique notes are:  
**F#, A, C, D, E, G, B**  

This gives us:  
- **F#** (not in C major, but appears in D major or G major)  
- **A, C, D, E, G, B** (all in C major except F#)  

### Step 3: Analyze the tonal center
The progression revolves around **F#dim** and **D/F#**, suggesting **D major** as a likely key because:
- F#dim is the **vii° chord in G major** or **ii° in E minor**, but it also functions as **vii°/V in D major** (leading to G, which appears as G/F#).  
- D/F# is the **I chord in D major**.  

### Step 4: Check for mode or minor tonic
The presence of **Am/E (vi in D major)** and **Cmaj7/E (IV in D major)** supports **D major**, not B minor (the relative minor), because:
- B minor would emphasize B, D, F# (i chord), but **B is absent as a root**.  
- The **F#dim** is **vii° in G major**, but here it’s likely **vii°/V in D major** (F# A C is the leading-tone chord resolving to G).  

### Step 5: Rule out other keys
- **G major**: F#dim is vii°, but the absence of a G major tonic (except as G/F#) and the prominence of D/F# weakens this.  
- **E minor**: F#dim is ii°, but E minor’s tonic (E) is only present in Am/E and Cmaj7/E, not as a root.  

### Final Determination
The **tonal center is D major**, with the **F#dim functioning as vii°/V** (leading to G/F#). The progression is **diatonic to D major**, not modal (no borrowed chords or chromaticism outside D major).  

**Answer:**  
**Key: D Major**  
**Mode: Ionian (standard major)**
