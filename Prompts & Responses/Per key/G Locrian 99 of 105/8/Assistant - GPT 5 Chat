Let’s analyze this progression carefully:  

**Progression:**  
Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Bbm/F | Ab/G | Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Dbmaj7/F | Gdim  

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords more clearly

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db  
- **Eb/G** = G–Bb–Eb  
- **Bbm/F** = F–Bb–Db  
- **Ab/G** = G–Ab–C–Eb (Ab major over G)  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F–Ab–C–Db  

---

### Step 2: Note the common tones

Let’s look at recurring tones:

| Chord | Notes |  
|--------|--------|  
| Gdim | G Bb Db |  
| Eb/G | G Bb Eb |  
| Bbm/F | F Bb Db |  
| Ab/G | G Ab C Eb |  
| Dbmaj7/F | F Ab C Db |

Common tones across many chords: **Bb**, **Db**, **Eb**, **F**, **G**, **Ab**, **C**  
Put those in order: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb — that’s **C natural minor (same as Eb major)**.

### Step 3: Tonal center

- The recurrence of **Eb/G** and **Gdim** gives weight to **Eb major** or its relative **C minor.**  
- **Gdim** is the leading-tone diminished chord in Ab major **(vii°/Ab)** and also functions as **iii°** in Eb major.  

Ab and Db chords (Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F) point toward the **Ab–Db** subdominant area, which fits inside the **Eb major** key.

Even more telling, **Eb/G → Gdim** alternation suggests tonic (Eb major, first inversion) resolving into its leading-tone diminished function, then back.

### Step 4: Mode determination

Everything fits neatly within the **Eb major scale** (Eb–F–G–Ab–Bb–C–D).  
There’s no raised or lowered leading tone indicative of a mode like Dorian, Phrygian, etc.  
So the mode is **Ionian (major).**

---

✅ **Final Answer**

- **Key:** Eb Major  
- **Mode:** Ionian  

**Functional view:**
| Chord | Function (in Eb major) |
|--------|------------------------|
| Gdim | iii° (or passing tone chord) |
| Eb/G | I in first inversion |
| Bbm/F | ii⁶ |
| Ab/G | IV⁷/with tonic passing bass |
| Dbmaj7/F | bVIImaj7/with inverted bass (borrowed from Mixolydian color) |

So:  
**Key = Eb major**  
**Mode = Ionian**
