To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Chords

List all chords with their root notes and qualities:

- **Gdim** = G–B♭–D♭  
- **Eb/G** = G in bass, chord is E♭ major (E♭–G–B♭) → **1st inversion of E♭ major**  
- **Bbm/F** = F in bass, chord is B♭ minor (B♭–D♭–F) → **2nd inversion of B♭ minor**  
- **Ab/G** = G in bass, chord is A♭ major (A♭–C–E♭) → This is a **slash chord** implying a **G bass under A♭ major** → creates a **G half-diminished or G7♭9♭13** type sound, but let’s keep it as A♭/G for now  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F in bass, chord is D♭maj7 (D♭–F–A♭–C) → **2nd inversion of D♭ major 7**

So we have recurring use of:
- **Gdim**
- **E♭ major**
- **B♭ minor**
- **A♭ major**
- **D♭ major 7**

All of these chords contain notes that belong to the key of **E♭ minor** or **G♭ major**, but let’s check more carefully.

### Step 2: Look for Common Key Centers

List all the **unique pitches** used in the chords:

- **Gdim**: G, B♭, D♭  
- **Eb**: E♭, G, B♭  
- **Bbm**: B♭, D♭, F  
- **Ab**: A♭, C, E♭  
- **Dbmaj7**: D♭, F, A♭, C

Collect all notes:
- G, B♭, D♭, E♭, F, A♭, C

That’s **7 notes**:  
**C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭**

This is the key signature of **E♭ minor** (natural minor):  
E♭ natural minor = E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭ → Wait! That’s **G♭ and C♭**, not G and C.

But our chords use **G natural and C natural**, **not G♭ or C♭**.

So E♭ natural minor is **not** it.

What key has **C natural, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭**?

Let’s arrange in order starting from **C**:

C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭

Compare to standard scales.

Try **G Phrygian**: G, A♭, B♭, C, D, E♭, F → nope, includes D♮.

Try **E♭ Mixolydian**: E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭ — **YES!**

E♭ Mixolydian scale =  
**E♭ – F – G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭**

That’s **exactly** the notes we have!

- E♭ Mixolydian is the **5th mode of A♭ major** (A♭ major = A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G)

So our note set matches **A♭ major / E♭ Mixolydian**.

Now, check chord roots:

- Gdim → G is the **7th degree** of A♭ major → vii°  
- Eb/G → E♭ is the **5th degree** of A♭ → V  
- Bbm/F → B♭ minor is the **2nd degree** → ii  
- Ab/G → A♭/G → A♭ is the **tonic**, but with G in bass → this is **♭VII chord in E♭ Mixolydian**, or **I with leading tone bass**  
- Dbmaj7/F → D♭ is the **4th degree** of A♭ → IVmaj7

But notice: **the tonal center seems to hover around G?** Because G is in the bass of many chords: Eb/G, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F, and Gdim.

However, the **harmonic function** suggests **E♭** is important (E♭ appears as a major chord, and E♭ Mixolydian fits).

But wait — there’s **no E♭ in the bass** except in Eb/G, which is actually **G in bass**.

So perhaps the **bass line** is driving the progression around **G**.

Let’s examine the bass notes:

Sequence of bass notes:
G – G – G – G –  
G – G – F – G –  
G – G – G – G –  
G – G – F – G

So almost entirely **G in the bass**, with occasional **F** (under Bbm and Dbmaj7).

This suggests a **pedal point on G**, with changing upper harmonies.

If G is the tonal center, what mode has G as tonic and includes these notes?

Our notes: G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F

That’s **G Locrian ♮2** (also called G half-diminished scale), which is the 6th mode of B♭ melodic minor.

But more commonly, this set is the **G diminished scale**? No, diminished scale is 8 notes.

Alternatively, consider **G as the leading tone** in A♭ major.

In **A♭ major**, G is the **leading tone**, and Gdim is the **vii° chord**.

But we’re sitting on G in the bass for most of the progression, so it feels like **G is the root**, but the harmony is ambiguous.

Now consider **Dbmaj7/F** → contains C♮, which is **not in E♭ natural minor or harmonic minor**, but **is in E♭ melodic minor (ascending)** or E♭ Dorian/Mixolydian.

Wait — **C♮** is the **major 6th** of E♭, which appears in:
- E♭ Dorian (♭3, ♮6)
- E♭ Mixolydian (♮3, ♮6)
- E♭ melodic minor (♮6, ♮7)

But we have **G♮ (major 3rd)** and **C♮ (major 6th)**, and **D♭ (♭7)** → that’s **E♭ Mixolydian**.

So the **harmonic palette** is **E♭ Mixolydian** (from A♭ major), but the **bass pedal on G** (the 3rd of E♭) creates a **modal interchange or polychordal feel**.

However, the **final chord is Gdim**, which gives an unstable, unresolved feeling — typical of diminished chords.

But notice **Dbmaj7/F** appears right before the final Gdim.  
Db = D♭, which is the **♭5 of G** → so **Gdim and D♭maj7** share notes:  
- Gdim = G–B♭–D♭  
- D♭maj7 = D♭–F–A♭–C

They share **D♭**, but otherwise contrast.

This sounds like **tritone substitution** or **diminished resolution**.

Another angle: All chords can be seen as derived from **A♭ major**:

- Gdim = vii°  
- Eb = V  
- Bbm = ii  
- Ab = I  
- Db = IV

So the entire progression uses **diatonic chords from A♭ major**, with **G in the bass** as a pedal.

Therefore, the **underlying key is A♭ major**, but the **mode is obscured by the pedal on G**.

However, if we consider **the tonal center to be E♭**, then **E♭ Mixolydian** makes sense because:
- E♭ is a major chord
- D♭ (♭7) is present (in Dbmaj7 and Gdim)
- C (6th) is present
- G (3rd) is present

And Mixolydian is often used in jazz, blues, and rock for dominant-like sounds.

But **the absence of A♭ in root position** (only as Ab/G) weakens A♭ as tonic.

Meanwhile, **E♭ major appears clearly as Eb/G**, which is a strong V chord in A♭, but if E♭ feels like “home,” then Mixolydian.

But does E♭ feel like home? The progression never **resolves** to E♭ in root position — always in 1st inversion over G.

Given the **persistent G bass**, perhaps the **real tonal center is G**, and the mode is **G Phrygian ♭4?** Unlikely.

Alternative interpretation: This progression is built from **symmetrical diminished harmony**.

Gdim is a fully diminished chord, which is **symmetrical every minor 3rd**.

Gdim = G–B♭–D♭–E (enharmonic F♭)

This chord can resolve to **A♭, E♭, B♭, or F**, all of which appear in the progression as chord roots or bass notes.

In jazz, **Gdim often functions as a rootless G7♭9**, leading to **C♭ (or B)** — but we don’t have that.

Wait — **Dbmaj7** is **tritone away from G7**. G7 would resolve to C♭, but D♭ is enharmonic to C♯, not helpful.

Maybe it's **chromatic mediant relationships**.

Let’s consider the possibility that this is in **E♭ minor with modal mixture**.

E♭ minor (harmonic): E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D  
→ doesn’t fit (we have G♮, C♮)

E♭ melodic minor (ascending): E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D  
→ We have D♭, not D♮ → so **not melodic minor**

Therefore, **D♭ rules out E♭ melodic minor**.

So back to **E♭ Mixolydian** (from A♭ major): contains D♭ and C♮ — yes.

Thus, the **key is A♭ major**, and if focusing on E♭, the **mode is Mixolydian**.

But the **bass pedal on G** (the major 3rd of E♭) is unusual.

In many modern/jazz contexts, this type of progression is **centered on the dominant (V)** with pedal on the 3rd, creating a **bluesy or modal dominant sound**.

**Conclusion:**

- The **harmonic material** comes from **A♭ major** (7 sharps? No — A♭ major has 4 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭).
- The **chords are diatonic to A♭ major**.
- The **bass pedal on G** (the leading tone of A♭) creates tension.
- The **implied tonal center** is **E♭**, using the **Mixolydian mode** (characterized by major triad with ♭7).

✅ **Most coherent analysis**:  
**Key: E♭ Mixolydian (mode of A♭ major)**  
**Parent key: A♭ major**

So:

> **Mode: Mixolydian**  
> **Tonal center: E♭**  
> **Parent key: A♭ major**

If forced to pick a single key and mode: **E♭ Mixolydian**.
