**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or leading tones, so I should look for a key that fits these chords.

Let me list out the chords with their full names:

- Gdim: G diminished triad. Since it's diminished, it's probably G Bb Db.

- Eb/G: This is an Eb major chord with a G in the bass. So the chord is Eb G Bb, but with G as the bass note.

- Bbm/F: Bb minor chord with F in the bass. So Bb Db F, with F bass.

- Ab/G: Ab major chord with G in the bass. So Ab C Eb, with G bass.

- Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th chord with F in the bass. So Db F Ab C, with F bass.

The progression has a lot of Gdim and Eb/G, and ends with Dbmaj7/F and Gdim.

I recall that diminished chords are symmetrical and can function in various ways. Gdim is the same as Bbdim, Dbdim, and Edim because of the symmetry. So Gdim = Bbdim = Dbdim = Edim.

Now, let's think about the key. Eb major has chords like Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim. But here we have Gdim, which is not in Eb major directly. Gdim would be G Bb Db, which in Eb major, the vii chord is Ddim, which is D F Ab, so not Gdim.

Perhaps it's in a minor key. Eb minor has chords like Ebm, Fdim, Gb, Abm, Bbm, Cb, Db. But Gdim doesn't fit directly.

Another thought: diminished chords are often used as secondary leading-tone chords or as common-tone diminished chords.

Let me look at the bass movement. The bass has a lot of G, and then F, and then back to G, and ends with F and G. So G is a persistent bass note.

In the chords, we have Eb/G, which is Eb major over G, so it's like a first inversion Eb chord, but with G bass, it might be functioning as a dominant or something.

Similarly, Ab/G is Ab major over G, which is like a dominant seventh chord without the root or something? Ab/G would be Ab C Eb with G bass, so if I think of G as the root, it could be a G7 chord with b9? G7 would be G B D F, but here we have Ab C Eb, which is Ab major, so over G, it's like G Ab C Eb, which is G7b9? Let's see: G7b9 would be G B D F Ab, so if we have G Ab C Eb, that's missing B and D, but has C and Eb, which are like b9, b10? No, standard G7b9 is G B D F Ab. Here we have G Ab C Eb, so the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. That could be interpreted as Gdim7 with an Ab? Gdim7 is G Bb Db E, so not quite.

Perhaps it's an altered dominant. But let's list all the notes involved.

First, Gdim: G Bb Db

Eb/G: Eb G Bb — so notes Eb G Bb

Bbm/F: Bb Db F — so notes Bb Db F

Ab/G: Ab C Eb G — so notes Ab C Eb G

Dbmaj7/F: Db F Ab C — so notes Db F Ab C

Now, let's see the common notes. G is frequently in the bass. Also, Eb and Bb appear often.

Perhaps the key is C minor or something. C minor has chords like Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb. But Gdim is not in C minor; Gm is G Bb D, which is minor, not diminished.

Another idea: Gdim might be functioning as a leading tone chord to Ab or something. In Ab major, the vii chord is Gdim, which is G Bb Db, and that matches. So if the key is Ab major, then Gdim is the vii° chord.

Now, let's check if other chords fit Ab major. Ab major has chords: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.

In the progression, we have Eb/G, which is Eb major, which is the V chord in Ab major. Eb/G is just first inversion, so that fits.

We have Bbm/F, which is ii chord in Ab major, first inversion? Bbm is the ii chord, and Bbm/F is with F bass, which is the fifth of Bbm, so that's fine.

We have Ab/G, which is Ab major with G bass. In Ab major, Ab is the I chord, but with G bass, it might be a dominant function. Ab/G could be seen as a V7/I or something? Actually, in jazz, sometimes I chord with dominant bass is used, but let's see.

We have Dbmaj7/F, which is Db major 7th, which is the IV chord in Ab major. Db is IV, and Db maj7 is fine.

And we have Gdim, which is vii°.

So all chords seem to fit in Ab major: I (Ab), ii (Bbm), IV (Db), V (Eb), vii° (Gdim).

In the progression, we have Ab/G, which is I chord with G bass. In Ab major, if we have Ab/G, that could be interpreted as a V7 chord resolving to I, but here it's I with dominant bass? Perhaps it's a common device where the I chord is played with the seventh in the bass, implying a V7/I, but in this case, Ab/G has notes G Ab C Eb, which is similar to G7b9 without the B and D? But in context, it might be functioning as a dominant preparation.

Let's see the progression: ... Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim ... so after Ab/G, it goes to Gdim, which is vii°, and then to Eb/G, etc.

In Ab major, the vii° chord should lead to I, but here it goes to Eb/G, which is V, so that might be fine.

Also, the progression ends with Dbmaj7/F and Gdim. Dbmaj7 is IV, and then Gdim is vii°, which might not be a strong resolution, but it could be.

Perhaps the key is Ab major, and the mode is major.

But let's confirm the chords in Ab major:

- Gdim: vii° - yes

- Eb/G: V - yes, first inversion

- Bbm/F: ii - yes, first inversion

- Ab/G: I with G bass - this is a bit unusual, but it might be used as a passing chord or something.

- Dbmaj7/F: IV maj7 - yes

So overall, it seems to fit.

But let's see the order: the progression starts with Gdim, then Eb/G, then Gdim, then Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Eb/G, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

So it seems like Gdim is used frequently, almost like a pedal point or something.

In Ab major, G is the leading tone, so having Gdim emphasizes the leading tone.

Also, Eb/G is V with third in bass, which is common.

Bbm/F is ii with fifth in bass.

Ab/G is I with seventh in bass, which might be used to create tension before resolving to something, but here it goes to Gdim, which is vii°, so perhaps it's a sequence.

Another thought: in some contexts, Ab/G could be seen as G7b9 sus or something, but in Ab major, it might just be a chromatic passing chord.

Perhaps the key is Eb major, but let's see. In Eb major, the chords would be Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim. Here we have Gdim, which is not in Eb major, and Bbm which is not in Eb major (Bbm is minor, but in Eb major, ii is Fm, iii is Gm, iv is Ab, v is Bb, vi is Cm, vii is Ddim). So Bbm is not in Eb major; Bb is major. So that doesn't fit.

Similarly, Ab is in Eb major, but Ab/G is not standard.

So Ab major seems better.

But let's check the Dbmaj7/F. Db is the subdominant in Ab major, so that's fine.

Now, about the mode: since it's Ab major, the mode is major. But sometimes progressions can imply other modes, but here the chords are diatonically from Ab major, so it should be major.

But let's list the notes of Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G. All chords use these notes.

Gdim: G Bb Db - all in Ab major.

Eb/G: Eb G Bb - all in Ab major.

Bbm/F: Bb Db F - all in Ab major.

Ab/G: Ab C Eb G - all in Ab major.

Dbmaj7/F: Db F Ab C - all in Ab major.

So yes, all chords are diatonic to Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

The progression ends with Dbmaj7/F and Gdim, which is IV and vii°, so it might not have a strong tonic resolution, but that's okay for a progression.

So I think the key is Ab major.

The chord progression provided is entirely diatonic to the key of Ab major. All chords—Gdim (vii°), Eb/G (V in first inversion), Bbm/F (ii in first inversion), Ab/G (I with dominant bass), and Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7 in first inversion)—fit within the Ab major scale (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G). The frequent use of Gdim, which is the leading-tone diminished chord in Ab major, reinforces the key center. The mode is major, as the harmony is based on the major scale.

**Key:** Ab major  
**Mode:** Major
