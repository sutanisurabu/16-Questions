The chords provided are:

* **Gdim** (G Bb Db)
* **Eb/G** ($\text{Eb G Bb}$) - This is an Eb major chord in first inversion.
* **Bbm/F** ($\text{Bb Db F}$) - This is a Bb minor chord in second inversion.
* **Ab/G** ($\text{Ab C Eb}$ with a G in the bass, although the provided text shows it as $\text{Ab/G}$, the notes listed in the pattern are Gdim, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.)

Let's look at the chords used in the sequence:

1. **G dim** (G Bb Db)
2. **Eb/G** (Eb G Bb) - Functionally Eb major.
3. **Bbm/F** (Bb Db F) - Functionally Bb minor.
4. **Ab/G** (Ab C Eb - often realized as an implied Ab)
5. **Dbmaj7/F** (Db F Ab C) - Functionally Db Major 7.

The bass notes (derived from the inversions or explicit notes after the slash) are primarily **G** and **F**. The sequence heavily features **G** in the bass, especially in conjunction with the **Gdim** chord.

Let's analyze the common tones and characteristic intervals:

* **Pervasive Gdim (G Bb Db):** This diminished chord suggests either a $\text{vi}^{\circ}$ or $\text{vii}^{\circ}$ in a major key, or a $\text{ii}^{\circ}$ in minor, or it functions as a secondary dominant/leading-tone chord.
* **Eb Major (Eb G Bb):** The G is present in Gdim and Eb.
* **Db Major and Bb minor:** These chords (Db, F, Ab, C and Bb, Db, F) strongly belong to the key of **Eb Major** (or C Minor).
    * Eb Major: $\text{I}$ is Eb, $\text{vi}$ is C min, $\text{V}$ is Bb, $\text{IV}$ is Ab.
    * In $\text{E}\flat$ Major: $\text{Db}$ is the $\text{bVI}$ (Neapolitan-related, or sometimes $\text{bVII}$ if seen as $\text{Db}$ Lydian), and $\text{Bb}\flat$ minor is the $\text{v}$ (often borrowed from minor).

However, the consistent use of **Gdim** is the key factor.

**The G Diminished Chord:**
In the key of $\text{Eb}$ Major:
The diatonic chords are: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, $\text{D}^{\circ}$.
$\text{G} \text{ diminished}$ (G Bb Db) is an altered chord.

* If we assume a **Minor Key (C Minor):**
    * $\text{C}$ minor (i): C Eb G
    * $\text{D}$ diminished ($\text{ii}^{\circ}$): D F Ab
    * $\text{Eb}$ Major ($\text{III}$): Eb G Bb
    * $\text{F}$ minor ($\text{iv}$): F Ab C
    * $\text{G}$ minor ($\text{v}$) or $\text{G}$ Major ($\text{V}$): G Bb D / G B D
    * $\text{Ab}$ Major ($\text{VI}$): Ab C Eb
    * $\text{Bb}$ Major ($\text{VII}$): Bb D F
    * **G Diminished (G Bb Db)** is strongly related to the $\text{vii}^{\circ}$ chord in **Ab Major** (G Bb Db E natural), or a leading tone chord to $\text{Ab}$ via an applied dominant ($\text{V/VI}$).

**Analyzing the Phrygian Dominant Sound (or Hungarian/Gypsy Scale):**
The chords Gdim (G Bb Db), Eb (Eb G Bb), Ab (Ab C Eb), and Db (Db F Ab) contain the notes: **G, Bb, Db, Eb, Ab, C, F.**

If we center the melody around **G** (due to the persistent $\text{G}$ bass and $\text{G dim}$ chord), the resulting scale is:
G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

This scale is notable for:
* **G to Ab:** Half step ($\text{b2}$)
* **G to Db:** Augmented Fourth (tritone, characteristic of Gdim)
* **G to Eb:** Minor Sixth ($\text{b6}$)

This collection of notes perfectly matches the structure of the **G Phrygian Dominant** scale, also known as **G Mixolydian $\text{b2}$** (G Ab B C D Eb F G) - *except* that we have **Bb** instead of B, and **Db** instead of D.

Wait, let's re-examine the scale derived from the chords:
G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

This scale is the **G Locrian $\text{b4}$** scale. This is highly improbable as a key.

**Focusing on common harmonic practices:**

The harmonic movement includes:
* **Eb Major (Tonic equivalent or III/VI)**
* **Db Major (bVII or bVI)**
* **Bbm (v in Eb Minor, or ii in Db Major)**
* **Gdim (leading tone function)**

This pattern often appears in keys related to $\text{Eb}$ or $\text{Ab}$, but with significant borrowing from the parallel minor or modal interchange, particularly the use of **Db Major ($\text{bVI}$ or $\text{bVII}$)**.

The combination of the chords strongly points towards either a **Minor Key** or a **Dorian/Phrygian Mode** centered on **G** or **C**.

**Hypothesis 1: Key of C Minor (C Phrygian or Harmonic Minor)**
* $\text{Gdim}$ (G Bb Db) is the $\text{V/bVI}$ (V of Ab).
* $\text{Eb}$ (III)
* $\text{Bbm}$ (borrowed $\text{v}$ from $\text{C}$ Phrygian or $\text{C}$ minor)
* $\text{Dbmaj7}$ (bII in $\text{C}$ Phrygian, or $\text{bVI}$ in $\text{C}$ minor)

If the key is $\text{C}$ minor, the presence of $\text{Gdim}$ (G Bb Db) where the diatonic dominant is G major (G B D) or the diatonic $\text{vii}^{\circ}$ is $\text{B}^{\circ}$ (B D F), shows that the key is being heavily altered.

**Hypothesis 2: Key of Eb Major (or C Minor Relatives)**

The presence of $\text{Eb}$ Major and the related $\text{Dbmaj7}$ and $\text{Bb}\flat\text{m}$ suggests a very common progression in Pop/Jazz where the tonic is $\text{Eb}$ Major, but the minor subdominant (or $\text{Db}$, its flat $\text{bVII}$ neighbor) is used.

**Hypothesis 3: E-flat Harmonic Minor (Scale: Eb F Gb Ab Bb C D)**
Does Gdim (G Bb Db) fit? No.
Does Dbmaj7 (Db F Ab C) fit? No.

**The Key to the Riddle: Phrygian/Locrian Dominant**

In traditional harmony, the G diminished triad (G $\text{Bb}$ $\text{Db}$) would function as $\text{V}^{\circ}\text{/C}$ (dominant of $\text{C}$ minor) if $\text{C}$ minor were the tonic, but the root is diminished, not natural.

The most defining feature is the **G diminished triad**. This triad often arises in the context of:
1. **Eb Harmonic Minor $(\text{i}_{G})$:** No.
2. **Ab Major $(\text{V}^{\circ}\text{ to C})$:** No.

**Gdim** is the $\text{vii}^{\circ}$ of **A-flat Major** if the notes were G Bb Db E-natural.

However, in many modal contexts, Gdim functions as a chord centered around **G** containing $\text{b3}$ and $\text{b5}$.

Given the frequent appearance of **Eb Major** (or $\text{Eb/G}$) and the strong influence of the **Db Major** chord ($\text{bVII}$ in $\text{Eb}$ minor, or $\text{bVI}$ in $\text{F}$ minor), this progression is commonly categorized under modes related to $\text{Eb}$ minor scale variants.

If we assume the **Key Center is G (due to bass line and Gdim):**
* Chords: Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Dbmaj7, Ab.
The characteristic intervals of G are $\text{b2}$ (Ab or $\text{Bb}$), $\text{b3}$ (Bb), $\text{b5}$ (Db), $\text{b6}$ (Eb), $\text{b7}$ (F).

This aligns best with the **G Phrygian Mode** (G Ab Bb C Db Eb F G).

Let's check the chords against **G Phrygian:**
* $\text{G}$ Phrygian (i): G Bb Db (No, G B D is i in G Phrygian)
* Wait, the standard G Phrygian scale is: G Ab Bb C D Eb F.

1. **Gdim (G Bb Db):** Fits G $\text{b3}$ $\text{b5}$.
2. **Eb (Eb G Bb):** Fits G $\text{b6}$ $\text{G}$ $\text{b3}$.
3. **Bbm (Bb Db F):** Fits G $\text{b3}$ $\text{b5}$ $\text{b7}$.
4. **Dbmaj7 (Db F Ab C):** Fits G $\text{b5}$ $\text{b7}$ $\text{b2}$ $\text{4}$.

The scale that perfectly contains all these notes (G, Bb, Db, Eb, Ab, C, F) is the **G Phrygian $\text{b4}$ mode** (or a very complex variant of the $\text{G}$ Phrygian scale that includes $\text{C}$ as the $\text{4}$ and $\text{Db}$ as the $\text{b5}$).

**Conclusion based on common musical contexts:**

The presence of the $\text{bII}$ (Ab), $\text{bIII}$ (Bb $\text{D} \flat \text{F}$? No, $\text{Bb}$m), $\text{bV}$ (Db), and $\text{bVI}$ (Eb) strongly indicates a modal key where the root is **G** and the predominant color is **flat**.

* The heavy use of the Gdim triad and the G bass line strongly suggests **G** is the root.
* The presence of Ab (b2), Bb (b3), Db (b5), and Eb (b6) unequivocally points to the **G Phrygian mode**.

**Key and Mode:**
**Key:** G
**Mode:** Phrygian (G Ab Bb C D Eb F)

*(Note: The Gdim chord (G Bb Db) is the $\text{i}^{\circ}$ chord in the G Phrygian scale if the scale contained a diminished triad built on the root, but the diatonic $\text{i}$ in Phrygian is minor (G Bb D). The use of the $\text{Gdim}$ here creates a Phrygian sound with an altered root chord, sometimes referred to as 'Phrygian Major' if the dominant chord was major, but here the whole progression maintains the Phrygian dark quality.)*

The G diminished triad is the distinguishing factor, defining the sound as strongly modal and altered. Therefore, the best fit is **G Phrygian**.
