### Step 1: Analyze Chord Functions and Pitches

Let’s break down each chord’s **root and quality**, and note the **bass note** since some are slash chords:

| Segment | Chord       | Bass | Notes (approx)                     | Function/Analysis |
|---------|-------------|------|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1–2     | Gdim        | G    | G–Bb–Db                            | diminished triad |
| 3–4     | Eb/G        | G    | G–Bb–Db (same as Gdim)             | **Inversion of Ebmaj7?** (Eb–G–Bb–D?) — but bass is G → G is the 3rd of Eb maj7 |
| 5–6     | Gdim        | G    | G–Bb–Db                            |                  |
| 7–8     | Bbm/F       | F    | F–Ab–C (Bbm triad = Bb–Db–F → F bass makes it 1st inversion) | Bbm triad, F = 5th → **F is the 5th of Bbm** |
| 9–10    | Ab/G        | G    | G–Bb–Db (same as Gdim again?)      | Ab minor triad = Ab–Cb–Eb → with G bass? **G is not in Ab minor!** Let’s check: Ab–Cb–Eb with G = **Ab7?** Ab–Cb–Eb–G → **Ab7 (dominant 7th)** |
| 11–12   | Eb/G        | G    | G–Bb–Db                            | Again, same as before |
| 13–14   | Gdim        | G    | G–Bb–Db                            |                  |
| 15      | Dbmaj7/F    | F    | F–Ab–C–Eb? Wait: Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C → bass is F → **F is the 3rd of Dbmaj7** |
| 16      | Gdim        | G    | G–Bb–Db                            |                  |

### Step 2: Spot the Hidden Keys

Even though most chords are Gdim or slash chords with G in the bass, the **upper structure** implies **other keys**.

Let’s consider **Eb/G** and **Dbmaj7/F** — these are very telling.

#### Eb/G = G–Bb–Db (same as Gdim) — but **Eb major 7th** is: **Eb–G–Bb–D**

So if Eb/G = G in bass, and the upper structure is Eb major 7th (G = 3rd, Bb = 5th, D = 7th), then **Eb major** is being implied.

Similarly, **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C, with F in bass → F is the **3rd** of Dbmaj7 → so again, we’re in **Db major**.

Wait — so we’re moving from **Eb** to **Db**?

That’s a **flat second** relationship — unusual, but common in jazz and modal interchange.

Also, **Bbm/F** — Bbm = Bb–Db–F, F in bass → F is the 5th → so key of **Bb minor**?

### Step 3: Look for Tonic and Modal Center

Even though **Gdim** is repeated many times, it’s never a tonic chord — G is the **root** of diminished, but diminished chords rarely tonicize unless in very specific contexts (e.g., leading tone).

However, the **most stable harmonic functions** are:

- **Eb/G** — implies **Eb major** (the 3rd in bass, but the harmony is Eb maj7)
- **Dbmaj7/F** — implies **Db major** (with 3rd in bass)

Both Eb and Db are **half-step apart** → this is a classic jazz move: **chromatic mediant** or **tritone substitution** context.

But here, we’re going from **Eb major** → **Db major** — a **minor 2nd** (half-step down).

This is **very characteristic of the Phrygian mode**!

> **Phrygian mode**: 1 – ♭2 – ♭3 – 4 – 5 – ♭6 – ♭7  
> So if the tonic is **Eb**, then the ♭2 is **D** → but we have **Db**.

Wait — **Db** is the ♭2 of **C**, not Eb.

Let’s try setting **Db** as the **tonic**.

#### Try Db as Tonic → Db Phrygian:

- Db (1)
- **Eb** (♭2) ← YES! We have Eb chords!
- F (♭3)
- Gb (4)
- Ab (5)
- Bbb (♭6)
- Cb (♭7)

We’re seeing **Eb chords** — and Eb is the **♭2** of Db!

Also, **Bbm** — Bb is the ♭3 of Db? Db → C (7), Bb (5), Ab (4), Gb (3), **F (2)**, **Eb (♭2)**, **Db (1)**

Wait — **Bbm** = Bb–Db–F

- Db = tonic → **Bb is the ♭3**
- F = ♭6? No. Db minor scale: Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab–Bbb–Cb → so Bb is **NOT** in there.

Wait — **F** = ♭6 of Db? Db to F is a **major 3rd** → F = **#5**? Not standard.

Perhaps **Bbm** is a borrowed chord.

### Step 4: Realization — This is a **Phrygian Mode**, **Tonic = Db**

Let’s test it fully.

We observe:
- **Gdim** appears 8x — Gdim is **Bb minor 7b5**? Or **viio7 of C**? Not helpful.

But look at:

- **Eb/G** — Eb major 7th triad with G in bass → **G is the 3rd of Eb** → so **Eb** is functioning as **a chord above G**.
- **Ab/G** — G in bass, Ab–Cb–Eb → **Ab7** = Ab–Cb–Eb–G → **G is minor 7th** → **Ab7**!
- **Dbmaj7/F** — F is 3rd of Db → so **Db major 7th** is implied.

So key = Db major? But then Eb is the ♭2, Ab is the ♭6, Bbm is ♭3 minor?

That’s **exactly the Db Phrygian mode**!

Let’s map Db Phrygian:

| Degree | Note  | Chord Quality | Notes | In Key? |
|--------|-------|---------------|-------|---------|
| 1 (Tonic) | Db    | Dbmaj7        | Db–F–Ab–C | ✅ Dbmaj7/F — chord heard |
| ♭2      | Eb    | Ebmaj7        | Eb–G–Bb–D | ✅ Eb/G — G is 3rd → implied |
| ♭3      | F     | Fmin7?        | F–Ab–C–Eb | Not present |
| 4       | Gb    | Gb7?          | Not present |
| 5       | Ab    | Ab7           | Ab–Cb–Eb–G | ✅ Ab/G — G is 7th → this is **VII7** in Db Phrygian |
| ♭6      | Bbb   | —             | — |
| ♭7      | Cb    | —             | — |

Wait — we have **Bbm/F** — Bb–Db–F

In Db Phrygian, **Bb** is **♭6**? Let’s calculate:

Db Phrygian scale:  
**Db – Eb – Fb – Gb – Ab – Bbb – Cb**

So:

- Bb is **NOT** in the scale — **Bbb (Cbb)** is ♭6.

But Bb is **not diatonic** — so Bbm is a **borrowed chord** from the parallel minor? Db minor?

**Db minor** (natural): Db–Eb–Fb–Gb–Ab–Bbb–Cb → still doesn’t have Bb.

Wait — **Bb** is the **major 6th** of Db.

So **Bbm** = Bb–Db–F = **♭6 minor chord**

This is a **common chromatic chord** in **Phrygian** progressions — often borrowed from Lydian or minor modes.

So: **Db Phrygian** is **the underlying mode**.

**Why?**

- Tonic = Db (implied by Dbmaj7, and final resolution)
- ♭2 chord = Eb (Ebmaj7 or Eb/G — very colorful Phrygian hallmark)
- VII7 chord = Ab7 = Ab–Cb–Eb–G → **dominant 7th on ♭7**? Wait — Ab is ♭6!

Wait — in Db Phrygian, **Ab = ♭6**

Standard Phrygian dominant is often on the 5th degree — e.g., E Phrygian has B7 as V.

But here, the **VII7** = **Ab7** is being used as a **secondary dominant** or **modal color chord**.

In Phrygian mode, it’s common to have the **♭II chord** (Eb) and the **♭VI chord** (e.g., Bbm) as strong color chords.

Bbm = Bb–Db–F = **♭6 minor root, with ♭6–1–3**

So: Bbm = ♭6 minor → classic in Phrygian!

Also, **Gdim** — G–Bb–Db — Db is the tonic, so Gdim is **viio7 in Db minor?**

Wait: In Db minor, the leading tone is **C**, and Cdim7 = C–Eb–Gb–Bbb — not Gdim.

Gdim = G–Bb–Db — so **G is ♭7 of Ab?** Or **Bb is ♭3 of Db?**

Actually — **Gdim = viio7 of A major** — not helpful.

But notice: **Gdim = Bb minor 7b5** = Bb–Db–F–Ab? No — Gdim is just triad: G–Bb–Db.

**Db is the tonic** → so Gdim = **viio7?** — no, viio7 would be **Cdim7**.

Wait — **Gdim = G–Bb–Db** = **Db minor 6ths**? Not quite.

Actually: **Gdim = Bb minor 7b5** (if we added F) → but here we have **no F**.

So perhaps **Gdim is just a passing diminished chord** — common as a chromatic passing chord leading into the ♭2 or tonic.

In jazz and modal music, **diminished chords are often used as chromatic approach chords**.

So Gdim moves to **Eb/G** — which is Eb maj7. G is the 3rd → so Gdim → Eb maj7 is **root movement up a minor 3rd (G→Bb→Db) but voice-led to Eb**.

More simply: **Gdim functions as a passing chord between Db and Eb**.

Thus, the whole progression is centered around **Db**, with color from its **Phrygian scale**.

### Step 5: Mode Confirmation

Here’s the Db Phrygian scale:  
**Db – Eb – Fb – Gb – Ab – Bbb – Cb**

The chords we’re hearing:

- **Dbmaj7** → I → tonic
- **Ebmaj7** → ♭II → hallmark of Phrygian
- **Ab7** → ♭VI7? (Ab = ♭6) → common in Phrygian dominant or jazz
- **Bbm** → Bb–Db–F = ♭6 minor (not strictly diatonic, but borrowed — used in Phrygian for color)

The **Gdim** chords are mostly **passing diminished chords**, often acting as **leading tone substitutes** or chromatic neighbors.

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: Db**  
> **Mode: Phrygian**  
> **Full designation: Db Phrygian**

### Why not Db minor?
Because if it were Aeolian (natural minor), the 2nd degree would be **Eb** (minor 2nd), **but** the chord on the 2nd degree is **major 7th (Ebmaj7)** — which is NOT diatonic to Db Aeolian.

In Db Aeolian: 2nd degree is **Ebdim** or **Ebm7** (minor 7th flat 5).

But here it’s **Ebmaj7** — **major 3rd and major 7th** — this is **only** diatonic in Phrygian mode.

✅ The presence of the **major 7th on the ♭2 degree** is the **hallmark of Phrygian mode**.

This progression is a **beautiful modal jazz phrase** in **Db Phrygian**, using the ♭II chord (Ebmaj7) and ♭VI chord (Bbm) for strong contrast, with Gdim as chromatic passing chords.

### 💡 Bonus Insight
This is similar to the **"Spanish progression"** or **Phrygian cadence** used in flamenco or jazz, e.g.,:

> **Db – Eb – Ab – Db**  
> which is **I – ♭II – ♭VI – I**

Your progression is:  
**Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - ... - Dbmaj7/F**

So:  
- Eb/G = ♭II  
- Ab/G = ♭VI7  
- Dbmaj7/F = I  

The Gdim acts as chromatic tension before resolving to ♭II or tonic.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
> **Key: Db major**  
> **Mode: Phrygian**  
> **Mode of Db: Db Phrygian**  
> *(Mode derived from Cb major? Yes — Db Phrygian = 3rd mode of Cb major — but practically, it’s a tonal center of Db with ♭2 (E) and ♭6 (Bb) color tones.)*
