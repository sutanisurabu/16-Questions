### Reasoning

**Examining the Chords**

I've just begun a deep dive into the chord progression. My initial focus is on identifying each chord type and its function within the sequence. I'm noting the presence of diminished chords, the inversions, and potential relationships between the chords.


**Determining Key and Mode**

I'm now zeroing in on the role of the G diminished chord. Its constant presence is intriguing. Considering it as a tonic is unconventional, so I'm investigating its function as a leading tone. The flat harmonies suggest a key signature with multiple flats, which is informing my analysis of possible modes.


**Exploring Tonic Alternatives**

I'm now contemplating whether $Gdim$ could serve as the tonic in a more unconventional setting. However, the prevalence of flats makes me lean toward a more conventional key with multiple flats. I'm carefully analyzing the relationship between $Gdim$, the major and minor chords, and the inverted chords. The possibility of $A\flat$ minor or $C$ minor keeps popping up.


**Identifying the Root Tones**

Now I'm focusing on the bass line movement and root tones to further clarify the harmonic function. I'm taking the bass notes into consideration, specifically the root movement. The bass line seems to be primarily walking down with the notes $G, G, E\flat, E\flat, B\flat, A\flat, G, E\flat, F$ suggesting a pattern. This bass-line hints at the potential for a pedal tone or passing chords.


**Deciphering the Function**

I'm now determining the function of the $Gdim$ chord and the key by evaluating each chord's relationship. I'm focusing on the flats present and possible scale degrees. My thought process is narrowing the field to C minor or $E\flat$ major, with $Gdim$ as the dominant. I'm also considering how the inversion chords fit in.


**Identifying Harmonic Center**

I've determined the progression's core is likely C Phrygian. The dominant function, built on G and diminished, confirms this. All the chords are now being considered within this modal context. I'm focusing on the flattened notes.




The analysis of this chord progression suggests a highly modal environment, characterized by the consistent use of diminished and flat-leaning chords that rotate around a central pitch.

### 1. Identify the Central Tonal Area

The most pervasive chord in the sequence is **G diminished ($G-B\flat-D\flat$)**. While it does not resolve traditionally, its constant repetition suggests it fulfills a powerful structural role, often acting as a non-traditional dominant or a strong anchor point.

### 2. Analyze the Harmonic Material

The progression features highly flattened harmonies:
*   $Gdim$ ($G, B\flat, D\flat$)
*   $E\flat$ Major ($E\flat, G, B\flat$)
*   $B\flat m$ ($B\flat, D\flat, F$)
*   $A\flat$ Major ($A\flat, C, E\flat$)
*   $D\flat maj7$ ($D\flat, F, A\flat, C$)

The overall common pitch collection is: $C, D\flat, E\flat, F, G, A\flat, B\flat$.

### 3. Determine the Mode

This specific collection of notes corresponds exactly to the scale of **C Phrygian**.

| Degree | C Phrygian | Chord Function built on that degree | Chords present in the progression | Relationship |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| I | C | $C$ minor (Tonic) | Implied (Tonic center) | Tonic |
| $\flat$II | $D\flat$ | $D\flat$ Major | $D\flat maj7$ | $\flat II$ |
| $\flat$III | $E\flat$ | $E\flat$ Major | $E\flat/G$ | $\flat III$ |
| IV | F | $F$ minor | (Implied) | Diatonic |
| V | G | **$G$ diminished** ($G-B\flat-D\flat$) | $Gdim$ | **Dominant ($V^{\circ}$) defining Phrygian** |
| $\flat$VI | $A\flat$ | $A\flat$ Major | $A\flat/G$ | $\flat VI$ |
| $\flat$VII | $B\flat$ | $B\flat$ minor/major | $B\flat m/F$ | $\flat VII$ |

The defining clue is the use of the $V$ chord. In C Minor (Aeolian) or other common minor keys, V is typically *G Major* or *G minor*. The presence of the root G, B-flat, and D-flat makes it a **G diminished chord ($V^{\circ}$)**. This diminished dominant triad is characteristic of the **Phrygian mode** when built on the fifth scale degree (G).

## Conclusion

The **key and mode** for this progression are:

**C Phrygian**
