Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**
Gdim  
Gdim  
Eb/G  
Eb/G  
Gdim  
Gdim  
Bbm/F  
Ab/G  
Gdim  
Gdim  
Eb/G  
Eb/G  
Gdim  
Gdim  
Dbmaj7/F  
Gdim

### Step 1: List the chords clearly with roots:
- Gdim (G–Bb–Db)
- Eb/G (G–Eb–Bb) → 1st inversion of Eb major
- Bbm/F (F–Bb–Db) → 1st inversion of Bb minor
- Ab/G (G–Ab–Eb) → Ab major in 2nd inversion (Ab–C–Eb, but C not present; possible Ab major or partial voicing)
- Dbmaj7/F (F–Ab–C–Eb) → 1st inversion of Db major 7

Wait — note: **Ab/G** is a bit ambiguous. G in the bass with Ab major implies G–Ab–C–Eb? That’s unusual. More likely, the chord is Ab major (Ab–C–Eb) with G in the bass — so Ab/G is Ab over G (G–Ab–C–Eb), which is a **polychord or non-functional voicing**.

But let's look at **root movement**:

Chord roots:
- G (Gdim)
- G (Gdim)
- G (Eb/G)
- G (Eb/G)
- G
- G
- F (Bbm/F)
- G (Ab/G)
- G
- G
- G (Eb/G)
- G (Eb/G)
- G
- G
- F (Dbmaj7/F)
- G (Gdim)

So G dominates, but with bass movement to F and inner chords suggesting broader harmony.

### Step 2: Look at the **actual notes** involved

Let’s collect all chord tones:

- **Gdim** = G, Bb, Db
- **Eb/G** = G, Eb, Bb → notes: G, Bb, Eb
- **Bbm/F** = F, Bb, Db
- **Ab/G** = G, Ab, C, Eb (assuming full Ab major chord)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, Eb

So combining all notes used:
- G
- Bb
- Db
- Eb
- F
- Ab
- C

List: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

That’s:  
G – Ab – Bb – C – Db – Eb – F

Now, arrange in a scale: starting from G:

**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F** → this is **G Phrygian dominant** mode.

Wait — let’s double-check.

But more clearly, reorder as a scale from **Eb**:

Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb – C – Db – Eb → that’s **Eb Phrygian**?

Wait — let's try to find a better root.

Wait — look at chords: Eb/G, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7 — these are all chords from **Eb minor**?

Try: **Eb natural minor** = Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db → but we have **G natural**, not Gb.

We have **G**, not Gb — so not Eb minor.

But we have: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

This is: **Ab major** starting on G → **G Phrygian**

- G Phrygian: G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G

But wait — we have **Db**, not D. Db is the **6th** degree.

So G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F — this is:

**G° (Gdim)** fits, Eb = bVI (in G minor), Bbm = ii in ab? Wait.

Alternative idea: What if the key is **Ab major**?

**Ab major scale**: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Exactly matches our notes:  
- Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G → all present.

So the **parent scale** is **Ab major**.

Now let’s analyze the chords in **Ab major**:

- Gdim = **vii°** of Ab → yes (G–Bb–Db) → leading tone diminished chord of Ab
- Eb/G = **V6** (first inversion of V chord: Eb = V of Ab)
- Bbm/F = **ii6** (ii chord in inversion)
- Ab/G = Ab major chord with G in bass → **I6** (I chord of Ab in first inversion? Wait — Ab/G is G–Ab–C–Eb? But Ab/G should be Ab with G in bass. But G is not in the Ab chord. Ab = Ab–C–Eb. So G is an **extra note**.

Wait — here’s a problem: **Ab/G** — if it's Ab major with G in the bass, G is the **7th** of Ab major. But G is not in the Ab major chord. So is this a **Db7** in second inversion?

Db7 = Db–F–Ab–Cb (but Cb = B), but we have C? No, we have C natural?

Wait no — **C natural** appears in Ab chord (Ab–C–Eb), so C is in chord.

Ab/G = bass G, chord Ab (Ab–C–Eb) → so pitches: G, Ab, C, Eb.

That’s **G–Ab–C–Eb** → which is **same as a Gm7b9** without the 7th? Not quite.

But notice: **G, Ab, C, Eb** — rearranged: Ab–C–Eb–G → **Abmaj7**!

So Ab/G = **Abmaj7** with **G in the bass** → which is **Abmaj7/F**? No — F is not here.

Wait: Abmaj7 = Ab–C–Eb–G → exactly the notes: G, Ab, C, Eb → so **Ab/G** is **Abmaj7** in first inversion (G in bass).

But Ab is the **I chord in Ab major**, so **Abmaj7** is **Imaj7**.

So Ab/G = **Imaj7** in first inversion.

Then earlier chord: **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C → with F in bass → so F–Ab–C–Db → which is **Fm11**? Or more simply, **Dbmaj7** in first inversion.

Dbmaj7 = **IVmaj7** in Ab major (since Db = IV)

So now let’s re-analyze the progression in **Ab major**:

1. Gdim = **vii°**
2. Gdim = **vii°**
3. Eb/G = **V6** (Eb = V, G is 3rd → 1st inversion)
4. Eb/G = **V6**
5. Gdim = **vii°**
6. Gdim = **vii°**
7. Bbm/F = **ii6** (Bb minor = ii, F is 5th → 2nd inversion? Wait — F is the 5th of Bbm — so Bbm/F is **second inversion**, not first. So **ii6/4**)
8. Ab/G = **Imaj7** in first inversion (since Ab/G contains Ab, C, Eb, G)
9. Gdim = **vii°**
10. Gdim = **vii°**
11. Eb/G = **V6**
12. Eb/G = **V6**
13. Gdim = **vii°**
14. Gdim = **vii°**
15. Dbmaj7/F = **IVmaj7** in first inversion (F is 3rd of Db)
16. Gdim = **vii°**

So all chords are diatonic to **Ab major**:
- ii = Bbm
- IV = Dbmaj7
- V = Eb
- I = Ab
- vii° = Gdim
- Imaj7 = Abmaj7

Thus, progression is in **Ab major**, using primarily:
- Gdim (vii°)
- Eb/G (V6)
- Bbm/F (ii6/4)
- Ab/G (Imaj7)
- Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7)

All **diatonic to Ab major**.

The **bass movement** frequently uses G and F, creating smooth voice leading.

### Final Analysis:

- **Key**: **Ab major**
- **Mode**: **Ionian (major)** — it's in a major key, not a mode.
- The **tonic chord** implied is **Ab**, though it only appears in inversion (Ab/G).
- The **dominant** (V) chord Eb appears frequently, reinforcing Ab as tonic.
- The progression has a **circling** motion around the tonic using vii°, V, ii, IV, I.

Despite the prominence of Gdim and G in the bass, the harmonic center is **Ab**, supported by V–I and ii–V–I motion.

---

### Conclusion:

✅ **Key**: **Ab major**  
✅ **Mode**: **Ionian** (natural major)  

The progression uses inversions and the leading tone diminished chord (vii°) to circle the tonic, with strong tonal function.
