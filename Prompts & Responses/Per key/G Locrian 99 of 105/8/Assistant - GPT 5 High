### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to determine key and mode from the chord progression "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." First, I'll parse the chords into a list: Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F. I see Gdim typically as a triad or diminished seventh. For the slash chords, Eb/G means Eb major with G as the bass. This indicates specific bass motion that I’ll analyze further.**Understanding chord structure**

The bass is mainly G for most of the chords, except for Bbm/F, Ab/G, and Dbmaj7/F, which shift to bass F or G. This creates a pedal G, alternating with F. It suggests a G pedal, possibly indicating G Phrygian or G Locrian modes. Now, I need to list the pitch collections: the Gdim triad has G, Bb, and Db, while Eb/G features Eb major over G bass. Eb/G is actually in first inversion, given the G is in the bass position.**Identifying chord notes**

I’m analyzing the chord notes, focusing on Eb, G, and Bb. The Bbm/F consists of a B-flat minor triad (Bb, Db, F) with F as the bass. The Ab/G features an Ab major triad (Ab, C, Eb) over a G bass, and Dbmaj7/F comprises a Db major seventh (Db, F, Ab, C) over F bass. 

Now, I’m looking at the overall scale that includes the notes {G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C}. It appears I have a mode, but it doesn't seem to fit neatly into Db major or C harmonic minor. What about G Phrygian dominant? It aligns better since it includes the right pitches.**Examining G Locrian mode**

So, I’ve checked to see if the notes include B natural and D, but we actually have Bb and Db instead. Next, I considered G Locrian from the Ab major scale, which has notes: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. This matches our pitch collection of G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F exactly. 

With G as the leading tone of Ab major, it suggests G Locrian is a fit. This mode includes Gdim (i°), Eb/G as the VI chord, and Ab/G as a bII.**Determining the key and mode**

In G Locrian, the scale degrees relative to G are: 1 (G), b2 (Ab), b3 (Bb), 4 (C), b5 (Db), b6 (Eb), and b7 (F). The tonic triad is Gdim (G, Bb, Db). Eb major acts as the b6 chord over a tonic pedal, while Bbm/F uses F as the b7, making a plausible progression from b6 to b7.

I conclude that the overall key and mode are G Locrian, with evidence from the pitch set matching Ab major. The recurring G pedal and relevant chords support this conclusion, which fits well in the context of Ab major or F minor.

G Locrian (mode VII of Ab major/F minor).

All chords use only Ab major scale tones {Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G} while centering on a G pedal: Gdim (i°), Eb/G (bVI over 1), Ab/G (bII over 1), Bbm/F (bIII over bVII), Dbmaj7/F (bVmaj7 over bVII). This confirms a G Locrian modal center.
