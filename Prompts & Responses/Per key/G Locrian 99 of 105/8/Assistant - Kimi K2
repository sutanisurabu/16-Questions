Let's break this down step by step.

### Chords:
Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Bbm/F | Ab/G | Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Dbmaj7/F | Gdim

- **Gdim**: G Bb Db
- **Eb/G**: G Bb Eb
- **Bbm/F**: F Ab Bb Db
- **Ab/G**: G Ab C Eb
- **Dbmaj7/F**: F Ab C Db

### Step 1: Look for tonic/dominant relationships
- **Gdim** is the most frequent chord, suggesting it might be a tonic or a passing diminished.
- **Eb/G** and **Dbmaj7/F** are both major chords with added bass notes, hinting at a possible **Gb major** or **Eb minor** key, but the diminished chords complicate this.

### Step 2: Analyze the bass line
The bass notes are almost entirely **G**, with occasional **F** and **Ab**. This strongly suggests **G** is the tonal center.

### Step 3: Check for mode
- **Gdim** is **G Bb Db**, which is a **diminished triad** (1 ♭3 ♭5).
- A diminished triad implies a **locrian mode** (1 ♭2 ♭3 4 ♭5 ♭6 ♭7), but locrian is extremely rare as a tonic.
- However, **Gdim** could also be a **passing diminished** or **vii°** in another key.

### Step 4: Check relative keys
- **Gdim** is **vii°** in **Ab major** (Ab Bb C Db Eb F G).
- **Eb/G** is **V6/5** in **Ab major**.
- **Dbmaj7/F** is **IV6/5** in **Ab major**.
- **Bbm/F** is **ii6** in **Ab major**.
- **Ab/G** is **I6/4** in **Ab major**.

### Step 5: Confirm key
All chords fit neatly into **Ab major** as:
- **Gdim** = vii°
- **Eb/G** = V6/5
- **Bbm/F** = ii6
- **Ab/G** = I6/4
- **Dbmaj7/F** = IV6/5

### Final Answer:
**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**
