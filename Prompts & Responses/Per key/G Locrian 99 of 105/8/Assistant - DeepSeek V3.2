Let’s break this down step by step.  

---

**1. List the chords clearly**  
The progression is:  

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim  

---

**2. Identify unique chords**  
- Gdim  
- Eb/G (Eb major with G in bass)  
- Bbm/F (Bbm with F in bass)  
- Ab/G (Ab major with G in bass)  
- Dbmaj7/F (Db major 7 with F in bass)  

---

**3. Analyze possible key**  

**Gdim** = G Bb Db (Fb) enharmonically G Bb Db E — it’s a fully diminished 7th chord, symmetrical.  
In classical harmony, diminished chords usually function as leading-tone chords (vii°7) or common-tone diminished chords.  

Let’s check possible keys for Gdim as vii°7:  
- In Ab major: Gdim = G Bb Db Fb (E) = vii°7 of Ab major.  
- In Bb minor: Gdim = vii°7 of Bb minor (harmonic minor).  

---

**4. Look at other chords**  

Eb/G = Eb major (Eb G Bb) with G bass — in Ab major, Eb is V, so Eb/G is V with 3rd in bass.  

Bbm/F = Bb minor (Bb Db F) with F bass — in Ab major, Bbm is vi.  

Ab/G = Ab major (Ab C Eb) with G bass — in Ab major, Ab is I, so Ab/G is I with maj7 in bass (G is b7 of Ab, so Abmaj7/G).  

Dbmaj7/F = Db F Ab C with F bass — in Ab major, Db is IV, so Dbmaj7 is IVmaj7.  

---

**5. Functional progression in Ab major**  

Gdim (vii°7) → Eb/G (V) → Gdim → Bbm/F (vi) → Ab/G (Imaj7) → Gdim → Eb/G (V) → Gdim → Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7) → Gdim  

This fits well in **Ab major**:  
- vii°7 – V – vii°7 – vi – Imaj7 – vii°7 – V – vii°7 – IVmaj7 – vii°7  

Gdim acts as a common diminished chord (maybe common-tone diminished of Ab, since G is in both Gdim and Abmaj7 as a common tone).  

---

**6. Mode**  

All chords fit **Ab major (Ionian)**. No strong evidence for minor key here because:  
- Bbm is vi, not i.  
- The tonic chord is Ab major (Ab/G).  
- Dbmaj7 is IVmaj7, typical of major key.  

---

**7. Conclusion**  

**Key:** **Ab major**  
**Mode:** **Ionian**  

---

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Ab\ major}
\]
