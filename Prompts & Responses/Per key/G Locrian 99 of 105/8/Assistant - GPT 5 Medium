**Clarifying music theory in Ab major**

In Ab major, G natural serves as the leading tone to Ab, despite G being the seventh in the context of flat keys. The notes in Ab major are Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, and G. The G diminished triad, which uses G, Bb, and Db, is diatonic here. G natural remains the leading tone, and the seventh chord on G is the G half-diminished seventh (G-Bb-Db-F). So, the diminished triad essentially fits in Ab major.**Exploring Ab minor and its leading tone**

In Ab major, the vii° chord leads to the tonic Ab. In Ab natural minor, G natural isn't present, so the leading tone is Gb. However, in Ab harmonic minor, G natural becomes the leading tone due to raising the seventh. The triad built on G would be G, Bb, and Db. Despite the complexity of accidentals and key signatures, I confirm that the diatonic spelling for the vii° triad in Ab minor is indeed G-Bb-Db.**Connecting chords in Ab major and minor**

Both Ab major and Ab harmonic minor indeed share the G-Bb-Db notes, making G diminished the vii° chord for both. This chord resolves nicely to the Ab root. Eb/G, the first inversion of the Eb major triad, acts as the V chord in Ab major and also fits in Ab minor's harmonic context. Then, Bbm/F shows B-flat minor with F in the bass, where Bbm is the ii chord in Ab major but becomes a bit tricky in Ab minor.**Clarifying diatonic chords in Ab minor**

In Ab minor, the diatonic ii chord is Bb, which can be confusing due to enharmonics. If I spell it out, the chord on Bb gives us Bb-Db-Fb, leading to a diminished triad. So I initially thought it might be Bbm, but it’s really Bb diminished. Bbm/F actually uses F natural, which hints at a raised sixth, typical in melodic minor. In the ascending Ab melodic minor scale, the Bb minor triad sounds correct as Bb-Db-F. Hence, Bbm fits nicely in both Ab major and Ab melodic minor contexts.**Determining the key and mode**

The presence of G diminished and Ab/G suggests heavy use of the second scale degree. In F natural minor, E natural would be the leading tone, but here, only Eb appears. Moreover, without any C chords, it leans towards Ab major. In Ab major, the V is Eb major, ii is Bbm, and IV is Dbmaj7, making it stronger overall. I can clarify that in the context of this progression, the key is A-flat major (Ionian) with functional mappings. Here they are:

- Gdim = vii° in Ab
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = I over 7
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/3

So, the key is A-flat major, mode Ionian.

Ab major (Ionian).

Why:
- Gdim = vii° in Ab
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = I over 7 in bass
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in first inversion

All chords fit diatonically in Ab major.
