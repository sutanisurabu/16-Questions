Let's analyze the progression together:

**Progression:**
```
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim
```

---

### Step 1: Identify notes/chords and their functions

- **Gdim** = G – Bb – Db  
- **Eb/G** = G – Bb – Eb  
- **Bbm/F** = F – Bb – Db  
- **Ab/G** = G – Ab – C – Eb  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F – Ab – C – Db  

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal centers

Notice several recurring notes:
- G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C

So the pitch collection looks like: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**.

If we line these up: G–Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F  
That’s the same as **G Locrian ♮2**, i.e. the **6th mode of Ab melodic minor.**

---

### Step 3: Functional perspective

If you treat **Gdim** as the "tonic" or recurring harmony, it supports viewing the music as centered around **G**, but clearly in a *diminished or Locrian-like context*.

A more diatonic analysis:
- In **Ab major**, chords include: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.  
  → Gdim is the vii° of Ab major.

Notice **Eb/G** (V with 3rd in bass) and **Dbmaj7/F** (IV with 3rd in bass) — both fit **Ab major** perfectly.  
**Bbm** and **Ab** are ii and I of Ab major, respectively.

So, the entire set of chords fits within **Ab major** (Ionian), with strong emphasis on the **leading-tone diminished chord G°**.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**
- **Key:** Ab major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (Ab major)  
- The progression heavily features **the leading-tone diminished chord, Gdim**, which gives it a very unstable, tense flavor around the tonic Ab.

**Summary Table**

| Chord | Roman numeral in Ab major |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Gdim | vii° |
| Eb/G | V⁶ |
| Bbm/F | ii⁶ |
| Ab/G | I with added tone over leading tone bass |
| Dbmaj7/F | IV⁶maj7 |

---

**Final Answer:**
> **Key:** Ab major  
> **Mode:** Ionian (major)  
> Frequent use of G diminished (vii°) for color and tension around the tonic.
