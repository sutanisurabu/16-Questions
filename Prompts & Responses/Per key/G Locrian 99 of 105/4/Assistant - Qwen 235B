Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**
Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G,  
Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G,  
Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G,  
Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim

---

### Step 1: List the Chords and Their Notes

Let’s write out the notes of each chord (assuming close voicings):

- **Gdim (G diminished)** = G, Bb, Db
- **Eb/G** = G, Bb, Eb (G as bass note)
- **Bbm/F** = F, Bb, Db (F in bass)
- **Ab/G** = G, Ab, C (G in bass, so G is a non-chord tone, but likely used for voice leading)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, Eb

Note: Diminished chords like Gdim (G–Bb–Db) are symmetrical and can function as leading-tone chords or passing chords.

---

### Step 2: Identify Common Tones and Tonal Center

Looking at the chords, several use **G** as a recurring bass note:

- Gdim (G in bass)
- Eb/G (G in bass)
- Ab/G (G in bass)
- Dbmaj7/F → upper structure includes Eb, not G, but bass is still **F**, not G. Wait: you wrote **Dbmaj7/F**, so bass is F, not G.

Wait, only:
- Gdim ×6
- Eb/G ×2
- Bbm/F (F in bass)
- Ab/G (G in bass)
- Dbmaj7/F (F in bass)

But **G** appears in the bass in Gdim, Eb/G, and Ab/G — so G is a common tone.

Let’s see: Eb/G is **G–Bb–Eb**, so a first-inversion Eb major.

Ab/G is **G–Ab–C**, which is Ab triad over G — so **Ab major with G in bass**.

Bbm/F = F–Bb–Db

Dbmaj7/F = F–Ab–C–Eb

Now, let’s collect all the **notes** used:

- G
- Bb
- Db (from Gdim, Bbm)
- Eb (from Eb/G, Dbmaj7)
- Ab (from Ab/G, Dbmaj7)
- C (from Ab/G, Dbmaj7)

So total pitch classes:
- G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

That’s: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

= G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭

This is **missing a D or D#, and missing F or F#** — but we **do have F** in the bass of Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F.

F appears in bass, so **F** is present.

List of all notes:
- From Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- From Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb
- From Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db
- From Ab/G: G, Ab, C
- From Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Eb

So full set:
- **F**
- **G**
- **Ab**
- **Bb**
- **C**
- **Db**
- **Eb**

Now we have all seven notes:

F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

That’s: **F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb**

Let’s arrange in order:
- F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

Compare this with modes of the **Bb minor** or **Db major** scales.

Wait — this is the **Ab melodic minor scale**?

No.

Let’s try to find a scale that matches these notes:

F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

Compare to:
- **Bb Dorian** = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab → same pitches!
  - Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab
  - Yes! That’s exactly our set.

So the **notes belong to Bb Dorian**.

Bb Dorian = Dorian mode of **Ab major**.

So key: **Ab major**, mode: **Bb Dorian**

---

### Step 3: Functional Harmony Analysis

Even though the chord progression looks chromatic, let’s see if Bb Dorian fits.

In **Bb Dorian**, the chords built on scale degrees:

- i: Bbm
- ii: Cm
- III: Db
- IV: Eb
- v: Fm
- vi: Gm
- VII: Ab

Now check our chords:

- Gdim: not diatonic to Bb Dorian. Gdim = G–Bb–Db. G is not in Bb Dorian? Wait — Bb Dorian has G natural. So G–Bb–Db is a diminished triad on G — but in Bb Dorian, the 6th degree is G, and G–Bb–Db is **G half-diminished?** No — G–Bb–Db is a **diminished triad** (all minor thirds), which would be **vii°** of Ab major — but in Bb Dorian, this isn't a standard diatonic chord.

Wait — **G–Bb–Db** is the **vii° chord in Ab major**.

And Bb Dorian uses the same key signature as Ab major.

So Gdim = vii° of Ab.

This suggests **functional pull toward Ab major**.

Now:
- Eb/G → first inversion of IV in Ab major
- Bbm/F → i6 in Bb Dorian (or v6 in Ab major)
- Ab/G → V chord with /G bass — Ab is V in Bb minor, but here Ab is the **VII** in Bb Dorian, or **I** in Ab major
- Dbmaj7/F → Dbmaj7 is **III** in Bb Dorian, and with F in bass, first inversion.

So:
- Gdim → vii° of Ab
- Eb/G → IV of Ab
- Bbm/F → v of Ab, or i of Bb Dorian
- Ab/G → I of Ab, with G in bass
- Dbmaj7/F → III of Bb Dorian

So there’s a **duality** between **Ab major** and **Bb Dorian**.

But the progression uses **Gdim** repeatedly — which strongly pulls to **Ab** (vii° → I), so it acts as a **leading tone chord to Ab**.

Then **Ab/G** appears — Ab major with G in bass — that’s **tonic chord with leading tone in bass**, so very strong tonicization of Ab.

Then **Dbmaj7/F** — III chord in Bb Dorian, but also III in Ab major (Db is III of Ab).

But it ends on **Gdim**, not Ab — so it doesn’t resolve.

Still, the harmonic motion suggests **Ab major or Ab root**.

But let’s see the bass motion:

Bass line:
G, G, G, G,
G, G, F, G,
G, G, G, G,
G, G, F, G

So mostly G — then F — then Ab/G (G again), then Dbmaj7/F (F), then ends on Gdim (G bass)

So bass: mostly **G**, some **F**

G and F are both below Ab — so possible pedal tone?

But G is the leading tone to Ab — so Gdim acts as **vii° of Ab**, and Ab appears with G in bass — so **Ab/G** is like a 6/5 suspension or passing chord.

Similarly, **Eb/G** is common in plagal motion in Ab.

But the persistent **Gdim** suggests **dominant function pulling to Ab**.

Also, **Dbmaj7** is the **III** chord — very common in modal music, especially Dorian.

But in **Ab major**, Dbmaj7 is III — less common as a tonic, but possible.

However, the chord **Bbm/F** appears — Bbm is **ii** in Ab, or **i** in Bb Dorian.

So now it’s tricky.

Let’s look for the **tonal center**.

Is the ear pulled to **Ab**? Or **Bb**?

Let’s see: chords include:

- Gdim → wants to resolve to Ab
- Eb/G → IV in Ab
- Ab/G → I with 7th in bass — stable
- Dbmaj7/F → III in Ab — could function as tonic extension
- Bbm/F → ii in Ab, or i in Bb Dorian

But **Bbm** only appears once.

Most frequent bass note: **G**

Most frequent harmony: **Gdim** and **Eb/G**, **Ab/G**

So harmonic rhythm:
- Gdim → Eb/G → Bbm/F → Ab/G — possible descent: G to F to G
But not strong root motion.

Alternatively: common-tone diminished chords?

Notice that **Gdim** shares notes with:
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb — shares G and Bb
- Ab/G: G, Ab, C — shares only G
- Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db — shares Bb, Db with Gdim
- Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Eb — shares Ab, C, Eb with Ab/G

So Gdim to Eb/G shares two notes — common tone (G, Bb)

Gdim to Bbm/F shares Bb, Db

Gdim to Ab/G shares G

So Gdim may be a passing chord between bass notes or harmonizing a descending line.

But consider: **Gdim** is vii° of **Ab**, so if Ab is tonic, it makes sense.

Also, **Dbmaj7** is more characteristic of **Dorian mode** (since III is a major 7 chord)

In **Bb Dorian**, the chords are:
- Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab

So:
- Bbm = i
- Db = III
- Eb = IV
- Ab = VII

But we have:
- Gdim — not in Bb Dorian (which has Gm)
- Eb/G — IV6
- Bbm/F — i6
- Ab/G — VII6
- Dbmaj7 — III

So Gdim is **not diatonic** to Bb Dorian — Bb Dorian has **Gm**, not Gdim.

That’s a problem.

But in **Ab major**, Gdim is **vii°**, which is diatonic.

Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Chords:
- I: Ab
- ii: Bbm
- iii: Cm
- IV: Db
- V: Eb
- vi: Fm
- vii°: Gdim

Yes! So:
- Gdim = vii° — diatonic to Ab major
- Eb/G = V6 — V chord in first inversion
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = I6
- Dbmaj7/F = IV6 with 7? Wait: Db is **IV** in Ab, but Dbmaj7? Db–F–Ab–C — but in Ab major, F is natural, so Db major includes F, yes — so **Dbmaj7** is **IVmaj7** in Ab major!

Ah! **Dbmaj7** is **IVmaj7** in **Ab major**

So all chords are **diatonic to Ab major**:

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = I6
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in first inversion

Even Ab/G — Ab is **I**, G is the 7th — so **I6 chord with 7th in bass**

And Dbmaj7 includes C (major 7th), which is in Ab major.

So **everything is diatonic to Ab major**.

But why does it suggest a mode?

Because **IVmaj7** (Dbmaj7) is used prominently, and **ii** chord (Bbm), which are more common in **subdominant-oriented** or **modal** sounds, but still perfectly fine in major.

Also, the progression avoids a strong dominant (Eb) chord in root position — uses inversions and passing harmony.

But the persistent **Gdim** suggests **upper leading tone** to Ab.

Also, the bass **G** appears a lot — the leading tone — enhancing pull to Ab.

So final analysis:

### ✅ **Key: Ab major**
### ✅ **Mode: Major (Ionian)**

But could it be **Bb Dorian**? Earlier we saw Bb Dorian has same key signature, but:
- Gdim is **not diatonic** to Bb Dorian (it has Gm, not Gdim)
- Dbmaj7 is III in Bb Dorian — possible, but rare
- But Gdim is foreign

So **Gdim rules out Bb Dorian**.

Thus, the key must be **Ab major**, and the mode is **Ionian (major)**.

The use of IVmaj7 and inversions gives it a **modal or jazzy flavor**, but it’s not actually in Dorian.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

All chords are diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V⁶
- Bbm/F = ii⁶
- Ab/G = I⁶ (with 7th in bass)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7⁶

No accidentals — all notes fit Ab major.
