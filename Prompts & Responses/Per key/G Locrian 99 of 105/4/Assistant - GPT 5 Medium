### Reasoning

**Re-evaluating chord components**

I'm looking at a collection of chords: Gdim (G Bb Db), Eb (Eb G Bb), Bb minor (Bb Db F), Ab (Ab C Eb), and Dbmaj7 (Db F Ab C). It seems I have a set of notes: {G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C}. Noticing these add up to seven notes in the scale: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. It's tricky because I thought this might be C natural minor or Eb major, but C natural minor doesn't include Db. It has Eb, Ab, and Bb, and includes D natural instead. So, our set does indeed contain Db, derived from the Gdim and Dbmaj7 chords.**Identifying the scale**

It seems that C natural minor actually doesn't have Db; it has D instead. So, my set of notes is C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, which actually represents C Phrygian instead! The Phrygian scale features a flat 2 (Db). I’ve confirmed this matches the chords: C is present in Ab/G and Dbmaj7, while Gdim, Eb major, Bb minor, and Ab major fit nicely too. Given that many chords are over G, perhaps there’s a pedal point on G in the sequence.**Analyzing chord progressions**

I noticed there's a Dbmaj7/F followed by Gdim, and it ends on Gdim instead of C. This could suggest that the key center might be C Phrygian, with a dominant pedal on G. However, in C Phrygian, the fifth degree would typically be G minor. But since Gdim is built on the notes G, Bb, and Db, this indicates a diminished triad rather than a G minor chord. In C Phrygian, the v chord can indeed be G diminished. Let's clarify: the diatonic triads in C Phrygian yield a diminished V chord as expected.**Clarifying chord functions**

I’m looking at the chords: VII (Bb-Db-F) is Bb minor, fitting well with Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, and Dbmaj7. The slash chords have bass notes F and G, which are chord tones. It seems like Eb/G is the III6 chord, while Bbm/F is a second inversion. Ab/G acts as the VI chord, and Dbmaj7/F is a IImaj7 chord in first inversion. All these chords align with C Phrygian. However, some may also refer to it as Ab major with G as a chromatic lower neighbor. But wait, Ab major includes G natural, not Db.**Finalizing key and mode**

I’ve confirmed that Ab major does include G natural, which is the major 7th of the scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Our chord set—C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb—mirrors the Ab major scale but starts on C, identifying it as C Phrygian, the third mode of Ab major. The tonal center is C, with a key signature of four flats. The progression supports a tonic feel of C, but the oscillation between Gdim and Eb/G suggests characteristics of Phrygian. All chords align with C Phrygian, reinforcing this mode.

C Phrygian (third mode of Ab major).

All the chords are diatonic to C Phrygian:
- Gdim = v°
- Eb/G = III6
- Bbm/F = VII (2nd inversion)
- Ab/G = VI over a G pedal
- Dbmaj7/F = IImaj7 (1st inversion)

Parent key signature: Ab major (four flats), with C as the tonal center.
