**Analyzing chord inversions and diatonic chords**

I'm checking the Dbmaj7/F chord, which consists of Db-F-Ab-C. In the Ab major scale, Db is the IV chord and adding the major seventh (C natural) confirms it's diatonic. I realize that with F in the bass, this is a first inversion of Dbmaj7. I notice Bbm/F as ii6 and Eb/G as V6 are also diatonic. However, Ab/G is non-triadic, functioning as a passing bass over the leading tone.**Exploring chord functions in Ab major and F minor**

I'm analyzing a four-note set: Ab-C-Eb-G. Even though G isn't part of the standard seventh chord, its presence as a bass note means all notes are still diatonic to Ab major. This suggests the key is likely Ab major, possibly in the Ionian mode. On the other hand, I wonder if it could be F minor. In F natural minor, Gdim is indeed ii°. I also identify Eb/G as a VII chord in first inversion and Bbm/F as iv in first inversion.**Clarifying chord functions and tonal centers**

I recognize that iv6 consists of Db-F-Bb with an F bass, confirming Bbm over F as iv6. Then, I see Ab/G as VI with a leading-tone bass, which implies it's part of Ab major but gives a non-functional slash chord. Now, considering Dbmaj7/F, I note that in F minor, Db is bVI, which fits because both Ab and C natural are diatonic. All chords are diatonic to F natural minor, so I wonder which tonal center is implied with Gdim, as it typically resolves to Ab or F.**Exploring chord progressions in F minor and Aeolian**

In classical minor, the predominant ii° usually leads to V, but without E natural in this case, it seems we’re not following that path. Instead, we see Eb and Db, indicating a modal Aeolian approach without leading tone. The Gdim to Eb/G transition suggests a ii° to VII6 movement, typical in Aeolian music, although Gø7 might be more common. However, the Ab major interpretation features a vii° to V6 progression. Ultimately, it resolves to Dbmaj7/F, but curiously, we never reach a I chord in root position.**Examining tonal centers and bass patterns**

I notice there's no root Ab major triad, only Ab/G, but the music seems to revolve around Ab, especially with the frequent Eb (V) leading towards it, even if I can’t see a direct resolution. The bass frequently alternates between G and F, notably with Gdim and Eb/G emphasizing G. This creates a pedal pattern around the leading tone and submediant in Ab major. It feels like a modal vamp with a possible tonal center of Ab, but I wonder about the melody and harmony relationships.**Determining key and mode**

Looking at chords built from the Ab major scale, all notes fit within Ab major (Ionian) and its relative minor, F natural minor (Aeolian). The prominence of Eb major suggests it functions as V in Ab major and VII in F minor. There’s a lot of Gdim, indicating a leading-tone function, but without a clear resolution to Ab. Considering the chord sequence, I conclude the key is likely Ab major, mode Ionian, though F minor is a possibility. I’ll provide the necessary scale degree mapping for clarity.

Ab major (Ionian).

Rationale: All chords are diatonic to Ab major, and the motion Gdim → Eb/G outlines vii° → V6 in Ab. Bbm/F (ii6) and Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7/3) reinforce Ab major’s predominant area, while Ab/G is a passing I over the leading-tone bass. While the same pitch set fits F natural minor (Aeolian), the dominant-function cues point to Ab major as the tonal center.
