This chord progression:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

...is rich in chromaticism and diminished harmony, but we can determine the **key** and **mode** by analyzing functional relationships, root movement, and the resolution points.

### Step 1: List the chords with their roots and bass notes

| Chord       | Root | Bass | Function (tentative)          |
|-------------|------|------|-------------------------------|
| Gdim        | G    | G    | vii° of A minor? / Passing   |
| Gdim        | G    | G    |                               |
| Eb/G        | Eb   | G    | Eb major triad with G in bass — could be Eb6 or Ebmaj7/G |
| Eb/G        | Eb   | G    |                               |
| Gdim        | G    | G    |                               |
| Gdim        | G    | G    |                               |
| Bbm/F       | Bb   | F    | Bb minor with F bass — likely Bbm7/F or Bbmin7/F |
| Ab/G        | Ab   | G    | Ab major with G bass — Ab7? (G is minor 7th of Ab) |
| Gdim        | G    | G    |                               |
| Gdim        | G    | G    |                               |
| Eb/G        | Eb   | G    |                               |
| Eb/G        | Eb   | G    |                               |
| Gdim        | G    | G    |                               |
| Gdim        | G    | G    |                               |
| Dbmaj7/F    | Db   | F    | Db major 7 with F in bass — F is major 3rd of Db — so this is a **Dbmaj7/F**, which is a rootless voicing of F major 9? (F-A-C-Eb-Db) — actually, Dbmaj7 = Db-F-A-C → F in bass makes it Fmaj7#11 or Dbmaj7 no root |
| Gdim        | G    | G    |                               |

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal center and resolution

The most important chord here is **Dbmaj7/F** — this is the **only major 7th chord** in the progression. All others are diminished or minor with altered bass.

#### Dbmaj7/F is very telling:
- Dbmaj7 = Db - F - A - C
- With F in the bass → F - Db - F - A - C → This is a **Fmaj7#11** or **F ionian with b13?** — but it's more accurately a **Dbmaj7/F**, functioning as an **upper-structure voicing**.

But more importantly: **Db and F are a major third apart** → which suggests **Db is the tonic**, and F is the 3rd, so this is a **Db major chord**, not F something.

So **Db major** is strongly implied.

Let’s check the circle of fifths. Db major has 5 flats:  
**Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C**

Now let’s see the other chords:

- **Gdim** — G Bb Db → this is the **vii°7 of A minor**, but A is not in Db major.
- **Gdim** = G-Bb-Db → **this chord contains Db** (the tonic of our potential key!)

Wait! **Gdim = G-Bb-Db**, which is the **diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone of Ab major?!** — or wait — **in Db major, the VII chord is C°7 (C-Eb-Gb-Bbb)** — not Gdim.

Hold on — **Gdim = G-Bb-Db**.  
In Db major, the pitches are: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

G is **not** in Db major! G is **G natural** — which is **not in Db major**. Db major has Gb.

So Gdim contains **G natural**, **Bb**, and **Db**.

Bb and Db are in Db major — G natural is not.

**G natural is the #5 of Db** — so Gdim is a **chromatic alteration**.

Wait — Gdim = G-Bb-Db — this is enharmonically equivalent to **Bb°7 (Bb-Db-Fb-Abb)** minus the 7th? Not helpful.

Gdim = **G-Bb-Db** — This is the same as **Bbdim** (Bb-Db-Fb) transposed up a minor 3rd? Let’s think differently.

Another perspective: **Gdim** = G-Bb-Db → this is the **vii° of A minor**, but we're probably not in A minor.

But **G-Bb-Db** = **Db6 (Db-F-Ab)** with bass on G? Doesn’t fit.

Wait — **Gdim is the same as Bb°7 without the 7th** — but Bb°7 = Bb-Db-Fb-Abb — so Gdim = G-Bb-Db is a **rootless Bb°7** with G in bass.

This is getting messy. Let’s use a new framework.

---

### Step 3: Think in terms of **chromatic mediant relationships** and **passing chords**

This progression looks highly chromatic — it’s from **jazz, film, or post-tonal pop** — possibly **key of Db major**, with frequent chromatic passing diminished chords.

But the **Dbmaj7/F** is the only chord that gives us a strong tonal anchor.

Let’s look at the **bass line**:

| Measure | Bass Note |
|---------|-----------|
| 1–2     | G         |
| 3–4     | G         |
| 5–6     | G         |
| 7       | F         |
| 8       | G         |
| 9–10    | G         |
| 11–12   | G         |
| 13–14   | G         |
| 15      | F         |
| 16      | G         |

So: **G–G–G–G–G–F–G–G–G–G–F–G**

It's mostly **G** bass — with two **F** basses (on Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F).

Bass motion: **G → F → G**

F is **a half-step below G**.

In tonal harmony, **F as bass** moving to **G** suggests **F is a chromatic neighbor or passing tone** to the tonic G.

If **G is tonic** (as suggested by the bass density), then the key is **G minor**?

Let’s test G minor:

G minor: G A Bb C D Eb F

Chords:
- Gdim = G-Bb-Db → Db is **not in G minor** (G minor has D natural, Eb — no Db).

G minor has **Eb** (minor 6th), not Db.

So **Db** is an accidental — meaning **Db is the flattened 5th?** Wait, in G minor, Db = ♭6 → but ♭6 in G minor is Eb.

Db is ♭♭6 — **double-flatted 6th**, which is **enharmonic to C#** — not natural to minor.

So Gdim = G-Bb-Db → **Db is not in G minor**.

But **Bb is natural in G minor**.

So Gdim implies **G-Bb-Db** — the **Db** is an **outsider**.

Unless — is this **G half-diminished 7th (Gm7♭5)**? But it's written as Gdim — probably means G diminished triad.

Another possibility: **this is in E minor?**

E minor: E F# G A B C# D

Gdim = G Bb Db — again, Bb and Db are not in E minor.

Gdim consistently appears — and is associated with **Eb/G** (Eb major triad with G bass) and **Dbmaj7/F**.

Wait — **Eb/G** = Eb-G-Bb — which is **Eb major in first inversion** — and **Eb is the ♭VI in C major**?

But we have Dbmaj7/F — Db is a half step below Eb.

So Eb → Db is a downward chromatic movement.

Let’s look at this:  
**Eb/G = G-Bb-Eb** → same notes as **Gm7♭5** (G-Bb-Db-F) **without F** — so it's a Gm7♭5 triad? No — G-Bb-Eb — Eb is not Db.

Wait: **Eb/G = G, Bb, Eb** — that’s a **G minor 6** chord? Gm6 = G-Bb-D-E — nope.

Actually, **G-Bb-Eb = Bb°7 without Bb root?**

Let’s stack: G (root), Bb (minor 3rd), Eb (minor 6th) — so **Gm6**? But Gm6 is G-Bb-D-E — so **Eb is not D**.

**G-Bb-Eb = Eb major triad in first inversion** — that’s what we said.

But Eb major = Eb-G-Bb — and G is in bass → **Eb/G**

This chord contains **G, Bb, Eb**

Now look again at **Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, Db — which is Db major triad (Db-F-Ab) with C (7th), bass F.

So in Dbmaj7/F: notes = **F, Db, F, A, C**

That’s: **F, A, C, Db** — which is **F7b9**? F7 = F-A-C-Eb — we have C and Db, not Eb.

F, A, C, Db → **Fm6**? F-Ab-C-Db? No, it's F-A-C-Db — so A is major, not minor.

F-A-C-Db — this is **F major with Db = ♭6** → **F6♭9**? Uncommon.

Better: **Dbmaj7/F = Db-F-A-C**, bass F → So F = 3rd of Db, so this is **Dbmaj7 no root**, bass on 3rd — commonly used in voice-leading.

This places **Db as tonic**.

Now look at **Eb/G** — Eb is a half-step above Db.

So is this a **chromatic mediant** or **neighboring chord**?

Eb major is the **♭III** relative to Db major.

Db major: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C  
Eb = II — but Eb major is not diatonic to Db major (diatonic II is Ebm)

So **Eb major** is borrowed — from **Db minor?**

Db minor: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bbb Cb — still, Eb major would be ♭III major — which is a **borrowed chord**.

And **Bbm/F** — Bb minor with F bass.

In Db major, Bb is the ♭VI — so Bbm = ♭vi — common borrow from minor mode.

Ab/G — Ab major with G bass. Ab is the ♭VII in Db major — very common in rock/pop.

So **Ab/G = ♭VII with 7th in bass** — which makes it resemble Ab7 (Ab-C-Eb-G) → and G is the 7th — yes! Ab7 = Ab-C-Eb-G → so **Ab/G is just Ab7 in third inversion**.

Perfect!

So **Ab/G = Ab7**

Similarly, **Eb/G = Eb major 6th?** or **Bbm6?**

Eb/G = G-Bb-Eb — same as Bb-Db-Fb/A? No.

G-Bb-Eb = G minor 7th? G-Bb-D-F = Gm7 — we have Eb, not D.

Wait — G-Bb-Eb = **Bbdim** (Bb-Db-F) with G as lowest? No.

Actually, **G-Bb-Eb = Eb6** — E-b-natural? No — it’s Eb, G, Bb — that’s **Eb major triad** — so Eb/G = **first inversion of Eb major**.

But Eb major is the **♭III chord** in Db major.

In Db major, ♭III is Eb minor — so Eb major here is a **borrow from Db minor**, which is common in modal interchange.

Similarly, **Bbm = ♭vi**, also from Db minor.

**Ab7 = ♭VII7** — very common in Db (and D-flat influenced keys).

**Gdim** — G-Bb-Db — G is not in Db major, but Db is the tonic.

So Gdim = G-Bb-Db → this chord is **the vii°7 of Ab minor**? No.

But **Db is the tonic** — so G-Bb-Db is **the leading tone chord to Db?**

In Db major: the leading tone is C — C-Eb-Gb — forms C°7.

But here we have **G-Bb-Db** — which is a **diminished triad with Db as root?** But bass is G.

Wait — this is a **G diminished triad with Db in it**.

That suggests **Db is the 3rd of Gdim**? Gdim = G-Bb-Db → Db is the **minor 6th** above G, **diminished 5th?** G to Db is a **diminished 5th** — yes!

So **Gdim = G-Bb-Db** is the **diminished triad built on G** → meaning **G is root**, **Bb is minor 3rd**, **Db is diminished 5th**.

In Db major, **G is the #5** (since Db major has Gb, not G).

So **Gdim is a chromatic diminished chord: the #vii°** of Db major?

In Db major — ♯vii° = C#° — not G°.

G is ♭♭6 (double-flat 6) of Db — so this chord **does not have a diatonic function**.

But here’s the insight:

**Gdim = G-Bb-Db** has notes that are **the same as Db tragically**, but with G as the root.

But **Db is the tonic** — so this Gdim chord is **a voice-leading device** — maybe **passing diminished chord**.

Look at the context:

After **Bbm/F → Ab/G → Gdim**

Bbm/F = F-Bb-Db  
Ab/G = G-Ab-C-Eb? No — Ab/G = G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait Ab major = Ab-C-Eb → so with G bass: G-Ab-C-Eb → that's Ab7

Then comes Gdim = G-Bb-Db

So from Ab7 (G-Ab-C-Eb) → Gdim (G-Bb-Db)

So common tone: G

Other notes: Ab → Bb? That’s a semitone downward? Ab to Bb is up.

Wait: Ab to Bb = upward whole step — not smooth.

But Eb → Db — that’s a **half-step down** — very strong voice-leading!

So in Ab7: Eb (7th) → in Gdim: Db (which is down a half-step from Eb) — perfect!

C → Bb? C to Bb is down whole step — less smooth.

G → G — same.

So **Ab7 to Gdim**: Eb → Db is a very strong resolution — the **leading tone relationship**.

Similarly, **Gdim → Eb/G**:

Gdim = G-Bb-Db  
Eb/G = G-Bb-Eb

So Db → Eb — half-step up! So the Db resolves **up** to Eb.

This is interesting — the **Db** is acting as a **chromatic passing tone** between **Eb and Db** — supported by the Gdim triad.

And then we go to **Dbmaj7/F** — which is the tonic chord, **Db major 7**, with 3rd in bass — a very **smooth, warm resolution**.

So the **bass is still G**, but the chord above is Dbmaj7 — it’s like **G is a pedal tone** while harmony moves.

But the **functional tonal center** is clearly **Db major**.

---

### Final Analysis:

- The chord progression centers around **Db major**.
- Most chords are borrowed from **Db minor** (Bbm, Eb major — flat III), or chromatic (Gdim).
- The **Gdim** acts as a **chromatic passing chord** — often functioning as **vii° of Ab**, or a voice-leading vehicle moving between Eb and Db.
- The **Dbmaj7/F** is the **tonic chord**, in an inverted form — confirming Db as tonic.
- **Ab/G** = Ab7 = ♭VII7 — very common in Db major (used famously in "So What", jazz, rock).
- **Bbm/F** = ♭vi6 — common modal interchange.
- **Eb/G** = ♭III maj — borrowed from Db minor.

This is a **modal mixture** progression in **Db major**, with frequent use of **minor-mode chords and chromatic passing chords**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

> **Key: Db Major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (major)** — with heavy **modal interchange** (borrowing from Db harmonic/melodic minor)

So the progression is **in the key of Db major**, but **uses chromatic and borrowed chords extensively**, giving it a rich, jazzy, cinematic quality.

The **Gdim chords** are chromatic passing harmonies, often resolving to/from Eb or Ab — enriching the harmonic motion without changing the tonic.

---

### Bonus: Why Db major?

- It has the rare **Gb** in its key signature, so any **natural G** is clearly **chromatic** (as in Gdim).
- **Dbmaj7** is the only major 7th chord.
- **F** appears as a common tone and bass — which is the 3rd of Db, confirming tonic quality.
- Chromatic movements (Eb → Db, Ab → G in bass) are classic in Db major progressions (e.g., Herbie Hancock, “Maiden Voyage”).

This progression feels like a **cosmic sigh in Db major** — tonally centered, but shimmering with chromatic color.
