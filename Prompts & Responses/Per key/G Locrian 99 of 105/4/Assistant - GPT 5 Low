### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm diving into a chord progression and need to identify the key and mode. It repeats Gdim and Eb/G, so I’ll interpret that.  

The Gdim chord is a fully diminished triad, likely consisting of the notes G, Bb, and Db. With Eb/G, it’s an Eb major chord in first inversion, adding G in the bass. Then, Bbm/F has Bb, Db, and F with F in the bass, while Ab/G is an Ab major over G, suggesting a bII over 7 or possibly an Abmaj7#11 without the root.**Examining bass notes in sequence**

Let’s break down the progression. The Dbmaj7/F consists of Db, F, Ab, and C, with F in the bass. The bass notes that repeat throughout are primarily G, with occasional F.  

The sequence goes: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, and so on. This indicates that G mainly serves as a pedal tone, while F appears as a passing note. It suggests G could be the dominant scale degree acting as a pedal or possibly even the tonic.**Clarifying Gdim and key context**

I realize that treating Gdim as a tonic chord doesn't quite fit, since the tonic would typically be G major or G minor. Instead, Gdim serves as the leading-tone chord in Ab. In Ab major, Gdim is the vii° chord, while Eb/G functions as the V chord over G. They share common tones, reinforcing G as a significant note linking these chords. This suggests an Ab major (or minor) context with G acting as a leading-tone pedal. Additionally, Bbm/F is a minor ii chord, and Ab/G represents the tonic with G creating a non-chord tone bass.**Examining Ab/G and Ab major**

I’m considering that Ab/G spells an Ab major triad over G, possibly forming an Abmaj7(#11)/G. Looking at the chord tones, I see the notes Ab, C, Eb, and G in the bass. While that resembles a G fully diminished chord, it's not quite the same. The intervals above G suggest G7(b9, 11, b13) without the third and seventh. 

In the context of Ab major, Ab/G might function as a tonic with G acting as a lower neighbor. Dbmaj7/F is the IVmaj7 in Ab major, making all the chords diatonic to that key. Overall, this indicates it's in Ab major, likely in the Ionian mode. I'm curious if there’s any minor inflection present here.**Determining key and mode**

This analysis explores the chord progression and its functions. The presence of Eb major as the V chord in Ab major suggests a strong functional relationship. While in F minor, Eb is just VII, which is weaker. The Gdim chord serves as a leading-tone to Ab, but I don't see a strong resolution to Ab, which complicates its designation as the tonal center. 

Overall, I lean towards Ab major, in the Ionian mode, as the chords are diatonic and reinforce this conclusion. But I also recognize that F minor could fit, albeit less functionally. So, my final answer is Ab major (Ionian) as the primary key.

Ab major, Ionian.

Rationale: Every chord is diatonic to Ab major (Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G). The repeated Gdim is vii° of Ab, Eb/G is V6, Bbm/F is ii6/4, Ab/G is I over the leading tone, and Dbmaj7/F is IV6. The bass alternates G–F as a pedal/neighbor, but the harmonic functions point to Ab Ionian. (The same pitch set is F natural minor/Aeolian, but the V (Eb) and vii° usage favor Ab major.)
