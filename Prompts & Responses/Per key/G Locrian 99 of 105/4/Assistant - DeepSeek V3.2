Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

---

## **2. Simplify chord names**

- **Gdim** = G diminished triad (G B♭ D♭)
- **Eb/G** = Eb major triad with G in bass (Eb G B♭)
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ minor with F in bass (B♭ D♭ F)
- **Ab/G** = A♭ major with G in bass (A♭ C E♭)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = D♭maj7 with F in bass (D♭ F A♭ C)

---

## **3. Look for tonal center**

The progression is dominated by **Gdim** and **Eb/G** alternating, with a middle section **Bbm/F – Ab/G** before returning to **Eb/G** and ending with **Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**.

Gdim is a symmetrical chord (dim7 would be G B♭ D♭ E), but here it’s just a diminished triad.  
In functional harmony, diminished triads often act as leading-tone chords.

---

## **4. Try interpreting in a key**

Let’s check **Eb major**:

- Eb/G = I chord in first inversion
- Gdim = ? In Eb major, Gdim is not diatonic. But G B♭ D♭ = Gdim could be from harmonic minor of something? Let’s check:  
  In Eb minor (G♭ dim is diatonic), but here Gdim has G natural, so not from Eb minor.

Check **C harmonic minor**:  
C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B C  
Gdim = G B♭ D♭ — B♭ and D♭ are in C harmonic minor? No, B♭ is not in C harmonic minor (B natural is). So not that.

---

## **5. Try Ab major**

Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G  
Gdim = G B♭ D♭ — none of those notes except D♭ are in Ab major. So no.

---

## **6. Try seeing Gdim as a common-tone diminished of Eb**

Gdim shares B♭ and D♭(C#) with Eb chord?  
Eb = Eb G B♭  
Gdim = G B♭ D♭  
Common tones: G, B♭. So Gdim could be a chromatic approach chord to Eb.

Also, Gdim could be vii° of A♭ minor, but we’re not in Ab minor.

---

## **7. Look at Bbm – Ab/G – Gdim**

Bbm = could be iv in F minor or ii in Ab major.  
Ab/G is Ab major with G bass — that’s a dominant pedal G under Ab major.  
Gdim also has G in bass often.

So G is a strong pedal tone.

---

## **8. Check key of C minor / Eb major**

In Eb major:  
Bbm = ii  
Ab = V  
Gdim = ? Not diatonic, but Gdim could be borrowed from C minor (harmonic form):  
C harmonic minor: chords: Gdim = G B♭ D♭ — yes! That’s the vii° of C harmonic minor.

So maybe we’re in **C minor** with Eb sections? But Eb/G appears more like I in Eb.

---

## **9. Likely key: Eb major with modal mixture**

Gdim acts as a passing diminished chord, possibly from C minor (harmonic).  
Bbm is diatonic to Eb major (ii).  
Ab/G is V with G pedal.  
Dbmaj7/F is ♭VImaj7 — a borrowed chord from Eb minor (Cb major = D♭ major in Eb minor).  
So the final Dbmaj7 to Gdim is a deceptive resolution in Eb minor context.

---

## **10. Determine mode**

The tonic seems to be **Eb**.  
Use of Dbmaj7 (from Eb minor) and Gdim (from C harmonic minor) suggests **Eb major with heavy borrowing from Eb minor (Aeolian)** — so the overall feel is **Eb major key**, but the mode is **Mixolydian?** No, because we have a minor iv (Bbm) and major I (Eb), that’s more Dorian? Wait, Bbm is natural in Eb major (dorian has major IV, not here). Actually, Bbm is native to Eb major (dorian would have Bb minor? Dorian of C would have Bb major? Let’s not overcomplicate.)

Given:  
I (Eb), ii (Bbm), V (Ab), and borrowed ♭VI (Db) from parallel minor, plus diminished chords from harmonic minor — this is **Eb major key, but mode is major with modal mixture**, not a pure standard mode.

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{Eb\ major}
\]
Mode: Major (Ionian) with extensive borrowed chords.
