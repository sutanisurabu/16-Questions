Let's break this progression down and determine the **key and mode**.

### **Chord Breakdown (with notes):**

1. **Gdim**: G - Bb - Db  
2. **Eb/G**: Eb - G - Bb (G in bass)  
3. **Bbm/F**: Bb - Db - F (F in bass)  
4. **Ab/G**: Ab - C - Eb (G in bass)  
5. **Dbmaj7/F**: Db - F - Ab - C (F in bass)  
6. **Gdim** (again)

---

### **Step 1: Identify Notes Present**
From the chords, the **distinct notes** are:

- G, Bb, Db, Eb, Ab, C, F

These are **all the notes of the Db major scale**, except the 4th degree (Gb).  
Db major scale: **Db - Eb - F - Gb - Ab - Bb - C**

So we have a **Db major scale** with the **4th (Gb) omitted**.

---

### **Step 2: Functional Analysis**

- The progression centers heavily around **Gdim**, which is **vii° of Ab major** or **ii° of F minor**.
- But **Ab major** contains **Eb**, **Bb**, **Db**, **C**, and **F** — all of which appear.
- **Db major** is the **IV chord in Ab major**, and **Eb** is **V**.
- **Gdim** is **vii° in Ab major** → **G - Bb - Db** is **leading tone triad**.
- **Ab/G** is a **IV chord in 2nd inversion** in **Ab major**.
- **Dbmaj7/F** is **IVmaj7 in 1st inversion** in **Ab major**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Key: Ab major**
- **Mode: Ionian (major mode)**

Even though Gdim is a diminished chord (which can feel ambiguous), its **function here is clearly vii° in Ab major**, and the rest of the chords support **Ab major** as the tonal center.

### 🔍 Summary:
> **Key: Ab major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (major)**
