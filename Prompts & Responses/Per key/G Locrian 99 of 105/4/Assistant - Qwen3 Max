To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Analyze the chords

Let’s spell out the chords:

- **Gdim**: G–B♭–D♭  
- **Eb/G**: G–B♭–E♭ (first inversion of E♭ major)  
- **Bbm/F**: F–B♭–D♭ (first inversion of B♭ minor)  
- **Ab/G**: G–A♭–C–E♭ (Ab major with G in bass → essentially G⁷♭9 or G7sus♭9? But more likely just Ab/G as a slash chord, implying Ab major over G bass)  
- **Dbmaj7/F**: F–A♭–C–D♭ (first inversion of D♭ major 7)

So the main pitch centers used:

- G (bass note appears often)
- E♭ major (E♭, G, B♭)
- B♭ minor (B♭, D♭, F)
- A♭ major (A♭, C, E♭)
- D♭ major 7 (D♭, F, A♭, C)

These all belong to the **key of E♭ minor** (or its relative major, G♭ major), which has a key signature of **6 flats**: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭.

But let’s double-check.

### Step 2: Consider E♭ minor (natural minor)

E♭ natural minor scale:  
**E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭ – C♭ – D♭ – E♭**

But we see **G natural** and **C natural** in the chords:

- Gdim = G–B♭–D♭ → G is **not** in E♭ natural minor (which has G♭)
- Eb major chord = E♭–G–B♭ → again, **G natural**, not G♭
- Ab major = A♭–C–E♭ → C natural, but E♭ minor has **C♭**

So E♭ natural minor is **not** a match.

### Step 3: Consider E♭ **harmonic** or **melodic** minor?

E♭ harmonic minor: E♭–F–G♭–A♭–B♭–C♭–**D**–E♭  
→ Raises 7th (D♭ → D♮). But we don’t see D♮; we see D♭ in Gdim and Bbm.

E♭ melodic minor (ascending): E♭–F–G♭–A♭–B♭–C–D  
→ Raises 6th and 7th. Still has G♭, not G♮.

So **E♭ minor is not working** because of the prominent **G natural** and **C natural**.

---

### Step 4: Try **G♭ major**?

G♭ major scale: G♭–A♭–B♭–C♭–D♭–E♭–F–G♭  
Again, **C♭ and G♭**, but we have **C♮ and G♮** → mismatch.

---

### Step 5: Look at **E♭ major**

E♭ major scale: **E♭ – F – G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D**

This includes:
- E♭, G, B♭ → E♭ major chord ✔️  
- B♭, D, F → B♭ major, **but we have B♭ minor** (B♭–D♭–F) → D♭ is **not** in E♭ major (which has D♮)

So B♭ minor is **borrowed** from E♭ minor (modal mixture).

Similarly:
- A♭ major (A♭–C–E♭) → all in E♭ major ✔️  
- D♭ major 7 (D♭–F–A♭–C) → D♭ is **not** in E♭ major (which has D♮), but D♭ is the ♭7 degree → again, borrowed from **E♭ mixolydian** or **E♭ minor**

Now consider **Gdim** = G–B♭–D♭  
- G = 3rd of E♭ major  
- B♭ = 5th  
- D♭ = **♭7**

So G–B♭–D♭ = **vii° chord in A♭ major**, or **#iv° in E♭ major?**

Wait—let’s consider **A♭ major** as a possible key.

A♭ major scale: A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F–G

Chords:
- E♭ major = V chord ✔️  
- A♭ major = I ✔️  
- D♭ major = IV ✔️  
- B♭ minor = ii? No, ii in A♭ is B♭ minor? Wait: A♭ major diatonic chords:

| Degree | Chord        |
|--------|--------------|
| I      | A♭ major     |
| ii     | B♭ minor     |
| iii    | C minor      |
| IV     | D♭ major     |
| V      | E♭ major     |
| vi     | F minor      |
| vii°   | G diminished |

**Aha!** This matches **perfectly**:

- **Gdim** = vii° in A♭ major  
- **Eb/G** = E♭ major in first inversion = V  
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ minor in first inversion = ii  
- **Ab/G** = A♭ over G = I with leading tone in bass (common in cadences)  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = D♭maj7 in first inversion = IVmaj7

So **all chords exist diatonically in A♭ major**, except perhaps Ab/G (but that’s just a slash chord implying a bass line descending: G → G → F → G etc.)

Let’s confirm:

A♭ major scale: **A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F – G – A♭**

From this:
- **Gdim** = G–B♭–D♭ → built on 7th scale degree → vii° ✔️  
- **E♭ major** = E♭–G–B♭ → V ✔️  
- **B♭ minor** = B♭–D♭–F → ii ✔️  
- **A♭ major** = I ✔️  
- **D♭ major 7** = D♭–F–A♭–C → IVmaj7 ✔️

✅ All chords are **diatonic to A♭ major**.

### Step 6: Determine mode

Since all chords fit **A♭ major** (Ionian mode), and there’s no consistent alteration suggesting Dorian, Mixolydian, etc., the mode is **Ionian** (major).

Also, the frequent use of **Gdim (vii°)** resolving to **A♭ (I)** or moving to **E♭ (V)** supports a tonal center of **A♭**.

The bass movement (G → G → F → G etc.) suggests a **descending bass line** around the tonic, common in classical and jazz-influenced harmony, but still within A♭ major.

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **Key**: A♭ major  
- **Mode**: Ionian (major)
