### Key and Mode Analysis

This chord progression fits **Ab major** (the key of Ab major), which is in the **Ionian mode** (the standard major scale mode).

#### Reasoning
- **Primary tonal center**: Ab major (scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G).
- **Chord functions in Ab major**:
  - **Gdim** (or Gdim7: G Bb Db Fb/E): vii° (leading-tone diminished chord, common for tension/resolution).
  - **Eb/G**: V6 (first inversion of Eb major, the dominant chord).
  - **Bbm/F**: ii⁶₅ (third inversion of Bb minor, the supertonic).
  - **Ab/G**: I⁶ (first inversion of Ab major, the tonic).
  - **Dbmaj7/F**: IV⁶maj7 (first inversion of Db major 7, the subdominant with added 7th for color).
- The progression is repetitive and cycle-like, emphasizing the dominant (V) and leading tone (vii°), with inversions (slash chords) creating a bass line oscillating between G and F. This builds tension typical of jazz, standards, or classical harmony in a major key.
- No chords introduce notes outside the Ab major scale (e.g., no Gb, A, or B for minor modes like Aeolian).
- Possible context: This resembles harmonic patterns in jazz standards (e.g., turnarounds or bridges), but it resolves tonally to Ab major without modal ambiguity.

If this is from a specific song or has more context (e.g., melody), it could refine the analysis further!
