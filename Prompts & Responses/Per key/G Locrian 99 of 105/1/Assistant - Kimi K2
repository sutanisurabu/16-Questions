Let’s label every chord with its root and its quality, then notice how (and how often) each pitch-class is being used.

Chord-by-chord pitch content  
Gdim = G Bb Db  
Eb/G = G Bb Eb  
Bbm/F = F Bb Db F  
Ab/G = G Ab C Eb  
Dbmaj7/F = F Ab C Eb  

Pool of notes that actually occur  
G Ab Bb C Db Eb F  
= every pitch in G-natural-minor except the 2nd degree (A).

Now look at the bass line (the written "/G" or "/F").  
It walks:  
G – G – F – G – G – G – G – F – F.

No A ever appears in any voicing, so we have a seven-note scale whose tonic feels like G and whose 2nd degree is conspicuously absent – the defining feature of the G dorian ♭2 mode (the 2nd mode of F melodic-minor).

Hence:

Key centre: G  
Mode: Dorian ♭2 (a.k.a. G melodic-minor with tonic on G, but with the 2nd degree permanently omitted in this particular chord loop).
