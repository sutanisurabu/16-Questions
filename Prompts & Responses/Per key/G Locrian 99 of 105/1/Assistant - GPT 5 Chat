Let's analyze the chord progression:  

```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F  Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

### Step 1: Identify the important tonal centers
The main chords that stand out are:

- **Eb major** (Eb/G suggests that Eb major is functioning in root position with G in bass)
- **Dbmaj7** (related to Eb major as the ♭VII maj7)
- **Bbm** (the ii chord in Eb major)
- **Ab** (the V chord in Eb major)
- **Gdim** (vii° in Ab major or vii°/V in Eb major)

---

### Step 2: Examine functional relationships
In **Eb major**:
- Eb is the **I** chord  
- Bbm is **ii**  
- Ab is **V** (dominant)  
- Dbmaj7 is borrowed (**♭VIImaj7**, common in mixolydian flavor)  
- Gdim can act as **vii°/V**, a leading-tone diminished chord to Ab.

That’s a logical mapping:

| Chord     | Function in Eb major          |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Gdim       | vii°/V (leading to Ab)       |
| Eb/G       | I                           |
| Bbm/F      | ii                          |
| Ab/G       | V with altered bass          |
| Dbmaj7/F   | ♭VIImaj7 (borrowed)          |

---

### Step 3: Conclusion  
The progression clearly centers around **Eb major**, though it uses chromatic and borrowed chords (particularly the frequent Gdim, which supports movement toward Ab).

- **Key:** Eb major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major), with borrowings suggestive of **Mixolydian** color due to the ♭VIImaj7 (Dbmaj7).

---

**Final Answer:**  
Key = **Eb major**, Mode = **Eb Ionian (with Mixolydian flavor from ♭VII)**
