### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Overview of Chords and Scale Fit
The given progression (Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Dbmaj7/F - Gdim) uses the following chords:
- **Gdim**: G–Bb–Db (vii° in Ab major)
- **Eb/G**: Eb–G–Bb (IV6 in Ab major)
- **Bbm/F**: Bb–Db–F (ii with F bass, equivalent to ii⁵ in Ab major)
- **Ab/G**: Ab–C–Eb (I6 in Ab major)
- **Dbmaj7/F**: Db–F–Ab–C (IVmaj7 with F bass, equivalent to IV⁶₅ in Ab major)

All notes in these chords (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G) fit perfectly within the **Ab major scale** (Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G–Ab). No accidentals or chromatic notes deviate from this scale.

This progression also fits **F minor** (the relative minor of Ab major, using the Aeolian mode: F–G–Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F), as the chords align with its natural minor scale. However, see the distinction below.

#### Determined Key: Ab Major
- **Primary Tonal Center**: Ab major. The progression emphasizes the dominant function (leading tone G via Gdim and G bass notes), which pulls strongly toward Ab as the tonic. Key indicators:
  - **Ab/G (I6)** acts as a clear tonic arrival, especially after Bbm/F (ii), forming a ii–I cadence.
  - Repetitive Gdim (vii°) functions as a pre-dominant/dominant chord leading back to Ab.
  - Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7 in inversion) provides subdominant color but resolves toward the tonic in context.
  - The bass alternates between G (leading tone/vii) and F (subdominant degree), creating tension/release around Ab.
- No strong resolution to F minor's tonic (F) is present; the F bass notes support subdominant harmony rather than establishing F as home.
- This is a common setup in jazz/classical progressions (e.g., similar to ii–V–I variants or turnaround figures like the "Abmaj turnaround"), where diminished chords on vii° build to the tonic.

#### Mode: Ionian (Major)
- The Ionian mode fits due to the major quality of the implied tonic (Ab major) and the presence of major chords like Ab and Eb, without the minor-third emphasis of Aeolian (F minor).
- If interpreted in the relative minor (F Aeolian), it would lack the brighter, more resolved feel; the progression's structure (ending on Gdim, pulling to Ab) favors major.

#### Why Not Other Keys?
- **F minor (Aeolian)**: Possible relative interpretation, but the Ab/G tonic emphasis and lack of minor i (Fm) chord make Ab major primary.
- **Eb major**: Ruled out—Db (from Gdim, Bbm) is not diatonic (Eb major uses D natural).
- **Other possibilities (e.g., Bb minor, C minor)**: Don't fully contain Db or align with the bass/tonic focus.

This progression feels like a looping vamp or intro (e.g., reminiscent of standards like "All of Me" or jazz turnarounds in Ab). If this is from a specific song or you have melody notes, it could refine the analysis further!
