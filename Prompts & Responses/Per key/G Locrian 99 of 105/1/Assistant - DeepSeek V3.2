Let’s break this down step by step.

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

## **2. Understand the chord qualities**

- **Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ (F♭) — fully diminished 7th chord.
- **Eb/G** = G Eb G B♭ — Eb major triad with G in bass (so Eb = E♭ G B♭).
- **Bbm/F** = F B♭ D♭ — B♭ minor triad with F in bass.
- **Ab/G** = G Ab C Eb — Ab major triad with G in bass.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F Db F Ab C — D♭ major 7th chord with F in bass.

---

## **3. Look for functional harmony patterns**

Gdim is a common diminished chord used as a leading-tone chord or common-tone diminished.

Let’s check keys:

- Gdim could be **G°7** = vii°7 in A♭ major, or common-tone diminished of A♭, or acting as a passing chord.

---

## **4. Try A♭ major hypothesis**

A♭ major scale: A♭ B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G A♭

- Gdim = G B♭ D♭ F♭(E) — enharmonically G B♭ D♭ E — that’s actually G°7, which is vii°7 of A♭.
- Eb = IV chord in A♭ major.
- Bbm = v chord in A♭ major (minor v is common in a major key, borrowed from parallel minor? Actually B♭ minor is ii of A♭ minor, not in A♭ major naturally — so maybe modal mixture).
- Ab = I chord (but Ab/G is Ab major with G bass — that’s Abmaj7/G, so G is the 7th of Abmaj7).
- Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7 in A♭ major.

So:  
G°7 → E♭/G (IV) → G°7 → B♭m (borrowed ii) → Ab/G (I with 7th in bass) → G°7 → E♭/G → G°7 → D♭maj7 (IV) → G°7.

This looks like: G°7 is functioning as **common-tone diminished of A♭** (C°7 in A♭ major is more standard as vii°7, but G°7 is enharmonic to B♭°7, D♭°7, E°7 — it’s symmetric). Actually G°7 contains B♭ D♭ E G — respell E as F♭ — that’s same as B♭°7? Let’s check: B♭°7 = B♭ D♭ F♭(E) A♭(G)? No, B♭°7 is B♭ D♭ F♭ A♭♭(G) — yes, G is A♭♭ enharmonically. So G°7 = B♭°7 = D♭°7 = E°7. So it’s the same diminished 7th chord.

## **5. Functional role of G°7 here**

In A♭ major, B♭°7 (which is G°7) often resolves to I (A♭) or goes to IV (D♭) or ii (B♭m). Here we see G°7 going to E♭ (IV) sometimes, and to B♭m, and to Ab/G, and to D♭maj7. That fits:  
B♭°7 (G°7) → A♭ (as vii°7)  
B♭°7 → B♭m (as common-tone diminished of B♭m)  
B♭°7 → D♭ (common progression)  
B♭°7 → E♭ (less direct but possible)

So G°7 is functioning flexibly as a diminished chord that tonicizes various chords in A♭ major.

## **6. Mode determination**

All chords fit in A♭ major except B♭m, which is borrowed from A♭ minor (Aeolian). So the mode is **A♭ major with modal mixture** from A♭ minor.

---

## **7. Conclusion**

**Key:** A♭ major  
**Mode:** Major (with borrowed chord B♭m from parallel minor)

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{Ab\ major}
\]
