### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chord symbols: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim". They want me to determine the key and mode of this chord progression. 

First, I need to unpack what these chord symbols mean. Gdim is G diminished, which is G-Bb-Db. Eb/G means Eb major chord with G in the bass - so it's essentially Eb major (G-Bb-Eb) but voiced with G as the lowest note. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb minor with F in the bass (Bb-Db-F), Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass (Ab-C-Eb with G), and Dbmaj7/F is Db major seventh with F in the bass (Db-F-Ab-C with F as bass note). 

Hmm, interesting pattern here. The progression keeps returning to Gdim, which is unusual because diminished chords are typically passing chords, not tonal centers. But here it's repeating so much - Gdim appears 8 times in a 15-chord sequence! That makes me suspect Gdim might be functioning as a pseudo-tonic. 

Let me list all the unique chords after stripping away the bass notes: Gdim (repeated), Eb major (from Eb/G), Bb minor (from Bbm/F), Ab major (from Ab/G), and Db major 7th (from Dbmaj7/F). So the essential chords are: G°, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7. 

Now I'm noticing something - all these chords contain notes from the G half-diminished scale (G Locrian mode). Let me verify: G half-diminished is G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F. Checking chords: 
- Gdim = G-Bb-Db (all in scale)
- Eb = Eb-G-Bb (G and Bb are in scale, Eb is the tritone substitution note)
- Bbm = Bb-Db-F (all in scale)
- Ab = Ab-C-Eb (C isn't in G Locrian... problem)
Wait, C isn't in G Locrian. That's an issue. 

Alternative approach: Since Eb/G and Ab/G have G in the bass, maybe the bass is outlining something. Let's extract bass notes: G (for Gdim/Eb/G), G (for Eb/G), F (for Bbm/F), G (for Ab/G), F (for Dbmaj7/F), then back to G (Gdim). So bass alternates between G and F. 

Ah! This looks like a pedal point progression where G is the home bass note, with F occasionally appearing as a chromatic passing tone. The persistent G bass under multiple chords suggests G might be the tonal center. 

Now considering harmonic function: 
- Gdim could be vii° in Ab major (Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G) but there's no Ab chord here
- Or it could be ii° in F major (F-G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-E) but again, no F chord
- Wait, Dbmaj7/F is Db major 7th with F bass - Db is the subtonic of G, F is the minor 7th of G

Let me try interpreting everything relative to G: 
- Gdim = G root, but diminished (unstable)
- Eb/G = G as major 6th (since Eb is bVI in G minor)
- Bbm/F = F is minor 7th, Bb is minor 3rd - so in G minor, Bbm is iii° but wait no...
Actually in G natural minor: G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F. 
- Eb = bVI 
- Bbm = iii (but minor, not diminished) 
- Ab = bII 
- Db = bV (but Dbmaj7 is unusual) 

G natural minor would have B diminished (B-D-F), not G diminished. This isn't matching. 

What if it's G Locrian? G Locrian scale: G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F. 
- Gdim = tonic (G-Ab-Bb? Wait no, Gdim is G-Bb-Db) 
Actually G half-diminished is G-Bb-Db-F, which is the vii°7 in Ab major. 

Perhaps Ab major is the key? Let's check: 
Ab major scale: Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G 
- Gdim = vii° 
- Eb = V 
- Bbm = iii? But Bbm is minor, while scale has Bb major -> no, Ab major has Bb major, not minor 
Bbm contradicts Ab major harmony. 

Unless it's Ab minor? Ab harmonic minor: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-G 
But we have Bbm (Bb-Db-F), which would be ii° in Ab harmonic minor... possible. 
- Gdim = vii° in Ab minor? No, Ab harmonic minor has G# dim, not G dim. 

This is tricky. Let me look at chord roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. The roots move by minor thirds: G to Eb (down minor 3rd), Eb to Bb (down perfect 5th? No), better to see the sequence: 
Gdim -> Eb -> Gdim -> Bb -> Ab -> Gdim -> Db 

Actually the roots are: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. That's a chain of minor thirds: G-Eb=Bb-Ab-Db... wait G to Eb is minor 3rd down, Eb to Bb is perfect 5th down (not minor third), Bb to Ab is minor 2nd, Ab to Db is perfect 4th. Not consistent. 

But G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db all belong to the diminished axis! In symmetrical diminished harmony, these are all part of the G diminished (whole-half) scale: G-Ab-Bb-B-C#-D-E-F. But our chords don't have C# or B natural. 

G whole-half diminished scale would be G-Ab-Bb-B-C#-D-E-F, but our Db chord suggests flat 5 or something else. 

Another idea: the progression cycles through chords built on every minor 3rd. Gdim, then Eb (which is Gdim's tritone substitution?), Bbm is another diminished axis chord. 

I recall that in jazz, sequences like this often pivot around the tritone. Gdim and Dbmaj7 are tritone partners (G and Db are tritone apart). Eb and A would be, but we have Ab instead. 

Let's list all notes used: 
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db 
- Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb 
- Bbm/F: F, Ab, C? Wait no, Bbm is Bb-Db-F 
- Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb? Ab/G is Ab-C-Eb with G bass, so notes G, Ab, C, Eb 
- Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Db (Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C) 

So full note set: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. That's exactly G natural minor! (G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F) but wait: 
G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F 
But here we have Ab and Db instead of A and D. Oh! It's G Phrygian: G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F. 

Perfect match! G Phrygian scale: 1=G, 2=b2=Ab, 3=b3=Bb, 4=4=C, 5=b5=Db, 6=b6=Eb, 7=b7=F. 

Now map the chords: 
- Gdim: but G diminished would be G-Bb-Db, which is 1-b3-b5 of G Phrygian. However, in Phrygian mode, the i chord is minor, not diminished. Contradiction? 

In G Phrygian, the tonic chord should be G minor (G-Bb-D). But here we have Gdim (G-Bb-Db), which is like a Gm7b5 or half-diminished. But no D natural appears anywhere! Looking back at chords: 
- All chords use Db or Eb, never D natural. Db appears in Gdim and Dbmaj7. Eb appears in Eb/G and Ab/G. 

So the scale must have b5 (Db) instead of natural 5 (D). That means it's G altered Phrygian? Actually, this is exactly the G half-diminished scale, which is the same as G Locrian mode. 

G Locrian: 1=G, 2=b2=Ab, 3=b3=Bb, 4=4=C, 5=b5=Db, 6=b6=Eb, 7=b7=F. Yes! And the characteristic chord is G half-diminished (Gm7b5), which is functionally equivalent to Gdim7 but usually written as Gm7b5. 

In jazz contexts, Gdim might be shorthand for G half-diminished, though technically dim is triad and half-dim is 7th chord. Given the context, it's safe to interpret Gdim here as representing the half-diminished tonality. 

Now verify all chords in G Locrian: 
- Gdim (assumed Gm7b5) = tonic chord (i) 
- Eb/G: Eb is bVI, G is major 6th - in Locrian, bVI is diatonic (Eb is degree 6) 
- Bbm/F: Bb is b3, F is b7 - Bbm is iii (since scale degrees: iii = Bb-Db-F) 
- Ab/G: Ab is b2, G is root - Ab is the bII chord (diatonic in Locrian) 
- Dbmaj7/F: Db is b5, F is b7 - Db is the v chord (Db-F-Ab-C), but in Locrian v should be diminished. Wait, Dbmaj7 has major 3rd (F) and major 7th (C), but in G Locrian scale, Db is b5, F is b7, Ab is 1, C is natural 4 - all diatonic! Dbmaj7 = Db-F-Ab-C, which are degrees 5-7-2-4 of G Locrian. So it's a Dbmaj7 chord built on the b5 degree. 

In modal harmony, this makes sense - the progression is emphasizing the G Locrian mode with its characteristic b2, b3, b5, b6, b7. The persistent G bass note reinforces G as the tonal center, while the chords cycle through the unstable intervals of Locrian. 

The Dbmaj7/F is particularly interesting - it's Db major 7th, which in a major key would be non-diatonic, but in G Locrian, Db is the b5 (tritone from root), so Db major is chromatic? Wait no: in G Locrian scale, the chord on Db would be Db half-diminished? Let's spell: 
G Locrian notes: G Ab Bb C Db Eb F 
Db chord: Db - (Eb? no) - F - Ab - C → Db-F-Ab-C is major 7th! Because F is major 3rd above Db (Db to F is major 3rd), Ab is 5th, C is 7th. Yes, and all these notes are diatonic to G Locrian: 
- Db = 5th degree (b5) 
- F = 7th degree (b7) 
- Ab = 2nd degree (b2) 
- C = 4th degree (4) 

So Dbmaj7 is a perfectly diatonic chord in G Locrian - it's the chord on b5, which is major 7th due to the b2 and natural 4 in the scale. 

This confirms G Locrian is consistent. The progression strongly centers on G with bass emphasis, and all chords fit the G Locrian scale without accidentals. 

Therefore, the key is centered on G, and the mode is Locrian. 

Key point: Locrian is rare as a true tonal center because the tonic chord is diminished, creating instability. But in this progression, by constantly returning to Gdim and using G in the bass for other chords, it forces G as the tonal center despite the diminished quality. That's characteristic of Locrian usage in modern and jazz contexts. 

So final answer: Key = G, Mode = Locrian.


Based on the chord progression you provided—**Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**—the **key center is G**, and the **mode is Locrian**. Here's a step-by-step analysis to explain why:

---

### **1. Core Observation: G as the Tonal Center**
- **Gdim** (G–B♭–D♭) appears **8 times** in this 15-chord progression, dominating the harmony.
- **G is consistently in the bass** for most chords (e.g., `Eb/G` = G in bass, `Ab/G` = G in bass, `Bbm/F` = F in bass but immediately resolves to Ab/G with **G in bass**).
- This creates a **pedal point** (sustained bass note) on **G**, firmly establishing it as the tonal center. Despite Gdim being unstable (diminished triads lack a strong tonal pull), the repetition and bass emphasis force G to function as the "home" pitch.

---

### **2. Why Locrian? Scale Analysis**
The progression uses notes exclusively from the **G Locrian mode** (the 7th mode of A♭ major). Here's the scale:  
**G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F**  
*(1 – ♭2 – ♭3 – 4 – ♭5 – ♭6 – ♭7)*  

#### **Chord Breakdown in G Locrian:**
| Chord (Symbol) | Notes (Actual) | Function in G Locrian | Why It Fits |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Gdim** | G – B♭ – D♭ | **Tonic (i°)** | Diatonic to Locrian (1–♭3–♭5). The unstable tonic is characteristic of Locrian. |
| **Eb/G** | G (bass) + E♭ – G – B♭ | **♭VI chord over G** | E♭–G–B♭ = ♭6–1–♭3 of G Locrian. G in bass emphasizes the tonic. |
| **Bbm/F** | F (bass) + B♭ – D♭ – F | **iii° chord over F** | B♭–D♭–F = ♭3–♭5–♭7. F (♭7) in bass is a passing tone; resolves to Ab/G (G returns as bass). |
| **Ab/G** | G (bass) + A♭ – C – E♭ | **♭II chord over G** | A♭–C–E♭ = ♭2–4–♭6. G in bass ties it to the tonic. |
| **Dbmaj7/F** | F (bass) + D♭ – F – A♭ – C | **v chord over F** | D♭–F–A♭–C = ♭5–♭7–♭2–4. F (♭7) in bass is transitional; resolves back to Gdim (tonic). |

#### **Key Evidence for Locrian:**
- **All notes are diatonic to G Locrian:**  
  G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F (no accidentals).  
  - *Example:* Dbmaj7 = D♭–F–A♭–C → all scale degrees of G Locrian (♭5, ♭7, ♭2, 4).  
- **The ♭5 (D♭) is critical:** Gdim (G–B♭–D♭) and Dbmaj7 both highlight the tritone (G–D♭), the hallmark of Locrian.  
- **♭II (Ab) and ♭VI (Eb) chords** are standard in Locrian harmonies.  
- **No dominant V chord:** In major/minor keys, V→I is fundamental, but here the "V" would be D (D–F♯–A), which **never appears**. Instead, unstable chords like Gdim and Dbmaj7 dominate.

---

### **3. Why Not Other Keys/Modes?**
- **G Minor?**  
  G natural minor (G–A–B♭–C–D–E♭–F) would have D natural, but **D♭** (not D) is used constantly (e.g., Gdim = G–B♭–D♭). D♭ replaces D natural, ruling out minor.  
- **G Phrygian?**  
  G Phrygian (G–A♭–B♭–C–D–E♭–F) would have **D natural**, but this progression uses **D♭** (e.g., Gdim, Dbmaj7). D♭ = ♭5 confirms Locrian, not Phrygian.  
- **Ab Major?**  
  Gdim is vii° in A♭ major, but:  
  - Bbm (not B♭ major) contradicts A♭ major (which requires B♭ major, not minor).  
  - Dbmaj7 is ♣IV in A♭ major but functions as **v** here (rooted on ♭5 of G), not a subdominant.  
- **Tritone Substitution?**  
  Dbmaj7 is Gdim's tritone partner (G–D♭), but the progression resolves to Gdim, not a dominant V–I. The bass pedal on G confirms Locrian, not a temporary substitution.  

---

### **4. Why Locrian is Rare (But Correct Here)**
- Locrian is seldom used as a true tonal center because **the tonic chord is diminished** (Gdim), creating inherent instability.  
- **This progression "hacks" Locrian** by:  
  - Using **G as a pedal bass note** (in Gdim, Eb/G, Ab/G) to reinforce G as the center.  
  - Resolving non-tonic chords (e.g., Bbm/F → Ab/G) **back to Gdim**, avoiding traditional cadences.  
- In modern/jazz harmony, this is a deliberate Locrian construction (e.g., in Miles Davis' "Blue in Green" or Metallica's use of modal interchange).

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key Center:** **G** (all chords orbit around G as the root/pedal point).  
- **Mode:** **Locrian** (scale: **G–A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F**).  
- **Why it works:** The persistent G in the bass and exclusive use of Locrian scale tones force Gdim to function as the unstable tonic. Dbmaj7/F → Gdim is the climax, emphasizing the ♭5 (D♭) resolving to the tonic.  

This is a **textbook Locrian progression**—uncommon but logically consistent. If you hear this, it will sound dark, suspended, and unresolved (due to the diminished tonic), which is the essence of Locrian. 🎵
