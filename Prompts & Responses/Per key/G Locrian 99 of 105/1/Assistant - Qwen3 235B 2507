Let's analyze the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

We’ll analyze this step by step to determine the most likely **key** and **mode**.

---

### Step 1: Identify the Chords More Clearly

Let’s write out the full notes in each chord.

#### Gdim (G diminished):
- G, Bb, Db

This is a fully diminished seventh chord if we add the next note, but in context, it's likely being used as a **passing chord**. In jazz or functional harmony, Gdim often functions as a **vii°7** of Ab major or minor.

But let’s look at the other chords.

#### Eb/G:
- Eb major chord with G in the bass: G, Bb, Eb
- This is **Eb major in first inversion**.

#### Bbm/F:
- Bb major chord with F in the bass: F, Ab, C, Bb? Wait — Bb triad is Bb-D-F. So Bbm/F would be F, Bb, Db? But Bbm is Bb, Db, F.
Wait — is it **Bbm** (B-flat minor), or **Bb** (major)?

The notation says **Bbm/F** — so **Bb minor, first inversion?** But let's be careful.

But in pop/jazz notation, **Bbm** means B-flat minor: Bb, Db, F.

So **Bbm/F** = F, Bb, Db → first inversion of Bb minor.

But — that’s a bit unstable. More context needed.

Wait — look at **Ab/G** — this is Ab major (Ab, C, Eb) with G in the bass? G is not in Ab major. G is a half-step above Gb (F#). So Ab/G is Ab major over G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb.

That creates a **G7(b9)** flavor: G, Bb, Db, F, Ab → but we don’t have F here.

Wait — Ab/G = G, Ab, C, Eb.

That's a G7sus(b9) or part of a diminished structure.

But here's a clue: **Ab/G**, **Eb/G**, **Dbmaj7/F**, **Gdim** — all have ascending or descending bass motion?

Let’s look at **bass line**:

```
G   G   G   G  
G   G   F   G  
G   G   G   G  
G   G   F   G
```

Wait — not quite.

Let’s extract the **bass notes**:

1. Gdim → G
2. Gdim → G
3. Eb/G → G
4. Eb/G → G  
5. Gdim → G
6. Gdim → G
7. Bbm/F → F
8. Ab/G → G  
9. Gdim → G
10. Gdim → G
11. Eb/G → G
12. Eb/G → G  
13. Gdim → G
14. Gdim → G
15. Dbmaj7/F → F
16. Gdim → G

So bass line:  
**G G G G | G G F G | G G G G | G G F G**

Interesting — the bass alternates between **G** and **F**, mostly sitting on **G**, but moves to **F** on beats 7 and 15.

So we have:

- Predominant bass: **G**
- Occasional move to **F** in the bass under Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F

Now look at the chords:

- **Gdim** appears frequently — G, Bb, Db
- **Eb/G** — Eb major over G: G, Bb, Eb
- **Bbm/F** — Bb minor over F: F, Bb, Db
- **Ab/G** — Ab major over G: G, Ab, C, Eb
- **Dbmaj7/F** — Db major 7 over F: F, Ab, C, Eb

Hmm.

Now let’s look at the overall harmonic movement.

---

### Step 2: Look for Tonal Center

Most chords have **G** in the bass, and the progression ends on **Gdim**, which is unusual for a tonic.

But Gdim is unstable. It wants to resolve.

However, notice that:

- Gdim contains: G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G contains: G, Bb, Eb → shares G, Bb with Gdim, but Eb instead of Db
- Ab/G contains: G, Ab, C, Eb → again, G and Eb
- Dbmaj7/F = F, Ab, C, Eb
- Bbm/F = F, Bb, Db

Wait — what if this revolves around **Ab major**?

Let’s try that.

### Ab Major Key:

- Key signature: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db
- Chords in Ab major:

| Degree | Chord       |
|--------|-------------|
| I      | Ab          |
| ii     | Bbm         |
| iii    | Cm          |
| IV     | Db          |
| V      | Eb          |
| vi     | Fm          |
| vii°   | Gdim        |

Ah! **Gdim is the vii° chord in Ab major**.

That’s a big clue.

So **Gdim** = **vii°7 of Ab** — very common dominant-function chord leading to Ab.

But in this progression, we go from Gdim to **Eb/G**, not Ab.

Wait — Eb is the **V chord** in Ab major.

So:

- Gdim (vii°) → can lead to Eb (V)
- Then Eb → ? Maybe to Ab?

But instead, we get Ab/G later.

Let’s map chords to Ab major:

| Chord       | Function in Ab?               |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Gdim        | vii° — dominant function      |
| Eb/G        | V6 (first inversion of V)     |
| Bbm/F       | ii6 (second inversion of ii)  |
| Ab/G        | I6 (first inversion of I)     |
| Dbmaj7/F    | IV6 (second inversion of IV)  |

Wait — Dbmaj7 is **Db, F, Ab, C** — that’s the **IV chord** in Ab major.

So all of these chords belong to **Ab major**:

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb = V
- Bbm = ii
- Ab = I
- Db = IV

**All diatonic to Ab major.**

So now look at the progression:

```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G      → vii°  vii°  V6    V6
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G      → vii°  vii°  ii6   I6
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G      → vii°  vii°  V6    V6
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F Gdim   → vii°  vii°  IV6   vii°
```

Wait — the last chord is **Gdim**, not resolving to I.

But this could be a **turnaround** or loop.

Alternatively, it might be in **Ab major**, and the Gdim at the end is leading back to Ab again (if looped).

But the progression **never firmly lands on Ab**, except as **Ab/G**.

But Ab/G appears only once.

So is **Ab** the tonic?

Possibility: **Tonic is Ab major**, but the progression avoids landing on root-position Ab, instead circling around dominant and pre-dominant areas.

Alternatively: Is this **G harmonic minor** or something else?

Try that.

### Try G Minor?

G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

Chords:

- i = Gm
- ii° = Adim
- III = Bb
- iv = Cm
- v = Dm
- VI = Eb
- VII = F

But we have **Gdim** — not in G minor. Gdim would require Bb and Db — G minor has Bb and D natural — not Db.

So Gdim is not in G minor.

But **Gdim** is in **Ab major**, as vii°.

Alternatively, **Gdim** can be a **common-tone diminished** chord, or part of **secondary dominants**.

But given that:

- Gdim → Eb/G: Gdim is vii° of Ab, and Eb is V of Ab → so Gdim leads to V, not directly to I — that’s common in sequences.

Also:

- Bbm/F → Ab/G: ii → I, both in first/second inversion — very smooth voice-leading.

- Dbmaj7/F → Gdim: IV → vii° — also a passing motion.

The bass line: G → F → G suggests a **descending 5th progression**?

Wait — let’s look at root movement.

But roots are hidden by inversions.

Let’s extract **roots**:

1. Gdim → G
2. Gdim → G
3. Eb/G → Eb
4. Eb/G → Eb
5. Gdim → G
6. Gdim → G
7. Bbm/F → Bb
8. Ab/G → Ab
9. Gdim → G
10. Gdim → G
11. Eb/G → Eb
12. Eb/G → Eb
13. Gdim → G
14. Gdim → G
15. Dbmaj7/F → Db
16. Gdim → G

So root movement:
G G Eb Eb | G G Bb Ab | G G Eb Eb | G G Db G

Now group:

- First phrase: G → Eb (down a third)
- Second: G → Bb → Ab (G to Bb is +3, Bb to Ab is -2)
- Third: G → Eb
- Fourth: G → Db → G

Interesting: Db to G is a tritone — but Gdim follows, which is closely related to G.

But **Db to G** is a tritone substitution kind of move?

Wait — Db is the IV in Ab major.

And Gdim is vii° of Ab.

So from IV to vii° — that’s a common progression: IV → vii° → I or V

But here: Db → Gdim → (implied Ab?)

But it loops.

Now, look at chords sharing notes:

- **Gdim** = G, Bb, Db
- **Eb/G** = G, Bb, Eb → shares G, Bb
- **Ab/G** = G, Ab, C, Eb → shares G, Eb? G is common, Eb appears in Eb/G too.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, Eb → shares Ab, C, Eb with Ab chord.

Strong connections to **Ab major**.

Also, **Gdim** is symmetric but functions here as **vii°7 of Ab** — especially if we consider it as G-Bb-Db-Fb (E), but even without the Fb, it implies dominant function.

In jazz, **Gdim** is often used as **secondary diminished** leading to Ab or Eb.

For example:

- Gdim → Ab: common
- Gdim → Eb: also common (because Gdim is enharmonic to Bdim, Ddim, Fdim — all sharing same notes)

Gdim7 = G, Bb, Db, Fb (E)

But here, it may be just triad.

Still, functionally, Gdim moving to Eb is like **vii°7/V in Ab** — that is, the secondary leading-tone chord of V.

Wait — in Ab major:

- V = Eb
- vii°7/V = **D#°7** = D#, F#, A, C → enharmonic to **Ebdim7** = Eb, Gb, Bbbb, Db → but not Gdim.

Gdim = G, Bb, Db → which is **vii° of Ab**, not of Eb.

So Gdim → Eb is **vii° → V**, not vii°7/V.

Yes — in Ab major: vii° → V is a valid progression (like in retrograde of circle of fifths).

Example: vii° – V – I

Here we see: Gdim → Eb/G → ... → Ab/G

So: vii° → V → I (via iv or ii)

Yes — fits.

Now sequence:

Line 1: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G → vii° vii° V6 V6  
Line 2: Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G → vii° vii° ii6 I6  
Line 3: Same as line 1  
Line 4: Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim → vii° vii° IV6 vii°

So the last line goes to **IV** then back to **vii°**, skipping the tonic.

But in context, may imply **Ab major** as tonal center.

All chords are diatonic to Ab major:

- Gdim → vii°
- Eb → V
- Bbm → ii
- Ab → I
- Db → IV

And all in inversions.

So **key: Ab major**

**Mode: Ionian (major)**

But is there a modal flavor?

The progression avoids the **I chord in root position**, and **Ab only appears once, in first inversion**, so the tonic is somewhat obscured.

But the **harmonic motion** and **chord functions** clearly point to **Ab major**.

Another possibility: **G Phrygian**?

G Phrygian: G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

Scale degrees: b2, b3, b6, b7

Chords in G Phrygian:

- i = Gm
- II = Ab
- III = Bb
- iv = Cm
- v = Dm
- VI = Eb
- VII = F

But we have **Gdim**, not Gm. Gdim has Db, which is not in G Phrygian (which has D natural).

So no.

**G half-diminished?** Gm7b5? But we have Gdim (diminished triad), not half-diminished.

Still not fitting.

Alternatively, **Ab Dorian**? But Dorian has raised 6th — Eb, not E natural — but Ab Dorian would be: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb — no, doesn't fit.

No — simplest explanation is **Ab major**, with modal interchange or voice-leading inversions.

### Conclusion:

- **Key: Ab major**
- **Mode: Ionian** (i.e., major key)
- The progression uses **inversions** and **predominant/dominant** chords to create a floating, ambiguous feel, but the tonal center is **Ab**, supported by:
  - ii (Bbm)
  - IV (Db)
  - V (Eb)
  - I (Ab)
  - vii° (Gdim) — leading tone chord

The final **Gdim** acts as a **turnaround**, leading back to the start (likely implying Ab).

- **Key: Ab major**
- **Mode: Ionian** (major)
