### Reasoning

**Analyzing chords and key**

I need to determine the key and mode based on the given chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim."

Gdim contains the notes G, Bb, and Db, forming a diminished triad. Eb/G, Bbm/F, and Ab/G suggest a relationship to E♭ major or possibly C minor due to the flats. With many chords centered around G as the bass, it’s logical to consider G as a potential root, but the context suggests E♭ major/C minor as the overall area.**Determining key context**

The presence of D♭ suggests a key around G♭, but D♭ also fits with E♭ minor, D♭ major, or A♭ major. In A♭ major, D♭ serves as the fourth. For E♭ major, it’s the lowered seventh, hinting at a Mixolydian mode. 

However, D♭ isn’t diatonic to E♭ major—only E♭ minor or E♭ Mixolydian includes it. Gdim doesn’t fit in E♭ major either. The diminished triad Gdim (G, B♭, D♭) might act as a leading-tone diminished to A♭, resolving effectively to A♭.**Examining chord transitions**

Looking at the progression, we see Bbm/F leading to Ab/G, which indicates a movement from the iv to I chord with a non-chord tone in the bass. The Ab/G chord is essentially an A♭ major chord with G in the bass, functioning like an A♭maj7. This G bass note makes it a leading-tone in A♭ major. 

If A♭ major is the key, then Gdim serves as the vii° triad. In this context, Eb/G represents the first inversion of V, which is E♭ major, while Bbm/F is ii in first inversion. Dbmaj7/F acts as IVmaj7, with the third in the bass.**Confirming A♭ major key**

Looking at the chords: Gdim (vii° in A♭), Eb/G (V6), Bbm/F (ii6), Ab/G (Imaj7 with G in the bass), and Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7 with F in the bass), everything seems to align well with A♭ major. The mode is Ionian. The G in bass shows a stepwise motion that supports G-F-G, reinforcing the presence of D♭ as IV.

Considering E♭ major, Eb/G would fit as I6; however, Gdim would need to be iii°, which isn’t correct because iii in E♭ major is G minor, not diminished. Gdim’s inclusion of D♭ confirms it doesn’t fit. Thus, A♭ major is the key!**Confirming A♭ major diatonic chords**

Looking at the chords: B♭ minor (B♭ D♭ F), iii as C minor (C E♭ G), IV as D♭ (D♭ F A♭), V as E♭ (E♭ G B♭), and vii° is G (G B♭ D♭), I see that everything fits within the A♭ major key.

So, Eb/G is V6, Bbm/F is ii6, Ab/G functions as Imaj7 with G in the bass, and Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7 with the third in the bass. It all points to A♭ major with an Ionian mode. I’ll respond succinctly, confirming A♭ major as the key and Ionian as the mode, along with clear reasoning.

Key: A-flat major
Mode: Ionian (major)

Why: All chords are diatonic to A♭ major:
- Gdim = vii° (G–B♭–D♭)
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = Imaj7 with 7th in bass
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in first inversion
