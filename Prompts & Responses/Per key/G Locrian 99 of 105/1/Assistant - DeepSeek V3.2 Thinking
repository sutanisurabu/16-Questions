**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or in minor keys, so I should look for a key that fits these chords.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G (which is an Eb major chord with a G in the bass)

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Bbm/F (Bbm chord with F in the bass)

- Ab/G (Ab major chord with G in the bass)

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Dbmaj7/F (Dbmaj7 chord with F in the bass)

- Gdim

Now, I see that Gdim appears frequently. Gdim is a diminished chord, which is typically vii° in a key or used as a common-tone diminished chord.

Let me think about what key Gdim might belong to. A diminished chord is made up of minor thirds, so Gdim consists of G, Bb, Db, and E (since diminished chords are often seventh chords, but here it might be just triads, but I'll assume full diminished for analysis).

Gdim: G, Bb, Db, E (if we consider the diminished seventh chord).

But in the progression, we have Eb/G, which is Eb major with G bass, so the notes are Eb, G, Bb with G in bass. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb, Db, F with F in bass, so notes Bb, Db, F. Ab/G is Ab, C, Eb with G in bass, so notes Ab, C, Eb, G. Dbmaj7/F is Db, F, Ab, C with F in bass, so notes Db, F, Ab, C.

Now, let's find a key that fits these chords.

First, consider the Eb chords. Eb major is the IV chord in Bb major or the bVI in G minor? Let's think in terms of minor keys since diminished chords are common there.

Gdim could be the vii° chord in Ab major or Ab minor? Let's see.

In major keys, the vii° chord is based on the leading tone. So for Ab major, the leading tone is G, so Gdim would be vii° in Ab major. But Ab major has chords: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim. So yes, Gdim is vii° in Ab major.

Now, let's check if other chords fit. We have Eb which is V in Ab major? In Ab major, V is Eb, so Eb/G is just an inversion of Eb major, which is fine.

We have Bbm which is ii in Ab major, and Bbm/F is an inversion.

We have Ab/G which is Ab major with G bass, so it's like I chord with a added bass note, which might be a passing thing.

And we have Dbmaj7 which is IV in Ab major? In Ab major, IV is Db, so Dbmaj7 is just a maj7 version of IV.

So all chords seem to fit in Ab major: I (Ab), ii (Bbm), IV (Db), V (Eb), vii° (Gdim).

But we have Ab/G, which is Ab major with G bass. In Ab major, G is the leading tone, so Ab/G could be seen as a I chord with a leading tone in the bass, which might be used for tension or resolution.

Also, the progression ends with Gdim, which is vii°, and in traditional harmony, vii° often resolves to I, but here it doesn't directly, but in context, it might be leading to Ab.

But let's see the order: after Gdim, we have Eb/G, which is V with G bass, and G is the leading tone, so Eb/G is essentially V with the leading tone in bass, which is common.

Then later we have Bbm/F which is ii with F bass, and F is the sixth scale degree in Ab major, so that's fine.

Then Ab/G which is I with leading tone bass, which might be a cadential thing.

And finally Dbmaj7/F which is IV with F bass, and then Gdim.

So overall, it seems like the key is Ab major.

But let's confirm the mode. Ab major is a major key, so mode is Ionian.

But is there any indication of minor? We have Bbm which is minor, but in major key, ii is minor, so that's normal.

We have Gdim which is diminished, which is also normal.

So I think Ab major is the key.

But let's double-check with the chords.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db, E? Wait, Gdim should be G, Bb, Db, E? But in Ab major, the leading tone chord is G diminished, which is G, Bb, Db, Fb? No, in equal temperament, diminished seventh chord is symmetric.

In Ab major, the seventh chord on G should be G, Bb, Db, Fb which is equivalent to E, but Fb is E only in terms of pitch, but in notation, it's G, Bb, Db, Fb.

But in practice, Gdim is often written as G, Bb, Db, E? But E is not in Ab major; Ab major has G natural, so the seventh should be F, but since it's diminished, it's Fb, which is E natural? This is confusing.

In standard music theory, in a major key, the vii° chord is a diminished triad, and if it's a seventh chord, it is a half-diminished chord, not fully diminished.

In Ab major, the vii° chord is G-Bb-Db, which is a diminished triad, and if we add the seventh, it would be Fb, which is E natural, but in Ab major, the seventh note is G, and the chord seventh should be Fb, which is actually E natural, but in terms of scale degrees, the seventh degree is G, and the chord uses Fb, which is the sixth scale degree lowered? Let's think carefully.

In major keys, the vii chord is based on the leading tone, and it is a diminished triad. When we add a seventh, it becomes a half-diminished chord because the seventh is minor seventh from the root. So in Ab major, vii°7 is G, Bb, Db, Fb. But Fb is equivalent to E natural, but in Ab major, we don't have E natural; we have F, which is the sixth scale degree. So vii°7 has Fb, which is not in the scale? No, in the scale, the seventh chord built on scale degree 7 uses scale degrees 7,2,4,6 which are G, Bb, Db, F. But since the chord is diminished, the seventh between G and F is a minor seventh, so it is half-diminished, not fully diminished. A fully diminished seventh chord would have a diminished seventh, which would require Fb, but in major key, the natural seventh chord is half-diminished.

In this progression, the chord is written as Gdim, which typically means diminished triad, but in context, it might be implying diminished seventh, but in jazz or popular music, "dim" often means diminished seventh chord.

But in the chords, we have Gdim, and later we have Dbmaj7, which has C, so if Gdim is fully diminished, it would have E natural, but Dbmaj7 has C, which is natural in Ab major, so E natural and C natural might clash? Let's see the notes.

If Gdim is G, Bb, Db, E, then E is not in Ab major scale. Ab major has F, not E. So if Gdim has E, it would be outside the key.

But in the progression, we have Eb/G, which has Eb, G, Bb — all in Ab major.

Bbm/F has Bb, Db, F — all in Ab major.

Ab/G has Ab, C, Eb, G — all in Ab major except G? G is in Ab major, so Ab, C, Eb, G are all in Ab major? Ab major has Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So yes, C and G are in Ab major? Scale degrees: 1=Ab, 2=Bb, 3=C, 4=Db, 5=Eb, 6=F, 7=G. So yes, C is the third, G is the seventh, so Ab/G has Ab, C, Eb, G which are scale degrees 1,3,5,7, so it's actually a Abmaj7 chord with G in bass? Abmaj7 would be Ab, C, Eb, G, so yes, Ab/G is an inversion of Abmaj7? But it's written as Ab/G, which typically means Ab major chord with G bass, so the chord is Ab major (Ab,C,Eb) with G bass, so the notes are Ab,C,Eb,G, which is Abmaj7, but since it's written as Ab/G, it might be emphasizing the bass note, but the chord is effectively Abmaj7.

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F is Db, F, Ab, C with F bass, so notes Db,F,Ab,C which is Dbmaj7, all in Ab major.

Now, back to Gdim. If Gdim is a diminished triad, it would be G, Bb, Db, which are scale degrees 7,2,4, all in Ab major. So that's fine. But if Gdim implies a diminished seventh chord, it would add Fb or E, which is not in the scale. But in the progression, we don't have any E natural in other chords, so probably Gdim is just a diminished triad here, or it might be used as a passing chord without the seventh.

In many contexts, "dim" can mean either diminished triad or diminished seventh, but in chord symbols, "dim" often means diminished seventh, but in classical theory, "dim" might mean diminished triad.

To be safe, let's assume that in this progression, Gdim is functioning as the vii° triad in Ab major.

But let's see the bass notes. In Eb/G, the bass is G, which is the leading tone, and in Ab/G, the bass is G, which is leading tone, and in Gdim, the bass is G, so G is frequently in the bass, emphasizing the leading tone.

So in Ab major, the leading tone G is prominent, which makes sense for tension towards tonic Ab.

Therefore, I think the key is Ab major.

But let's see if there is a minor key possibility.

If we consider Ab minor, the natural minor scale would be Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But we have chords like Eb which is major, and Bbm which is minor, but in Ab minor, Bbm would be Bb, Db, Fb which is not Bbm; Bbm in Ab minor would be Bb, Db, Fb? Bbm is Bb, Db, F, but in Ab minor, F is Fb? No, in Ab minor, the scale has Fb, which is E natural, but Bbm has F, which is not in Ab natural minor.

If harmonic minor, Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G natural. So then we have G natural, which is in Gdim? Gdim would be G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is E, so G, Bb, Db, E which is fully diminished, and that fits harmonic minor. But then we have Eb which is V in Ab minor? In Ab minor, V is Eb major, which is correct. But we have Bbm? In Ab harmonic minor, the ii chord would be Bb diminished? Because Bb, Db, Fb? Fb is E, so Bb, Db, E which is diminished, but here we have Bbm which is Bb, Db, F? But F is not in harmonic minor; harmonic minor has Fb, so F natural would be raised sixth? So if we have Bbm, it must be from natural minor or something.

But in the progression, we have Dbmaj7, which in Ab minor would be Db, Fb, Ab, Cb? But Dbmaj7 has F and C, but in Ab minor, F is Fb and C is Cb? So Dbmaj7 would require F natural and C natural, but in Ab harmonic minor, we have Fb and Cb, so F natural and C natural are not in the scale. So Dbmaj7 doesn't fit in Ab minor.

Therefore, Ab minor is not likely.

So, back to Ab major.

Thus, the key is Ab major, and the mode is Ionian.

So, for the answer, I think key of Ab major.

But let's write it properly.

The chord progression primarily revolves around Ab major, as all chords fit within this key. The frequent use of Gdim functions as the leading-tone diminished chord (vii°) in Ab major, often resolving to or emphasizing the tonic Ab. The chords Eb/G and Ab/G reinforce the dominant-tonic relationship with the leading tone G in the bass, while Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F correspond to the ii and IV chords, respectively. The progression does not suggest a minor key, as chords like Dbmaj7 contain notes that align with the Ab major scale (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G).

**Key:** Ab major  
**Mode:** Ionian
