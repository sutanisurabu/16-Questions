### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I've got this chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

I need to figure out the key and mode here. It's a bit cryptic since there are many Gdim chords and passing slash chords like Eb/G. Gdim consists of G, Bb, and Db, while Eb/G is an inversion of an Eb major chord. I see common tones among these chords, so now I’ll try to find a key or mode that encompasses them all.**Determining tonal center**

I've analyzed the pitch collection, and it seems to contain: G, Bb, Db, Eb, Ab, F, and C. This gives me seven notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, and Bb. They match the C Phrygian scale perfectly! So, it looks like I'm working with C Phrygian relative to the Ab major scale. But wait, is C actually functioning as the tonic? There’s no distinct C bass, and the bass notes are toggling between G and F. Maybe G is the tonal center instead?**Testing tonalities and scales**

Let’s check the set we identified, which is C Phrygian. If my tonic were G, then the scale would be G Locrian. The notes for G Locrian are G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, and F. That matches the pitch set as well! This leads me to think the pitch set might be from the Ab major scale. However, the chords don't fully fit within Ab major diatonic structure since Gdim appears. Eb/G is diatonic, and Bbm/F seems to be in the second inversion.**Analyzing chord inversions**

The Bbm chord over F is in second inversion because the fifth, which is F, is in the bass. So, Bbm contains Bb, Db, and F, confirming my thought. Meanwhile, Ab/G is functioning as a tonic over the leading-tone bass, which means it's using diatonic notes. Now, Dbmaj7 is acting as IV in Ab major; that makes sense since C is the third degree of the scale. With Dbmaj7/F, I now realize it’s actually in first inversion, with the third (F) in the bass.**Determining key and mode**

I see that all the chords fit within the Ab major scale. The Gdim chord represents the vii° degree, while Eb/G is the V in first inversion, Bbm/F is the ii in second inversion, and Ab/G is the I over a leading tone. Despite this clarity, the bass alternates between G and F, creating some motion between scale degrees 7 and 6. 

Though the set aligns with Ab major, the emphasis on Gdim might suggest G Locrian as a tonal center. However, due to the functional harmony, I’m inclined to say the key is Ab major (Ionian). Thus, I would conclude: Key: Ab major, Mode: Ionian.

Key: Ab major
Mode: Ionian

All chords are diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6/4
- Ab/G = I over 7 in the bass
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in first inversion

If you describe it by pitch collection alone, it’s the Ab major scale (also G Locrian / C Phrygian), but the functional pull (vii° and V6) points to Ab Ionian as the tonal center.
