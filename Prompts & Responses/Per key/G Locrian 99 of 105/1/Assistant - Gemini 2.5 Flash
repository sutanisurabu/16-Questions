The provided chord progression is:

**Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Dbmaj7/F - Gdim**

To determine the key and mode, we need to analyze the specific chords, their relationships, and especially the presence and function of the diminished chords (Gdim) and the stable chords (Eb/G, Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F).

### Chord Analysis:

1.  **Gdim (G - Bb - Db):** This diminished chord is highly prevalent, suggesting it is a defining characteristic of the sound. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords, but their overwhelming presence here might indicate a specific scale where G, Bb, and Db are common, or that the Gdim is the tonic/primary structural chord (unlikely in standard major/minor, but possible in exotic scales or certain jazz/modern contexts).
2.  **Eb/G (G - Bb - Eb):** A root third inversion of an Eb major chord. The notes G and Bb link directly to the Gdim chord.
3.  **Bbm/F (F - Bb - Db):** A root third inversion of a Bb minor chord. Notes Bb and Db link to the Gdim chord.
4.  **Ab/G (G - Ab - C - Eb):** Likely a suspension or a passing chord, potentially a variation of an Ab chord (Ab major = Ab - C - Eb); with the G in the bass, it creates a dominant-like sound without the tritone.
5.  **Dbmaj7/F (F - Db - F - Ab - C):** A root third inversion of a Db Major 7th chord. Notes Db and Ab link to the Bb minor and G diminished chords.

### Identifying the Core Pitch Collection:

By combining the notes from the most frequent and most structurally significant chords:

*   Gdim: G, Bb, Db
*   Eb: Eb, G, Bb
*   Bbm: Bb, Db, F
*   Dbmaj7: Db, F, Ab, C

The aggregate pitch collection is: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

This sequence of notes matches the scale of **F Harmonic Minor** or **Db Harmonic Major**.

*   **F Harmonic Minor:** F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, E (The missing pitch is E, but the C and F are strongly present, and Db is the flattened 6th.)
*   **Db Harmonic Major:** Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C (This scale also contains the entire collection, plus C.)

Let's look at the intervals from the perspective of the **G Diminished chord (Gdim)**, which dominates the progression.

### Evaluating Potential Keys/Modes:

The strong emphasis on the notes **G, Bb, and Db** suggests these pitches are fundamental.

#### 1. F Minor Context (Specifically F Harmonic Minor)

*   **Tonic:** F
*   **Gdim:** The **supertonic diminished chord (ii°)** in F harmonic minor (F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, E). The ii° is G - Bb - Db.
*   **Eb:** The **subdominant chord (bVI)** in F natural minor (Eb, G, Bb).
*   **Bbm:** The **subdominant chord (iv)** in F minor (Bb, Db, F).
*   **Dbmaj7:** The **submediant chord (bVImaj7)** in F minor (Db, F, Ab, C).

**Evaluation:** This fits perfectly. The progression revolves around chords built on the second, third, fourth, and sixth degrees of F minor, with the Gdim (ii°) being the central, unstable element that constantly resolves or cycles back to the F-minor-related harmonies (Eb, Bbm, Db).

#### 2. Db Major Context (A possibility due to Dbmaj7)

The dominant chord in Db major is Ab. The subdominant is Gb. Neither Ab nor Gb major/minor structures seem central, but a Dbmaj7 chord is present.

#### 3. G Diminished Context (G Locrian or Exotics)

If Gdim is the tonic, the scale is likely Locrian or highly exotic. Given the clear presence of standard minor function chords (Eb, Bbm, Dbmaj7), an interpretation based on a standard scale (F Minor) where Gdim serves a structural, pre-dominant function is much more probable.

### Conclusion

The chord progression utilizes the core harmonies of **F Minor**, specifically incorporating the unique pitches of the harmonic minor scale.

*   The **Gdim** is the **ii° chord** (supertonic diminished).
*   The surrounding chords **Eb, Bbm, and Dbmaj7** are all standard harmonies (VI, iv, bVI) in the F minor system.

The repetitive, unsettling nature of the Gdim, juxtaposed with the stable passing harmonies, strongly indicates a mode centered around F, utilizing the harmonic minor structure to create tension (Gdim) and resolution (Eb, Bbm).

**Key and Mode:**

*   **Key:** **F Minor**
*   **Mode:** **F Harmonic Minor** (The specific inclusion of Gdim suggests the scale includes Db, the lowered 6th degree, consistent with the Harmonic Minor structure in relation to the ii° chord.)
