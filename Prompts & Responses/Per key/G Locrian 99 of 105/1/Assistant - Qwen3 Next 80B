This chord progression:

> **Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**

...is highly chromatic and ambiguous, but we can analyze it carefully to determine the most likely **key** and **mode**.

### Step 1: List all the chords with root and voicing

Let’s interpret each chord properly:

| Chord          | Full Interpretation      | Notes (from root)              |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Gdim           | G diminished triad       | G, Bb, Db                      |
| Gdim           | —                        | G, Bb, Db                      |
| Eb/G           | Eb major triad / G bass  | G, Bb, Eb                      |
| Eb/G           | —                        | G, Bb, Eb                      |
| Gdim           | —                        | G, Bb, Db                      |
| Gdim           | —                        | G, Bb, Db                      |
| Bbm/F          | Bb minor triad / F bass  | F, Ab, Bb                      |
| Ab/G           | Ab major triad / G bass  | G, Ab, C                       |
| Gdim           | —                        | G, Bb, Db                      |
| Gdim           | —                        | G, Bb, Db                      |
| Eb/G           | —                        | G, Bb, Eb                      |
| Eb/G           | —                        | G, Bb, Eb                      |
| Gdim           | —                        | G, Bb, Db                      |
| Gdim           | —                        | G, Bb, Db                      |
| Dbmaj7/F       | Db major 7 / F bass      | F, Ab, C, Db                   |
| Gdim           | —                        | G, Bb, Db                      |

Note: The slash chords (like Eb/G) indicate the bass note is G, but the chord is Eb major (or implied).

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal center — Is there a “home” chord?

The progression is dominated by **Gdim** — it appears 8 times. That’s very significant.

Gdim = G–Bb–Db  
This chord is the **ii°** of F minor, and also the **vi°** of Ab major.

But Gdim is also the **leading-tone diminished chord** in Ab major or F minor.

Let’s examine the other chords:

- **Eb/G** → G, Bb, Eb → This is **Eb major in first inversion**  
  - Eb major: Eb–G–Bb → same as G–Bb–Eb → so it's **Eb major** triad with G in bass
- **Bbm/F** → F–Ab–Bb → **Bb minor with F in bass** → F is the 5th
- **Ab/G** → G–Ab–C → **Ab major with G bass** → G is the flat 7th of Ab
- **Dbmaj7/F** → F–Ab–C–Db → this is a **Dbmaj7 chord with F in bass**

Notice: **F–Ab–C–Db** = Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C  
→ So Dbmaj7 contains: Db, F, Ab, C

→ That’s a **major 7th chord a tritone away from G** — which is very telling.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the function of Dbmaj7

Dbmaj7 is an unusual chord here. But note:

**Db and G are a tritone apart** — and the tritone relationship is **the most common substitution relationship in jazz** (e.g., tritone substitution).

In functional harmony, **Gdim often acts as a substitute for dominant 7th chords** (specifically, Gdim = F#7♭9, or G° = part of D7♭9).

But **Dbmaj7** is not a dominant — it’s a **major 7th**.

Wait — **Dbmaj7 = F#7♭9**? Let’s check:

F#7♭9 = F#–A#–C#–E–G  
Not the same as Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C

But here’s the **critical insight**:

> **Dbmaj7 contains the same notes as F#7♭9 in a different voicing?**  
No — different notes.

BUT — here's something far more important:

> **Dbmaj7 with bass on F = F–Ab–C–Db**  
This is **not a standard diatonic chord** — but notice:

- F–Ab–C = F minor triad  
- Then adding Db → F minor + Db = **Fm6/Db** or **Dbmaj7/F**

Wait — **F–Ab–C–Db** is **also the notes of Ab7**:

**Ab7 = Ab–C–Eb–Gb** → no, doesn’t match.

Wait — let's invert it.

F–Ab–C–Db → rearrange as **Db–F–Ab–C** → that's **Dbmaj7**

So the chord **Dbmaj7/F** = Dbmaj7 with F in the bass.

### Step 4: Look for key signatures or scales that fit

Let’s try to find a key where **Gdim** and **Dbmaj7** make sense together.

Gdim: G–Bb–Db  
Dbmaj7: Db–F–Ab–C

So we have:  
G, Bb, Db, F, Ab, C

List all unique notes:

> **C, Db, F, G, Ab, Bb**

That’s 6 notes:  
C, Db, F, G, Ab, Bb — which is 6 of 7.

What key has these?

Try **Ab major** scale:

**Ab major**: Ab – Bb – C – Db – Eb – F – G → YES!

That’s: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Our notes are: **C, Db, F, G, Ab, Bb** — missing **Eb**

So we’re missing Eb — but we have all other notes of **Ab major**.

So the notes used are: **Ab major scale minus Eb**

That’s the **Ab major scale without the 5th (Eb)**.

That’s unusual, but possible — common in modal or chromatic jazz contexts.

Now check the chords:

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db → these are the 7th, 2nd, and 4th degrees of Ab major  
  → So Gdim = **vii°** (leading-tone diminished triad) in **Ab major**

- **Eb/G** = Eb major → Eb is **the 5th degree of Ab major**, but we don’t have Eb in the chord — we have **G, Bb, Eb**, but Eb is the root. But in the chord Eb/G, we're implying **Eb major triad**, which includes Eb — *an outside note!*  
  → Wait — **Eb is not in Ab major**.

Uh-oh — **Eb major chord = Eb–G–Bb**, but **Eb is not in Ab major scale** — it's **chromatic**.

So now we have a conflict.

### Step 5: Reconcile Eb major chord

Eb major: Eb–G–Bb — these are **not in Ab major**.

Ab major: Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G → Wait! **Eb IS in Ab major!**

I made a mistake!

Ab major scale:  
**Ab – Bb – C – Db – Eb – F – G**

Yes! **Eb is the 5th degree!**

So Eb is **in Ab major**.

So:

- **Eb major** = Eb–G–Bb → in key of Ab major, this is the **V chord** (dominant)

But wait — **Eb major = V of Ab?**  
No — in Ab major:

- I = Ab  
- ii = Bbmin  
- iii = Cmin  
- IV = Db  
- **V = Eb major** ← YES! Exactly  
- vi = Fmin  
- vii° = Gdim

Perfect!

So now the chords make sense!

### Step 6: Re-analyze all chords in **Ab major**

| Chord          | Function in Ab major?         | Notes       | Notes in Ab major? |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Gdim           | vii° (leading tone)           | G–Bb–Db     | Yes                 |
| Eb/G           | Eb major (V) in 1st inversion | G–Bb–Eb     | Yes (Eb is root)    |
| Bbm/F          | Fmin (vi) → but written as Bbm/F → F is 5th of Bbmin?  
                 → Bbm = Bb–Db–F, so F is 5th → so **vi in second inversion?**  
                 But Bbm = ii in Ab major?  
                 Wait — in Ab major:  
                 ii = Bb min → yes!  
                 So **Bbm/F = ii6** (ii chord in second inversion) → F is the 5th, bass = 5th → functional in Ab major? **Slightly unusual**, but acceptable |
| Ab/G           | Ab major (I) with G bass → **I with flat 7 in bass** → **I6/4?** or **I with added b7**  
                 Ab = Ab–C–Eb  
                 With G bass: G–Ab–C → that's **Ab major with a 7th added?**  
                 But G is the leading tone (7th of Ab) → so this is **Abmaj7?**  
                 Abmaj7 = Ab–C–Eb–G → YES!  
                 So **Ab/G = Abmaj7 in 3rd inversion** (G in bass)  
                 Very common in jazz! |
| Dbmaj7/F       | Db = IV = Db–F–Ab–C  
                 Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C  
                 F in bass = IVmaj7 in 2nd inversion → common in jazz, especially for color |

So everything fits beautifully in **Ab major**!

| Chord          | Function           | Notes      | Role                               |

| Gdim           | vii°               | G–Bb–Db    |                                    |

| Gdim           | vii°               | G–Bb–Db    |                                    |
| Gdim           | vii°               | G–Bb–Db    |                                    |

| Gdim           | vii°               | G–Bb–Db    | Resolution to...? (could loop or end) |

### Step 7: Mode?

It’s not modal in the sense of Dorian, Phrygian, etc.

This is **functional harmony** in **Ab major** — with some chromatic color, inversions, and jazz voicings (maj7 chords in odd inversions, diminished as passing/tritone subs).

But the **key** is clearly **Ab major**.

The use of:

- Gdim (vii°)
- V (Eb)
- IVmaj7 (Dbmaj7)
- vi (Bbm)
- I (Ab)

...are all diatonic chords of **Ab major**.

Even the unusual Ab/G (Abmaj7 with G bass) is just a jazz voicing — not modal.

---

## ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: Ab major**  
> **Mode: Major (Ionian)**

The progression uses functional diatonic harmony in **Ab major**, with jazz-like inversions and voicings, but no modal alterations or non-diatonic scales. The Gdim acts as the leading-tone diminished chord, and the Dbmaj7/F is an extended IV chord used for color — all within the Ab major scale.
