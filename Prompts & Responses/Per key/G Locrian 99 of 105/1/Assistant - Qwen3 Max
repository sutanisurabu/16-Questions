To determine the key and mode from the given chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Identify all the chord roots and qualities

- **Gdim**: G–B♭–D♭  
- **Eb/G**: Eb major chord with G in the bass (G–B♭–Eb)  
- **Bbm/F**: B♭ minor chord with F in the bass (F–B♭–D♭)  
- **Ab/G**: A♭ major chord with G in the bass (G–C–E♭–A♭? Wait—Ab major is A♭–C–E♭, so Ab/G = G in bass, chord = A♭–C–E♭ → notes: G–A♭–C–E♭)  
- **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭ major 7 chord with F in the bass → D♭–F–A♭–C, with F in bass → notes: F–A♭–C–D♭

Now, collect all unique pitch classes used:

From Gdim: G, B♭, D♭  
From Eb/G: G, B♭, E♭  
From Bbm/F: F, B♭, D♭  
From Ab/G: G, A♭, C, E♭  
From Dbmaj7/F: F, A♭, C, D♭

All pitch classes:
- **C**
- **D♭** (enharmonic to C#)
- **E♭**
- **F**
- **G**
- **A♭**
- **B♭**

That’s **7 notes**, which correspond to the **key signature of 5 flats**:

**C D♭ E♭ F G A♭ B♭ = C Aeolian? Wait—let’s check:**

Actually, these notes form the **E♭ natural minor scale**:

- E♭ natural minor (Aeolian): E♭–F–G–A♭–B♭–C–D♭

Yes! That matches exactly:
- Root: E♭
- Scale degrees: 1–2–3–4–5–6–♭7 = E♭–F–G–A♭–B♭–C–D♭

So the **key is E♭ minor (natural minor / Aeolian mode)**.

But let’s double-check whether it could be a different mode or key.

### Step 2: Consider harmonic function

- Gdim = vii° in A♭ major **or** ii° in F minor **or** #v° in E♭ minor?
Wait—in **E♭ minor**, the diatonic chords are:

- i: E♭m  
- ii°: F° (F–A♭–C♭ → but C♭ = B, which **we don’t have**; we have C natural)

Ah! **Important**: In **E♭ natural minor**, the 6th and 7th are **C♮ and D♭**. But the **ii° chord** would be **F diminished (F–A♭–C♭)**, which requires **C♭**, not C♮.

But in our chords, we have **C natural**, not C♭.

So perhaps this is **E♭ Dorian**? No—E♭ Dorian has D♮, not D♭.

Wait—what if the key is **G♭ major / E♭ minor with raised 6th**? Hmm.

Alternatively, consider **A♭ major**:

A♭ major scale: A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F–G

That gives notes: A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G — **exactly our set!**

So this is **A♭ major**.

Now let’s check chord functions in **A♭ major**:

- **Gdim**: In A♭ major, G is the **leading tone**, so G° = **vii°**
- **Eb/G**: E♭ major is the **V chord** in A♭ major (E♭–G–B♭), and G in the bass is just first inversion → **V6**
- **Bbm/F**: B♭m is the **ii chord** in A♭ major → B♭–D♭–F; with F in bass = **ii6**
- **Ab/G**: A♭ major chord with G in bass = **I with leading tone in bass** → often used as a **cadential 6/4 or suspension**
- **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭ is the **IV chord** in A♭ major → D♭–F–A♭–C = **IVmaj7**, with F in bass = **IV6**

So **all chords are diatonic to A♭ major**:

- G° = vii°  
- E♭ = V  
- B♭m = ii  
- A♭ = I  
- D♭ = IV

Thus, the key is **A♭ major**.

But wait—why did we think E♭ minor earlier? Because E♭ minor (natural) shares the same key signature as G♭ major, **not A♭ major**.

But A♭ major has **4 flats**: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭  
Our notes: C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭ → that’s **4 flats**: yes! (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭)

So key signature = **4 flats → A♭ major or F minor**

Now, is it **F minor**?

F natural minor: F–G–A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭  
Same notes as A♭ major — yes, **relative minor**.

So could it be **F minor**?

Let’s test chords in **F minor** (natural minor):

- Gdim = **ii°** in F minor → G–B♭–D♭ → yes, matches  
- Eb/G = E♭ major = **♭VII** in F minor → common in minor keys  
- Bbm/F = B♭m = **iv** in F minor → B♭–D♭–F → yes  
- Ab/G = A♭ major = **♭VI** in F minor → A♭–C–E♭ → yes  
- Dbmaj7/F = D♭ = **♭II** in F minor → also possible (Neapolitan area)

So both **A♭ major** and **F minor** are plausible.

Which is more likely?

Look at **harmonic emphasis**:

- The progression **repeatedly uses Gdim → Eb/G**  
  - In **A♭ major**: G° → E♭ = vii° → V → strong dominant motion  
  - In **F minor**: G° → E♭ = ii° → ♭VII → less functional, weaker resolution

- The **Dbmaj7/F** (♭II in F minor, IV in A♭ major):  
  - In A♭ major, IV is a strong pre-dominant  
  - In F minor, ♭II is a modal mixture chord (Neapolitan), used for color

- **Ab/G**: In A♭ major, this is **I with leading tone in bass**, often used in cadences (I6/4 → V, but here it’s just I/G)  
  - In F minor, it’s ♭VI, a common modal chord

- **Final chord is Gdim**, which is unusual for a cadence in either key, but in **A♭ major**, ending on vii° is uncommon  
  - In **F minor**, ending on ii° is also uncommon

But note: **the most frequently used chord is Gdim**, appearing **8 times**, followed by Eb/G (4 times). That suggests **G is a strong harmonic center**?

Wait—if G is the tonal center, what key has G as tonic with these notes?

Try **G Phrygian?** G Phrygian = G–A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F → **exactly our note set!**

G Phrygian uses the same notes as **E♭ major**? Wait:

G Phrygian = 3rd mode of **E♭ major** → E♭ major: E♭–F–G–A♭–B♭–C–D  
But we have **D♭**, not D♮.

So not that.

Wait—our notes are: G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F → that’s the **G Locrian** mode of **A♭ major**:

- A♭ major: A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F–G  
- G Locrian = G–A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F

Yes! **G Locrian** is the 7th mode of A♭ major.

But **Locrian is very unstable** as a tonal center, and rarely used as a key.

However, the repeated **Gdim** suggests G is a pedal or a passing chord, not the tonic.

More likely, **A♭ major** is the key, and **G° is used as a leading-tone chord** resolving to A♭ (though in this progression it often goes to E♭, which is V, so G° → E♭ = vii° → V, which is standard in classical harmony).

Also, **Eb/G** is **V6**, a dominant chord.

The presence of **Dbmaj7/F** = **IV6** supports A♭ major.

Thus, despite the repetition of Gdim, the **functional harmony points to A♭ major**.

But consider voice leading:

- Gdim (G–B♭–D♭) → Eb/G (G–B♭–E♭): smooth voice leading, D♭ → E♭  
- Gdim → Bbm/F: G–B♭–D♭ → F–B♭–D♭: G → F (stepwise)  
- Gdim → Dbmaj7/F: G–B♭–D♭ → F–A♭–C–D♭: B♭ → A♭, G → F

All suggest **Gdim as a common tone diminished chord** or **passing chord**, not tonic.

### Conclusion:

- **Key signature**: 4 flats → A♭ major / F minor  
- **Chord functions**: Best explained in **A♭ major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian (major)**  
- **Tonic**: **A♭**

✅ **Answer: Key = A♭ major, Mode = Ionian**
