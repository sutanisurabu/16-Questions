### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by analyzing this step by step.

First, I need to list out all the chords and see what notes they contain. Starting with Gdim. A diminished seventh chord is typically G-Bb-Db-F. But wait, sometimes it's written as Gdim7, which is G-Bb-Db-F. But here it's just Gdim, which could be a triad: G-Bb-Db. I should confirm that. Diminished triads are root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Gdim triad is G, Bb, Db. But in the context of chords in a progression, especially when written as "Gdim" without the 7, it's likely a triad. However, sometimes people use "dim" for diminished seventh, but I think in most notation, "dim" is triad and "dim7" is the seventh. But to be safe, I should check the specific chords.

Looking at the next one: Eb/G. That's an Eb major chord with G in the bass. So Eb major is Eb, G, Bb. So Eb/G would be G, Eb, Bb. Then Bbm/F is Bb minor with F in the bass. Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So F, Bb, Db. Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass: Ab, C, Eb. So G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait, no. Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So when it's Ab/G, that means G is the bass note, so the notes would be G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait, but a chord with Ab in the bass would be Ab major, but here it's Ab/G, so G is the bass note, so it's a first inversion or something. Wait, actually, when it's written as X/Y, Y is the bass note. So Ab/G means the chord is Ab major, but with G as the bass note. So the notes would be G (bass), then the Ab major chord notes which are Ab, C, Eb. So the full notes would be G, Ab, C, Eb. But that might be an Ab major chord in third inversion? Because the root is Ab, so the order would be Ab, C, Eb, but with G in the bass, so the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. Alternatively, maybe a G minor 7th chord? Wait, G, Bb, Db, F would be Gø7, but here it's Ab/G. Let me check.

Wait, Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So with G in the bass, that's G, Ab, C, Eb. But is that a valid chord? Let's see: the root would be Eb? Because Eb is the fifth of Ab. No, actually, the chord is an Ab major triad with G as the bass note. So the intervals from G: G to Ab is minor second, G to C is perfect fourth, G to Eb is minor sixth. So it's a G minor 7th without the fifth? Wait, G minor 7th is G, Bb, D, F. No, this is different. Alternatively, this might be an Ebmaj7 chord? Because Ebmaj7 is Eb, G, Bb, D. But here it's Ab/G. Let me check the notes: Ab, C, Eb with G bass. So notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. So G is the bass, then Ab, C, Eb. So the notes present are G, Ab, C, Eb. Now, let's see what scale this might belong to.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at the chord progression as a whole. Let's list all the chords:

1. Gdim (G, Bb, Db)
2. Gdim (same)
3. Eb/G (bass G, chord Eb major: Eb, G, Bb) so G, Eb, Bb (but actually, when written as Eb/G, the chord is Eb major with G in bass, so notes are G, Eb, Bb. The top notes would be Eb and Bb over G. So the notes present: G, Eb, Bb. So it's like a G minor 7th? G, Bb, D, F. But here we have G, Eb, Bb. So D is missing. So perhaps it's a Gm7 chord without the fifth? Or Eb6? Wait, Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So in first inversion, G, Bb, Eb. But Eb/G could be G as bass, the chord Eb major, so the notes are Eb, G, Bb with G on the bottom. So G is bass, then Eb and Bb. So the notes are G, Eb, Bb. So that's a G minor 7th chord without the D? Because G minor 7th is G, Bb, D, F. But here there's no D or F. So maybe it's a different chord.

Wait, maybe better to write all the chords in terms of their notes. Let's go through each chord:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Gdim (same)
- Eb/G: bass is G, the chord is Eb major. So notes are G, Eb, Bb (since Eb major is Eb, G, Bb; with G as bass, so the notes would be G (bass), then Eb, Bb above. So the chord is G, Eb, Bb. So notes: G, Bb, Eb.
- Eb/G (same as above)
- Gdim (G, Bb, Db)
- Gdim (same)
- Bbm/F: bass F, chord Bb minor. Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So with F in bass, notes: F, Bb, Db. So F, Bb, Db.
- Ab/G: bass G, chord Ab major. Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. So with G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb. Notes: G, Ab, C, Eb.
- Then Gdim (G, Bb, Db)
- Gdim (same)
- Eb/G (same as before: G, Eb, Bb)
- Eb/G (same)
- Gdim (G, Bb, Db)
- Gdim (same)
- Dbmaj7/F: bass F, chord Db major 7. Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So with F bass: F, Db, Ab, C. Notes: F, Db, Ab, C.
- Then Gdim: G, Bb, Db

So let's list all the unique notes across the entire progression. Let's collect all notes used.

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (since Eb/G has G bass, and the chord is Eb major, which is Eb, G, Bb. So yes, notes G, Eb, Bb)

Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db (since Bbm is Bb, Db, F, bass F)

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb

Dbmaj7/F: F, Db, Ab, C

So let's list all notes present in the entire progression:

- G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C

Now let's list them: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, let's order them:

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. That's seven notes. Let's see what scale this could be.

Check the intervals. C, Db (minor second), Eb (minor third), F (perfect fourth), G (perfect fifth), Ab (minor sixth), Bb (minor seventh). Hmm, a minor scale with all minor seconds? Wait, no. Let's check if this is a mode of a scale.

Alternatively, the notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Let's see: starting from C: C (root), Db (minor second), Eb (minor third), F (perfect fourth), G (perfect fifth), Ab (minor sixth), Bb (minor seventh). So that's the C Phrygian mode? Because the Phrygian mode has a flattened second. The standard Phrygian mode for C would be C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! That's exactly C Phrygian. Wait, no: the Phrygian mode is the 3rd mode of the major scale. For example, E Phrygian would be E, F, G, A, B, C, D. But in terms of intervals, Phrygian has flat 2, flat 3, flat 6, flat 7. Wait, in the C Phrygian, the degrees are 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. So yes: C (1), Db (b2), Eb (b3), F (4), G (5), Ab (b6), Bb (b7). Exactly. So the notes fit C Phrygian.

But wait, is the key C Phrygian? Let's check how the chords function.

But another way is to see if there's a tonic chord. In Phrygian mode, the tonic is minor. Let's see if there's a chord that could be the tonic. However, in the progression, the chords used include Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F.

Wait, Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7, which is built on Db. But Db is part of the C Phrygian scale. The chords in C Phrygian would be:

Chords built on each degree:

C minor (C, Eb, G), but as a scale degree I chord.

II: Db major 7 (Db, F, Ab, C)

III: Eb minor 7 (Eb, Gb, Bb, Db), but in our case, the scale is C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So the chord built on Eb would be Eb, Gb, Bb, Db. But Gb is not in our scale; wait the scale is C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Eb is the third degree. So Eb minor chord: Eb, Gb, Bb. But Gb isn't in the scale. Because the scale has Eb, but the third of Eb chord would be Gb. However, in the scale, the note above Eb would be F, but for the chord on Eb, it's Eb-Gb-Bb. But Gb is not present here because our scale has Db, but no Gb. Wait, hold on: in the C Phrygian scale, the notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Eb is present, but there's no Gb. So the chord built on Eb would be Eb minor (Eb, Gb, Bb), but Gb is not in the scale. So that's a problem. So maybe the scale isn't C Phrygian because it's missing some notes?

Wait, actually, the C Phrygian scale does contain Gb? No, wait. Wait, C Phrygian: the scale degrees are 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. So C is 1, Db (b2), Eb (b3), F (4), G (5), Ab (b6), Bb (b7). Now, the third note of the scale is Eb. To build a chord on Eb, you stack thirds: Eb (root), Gb (minor third), Bb (perfect fifth), Db (minor seventh). But Gb is not in the scale we have here. Our scale has Ab (b6) and Bb (b7), but no Gb. Instead, the scale has Eb, F, G, Ab, etc. So Gb is not present. So if the scale is C Phrygian, then the note Gb would be part of it, but in our progression, we have notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. There is no Gb. So actually, the scale has Bb (flat seventh), but the third degree from C is Eb, but for the chord on Eb, you'd need Gb, but in the progression we don't have Gb. So perhaps the scale isn't C Phrygian.

Wait, let's look at all the notes again. The notes we have in total are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Let's list all the notes in the scale as a set: {C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb}. Now, check if that's a regular scale. The interval pattern between consecutive notes (C to Db is half step), Db to Eb is whole step (but Db to Eb is actually a minor second?), wait no: Db to Eb is a whole step (two half steps). Wait, C to Db is 1 semitone (minor second), Db to Eb: Db to D is semitone, D to Eb is semitone, so total 2 semitones, a whole step. Eb to F: Eb to E is semitone, E to F is another semitone, so 2 semitones, whole step. Wait no: Eb to E is a semitone, E to F is a semitone, so Eb to F is two semitones, a whole step. Then F to G: whole step. G to Ab: semitone. Ab to Bb: whole step. Then Bb to C: whole step. Wait, but this is if we list the scale in order.

Wait let's arrange the notes in ascending order:

C (0), Db (1), Eb (3), F (5), G (7), Ab (8), Bb (10), then to C (12). Wait, in semitones:

C is 0

Db: 1

Eb: 3 (because C to D is 2 semitones, but Eb is 3 semitones from C? Wait, no. Let's count semitones from C:

C: 0

Db: 1

D: 2

Eb: 3

E: 4

F: 5

F#: 6

G: 7

Ab: 8

A: 9

Bb: 10

B: 11

So in the set we have, the notes are C (0), Db (1), Eb (3), F (5), G (7), Ab (8), Bb (10). So the intervals between consecutive notes:

C to Db: 1 semitone

Db to Eb: 2 semitones (Db=1, Eb=3)

Eb to F: 2 semitones (3 to 5)

F to G: 2 semitones (5 to 7)

G to Ab: 1 semitone (7 to 8)

Ab to Bb: 2 semitones (8 to 10)

Bb to C: 2 semitones (10 to 12)

So the interval pattern is: H, W, W, W, H, W, W. Wait, that's the same as the Phrygian mode, but wait: the standard Phrygian mode has the pattern H-W-W-W-H-W-W. Wait, no: for example, E Phrygian (starting on E) is E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E. Intervals from E: E-F (H), F-G (W), G-A (W), A-B (W), B-C (H), C-D (W), D-E (W). So the interval pattern for Phrygian is H-W-W-W-H-W-W.

But in our case, starting from C:

C to Db: H

Db to Eb: W (2 semitones)

Eb to F: W

F to G: W

G to Ab: H

Ab to Bb: W

Bb to C: W

So that's H, W, W, W, H, W, W. Which matches the Phrygian mode pattern. So yes, the scale with notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb is C Phrygian. Because C Phrygian is the same as the 3rd mode of Ab major? Wait, but regardless of the parent key, the scale itself is Phrygian mode.

But wait, sometimes people think of the scale as C Phrygian, which is the same as Ab major scale. Let's check. Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes! Ab major scale: Ab (root), Bb (2), C (3), Db (4), Eb (5), F (6), G (7). Wait, no: actually, Ab major key has notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes. So if you take the notes of Ab major scale, which is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Now, if you start on C, the scale would be C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! So C Phrygian mode is the same as the Ab major scale starting on the 3rd degree (C is the 3rd of Ab major: Ab - Bb - C). So Ab major (key of Ab major) has the notes where C Phrygian is the 3rd mode.

But in the progression, what's the home chord? Let's check the chords used.

Looking at the chords:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db. In C Phrygian, G is the 5th degree. G diminished chord would be a diminished chord on 5th? Wait, usually in a minor scale, the 5th chord is a minor 7th flat 5 or something. Let's build chords on the C Phrygian scale.

C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

I: C minor (C, Eb, G) but with some extensions? But in our progression, do we see a C minor chord? Not really. The chords listed don't include Cm or C.

II: Db major (Db, F, Ab). Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C. Yes! In the progression, we have Dbmaj7/F, which is Db major 7th with F in bass. So the root of the last chord before the end is Dbmaj7/F. That's significant. Also, earlier we have Bbm/F: Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So Bbm chord. And Ab/G: Ab major with G bass.

Wait, Db major chord is present as Dbmaj7. Also, Ab major chord is present. Let's see:

In the key of Ab major, which contains the notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Now, let's see the chords.

Ab major key:

I: Ab major

II: Bb minor

III: C minor

IV: Db major

V: Eb major

VI: F minor

VII: G diminished

Yes, in Ab major, the VII chord is G diminished. Exactly. So Gdim would be the VII chord. Then Eb/G? Eb major would be the V chord. But Eb/G: the chord is Eb major with G bass. In Ab major scale, Eb is the V chord (Eb major: Eb, G, Bb). So Eb/G is a first inversion of Eb major.

Similarly, Bbm/F: Bb minor is the II chord. Bbm (Bb, Db, F), so with F in bass is a first inversion.

Ab/G: Ab major with G in bass (so third inversion), since Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb, and with G bass—wait, Ab with G bass, notes G, Ab, C, Eb. Which might be considered as a rootless Ab major chord? Or a G minor chord? Wait, G minor is G, Bb, D. But here we have G, Ab, C, Eb. That's G, Ab, C, Eb. So that's Gdim7? Because Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, F. But here we have Ab instead of Bb, and C and Eb. No. Alternatively, perhaps Abmaj7? No.

Wait in Ab major scale, the VII chord is G diminished. But Ab/G is not part of the Ab scale's chords. Let's see the chords in Ab major:

Chords:

I: Abmaj

II: Bbm

III: Cm

IV: Dbmaj

V: Ebm (Ebm? No, wait in Ab major, the V chord is Eb major. Wait Ab major scale has Eb as the 5th. Eb major is Eb, G, Bb. Yes. So V is Eb major.

VI: Fm (F, Ab, C)

VII: Gdim

Yes. So Gdim is seventh chord.

In the progression:

Gdim Gdim (VII)

Eb/G (V in first inversion: Eb major with G bass)

Bbm/F (II, Bbm chord with F bass. Bbm is Bb minor: Bb, Db, F; with F bass: F, Bb, Db. Which is F, Bb, Db. That's the IV chord in Ab major? Wait no, in Ab major, IV is Db major. Bbm is II chord. So yes.

Ab/G: what chord is this? Ab major chord in third inversion. But Ab major is the tonic. So Ab/G would be Ab major with G bass. In the scale of Ab major, the tonic chord is Ab, C, Eb. When played with G in bass, notes G, Ab, C, Eb. Which notes correspond to? The G is the leading tone, but Ab is the tonic. So perhaps it's a Gm7b5 chord? Wait G, Bb, Db, F is Gm7b5 (half dim). But here it's G, Ab, C, Eb. So G, Ab (b2), C (4th), Eb (b6). Wait, maybe Gmin7(b9)? No, this seems confusing.

Wait in Ab major key, the II chord is Bbm. Then IV is Dbmaj. So the chord Ab/G... If the key is Ab major, then Ab is tonic. So the Ab maj chord with G in bass: G is the leading tone (since in Ab major, G is the VII note). So Ab chord with G in bass is Ab with a G bass note, so the chord would be Abmaj with G in bass, which is a bit of a dissonance because G is the leading tone to Ab? Wait no, actually in Ab major, the note above G would be Ab, so G is the leading tone to Ab. So having G in the bass while playing Ab chord would create a minor 9th interval between G and Ab, which is quite dissonant. That might not be standard, but perhaps it's a passing chord.

Wait, but looking at the chords used:

- Gdim (VII)

- Eb/G (V first inversion)

- Bbm/F (II first inversion)

- Ab/G (tonic chord with G bass? Not sure)

- Dbmaj7/F (IV maj7 with F bass)

Dbmaj7: in Ab major, Db is the IV chord. So Dbmaj7 would be IVmaj7. Then F is the sixth of the key, so Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C. With F bass, it's F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, what's the tonic? In Ab major key, the tonic is Ab. But in the progression, do we ever see a clear Ab chord without the bass? For example, Ab major chord: Ab, C, Eb. In the progression we have "Ab/G", which is Ab major chord with G bass. So when played as Ab/G, it's G, Ab, C, Eb. So the top notes are Ab, C, Eb, which is Ab major. So the chord is Ab major, but with G in bass. So maybe it's a common chord in the progression.

Another chord: the first chords are Gdim Gdim, which is the VII chord. Then Eb/G, which is V. Then Bbm/F, which is II. So the progression is VII - V - II - ...? But in standard key, the V to I is common, but here maybe the tonic is Ab.

Also, the Dbmaj7 chord is IV. So if the key is Ab major, then chords would be VII (Gdim), V (Eb), II (Bbm), IV (Db). So the progression includes VII, V, II, IV. That makes sense for a key of Ab major. Then the Dbmaj7/F: since F is part of Db chord (Dbmaj7 has F as the third), so with F bass, it's an inversion.

Similarly, the Eb/G: Eb chord has G as the third, so in first inversion. Bbm/F: Bbm chord has F as the fifth (Bbm is Bb, Db, F), so F is fifth—so Bbm/F is first inversion (F, Bb, Db), which is common.

Now, where is the tonic chord? In the progression, Ab/G is present. Ab major chord is the tonic (I), so even though it's inverted, it's likely the tonic chord. So the key would be Ab major. But the question is about key and mode. Wait, but key is generally the major or minor key, and mode would be the scale used. But if it's in Ab major, then the mode would be Ionian. However, in Ab major, all chords would be diatonic. Let's check the chords.

Chords in Ab major:

I: Abmaj

II: Bbm

III: Cm

IV: Dbmaj

V: Ebmaj

VI: Fm

VII: Gdim

Looking at the progression:

Gdim — yes, VII

Eb/G — Ebmaj/I (but Eb major is V, and Eb/G would be V in first inversion)

Bbm/F — Bbm (II), with F as bass (Bbm is Bb, Db, F; so F is fifth of the chord, so in first inversion)

Ab/G — Abmaj (I), with G in bass (so seventh note as bass; third inversion of Abmaj)

Dbmaj7/F — Dbmaj7 is IV, and Dbmaj7 has F as third, so F bass would be third inversion

So all chords fit within Ab major.

Now, the progression alternates between these chords. So it's in Ab major. But in Ab major, the mode would be Ionian. However, sometimes when the tonic chord isn't present, but in this case, we have Abmaj chord (even if inverted), so the key is Ab major.

Wait, but the progression starts with Gdim (VII), then Eb/G (V), then Bbm/F (II), etc. But the tonic chord Ab is present as Ab/G. So the key is Ab major.

But wait, another way: in Ab major, the VII chord is Gdim. But sometimes people might consider the key as C Phrygian, which is the same notes, but root on C. However, if the chord progression centers around Ab as the tonic (especially with Ab/G and possibly other Ab chords), then it's more likely Ab major. But let's see if there's a chord that clearly resolves to Ab. For example, if there's a V to I cadence. In the progression, after Eb/G (V), but the next chord is Bbm/F (II), so not directly resolving. Hmm. Let's see the actual progression:

Gdim (VII) – Gdim (VII) – Eb/G (V) – Eb/G (V) – Gdim (VII) – Gdim (VII) – Bbm/F (II) – Ab/G (I) – Gdim (VII) – Gdim (VII) – Eb/G (V) – Eb/G (V) – Gdim (VII) – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F (IV)

So looking at this, after Fm, wait no. Let's see the chords:

After the 7th chord in the sequence: Bbm/F followed by Ab/G. So Bbm is II, Ab is I. So II to I is a common cadence (like Deceptive Cadence if V to VI, but II to I is also a subdominant to tonic). But in Ab major, II chord is Bbm. So Bbm to Ab is II to I, which is a common progression in some contexts, but usually V to I is more definitive. However, here we have V (Eb) leading into II? Not exactly. Let's see: the sequence before the Ab/G is Bbm/F – Ab/G. So Bbm to Ab (II to I). Yes, that's a cadence. Then after that, back to Gdim, etc.

But also, the Dbmaj7/F is IV chord. Then Gdim, so IV to VII. Not sure. But overall, the presence of Ab as a chord (even if inverted) and the fact that all the chords fit into Ab major points towards Ab major as the key.

Alternatively, if the tonic was C, but in C Phrygian mode, the VII chord would be Bbm (since in C Phrygian, the VII chord would be based on Bb: Bb, Db, F, Ab). Wait, let's build chords for C Phrygian.

C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Chords:

Cm (C, Eb, G)

Dbmaj (Db, F, Ab)

Ebm (Eb, Gb, Bb) — but Gb is not in our progression, but our current progression doesn't have Gb. Wait, our progression has notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Ebm chord would require Gb, which isn't present. So that's a problem. So in C Phrygian, the III chord would be diminished or minor with a Gb. But our chord progressions don't have a Gb, so perhaps the VII chord for Bb. Let's see:

Bb minor chord: Bb, Db, F. Which is present. But in C Phrygian, Bb is the VII note. So Bbm chord is VII chord. But Ab is the VI note. So Ab major chord would be VI chord. But in the progression we have Ab/G as a chord.

If the key was C Phrygian, the tonic chord would be Cm, but we don't see any C minor chords in the progression. The closest would be a chord that includes C, Eb, G, but we don't have that. So that makes C Phrygian less likely as the tonic because the tonic chord isn't present.

So if the progression doesn't have a clear C chord, but does have Ab major chord (even inverted as Ab/G), then likely the key is Ab major, with Gdim as VII chord. Because all chords used are diatonic to Ab major.

Let me confirm. Notes in Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords:

Abmaj: Ab, C, Eb

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Cm: C, Eb, G

Dbmaj: Db, F, Ab

Ebmaj: Eb, G, Bb

Fm: F, Ab, C

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Yes. So looking at the progression chords:

Gdim — yes, seventh chord.

Eb/G: Ebmaj with G bass: Ebmaj is Eb, G, Bb. So yes.

Bbm/F: Bbm (Bb, Db, F) with F bass → F, Bb, Db.

Ab/G: Abmaj with G bass → G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 (Db, F, Ab, C), F bass → F, Db, Ab, C.

All chords fit Ab major scale. There's no Cm chord, which is in the scale (C, Eb, G), but it's not present. But sometimes progressions don't use all chords. So the most likely key is Ab major. However, the mode would be Ionian if it's a major key. But the user asked for key and mode. Key is usually the tonic note and quality, like Ab major, mode might be Ionian. But sometimes people refer to the scale mode. But in this case, since there's a clear dominant chord (Eb major, V), and tonic Ab, it's Ab major.

But let's see if there's a case where it's in a minor key. Suppose if we thought it's F minor. F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. Which is same as Ab major. Yes, F minor scale is relative minor of Ab major. So F natural minor is same as Ab major scale, which is the relative minor. So key could be F minor, with the tonic chord Fm. But looking at the progression, we have Fm? Let's see. In Ab major scale, Fm is VI chord: F, Ab, C. Is Fm present? The chords we have: Eb/G (Eb, G, Bb), Bbm/F (Bbm), which includes F but as the fifth. But there's no explicit Fm chord. The Dbmaj7/F chord contains F, Db, Ab, C. So Dbmaj7 with F bass: Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So F is part of the chord. But the chord itself is Dbmaj7, not Fm. So Fm is not directly present. However, Fm would be F, Ab, C. But in the progression, do we have that? The Dbmaj7/F has notes F, Db, Ab, C, which includes F, Ab, C—that's Fm add 11 or something? No, Fm would be F, Ab, C. Dbmaj7/F has F, Db, Ab, C. So yes, the notes of Fm are present (F, Ab, C) plus Db. So it's not strictly the Fm chord. So the VI chord Fm isn't really present as a triad.

Whereas in Ab major, the tonic is present as Abmaj in various forms (Ab/G is Ab with G bass; the C and Eb are above). So the Ab chord is definitely present. In the progression, the chords include Ab as the highest-level chord in the Ab/G inversion. So even though it's inverted, the root is still Ab.

Therefore, the key is Ab major. The mode is Ionian (since major keys are Ionian mode).

But wait, another possibility: sometimes with diminished chords, you might be in minor key. For example, a key like Ab minor. But let's see. Ab minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But that has Cb and Fb, which we don't see in the notes. The notes we have are natural Eb, F, Ab, etc., so probably not a minor key.

Another check: the presence of Dbmaj7. In Ab major, Db is IV, so Dbmaj7 is the IV chord (which is a major 7th chord). That works. In minor keys, the IV chord is usually minor or diminished, but here it's a major 7th, so suggests major key.

Also, the V chord is Eb major (Ebmaj), which is major. In a minor key, the V chord is often minor or diminished, but in natural minor it's minor, in harmonic minor it's major. However, in this progression, there's an Eb major chord (V), which would fit if in a harmonic minor. But if key is Ab minor, then natural minor is Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But that's not matching our notes since we have no Cb or Fb. But if it's harmonic minor, then the major VII. However, in this case, the presence of Eb major chord (V) would make sense in harmonic minor. But then let's check.

If key is Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. But wait, the seventh degree is G natural. So notes would be Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. But our progression includes F, not Fb. Also, the notes we have are F natural (as in Bbm/F chord), and Ab, etc. So F natural is present, but Fb would be E. So no, that's not matching. So natural minor would have F natural. Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G. Wait, natural minor would have flat 6th and 7th, but the natural minor scale is Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb? No, wait. Let's think.

Standard natural minor scale: minor scale with flat 3, 6, 7.

So Ab natural minor would be: Ab (1), Bb (2), Cb (b3), Db (4), Eb (5), Fb (b6), Gb (b7).

Wait, but in our progression, we have F natural. So F is present, but Fb would be E. So no, the scale we have has F natural. So if we consider F natural as the 6th degree, then in Ab minor, the 6th should be natural minor, but Ab natural minor's 6th is Fb (E), which is not present. So there's a conflict.

Alternatively, maybe it's Dorian mode. But I don't think so.

The most straightforward conclusion is that the key is Ab major, since all chords fit within the Ab major scale, tonic is Ab (even though inverted), and dominant Eb major chord is present.

Another check: G diminished chord is the VII chord in Ab major, which is common. Also, in Ab major, the VII chord is G dim, which is present in the progression multiple times. The V chord is Eb major, which is used (Eb/G). The II chord is Bbm (Bb minor), which is present as Bbm/F. The IV chord is Dbmaj, which is present as Dbmaj7/F. And Ab major as the tonic is present.

So the key is Ab, major. Mode would be Ionian. However, sometimes people might say "key of Ab" without specifying mode, but since it's major, the mode is Ionian. But strictly speaking, the key is Ab major.

Wait, but the question says "determine key and mode". Key usually refers to the tonic note and quality (major/minor), and mode can be specified. But sometimes key refers to the mode. But typically, "key" is major or minor with a tonic, and mode would be specified separately if it's not major/minor. However, since it's clearly a major key, the mode would be Ionian.

Alternatively, if someone considers the scale mode, then Ab major scale is Ionian, so the mode is Ionian. Yes.

But to confirm, let's see if there's a strong tonic chord. In the progression, the Ab/G chord appears in the middle. When they play Ab/G, the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. So the Ab root is present but in the higher register. So it's still the tonic chord. Also, there's no other chord that stands out as stronger tonic.

So conclusion: key of Ab major, mode Ionian.

But sometimes people might say it's in the key of Ab, and the mode is major (Ionian).

Alternatively, another thought: sometimes with chord progressions that are based around diminished chords, people might consider different keys. But in this case, it seems consistent with Ab major.

Another way to check: look at the Dbmaj7 chord. In Ab major, Dbmaj7 is IV chord, which is major seventh. That's correct. If it were C Phrygian, Db would be II chord (which is major), but the tonic would be Cm, which isn't present.

Also, the Gdim in Ab major is VII, which is common.

So yes, Ab major key.

But let's check one more thing. The chord "Bbm/F". Bbm is Bb, Db, F. With F in bass. In the key of Ab major, F is the sixth degree. The Bbm chord is second degree.

Another chord: Dbmaj7/F. Db is fourth degree, and F is the sixth. So Dbmaj7 with F bass. In Ab major, Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So F is the third of Dbmaj7, so bass F is third inversion.

So all chords fit.

Therefore, the key is Ab major (or Ab Ionian mode).

But to phrase the answer: "The key is A-flat major, and the mode is Ionian."

But let's make sure. Alternatively, someone might interpret the progression as having a different tonic. Let's see if there's a V-I cadence. The progression is:

... Bbm/F Ab/G ... So Bbm to Ab. That's II-V? No, Bbm is II, Ab is I. So II to I. It's not a perfect cadence (V to I), but still a cadence. However, in Ab major, it's possible.

If the V chord (Eb) was followed by I (Ab), that would be strong. Let's see: the progression has Eb/G followed by Gdim. So Eb (V) followed by Gdim (VII), which is not a standard cadence. But maybe after that, it goes to Bbm/F, etc. Hmm. Maybe the harmonic function isn't as clear with that, but all chords fit Ab major.

Another check: are there any chromatic notes outside the Ab major scale? Our notes are Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So all natural, no accidentals outside. No sharps or flats beyond Ab major. So no. So yes, definitely Ab major.

So key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

The chord progression provided contains all notes from the **Ab major scale** (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G), with no chromatic alterations outside this scale. All chords are diatonic to Ab major, confirming the key and mode.

### Key Analysis:
- **Tonic (I): Ab major** – The Ab/G chord (Ab, C, Eb with G in the bass) clearly establishes Ab as the tonic. While inverted, the root (Ab) and core notes of the tonic chord are present.
- **V (dominant): Eb major** – The Eb/G chord (Eb, G, Bb) is the V chord of Ab major, a classic harmonic function.
- **VII (leading-tone): Gdim** – The Gdim chord (G, Bb, Db) is the diminished VII chord in Ab major, common in major-key progressions.
- **II (supertonic): Bbm** – The Bbm/F chord (Bb, Db, F) is the II chord of Ab major.
- **IV (subdominant): Dbmaj7** – The Dbmaj7/F chord (Db, F, Ab, C) is the IV chord in first inversion.

### Mode Confirmation:
- The **Ab major scale** corresponds to the **Ionian mode**, as it follows the standard major scale pattern (W-W-H-W-W-W-H).  
- There are no minor-scale characteristics (e.g., no harmonic minor raised seventh or Dorian flat 3), and all chords align perfectly with Ab major.

### Final Answer:
**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian**  

This progression functions entirely within the diatonic framework of **Ab major (Ionian)**, with clear tonic (Ab), dominant (Eb), and subdominant (Db) harmonic relationships. The presence of the Ab tonic chord (even when inverted) and the absence of any non-diatonic accidentals solidify this conclusion.
