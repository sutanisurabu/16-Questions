The provided chord progression is:

**Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Dbmaj7/F - Gdim**

To determine the key and mode, we need to analyze the chords, paying close attention to the frequently occurring harmonies and the dominant root movement.

### 1. Breakdown of Key Chords and Roots

* **G dim ($G, B\flat, D\flat$)**: A diminished triad. This chord is often found in minor keys or as a leading-tone chord (LTC).
    * If it's a vii° chord, it suggests the tonic is one half step higher ($A\flat, B, D\flat$, etc.).
* **Eb/G ($G, B\flat, E\flat$)**: An Eb major chord in first inversion (bass on G).
    * This chord is IV in $B\flat$ major, and VI in $G$ minor or $B\flat$ minor.
* **Bbm/F ($F, B\flat, D\flat$)**: A $B\flat$ minor chord in second inversion.
    * This suggests $B\flat$ minor.
* **Ab/G ($G, C, E\flat, A\flat$)**: This is an $A\flat$ major chord with a G in the bass. This creates a highly dissonant non-functional chord if viewed strictly as $A\flat/G$. **Howerver, given the context (Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F), the most likely interpretation of $A\flat/G$ in this mode is an altered dominant or a suspension/passing chord leading back to Gdim.**
* **Dbmaj7/F ($F, A\flat, C, D\flat$)**: A $D\flat$ major 7th chord in first inversion.
    * This chord is the VII chord in $E\flat$ harmonic minor, or the $IV$ chord in $A\flat$ major, or the $VI$ chord in $F$ minor.

### 2. Identifying Potential Tonic Centers

The most striking feature is the **overwhelming presence of Gdim** and the frequent use of chords derived from $B\flat$ or $E\flat$ major/minor.

#### Scenario A: G Minor/G Phrygian

* **Gdim ($G, B\flat, D\flat$)**: This is not the natural vii° of G minor ($F\sharp^\circ$). It uses $D\flat$ instead of $D$ and $B\flat$ instead of $B$.
* **Eb/G**: VI chord (Common in G natural minor/Aeolian).
* **Bbm/F**: Not a diatonic chord in G minor.
* **Dbmaj7/F**: Not a diatonic chord in G minor.

#### Scenario B: $B\flat$ Minor

* **Gdim ($G, B\flat, D\flat$)**: $D\flat$ is the subtonic, $B\flat$ is the tonic. $G$ is the submediant. This is not a diatonic chord, but is very close to the $V$ chord in $B\flat$ minor when inverted ($F, A\flat, C$).
* **Eb/G**: Subdominant (iv) in first inversion. ($E\flat, G, B\flat$). Diatonic.
* **Bbm/F**: Tonic (i) in second inversion. ($B\flat, D\flat, F$). Diatonic.
* **Dbmaj7/F**: Mediant (III) in first inversion. ($D\flat, F, A\flat, C$). Diatonic.

The diatonic chords of **$B\flat$ Natural Minor (Aeolian)** are: $B\flat m, C^\circ, D\flat, E\flat m, F m, G\flat, A\flat$.

Let's re-examine the given chords against $B\flat$ Minor:

| Chord | Function in $B\flat$ Minor | Diatonic? | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bbm/F** | **i** (Tonic) | Yes | Strong indicator of $B\flat$ minor. |
| **Eb/G** | iv Major?! | No ($E\flat$ minor is iv) | This chord introduces $G$ and $B\flat$ but uses an $E\flat$ major triad. This suggests the parallel major or a modal mixture. |
| **Gdim** | Non-diatonic | No | $G, B\flat, D\flat$. This chord uses notes from $B\flat$ minor ($G, B\flat, D\flat$). The structure is $vi - i - III$. |
| **Dbmaj7/F** | III Major 7 | Yes (A\flat is Ab maj) | F, Ab, C, Db - Diatonic to $B\flat$ minor. |

The music is centered heavily on the notes $B\flat, D\flat, F$ (Tonic), $E\flat$ and $G$.

### 3. The Power of the G Diminished Chord

The chord that dominates the progression is **Gdim**. In film scoring and modal music, a diminished triad built on the **submediant (VI)** is a common signature of **Phrygian or Minor mode** mixed with elements of the $V$ function (often the Neapolitan or the altered dominant).

Let's revisit the notes used by the entire progression:
$G, B\flat, D\flat, E\flat, F, A\flat, C$ (from $D\flat maj7$).

This collection of notes ($B\flat, C, D\flat, E\flat, F, G, A\flat$) is the scale of **$B\flat$ Natural Minor (Aeolian)**.

The only chord that seems to break the diatonic pattern is $E\flat/G$ (iv in $B\flat$ Aeolian should be $E\flat m$). However, in non-classical composition, switching $E\flat m$ to $E\flat$ is a common modal interchange, borrowing the subdominant from $B\flat$ Major.

Now, let's understand the repeated use of **Gdim**:

$G$ is the VI degree of $B\flat$ minor. The use of $D\flat$ implies a relationship to $D\flat$ major (III).

In $B\flat$ minor, the ii° chord is $C^\circ$ ($C, E\flat, G\flat$), and the iv chord is $E\flat m$.

The progression reads like a sequence of non-functional or slowly moving harmonic blocks surrounding the tonic ($B\flat m/F$) and III ($D\flat maj7$).

* **Gdim** acts as a haunting, suspended harmony, based on the VI degree ($G$).
* The harmonic rhythm suggests $B\flat$ minor as the tonic, but the use of the submediant ($G$) as the root of the dominant chord, and the presence of $E\flat$ major (borrowed from $B\flat$ Major), points toward a mixture of minor and major modes around $B\flat$.

### Conclusion on Key and Mode

1. **Tonic:** The presence of $B\flat$ minor (Bbm/F) and the collection of accidentals strongly center the tonality around **$B\flat$**.
2. **Mode:** The primary scale used is **$B\flat$ Natural Minor (Aeolian)** ($B\flat, C, D\flat, E\flat, F, G, A\flat$).
3. **Modal Interchange:** The use of $E\flat$ Major (Eb/G) borrows the Subdominant from the parallel major ($B\flat$ Major), slightly weakening the pure Aeolian sound but fitting comfortably within a minor key context.

The constant repetition of Gdim (a chord built on the VI degree) provides the specific dark, suspended quality characteristic of this progression, typical of film scores.

**KEY AND MODE:** **B-flat Minor (Aeolian)**

*(Note: While the use of Gdim is complex—it is the vii° of $A\flat$ minor—its context alongside Bbm and D flat major resolves it as a chromaticized chord within the B-flat minor environment, functioning as a non-diatonic suspension built on VI)*
