The chord progression you've provided is:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

Let’s analyze this step by step to determine the key and mode.

### Step 1: Look at the Chord Qualities and Common Tones

- **Gdim** = G–B♭–D♭ (or G–B♭–D♭–F♭ enharmonically = G–B♭–C♯–E)
- **Eb/G** = Eb major in first inversion = G–B♭–Eb
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ minor in second inversion = F–B♭–D♭
- **Ab/G** = A♭ major over G in the bass = G–A♭–C–E♭
- **Dbmaj7/F** = D♭ major 7 with F in the bass = F–A♭–C♭–E♭ (but C♭ = B, so spelled as F–A♭–B–E♭ enharmonically)

This last chord is unusual as written; **Dbmaj7** = D♭–F–A♭–C♭, which contains a **C♭** (enharmonic to B). But in the context of **F in the bass**, it's likely functioning as **F–A♭–C♭–E♭**.

But note: C♭ is awkward. In practice, many would respell Dbmaj7 as **C#maj7** if in a sharp key, but here we’re likely in a flat key.

### Step 2: Identify Possible Tonal Centers

We see a strong recurrence of **Gdim**, and many chords contain **G in the bass** or share common tones with Gdim.

- **Gdim** = G–B♭–D♭
- **Eb/G** = G–B♭–E♭ → shares G and B♭ with Gdim
- **Bbm/F** = F–B♭–D♭ → shares B♭ and D♭
- **Ab/G** = G–A♭–C–E♭ → contains G in bass, but other notes are from A♭ major
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F–A♭–C♭–E♭ → all notes from D♭ major (or enharmonic C# major)

Also note that **Gdim** is a common chord in **E♭ minor** and **E♭ harmonic minor**, as it is the **#viio7** (or viio7 of the dominant).

Wait—let’s check **E♭ minor**:

- E♭ natural minor: E♭–F–G♭–A♭–B♭–C♭–D♭
- E♭ harmonic minor: E♭–F–G♭–A♭–B♭–C♭–**D♮**

But **Gdim = G–B♭–D♭**, which is not diatonic to E♭ minor (which has G♭, not G♮).

So perhaps the key is **E♭ major**?

E♭ major scale: E♭–F–G–A♭–B♭–C–D

Now, **Gdim = G–B♭–D♭** → includes **D♭**, which is **not in E♭ major** (E♭ major has D♮).

So Gdim is **not diatonic to E♭ major or minor**.

But **Gdim** is diatonic to **A♭ major**:

A♭ major: A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F–G

→ **Gdim = G–B♭–D♭** → yes! All notes are in A♭ major.

So **G° = vii° in A♭ major**.

Now check other chords:

- **Eb/G**: E♭ major = V in A♭ major → first inversion, fine.
- **Bbm/F**: B♭ minor = ii chord in A♭ major (ii = B♭m), and F in bass = second inversion → makes sense.
- **Ab/G**: A♭ major with G in bass – this is a **VII7 chord**, or more precisely, a **major chord over leading tone** – this is a **common cadential embellishment** in A♭ major: G is the leading tone, so Ab/G creates a strong pull to A♭.
- **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭maj7 = IVmaj7 in A♭ major (since IV = D♭), and F is the 3rd of D♭, so F in bass = first inversion → valid.

So **ALL chords are diatonic or functional within A♭ major**, except for one observation:

- **Gdim** appears constantly – which is the **vii° chord** in A♭ major – often used to lead to I (A♭) or to substitute for V.

But wait: The progression **never actually resolves to A♭**. It circles around Gdim and neighbors, but ends on **Gdim**.

However, that doesn’t mean the key isn’t A♭ – it may be avoiding the tonic for color or tension.

Also note that **Gdim** can be viewed as an **incomplete dominant**: in A♭, the V chord is E♭, and Gdim shares two notes with E♭7 (E♭7 = E♭–G–B♭–D♭ → remove root = G–B♭–D♭ = Gdim). So Gdim is often used as a **rootless E♭7**, functioning as dominant.

Thus, this progression is **centered around the dominant area of A♭ major**, using the **vii° chord (Gdim)** as a harmonic pedal or substitute.

### Step 3: Consider Mode

Since all chords fit within **A♭ major** (no accidentals outside the key), and the harmonies are functional (ii, V, IV, vii°, etc.), the **mode is Ionian** (i.e., **major**).

There’s no consistent use of modal mixture or modal interchange that would suggest Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.

---

### Conclusion:

**Key: A♭ major**  
**Mode: Ionian (Major)**

Even though the tonic A♭ is not explicitly stated as a chord (except possibly implied in Ab/G), the harmonic material is entirely derived from A♭ major, and Gdim functions as the leading-tone diminished chord resolving (or pulling toward) A♭.

So the key is **A♭ major**.
