### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I'm digging into some chords in Ab major. The chords like Bbm/F, Ab/G, and Dbmaj7/F all fit well in this key. Then I see Eb/G, which is interesting for its role as V6 in Ab. The repeated Gdim suggests it's the vii° chord in Ab, indicating a dominant area vibe. But if I consider Eb major instead, Eb/G becomes I6. Gdim is tricky since it's not diatonic in Eb. Yet it works perfectly in Ab major.**Examining triads in Ab major**

I'm looking at triads and noting that Gdim contains G, Bb, and Db, which fits in Ab major. Then I see Eb/G and Bbm/F, both diatonic as well. Ab/G is interesting since it has G as a bass note, a leading tone but not a chord tone, yet it's allowed as a passing tone. Dbmaj7/F is diatonic too. Overall, these chords confirm that the key is Ab major, likely in the Ionian mode. Ab Lydian isn't a fit because of the Db note, so it stays Ionian.**Analyzing chords in F minor**

I'm sorting through chords and noting that Gdim contains G, Bb, and Db, which fits as ii° in F minor and also aligns with F Aeolian. Then, looking at Eb/G, it has Eb, G, and Bb, which means G natural fits in F natural minor. The scale is: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, confirming that Eb major acts as the VII chord in F minor, especially since it’s a first inversion (VII6) over a G bass. That all makes sense!**Examining chord inversions in F minor**

I’m looking at Bbm/F, which is a Bb minor chord over an F bass. In F minor, that would normally make it a second inversion, but since it’s written as Bbm/F, it fits as iv6. Then there's Ab/G, which acts as a VI chord over a G bass, also functioning as a neighbor tone. Dbmaj7/F, as bVImaj7 in F minor, is another second inversion. Since all these chords fit diatonically, the progression could work in F minor. However, without a typical V chord, it presents some unique challenges, especially with the ii° to VII6 movement.**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing the chord progression, noting that Gdim and Eb/G seem to toggle stepwise in the bass. In Ab major, Gdim serves as the leading tone, while Eb/G acts as V6. Even though it usually resolves to I (Ab), this progression appears to avoid resolution, creating a vamp feel. Given the presence of chords like Ab/G and Bbm/F, it strongly suggests Ab major is the underlying key in Ionian mode. While F minor is a possibility, the functions align more clearly with Ab major. So, I'll state the key as Ab major (Ionian) and justify that all chords are diatonic.

Ab major, Ionian mode.

Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major (Gdim = vii°, Eb/G = V6, Bbm/F = ii6, Ab/G = I with leading-tone bass, Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/6). While they also fit F natural minor (relative minor), the ii–V–I implications point more strongly to Ab major.
