**Assistant - Qwen 235B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, let's see. The user gave a sequence of chords: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim. They want to figure out the key and mode. Hmm, first I need to recall what diminished chords typically do in harmony. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or leading to other chords, especially in minor keys where the leading tone is a diminished triad. But here we have Gdim repeating multiple times, so maybe it's a common tone diminished chord?

Let me list out the chords with their notes. Gdim is G, Bb, Db. Wait, a diminished triad has root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Gdim would be G, Bb, Db. Yes. Then Eb/G is Eb major with G in the bass, so notes G, Eb, Bb (since Eb major is Eb, G, Bb). Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb major with F in the bass: F, Bb, Db. Ab/G is Ab major with G as bass note: G, Ab, C (wait, Ab major is Ab, C, Eb, so with G bass it's G, Ab, C, Eb? Or maybe just G in the bass and the chord is Ab major, so the notes would be G (bass), Ab, C, Eb. Dbmaj7/F is Db major seventh with F in the bass. Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C, so with F as bass, the notes are F, Ab, C, Db.

So let's write down all the notes in each chord:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db
Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (since Eb major triad is Eb, G, Bb)
Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db (Bb major is Bb, D, F, but wait, Bb/F would be F, Bb, D? Wait, no. Wait, Bbm is Bb minor? Wait, the user wrote Bbm/F. Wait, hold on. Wait, the original sequence is "Bbm/F". But in the initial problem statement, was it Bbm/F or Bb/F? Let me check.

Original: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim"

Ah, it's Bbm/F. So B flat minor with F in the bass. Bb minor triad is Bb, Db, F. So Bbm/F would be F, Bb, Db. That makes sense. So Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db.

Similarly, Eb/G: Eb major is Eb, G, Bb, so with G in bass: G, Eb, Bb.

Ab/G: Ab major is Ab, C, Eb, so with G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: Db major seventh is Db, F, Ab, C, so with F bass: F, Ab, C, Db.

Now, let's look at all the bass notes first because sometimes the bass line can indicate a key.

The bass notes as per each chord:

Gdim: G (assuming root position, since it's written as Gdim without slash)
Gdim: G
Eb/G: G
Eb/G: G
Gdim: G
Gdim: G
Bbm/F: F
Ab/G: G
Gdim: G
Gdim: G
Eb/G: G
Eb/G: G
Gdim: G
Gdim: G
Dbmaj7/F: F
Gdim: G

Wait, so the bass line alternates mostly between G and F. Let's list the bass notes in order:

G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, F, G

Hmm. The bass is on G for most of the time, with a few Fs. So maybe G is the tonic? But diminished chords on tonic are unusual. Wait, but Gdim is not a common tonic chord. In harmonic minor, the vii° is diminished. For example, in C minor, the vii° chord is Bb diminished (Bb, Db, Fb? Wait no: in C minor, the scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, no: harmonic minor raises the 7th, so C minor harmonic: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B natural. So the vii° chord would be B diminished (B, D, F). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps looking at the chords in relation to a key. Let's see the Gdim chord. If we consider Gdim as vii° in Ab major. In Ab major, the vii° chord is G#dim, but enharmonically that's Ab dim? Wait, Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So leading tone is G, which is major seventh, so vii° would be G diminished (G, Bb, Db). Wait, yes! In Ab major, the seventh scale degree is G, so the triad built on G is G-Bb-Db, which is G diminished. So Gdim would be the vii° chord in Ab major.

Similarly, in Ab minor, but let's check. Wait, but let's see other chords. Eb/G is Eb major with G in bass. In Ab major, Eb is the V chord. Eb major is V in Ab major. So Eb/G would be the first inversion of V. Similarly, Bbm is the iv chord in Ab major? Wait, Bb minor? Wait, in Ab major, the iv chord would be Db minor. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's list the chords and see if they fit into a key.

First, assuming the key is Ab major:

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb = V
- Bbm = ? In Ab major, the chords are: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° G°. Wait, so Bbm would be the ii chord. But in the sequence we have Bbm/F. So if key is Ab, then Bbm is ii. But why is it F in the bass? Maybe it's a second inversion? Bbm in second inversion would be F as bass (since Bbm is Bb-Db-F), so F is the fifth, so second inversion. But the user wrote Bbm/F, which is correct for second inversion.

Similarly, Ab/G would be the I chord in first inversion? Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so with G as bass... Wait, G is not in the Ab major chord. Wait, Ab/G would imply G in the bass and Ab major chord. So G is a seventh below Ab? Hmm, so Ab/G would be Ab major over G bass, which creates a G-Ab-C-Eb... which is a bit dissonant. Wait, but in Ab major, Ab/G would be a type of suspension or maybe a borrowed chord?

Wait, another angle: diminished chords with same bass note. Gdim repeated. If G is the bass note, maybe G is a pedal tone. But the chords are changing over it. Wait, but the bass notes alternate between G and F. Hmm.

Wait, looking at Dbmaj7/F. Db major seventh is Db-F-Ab-C. So with F in bass, it's F-Ab-C-Db. So notes F, Ab, C, Db. If we consider Ab major, Db is the IV chord. So Dbmaj7 would be IVmaj7 in Ab major. So Dbmaj7/F would be third inversion of IVmaj7.

So let's tabulate all the chords in the context of Ab major:

- Gdim (vii°)
- Eb/G (V first inversion)
- Bbm/F (ii second inversion)
- Ab/G (I chord with G in bass, which is a non-chord tone? Or maybe Ab/G is a passing chord)
- Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7 third inversion)

Wait, Ab/G: Ab major chord is Ab-C-Eb. Adding G in the bass would make it a G-Ab-C-Eb. G is the major seventh of Ab? Wait, Ab to G is a major seventh. So Abmaj7 is Ab-C-Eb-G. So Ab/G is the third inversion of Abmaj7. But the chord symbol would usually be Abmaj7/G. But here it's written as Ab/G, which might imply just Ab major triad with G bass, which would create a minor ninth interval between G and Ab, which is dissonant. So maybe it's actually an Abmaj7 chord.

Assuming that, then Ab/G is Abmaj7 in third inversion. Similarly, Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 in third inversion.

Let's check the other chords:

Eb/G is Eb major triad with G in bass: G is the third of Eb, so first inversion. Correct.

Bbm/F is Bbm triad with F in bass: Bbm is Bb-Db-F, so F is the fifth, so second inversion. Correct.

So putting this together in Ab major:

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6/4
- Ab/G = Imaj7 (if we consider it Abmaj7/G)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7

But in the sequence, we have Ab/G, not Abmaj7/G. However, given that later there's Dbmaj7/F, which explicitly has "maj7", maybe Ab/G is just Ab major triad over G bass. But that would create a G-Ab clash. However, in some contexts, especially in jazz or extended harmony, it might be a different chord. Alternatively, perhaps the piece is in a minor key.

Wait, let's consider Ab minor. Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But harmonic minor would raise the Gb to G natural. So Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. Wait, Cb is B, Fb is E. So scale: Ab, Bb, B (Cb?), wait no:

Wait, standard harmonic minor raises the 7th scale degree. Natural minor for Ab is: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb (F#). Wait, maybe better to think enharmonically. Ab minor key signature is: 7 flats? No, actually, Ab minor has 5 flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb), but since it's the relative minor of Cb major, which is not practical. Usually, people use the key signature of its relative major. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, considering Gdim as a common-tone diminished chord. Common-tone diminished chords are used to embellish a major or minor chord by having the same root. For example, Cdim over C bass to lead to C major. But here the bass is moving.

Wait, looking at the bass notes again: mostly G, with some Fs. So G is the dominant note in the bass. Maybe the key is C minor? Because in C minor, G is the dominant (v), but Gdim would be... Let's see. In C minor harmonic, the chords include G as major (V), but Gdim would be if it's natural minor? Wait, no.

Wait, another approach: the progression seems to have a lot of Gdim chords alternating with other chords. If Gdim is the common tone, perhaps the tonal center is G? But Gdim as a tonic is unusual. Wait, but in jazz, sometimes diminished chords are used as passing chords between tonics.

Wait, looking at the chords: Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F. Let's see the roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. Wait, those roots are a half-step apart? Eb to Bb is a fifth, not sure.

Wait, Eb/G has root Eb, but bass G. Maybe the chord roots are not matching the bass. So focus on the chord roots:

Gdim (root G), Eb/G (root Eb), Bbm/F (root Bb), Ab/G (root Ab), Dbmaj7/F (root Db). So roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db.

Hmm, G to Eb is minor third down, Eb to Bb is perfect fifth, Bb to Ab is major second down, Ab to Db is perfect fourth up. Not obvious.

Wait, maybe it's a circle of fifths progression? Let's see: Db - Ab - Eb - Bb - F - C - G... But the roots we have are Db, Ab, Eb, Bb, G. So Db, Ab (P5 down), Ab to Eb (P5 down), Eb to Bb (P5 down), Bb to G... Not quite. G is a minor third up from Eb? Maybe not.

Wait, another idea: all these chords might be related to the diminished scale. Gdim is part of the G half-diminished or diminished scale. But not sure.

Wait, looking at the notes used:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb

Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb

Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Db

So compiling all notes: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Wait, these notes are all the notes of the Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes! Ab major scale has G as the seventh degree. So all the notes fit into Ab major. Therefore, the key is Ab major.

But let's confirm:

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords:

Gdim = G, Bb, Db (vii° in Ab)

Eb/G = G, Eb, Bb (Eb is V in Ab, first inversion)

Bbm/F = F, Bb, Db (Bbm is ii in Ab? Wait, no. In Ab major, the ii chord is Bb minor: Bb, Db, F. Yes! So Bbm is ii, and Bbm/F is second inversion.

Ab/G: If we consider Ab major chord with G in bass, but G is not part of Ab major triad. However, Ab major 7th chord is Ab, C, Eb, G. So Abmaj7/G is the third inversion. Given that later we have Dbmaj7/F, it's likely that Ab/G is implying Abmaj7. So this chord is Imaj7 in third inversion.

Dbmaj7/F: Db is the IV chord in Ab major. Dbmaj7 is IVmaj7, and F is the third of Db, so third inversion (since Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C; third inversion would be C in bass, wait no: inversions for 7th chords are 1st (3rd in bass), 2nd (5th), 3rd (7th). So Dbmaj7 in third inversion has C in bass. Wait, but here it's Dbmaj7/F. F is the third of Db, so first inversion. Wait, confusion here.

Wait, chord inversions for triads: first inversion is third in bass, second inversion is fifth. For seventh chords: root position (root bass), first inversion (third), second (fifth), third (seventh).

So Dbmaj7 consists of Db (root), F (third), Ab (fifth), C (seventh).

Dbmaj7/F would be first inversion (third in bass), yes. Similarly, Abmaj7/G would be third in bass (G is seventh of Abmaj7), so third inversion.

Yes, so:

- Abmaj7/G: third inversion (G is the seventh)
- Dbmaj7/F: first inversion (F is the third)

So given that, the progression uses diatonic chords from Ab major:

- Gdim (vii°)
- Eb (V)
- Bbm (ii)
- Abmaj7 (I)
- Dbmaj7 (IV)

But why the frequent Gdim? Let's see the progression:

Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Bbm/F | Ab/G | Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Dbmaj7/F | Gdim

So it's like a repeating pattern: [Gdim x2, Eb/G x2] then [Gdim x2, Bbm/F, Ab/G], then [Gdim x2, Eb/G x2], then [Gdim x2, Dbmaj7/F], Gdim.

This seems like Gdim is being used as a passing chord between the other chords. In Ab major, Gdim (vii°) often leads to Ab (I). But here, it's alternating with Eb/G (V), so maybe it's a back-and-forth between V and vii°, which is common because vii° acts as a leading chord to I, but here it's going to V? Wait, no.

Wait, in Ab major:

- vii° (Gdim) leads to I (Ab)
- V (Eb) leads to I (Ab)

But in the progression, we have Gdim leading to Eb/G. Hmm. Maybe it's a different function. Alternatively, considering secondary leading tones.

Wait, Eb is the V of Ab. Gdim is vii° of Ab. But when we have Gdim followed by Eb, perhaps Gdim is acting as a common tone diminished chord related to Eb.

Wait, let's take Gdim to Eb/G. Gdim has notes G, Bb, Db. Eb major has Eb, G, Bb. So the common tones are G and Bb. The Db in Gdim moves down to C (but in Eb/G, there's no C; wait, Eb/G is G, Eb, Bb). So Db to Eb? Maybe chromatic movement.

Wait, another thought: the repeated use of Gdim with other chords might indicate that G is not the root but the common tone. If the bass is staying on G for many chords, but then in some places it goes to F.

Wait, Ab/G chord: if the bass stays on G, then Ab/G would be a chord over G pedal. But then Bbm/F has bass F.

Alternatively, looking at the chord progression in terms of minor key. Let's consider Ab minor.

Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb (enharmonically: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb). But harmonic minor would have G natural instead of Gb. So Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. Which is equivalent to: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G.

But the chords present notes like Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, F (from Bbm/F), G. Wait, there's an F natural in Bbm/F chord (since Bbm is Bb-Db-F). In Ab harmonic minor, F would be F natural? Wait, no:

Wait, in Ab natural minor, the sixth degree is Fb (which is E), but in harmonic minor, the seventh is raised to G natural, but sixth remains Fb/E. Wait, this is confusing. Let's spell Ab harmonic minor properly:

Root: Ab

2: Bb

3: Cb (B)

4: Db

5: Eb

6: Fb (E)

7: G (natural, since raised from Gb)

So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G.

But in the given chords, we have F natural (from Bbm/F chord: F, Bb, Db). So F natural isn't in Ab harmonic minor. Hmm. So maybe not Ab minor.

Wait, another candidate: Gb minor? Relative to Bbb major, messy. How about C minor?

C minor natural: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B natural

Chords:

Gdim: in C minor, would Gdim be the iv chord? No. Wait, in C minor, the diatonic chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v°: Gdim (if natural minor), but in harmonic minor, v is G major

VI: Ab

VII: Bb

So in natural minor, Gdim would be the v chord? Wait no:

Wait, scale degrees for natural minor:

i: C D Eb F G Ab Bb (C natural minor)

Triads:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

vii°: Bdim

Wait, so in C natural minor, the vii° is Bdim. Not Gdim.

In harmonic minor, with B natural:

Scale: C D Eb F G Ab B

Triads:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III+: Ebaug

iv: Fm

V: G

VI: Ab

vii°: Bdim

Wait, so G is major in harmonic minor.

Hmm. Not seeing Gdim as a diatonic chord in C minor.

Wait, maybe F minor? Let's check.

F natural minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

Harmonic minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, E

Chords:

Diatonic vii° in F minor would be Eb dim (Eb, Gb, Bbb), which is enharmonically D#dim, but not Gdim.

Not helpful.

Wait, going back to Ab major. All the notes fit into Ab major. Let's confirm each chord's function:

- Gdim: vii° leading to I, but here it's used in between V and other chords.

Eb/G is V6 (first inversion of V). In Ab major, V is Eb, so Eb/G makes sense.

Bbm/F is ii6/4 (second inversion of ii).

Ab/G is Imaj7 in third inversion (if we assume the maj7).

Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7 in first inversion.

So the progression has the following functional harmony:

vii° - V6 - vii° - ii6/4 - I6/4 (if Ab/G is considered as I with added G) - etc.

Wait, but the repeated vii° might be for a chromatic bass line. The bass alternates G and F. G to F is a whole step down. In Ab major, the bass movement from G (vii) to F (VI? No, F is the sixth scale degree in Ab major). Wait, in Ab major, the scale degrees:

I: Ab

ii: Bb

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: G°

So F is the sixth degree, forming vi minor.

But the bass goes G (vii°), then F (vi), but in the chord Bbm/F, the chord is ii, not vi.

Hmm, maybe the bass line is descending: G, F, E, etc., but here it's mostly G with occasional F.

Wait, another idea: the progression could be in Gb major? Let's see.

Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

But we have Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, F, and G natural. G natural is not in Gb major; it would be F#. So no.

Wait, but the chords include G natural (as bass note), Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, F. So the notes are Ab, Bb, C (from Ab/G chord: Ab/G has Ab, C, Eb?), wait wait:

Wait, hold on. Ab/G chord: if it's Ab major triad with G bass, then the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. So C natural is present. In Ab major scale, C is the third degree (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G). Yes, so C is in Ab major.

Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C. All in Ab major.

Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb. G is in Ab major (7th degree).

Bbm/F: Bb, Db, F. Bb is ii, Db is iv, F is vi.

So yes, all notes are diatonic to Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

As for the mode, since all chords fit into major scale, it's Ionian mode. But maybe there's a modal feel, but given the presence of major IV (Dbmaj7) and V (Eb), it's likely straightforward major.

Wait, but the frequent use of vii° might give a different feel, but still in major key.

Alternatively, considering the chord progression revolves around Ab, but with a lot of Gdim, which is the leading tone chord, so it's definitely Ab major.

Wait, but let's check for other possibilities. Could it be F minor? Let's see.

F minor natural: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

Harmonic minor has E natural.

Chords in the progression have Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G (natural). In F minor natural, G is the second degree (minor key: whole step between i and ii). G natural is present. Let's see:

- Gdim in F minor? Scale degrees: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. So chord on G would be G-Ab-C, which is Gm7b5? Wait, triad: G, Bb, Db – yes! In F natural minor, the ii chord is G diminished (G, Bb, Db). So Gdim would be ii° in F minor.

Then Eb/G: Eb major with G bass. In F minor, Eb is the VII chord. Eb major is borrowed from harmonic minor (since in natural minor, VII is Eb major already). Wait, in natural minor, VII is major.

Ab/G: Ab major chord. In F minor, Ab is the III chord (relative major key is Ab major). So Ab would be III in F minor.

Dbmaj7/F: Db is iv in F minor (natural minor: Db major? No, iv in natural minor is minor. Wait, confusion.

Wait, F minor scale:

Natural: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

Harmonic: raises Eb to E natural.

So chords:

i: Fm

ii°: Gdim

III: Ab

iv: Bbm

V: C dim or major depending on harmonic/natural

VI: Db

VII: Eb

So in natural minor:

- Gdim is ii°

- Eb is VII (major)

- Ab is III

- Bbm is iv

- Db would be VI, but Db major is not diatonic; in natural minor, VI is Db major? Wait:

Wait, in natural minor, the triads:

i: Fm (F, Ab, C)

ii°: G° (G, Bb, Db)

III: Ab (Ab, C, Eb)

iv: Bbm (Bb, Db, F)

v°: C° (C, Eb, Gb) [but Gb not present here]

VI: Db (Db, F, Ab)

vii°: Eb° (Eb, Gb, Bbb)

Wait, hold on:

For F natural minor:

Note: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

Triad on F: F, Ab, C → Fm

G: G, Bb, Db → Gdim

Ab: Ab, C, Eb → Ab

Bb: Bb, Db, F → Bbm

C: C, Eb, Gb → Cdim (but Gb not in our chords; we have G natural)

Db: Db, F, Ab → Db

Eb: Eb, Gb, Bbb → effectively E dim, but not matching.

But in our chord progression, we have C natural (from Ab/G chord: Ab, C, Eb). In F minor natural, C is the fifth degree, and the III chord (Ab) has C as its third. So Ab major is diatonic. Similarly, Db major is VI in F minor natural.

Wait, so let's map the chords to F minor:

- Gdim = ii°

- Eb/G = VII with first inversion? Eb/G: G is not part of Eb triad in F minor. Eb as VII chord is Eb major (Eb, G, Bb). Yes! So Eb/G is the first inversion of VII chord.

- Bbm/F = iv chord (Bbm) in second inversion (F bass).

- Ab/G = III chord (Ab) with G bass (which is a non-chord tone for triad, but if considering Ab major 7th, G is the seventh).

- Dbmaj7/F = VI chord (Db) with major 7th, in first inversion (F bass).

So in F minor, the chords make sense as:

- Gdim (ii°)

- Eb/G (VII6)

- Bbm/F (iv6/4)

- Ab/G (III with added 7th)

- Dbmaj7/F (VI7)

Moreover, F minor's relative major is Ab, so they share the same key signature. So depending on the tonal center, it could be either Ab major or F minor.

The progression ends on Gdim, which is not tonic for either. But the chord that appears to function as a tonic might be Ab or Fm.

But in the sequence, we have Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F. In minor keys, the VI chord (Db) is often used, and III (Ab) is the relative major.

However, the progression has a lot of Gdim (ii° in F minor), which again, is similar to vii° in Ab major.

To determine whether it's major or minor, look for the presence of leading tone. In Ab major, the leading tone is G (7th degree), which is in the Gdim chord. In F minor, the leading tone would be E natural (in harmonic minor), but the chords don't have E natural; we have Eb instead. All chords use Eb, not E natural. So likely natural minor, but in natural minor, the v chord is minor, but here we have Eb major as VII.

Wait, this is a bit tricky. In rock/pop music, sometimes minor keys use the major VII chord from natural minor. So F natural minor has Eb as VII major. So if the tonal center is F minor (natural), then:

- Tonic: Fm

- But the chords go to Ab (III), Db (VI), Eb (VII), which are all characteristic of natural minor progressions (e.g., i - VII - VI - V, etc.)

However, in this progression, there is no F minor chord presented. The bass moves to F in Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F chords, but the chord on F is not F minor. Wait, Bbm/F is Bbm chord with F bass, Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 with F bass. So F is in the bass but the chord isn't Fm.

Similarly, in Ab major, we don't have the V chord leading to I frequently; instead, we have Eb which is V, but it's alternating with vii°.

Hmm. How to decide between Ab major and F minor.

One test is whether the progression feels like it resolves to Ab or to Fm.

The last chord before the final Gdim is Dbmaj7/F. Db is VI in F minor and IV in Ab major. The progression ends on Gdim, which would want to resolve to Ab in major or to Am in... No.

In Ab major, Gdim (vii°) strongly pulls to Ab. In F minor, Gdim is ii°, which would pull to Bb (iv), but not as strong.

Given the repeated movement between Gdim and Eb/G (which is V in Ab, VII in Fm), it's more likely Ab major because V-I is a strong cadence in major, whereas in minor, the cadence is often V-i (with harmonic minor's raised 7th). But here, the V chord (Eb) is used, which in minor would be Eb major as VII in natural minor, not the V.

Wait, crucial point: In minor keys, the dominant chord (V) is typically major due to the raised 7th in harmonic minor. So in F minor, the V chord would be C major (to pull to Fm). But in this progression, there is no C chord; instead, we have Eb which is the VII in natural minor. So this suggests it's in Ab major, where Eb is the V chord.

The presence of Eb (V) strongly pointing to Ab (I) suggests Ab major, whereas in F minor, Eb would be a less strong chord (subtonic). Given the frequency of Eb/G paired with Gdim (which is vii° leading to I), it makes more sense in Ab major.

Additionally, the Dbmaj7 is IV in Ab major, a common chord, whereas VI in minor is less dominant.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

As for mode, since it's using major scale with all diatonic chords and strong V-I motion (implied by Eb leading to Ab, although Ab isn't stated directly in the progression except possibly as Ab/G), it's Ionian mode (i.e., major key, not modal).

Wait, but the progression doesn't clearly state the tonic chord (Ab or Fm). However, the Ab/G chord suggests that Ab is a point of arrival. Let's see the structure:

Looking at the chord sequence, there's a section: ...Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G...

So after two Gdim, it goes to Bbm/F then Ab/G. In Ab major, Gdim (vii°) leads to Ab (I), so the Ab/G would be that resolution. Even though it's Ab in first inversion (or third inversion of maj7), it's still pointing to Ab as tonic.

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7 leading possibly to a resolution, but followed by Gdim which leads back to Ab.

Therefore, I think the key is Ab major.

Double-checking for any accidentals outside Ab major: all chords use only notes from Ab major. Yes.

Final answer: Key is Ab major, Ionian mode.

The given chord progression consists primarily of diatonic chords within **Ab major** (Ionian mode). Here's a concise breakdown:

### **Key Determination**
- All chord tones (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G) align perfectly with the **Ab major scale** (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G).
- **Functional Harmonic Roles**:
  - **Gdim**: vii° (leading-tone diminished chord), which naturally resolves to **Ab** (I).
  - **Eb/G**: V first inversion (dominant chord), strongly pulling toward **Ab**.
  - **Bbm/F**: ii second inversion (supertonic minor chord).
  - **Ab/G**: I chord in third inversion (Imaj7), emphasizing **Ab** as tonic.
  - **Dbmaj7/F**: IVmaj7 first inversion (subdominant major seventh chord).

### **Why Ab Major?**
- The progression hinges on the **vii°-V-I relationship** (Gdim → Eb → Ab), a hallmark of major-key harmonic motion.
- While the final chord is Gdim (vii°), the repeated movement from **Gdim → Eb/G → Ab/G** resolves toward **Ab**, confirming **Ab** as the tonal center.
- **No modal ambiguity**: All chords derive from the major scale, and there are no accidental alterations pointing to a mode (e.g., Dorian, Mixolydian).

### **Why Not F Minor?**
- While F minor shares the same key signature, the progression lacks a functional **V-i cadence** (e.g., C major → F minor), which is typical in minor keys.
- **Eb** functions as **V in Ab major** (strong dominant), whereas in F minor, Eb would act as a *weaker* subtonic (VII in natural minor), not driving toward F.

### ✅ Final Answer  
- **Key**: **Ab major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (standard major scale, no modal mixture)  

This progression is firmly rooted in **Ab Ionian**, with Gdim acting as the leading-tone chord driving harmonic motion toward the tonic (Ab).
