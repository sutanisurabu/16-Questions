### Reasoning

**Analyzing Lydian on Db**

I’m checking if Lydian on Db uses notes from Ab major, and yes, they align! Ab major has Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, which matches Db Lydian. So, I could say it's deriving from Ab major with a Lydian tonicization of Db. The tonal center appears to be Db, especially with the Dbmaj7 near the end and the pedal tones. There’s a notable bass movement around G, suggesting a Lydian function on Db with #4 pedal. Overall, it all points to Db Lydian.**Determining key and mode**

I need to determine the key and mode, which leads me to conclude it's Db Lydian, centering on Db but drawing from Ab major. I notice G appears in the bass frequently, which makes me wonder if G might be the tonal center. The chords like Gdim and Eb/G support this idea, possibly hinting at a G pedal. However, examining the repeated notes shows that the pitch set confirms it's Db Lydian, not G Phrygian, since my set has Db instead of D natural.**Exploring Phrygian and Locrian modes**

I'm working through the characteristics of the Phrygian mode, which includes notes like b2 (Ab), b3 (Bb), b6 (Eb), and b7 (F), plus a natural 4 (C). However, it also contains a D natural that I don't see in my set. Given that my set includes Db but not D, it can't be G Phrygian. 

Then I check G Locrian, which has G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, and F. My set matches these notes perfectly, including G, so yes, it is indeed G Locrian!**Comparing modes**

Let’s compare Db Lydian and G Locrian. I notice both share the same notes: Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, and C. This means they are related through mode mixture, as both are derived from Ab major. 

In Ab major, the scale degrees are: 1 Ab, 2 Bb, 3 C, 4 Db, 5 Eb, 6 F, and 7 G. When starting on Db, I get the Lydian pattern of notes, while starting on G gives the Locrian pattern. So yes, I’ve confirmed that they are indeed Lydian and Locrian.**Determining key center and mode**

Both Db Lydian and G Locrian share the same pitch collection, but the key center is the question here. The progression ends on Gdim rather than a Db chord, suggesting G might be a prominent pedal. However, the presence of Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F indicates a movement reflecting ii to I with a major seventh.

Ultimately, I conclude it’s in Db Lydian, as reflected by the recurring G natural (#4) and C natural in Dbmaj7. While one could interpret it as G Locrian, the harmonic structure leans towards Db as the focal tonic. So, my final answer is Db Lydian.

Db Lydian.

Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major (Ab Bb C Db Eb F G), but the tonal center is Db and the recurring G natural (#4 of Db) plus the Dbmaj7 (with C natural) give a clear Lydian color. If you prefer a pedal-based view, the same pitch set can be heard as G Locrian, but the presence of Dbmaj7 points to Db as the center.
