Let's analyze the chord progression step by step:  

**Progression:**
```
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim
```

### Step 1: Identify possible tonal centers

You have a few key tonal hints here:

- **Eb major/G (i.e. Eb major in first inversion)** appears repeatedly — this strongly suggests **Eb major or Eb minor** as home key possibilities.

- **Dbmaj7/F** is the IVmaj7 chord (if in Ab major), or the **♭VIImaj7** chord if in Eb major (since Db is a whole step below Eb).

- **Bbm/F** is the ii chord in Ab major, or the **v chord** in Eb minor.

- **Ab/G** is an unusual chord — a rootless *Ab7/G* type (flat 7 chord with lowered bass). That could function as a **V7sus4 (Ab7)** resolving to Eb, or a passing chord toward Eb.

---

### Step 2: Interpret common-tone and resolution patterns

Notice the **Gdim** (G–Bb–Db) repeating everywhere:

- Gdim could function as a **leading-tone diminished chord** in **Ab major/minor** (leading to Ab).  
- But we don’t clearly *resolve* to Ab except through Ab/G (which is unusual).  
- Gdim also shares two notes (G and Bb) with **Eb/G**, so it may serve as a **chromatic neighbor chord** or a tension builder around Eb.

---

### Step 3: Test possible keys

Let’s test both **Eb major** and **Ab major** as candidates.

**If in Eb major:**
- Eb/G = I⁶  
- Bbm/F = v (from Eb minor, borrowed)  
- Ab/G = IV⁷ over G (with an unusual bass)  
- Dbmaj7/F = ♭VIImaj7⁶  
- Gdim = vii° of Ab (harmonic function serving as tension around IV or ♭VII)

**If in Ab major:**
- Eb/G = V⁶  
- Bbm/F = ii⁶  
- Dbmaj7/F = VImaj7⁶  
- Gdim would be vii°/ii (leading-tone dim to Bbm), which works sometimes  
- Ab/G = Imaj7sus/G or I chord with a chromatic bass

Eb major seems slightly more stable harmonically — its I chord (Eb major) recurs, and most of the other chords can be viewed as colorful borrowings or modal mixture chords.

### Step 4: Consider mode or tonal color

Given the frequent use of **bVII (Dbmaj7)** and **borrowed v (Bbm)**, this suggests a **mixolydian** or **modal interchange** flavor — Eb **mixolydian** is a sensible label (since Eb Mixolydian has Db and Bb minor would fit inside it).

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Likely key center:** Eb  
- **Likely mode:** **Mixolydian** (Eb major with lowered 7th, giving the Db chord and Bbm borrowings)
- **Functional characterization:** A modal Eb tonal center with chromatic and common-tone diminished colorings (Gdim providing tension around Eb).  

**Answer:**  
**Key: Eb**  
**Mode: Eb Mixolydian (with diminished color chords around G)**
