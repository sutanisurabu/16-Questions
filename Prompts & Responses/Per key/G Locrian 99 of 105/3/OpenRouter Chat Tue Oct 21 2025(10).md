### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I'm digging into some chords in Ab major. The chords like Bbm/F, Ab/G, and Dbmaj7/F all fit well in this key. Then I see Eb/G, which is interesting for its role as V6 in Ab. The repeated Gdim suggests it's the vii° chord in Ab, indicating a dominant area vibe. But if I consider Eb major instead, Eb/G becomes I6. Gdim is tricky since it's not diatonic in Eb. Yet it works perfectly in Ab major.**Examining triads in Ab major**

I'm looking at triads and noting that Gdim contains G, Bb, and Db, which fits in Ab major. Then I see Eb/G and Bbm/F, both diatonic as well. Ab/G is interesting since it has G as a bass note, a leading tone but not a chord tone, yet it's allowed as a passing tone. Dbmaj7/F is diatonic too. Overall, these chords confirm that the key is Ab major, likely in the Ionian mode. Ab Lydian isn't a fit because of the Db note, so it stays Ionian.**Analyzing chords in F minor**

I'm sorting through chords and noting that Gdim contains G, Bb, and Db, which fits as ii° in F minor and also aligns with F Aeolian. Then, looking at Eb/G, it has Eb, G, and Bb, which means G natural fits in F natural minor. The scale is: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, confirming that Eb major acts as the VII chord in F minor, especially since it’s a first inversion (VII6) over a G bass. That all makes sense!**Examining chord inversions in F minor**

I’m looking at Bbm/F, which is a Bb minor chord over an F bass. In F minor, that would normally make it a second inversion, but since it’s written as Bbm/F, it fits as iv6. Then there's Ab/G, which acts as a VI chord over a G bass, also functioning as a neighbor tone. Dbmaj7/F, as bVImaj7 in F minor, is another second inversion. Since all these chords fit diatonically, the progression could work in F minor. However, without a typical V chord, it presents some unique challenges, especially with the ii° to VII6 movement.**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing the chord progression, noting that Gdim and Eb/G seem to toggle stepwise in the bass. In Ab major, Gdim serves as the leading tone, while Eb/G acts as V6. Even though it usually resolves to I (Ab), this progression appears to avoid resolution, creating a vamp feel. Given the presence of chords like Ab/G and Bbm/F, it strongly suggests Ab major is the underlying key in Ionian mode. While F minor is a possibility, the functions align more clearly with Ab major. So, I'll state the key as Ab major (Ionian) and justify that all chords are diatonic.

Ab major, Ionian mode.

Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major (Gdim = vii°, Eb/G = V6, Bbm/F = ii6, Ab/G = I with leading-tone bass, Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/6). While they also fit F natural minor (relative minor), the ii–V–I implications point more strongly to Ab major.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequence**

I need to analyze the chord sequence: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F." It seems like the user wants to identify the key center. The G diminished chords show up often. I see Eb/G as an E♭ major triad with G in the bass, and Bbm/F indicates a B♭ minor over F. It seems I should consider keys like B♭ minor or E♭ major. Let's keep exploring!**Examining chord functions**

I notice that Gdim is not diatonic, but Eb/G acts as I6 in E♭ major, while Bbm could be a borrowed iv minor from either E♭ Mixolydian or the parallel minor. In E♭ major, Bbm would be v minor. Ab/G is like a flat VII over the leading tone, and Dbmaj7 might be a flat IIImaj7 relative to B♭ minor. It looks like there are interesting functions and relationships in this progression, especially with Gdim. Let's keep analyzing!**Computing leading tones**

I'm considering whether Gdim is functioning as vii°/Ab. The leading-tone triad to A♭—the IV chord in E♭—would indeed be G°. The diminished triad on the leading tone up to A♭ is G-B♭-D♭, confirming that Gdim is vii°/IV in E♭ major. This repetition of Gdim suggests a strong pull toward A♭. The Ab/G chord has A♭ over G in the bass, which feels like a resolution. I need to explore whether Bbm/F acts as ii in A♭ major. Let's check this!**Confirming key and chords**

I'm looking at the chords in A♭ major: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, and Gdim. In this key, the diatonic vii° is indeed G°. I see Eb/G functioning as V6, the first inversion of the V chord. Bbm/F acts as ii6. The Ab/G chord serves as a I chord with the leading tone in the bass, creating a passing cadential effect. Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7/6 and fits nicely into A♭ major. Overall, the chords Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, and Dbmaj7 are diatonic to A♭ major.**Determining the key**

It looks like A♭ major is a strong possibility for the key. In this key, Eb/G is V, and the G diminished chord sets up a leading-tone connection. The Gdim alternating with Eb/G creates a clear movement to the V6 chord. Investigating further, Gdim could serve as the vii°/V, but with G serving as a pedal tone throughout several chords, it acts prominently. 

Eventually, the chord progression fits both A♭ major and F minor, with common tones present in either context. However, the absence of E natural suggests that we may indeed be grounded in F natural minor.**Finalizing key and mode**

The chords fit neatly into both F natural minor (Aeolian) and A♭ major (Ionian). However, the bass note G suggests a stronger tension toward A♭. Analyzing the chord functions: in A♭ major, Gdim is vii°, Eb is V, and Bbm is ii. The repeated Gdim and Eb/G create leading-tone tension that aligns with A♭ major. 

So, I’d conclude that the key is A♭ major (Ionian). The chords used—like Gdim = vii°, Eb/G = V6, and others—support this choice. If the user wants alternative interpretations, I could mention F minor too, but I’ll keep it concise.

Ab major (Ionian)

Why: All chords fit diatonically in Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = I over 7 (leading-tone pedal)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/3

The repeated G in the bass functions as a leading-tone pedal to Ab. While these chords also belong to F natural minor (relative minor), the functions here point more clearly to Ab major.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing Lydian on Db**

I’m checking if Lydian on Db uses notes from Ab major, and yes, they align! Ab major has Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, which matches Db Lydian. So, I could say it's deriving from Ab major with a Lydian tonicization of Db. The tonal center appears to be Db, especially with the Dbmaj7 near the end and the pedal tones. There’s a notable bass movement around G, suggesting a Lydian function on Db with #4 pedal. Overall, it all points to Db Lydian.**Determining key and mode**

I need to determine the key and mode, which leads me to conclude it's Db Lydian, centering on Db but drawing from Ab major. I notice G appears in the bass frequently, which makes me wonder if G might be the tonal center. The chords like Gdim and Eb/G support this idea, possibly hinting at a G pedal. However, examining the repeated notes shows that the pitch set confirms it's Db Lydian, not G Phrygian, since my set has Db instead of D natural.**Exploring Phrygian and Locrian modes**

I'm working through the characteristics of the Phrygian mode, which includes notes like b2 (Ab), b3 (Bb), b6 (Eb), and b7 (F), plus a natural 4 (C). However, it also contains a D natural that I don't see in my set. Given that my set includes Db but not D, it can't be G Phrygian. 

Then I check G Locrian, which has G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, and F. My set matches these notes perfectly, including G, so yes, it is indeed G Locrian!**Comparing modes**

Let’s compare Db Lydian and G Locrian. I notice both share the same notes: Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, and C. This means they are related through mode mixture, as both are derived from Ab major. 

In Ab major, the scale degrees are: 1 Ab, 2 Bb, 3 C, 4 Db, 5 Eb, 6 F, and 7 G. When starting on Db, I get the Lydian pattern of notes, while starting on G gives the Locrian pattern. So yes, I’ve confirmed that they are indeed Lydian and Locrian.**Determining key center and mode**

Both Db Lydian and G Locrian share the same pitch collection, but the key center is the question here. The progression ends on Gdim rather than a Db chord, suggesting G might be a prominent pedal. However, the presence of Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F indicates a movement reflecting ii to I with a major seventh.

Ultimately, I conclude it’s in Db Lydian, as reflected by the recurring G natural (#4) and C natural in Dbmaj7. While one could interpret it as G Locrian, the harmonic structure leans towards Db as the focal tonic. So, my final answer is Db Lydian.

Db Lydian.

Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major (Ab Bb C Db Eb F G), but the tonal center is Db and the recurring G natural (#4 of Db) plus the Dbmaj7 (with C natural) give a clear Lydian color. If you prefer a pedal-based view, the same pitch set can be heard as G Locrian, but the presence of Dbmaj7 points to Db as the center.

### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Overall Key: A♭ Major
- **Reasoning**: The chord progression uses notes exclusively from the A♭ major scale (A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G). No notes outside this scale appear, even in the diminished chords.
  - Gdim (G–B♭–D♭): All scale degrees (#7, 2, 4).
  - E♭/G (E♭–G–B♭): Scale degrees (5, #7, 2) — functions as V⁶ (first inversion of the dominant).
  - B♭m/F (B♭–D♭–F): Scale degrees (2, 4, 6) — ii chord (supertonic minor) over the 6th scale degree.
  - A♭/G (A♭–C–E♭): Scale degrees (1, 3, 5) — I⁶⁴ (second inversion of the tonic).
  - D♭maj7/F (D♭–F–A♭–C): Scale degrees (4, 6, 1, 3) — IV⁶ (first inversion of the subdominant, with added 7th).
- The bass pedal on G (#7) creates tension that resolves toward A♭ (e.g., via A♭/G), reinforcing A♭ as tonic. The F bass notes (6th scale degree) add a plagal flavor without disrupting the key center.
- This is not E♭ major (which requires D natural, not D♭) or G minor (which lacks A♭ and includes A/D natural). It also doesn't fit F minor exclusively, as the tonal center pulls toward A♭ rather than F (no strong resolution to F minor's i chord).

#### Mode: Ionian (Major)
- **Reasoning**: The progression emphasizes major harmony and resolves triadically around the major tonic (A♭), with no characteristic minor mode alterations (e.g., no raised 7th for harmonic minor or flattened 2nd for Dorian). 
  - Harmonic functions are diatonic to Ionian: I (A♭), ii (B♭m), IV (D♭maj7), V (E♭), and vii°-like (Gdim as a leading-tone diminished chord approaching I).
  - The overall sound is bright and major-leaning due to the pedal G resolving to A♭, despite the tension from diminished and inverted chords. If it were minor (e.g., Aeolian/F natural minor), we'd expect more emphasis on F as tonic or a ♭3/♭6/♭7 feel, but the progression orbits A♭ major.
- Relative minor equivalent: F Aeolian (same scale/notes), but the functional center is major.

#### Additional Notes
- This progression has a dramatic, cinematic quality (reminiscent of film noir or spy themes, like elements of the James Bond motif), built on the G pedal for suspense before resolving to A♭.
- If this is from a specific song/piece, it aligns with A♭ major usage in standards like "On the Street Where You Live" or similar jazz/Broadway intros, but the exact pattern suggests a custom or thematic excerpt. If you provide more context (e.g., melody or source), I can refine this!

### Reasoning

**Examining the Chords**

I'm now zeroing in on the sequence itself, treating it as a raw dataset. My initial step involves identifying each chord and its specific placement within the progression. Further, I am looking for the presence of any unusual voicings or inversions to see if there is any hidden significance.


**Unpacking the Harmony**

I'm now prioritizing the chord functions and relationships. The ubiquity of `Gdim` suggests it's likely a diminished passing chord, or perhaps even a chromatic connector. I'm noting the harmonic movement created by the non-diminished chords, and looking for a functional key area. The bass line's descending motion is particularly interesting as a structuring device.


**Decoding the Structure**

Now, I'm analyzing the chord functions within the proposed key. The `Gdim` is clearly acting as a chromatic passing chord resolving to various points. Its frequent use is very insightful, pointing towards a strong Ab Major tonality. I'm focusing on the structural implications of the `G` bass notes in `Eb/G` and `Ab/G`, alongside the repeated Gdim chords, within the context of the Ab Major scale.


**Synthesizing the Observations**

I'm now consolidating the role of the `Gdim` and its function in the key of Ab Major. By identifying the root relationships within the chord progression, and contrasting them to their respective positions in the Ab Major scale, I've confirmed that the core chords outline a clear harmonic movement. Now, I'm examining the effect of the bass notes, and how they interact with the tonic.


**Unraveling the Progression's Core**

I am now focusing on the diatonic function of each chord, which is further solidifying the Ab Major tonality. The `Eb` and `Dbmaj7` are particularly revealing. The bass line continues to drive the progression, especially with the use of the `G` note, which supports the overall harmonic motion.


**Defining the Scale**

I'm now collating the information to determine the overall scale. I've noted the chords and their component notes, and I am currently focusing on the unique notes to determine a potential key signature. I am mapping the relationship between the base scale and the chords, as they appear.


**Mapping the Notes**

I am now concentrating on mapping the chord notes against the Ab major scale, to fully understand the relationship between each chord's elements. I am carefully assessing each chord and how it's built using scale degrees.




Based on a harmonic analysis of the chord progression, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **Ab Major**
*   **Mode:** **Major**

---

### **Detailed Analysis**

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how we arrive at this conclusion:

**1. Identify the Chords and Their Notes:**

*   **Gdim:** G - Bb - Db
*   **Eb/G:** Eb - G - Bb (with G in the bass)
*   **Bbm/F:** Bb - Db - F (with F in the bass)
*   **Ab/G:** Ab - C - Eb (with G in the bass)
*   **Dbmaj7/F:** Db - F - Ab - C (with F in the bass)

**2. Look for the Tonal Center (The "Home" Chord):**

The collection of chords used—**Eb**, **Ab**, **Db**, and **Bbm**—are all diatonic to the key of Ab Major. Let's look at their function within that key:

*   **Ab** is the **I** chord (the tonic).
*   **Bbm** is the **ii** chord (the supertonic).
*   **Dbmaj7** is the **IV** chord (the subdominant).
*   **Eb** is the **V** chord (the dominant).

**3. Analyze the Function of the `Gdim` Chord:**

The `Gdim` chord is the most important clue in this progression.

*   In the key of Ab Major, the 7th scale degree is **G**.
*   The chord built on the 7th degree is the leading-tone chord, which is a diminished triad.
*   Therefore, **Gdim (G-Bb-Db) is the vii° chord** of Ab Major.

The function of the leading-tone chord (vii°) is to create strong tension that resolves up to the tonic (I). The fact that this `Gdim` chord appears so frequently, constantly surrounding the other chords, reinforces Ab as the tonal center it keeps pointing towards.

**4. Roman Numeral Analysis of the Progression:**

Let's write the progression using Roman numerals in the key of Ab Major:

*   **Gdim:** **vii°** (leading-tone, creates tension)
*   **Eb/G:** **V⁶** (dominant in first inversion, creates tension)
*   **Gdim:** **vii°**
*   **Bbm/F:** **ii⁶⁄₄** (pre-dominant, leads to the dominant)
*   **Ab/G:** **I/7** (a tonic chord with the leading-tone in the bass, creating a unique suspended feeling)
*   **Gdim:** **vii°**
*   **Eb/G:** **V⁶**
*   **Gdim:** **vii°**
*   **Dbmaj7/F:** **IV⁶** (pre-dominant in first inversion)
*   **Gdim:** **vii°**

**Conclusion:**

The progression is built entirely from the notes and chords of the **Ab Major scale**. The constant use of the **vii° (Gdim)** and **V (Eb/G)** chords creates a powerful pull towards the **I chord (Ab)**, firmly establishing **Ab Major** as the key. The progression ends on the `Gdim`, leaving the listener with a feeling of unresolved tension, expecting to finally land on an Ab Major chord.

### Reasoning

Okay, let's see. The user gave a sequence of chords: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim. They want to figure out the key and mode. Hmm, first I need to recall what diminished chords typically do in harmony. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or leading to other chords, especially in minor keys where the leading tone is a diminished triad. But here we have Gdim repeating multiple times, so maybe it's a common tone diminished chord?

Let me list out the chords with their notes. Gdim is G, Bb, Db. Wait, a diminished triad has root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Gdim would be G, Bb, Db. Yes. Then Eb/G is Eb major with G in the bass, so notes G, Eb, Bb (since Eb major is Eb, G, Bb). Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb major with F in the bass: F, Bb, Db. Ab/G is Ab major with G as bass note: G, Ab, C (wait, Ab major is Ab, C, Eb, so with G bass it's G, Ab, C, Eb? Or maybe just G in the bass and the chord is Ab major, so the notes would be G (bass), Ab, C, Eb. Dbmaj7/F is Db major seventh with F in the bass. Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C, so with F as bass, the notes are F, Ab, C, Db.

So let's write down all the notes in each chord:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db
Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (since Eb major triad is Eb, G, Bb)
Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db (Bb major is Bb, D, F, but wait, Bb/F would be F, Bb, D? Wait, no. Wait, Bbm is Bb minor? Wait, the user wrote Bbm/F. Wait, hold on. Wait, the original sequence is "Bbm/F". But in the initial problem statement, was it Bbm/F or Bb/F? Let me check.

Original: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim"

Ah, it's Bbm/F. So B flat minor with F in the bass. Bb minor triad is Bb, Db, F. So Bbm/F would be F, Bb, Db. That makes sense. So Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db.

Similarly, Eb/G: Eb major is Eb, G, Bb, so with G in bass: G, Eb, Bb.

Ab/G: Ab major is Ab, C, Eb, so with G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: Db major seventh is Db, F, Ab, C, so with F bass: F, Ab, C, Db.

Now, let's look at all the bass notes first because sometimes the bass line can indicate a key.

The bass notes as per each chord:

Gdim: G (assuming root position, since it's written as Gdim without slash)
Gdim: G
Eb/G: G
Eb/G: G
Gdim: G
Gdim: G
Bbm/F: F
Ab/G: G
Gdim: G
Gdim: G
Eb/G: G
Eb/G: G
Gdim: G
Gdim: G
Dbmaj7/F: F
Gdim: G

Wait, so the bass line alternates mostly between G and F. Let's list the bass notes in order:

G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, F, G

Hmm. The bass is on G for most of the time, with a few Fs. So maybe G is the tonic? But diminished chords on tonic are unusual. Wait, but Gdim is not a common tonic chord. In harmonic minor, the vii° is diminished. For example, in C minor, the vii° chord is Bb diminished (Bb, Db, Fb? Wait no: in C minor, the scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, no: harmonic minor raises the 7th, so C minor harmonic: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B natural. So the vii° chord would be B diminished (B, D, F). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps looking at the chords in relation to a key. Let's see the Gdim chord. If we consider Gdim as vii° in Ab major. In Ab major, the vii° chord is G#dim, but enharmonically that's Ab dim? Wait, Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So leading tone is G, which is major seventh, so vii° would be G diminished (G, Bb, Db). Wait, yes! In Ab major, the seventh scale degree is G, so the triad built on G is G-Bb-Db, which is G diminished. So Gdim would be the vii° chord in Ab major.

Similarly, in Ab minor, but let's check. Wait, but let's see other chords. Eb/G is Eb major with G in bass. In Ab major, Eb is the V chord. Eb major is V in Ab major. So Eb/G would be the first inversion of V. Similarly, Bbm is the iv chord in Ab major? Wait, Bb minor? Wait, in Ab major, the iv chord would be Db minor. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's list the chords and see if they fit into a key.

First, assuming the key is Ab major:

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb = V
- Bbm = ? In Ab major, the chords are: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° G°. Wait, so Bbm would be the ii chord. But in the sequence we have Bbm/F. So if key is Ab, then Bbm is ii. But why is it F in the bass? Maybe it's a second inversion? Bbm in second inversion would be F as bass (since Bbm is Bb-Db-F), so F is the fifth, so second inversion. But the user wrote Bbm/F, which is correct for second inversion.

Similarly, Ab/G would be the I chord in first inversion? Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so with G as bass... Wait, G is not in the Ab major chord. Wait, Ab/G would imply G in the bass and Ab major chord. So G is a seventh below Ab? Hmm, so Ab/G would be Ab major over G bass, which creates a G-Ab-C-Eb... which is a bit dissonant. Wait, but in Ab major, Ab/G would be a type of suspension or maybe a borrowed chord?

Wait, another angle: diminished chords with same bass note. Gdim repeated. If G is the bass note, maybe G is a pedal tone. But the chords are changing over it. Wait, but the bass notes alternate between G and F. Hmm.

Wait, looking at Dbmaj7/F. Db major seventh is Db-F-Ab-C. So with F in bass, it's F-Ab-C-Db. So notes F, Ab, C, Db. If we consider Ab major, Db is the IV chord. So Dbmaj7 would be IVmaj7 in Ab major. So Dbmaj7/F would be third inversion of IVmaj7.

So let's tabulate all the chords in the context of Ab major:

- Gdim (vii°)
- Eb/G (V first inversion)
- Bbm/F (ii second inversion)
- Ab/G (I chord with G in bass, which is a non-chord tone? Or maybe Ab/G is a passing chord)
- Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7 third inversion)

Wait, Ab/G: Ab major chord is Ab-C-Eb. Adding G in the bass would make it a G-Ab-C-Eb. G is the major seventh of Ab? Wait, Ab to G is a major seventh. So Abmaj7 is Ab-C-Eb-G. So Ab/G is the third inversion of Abmaj7. But the chord symbol would usually be Abmaj7/G. But here it's written as Ab/G, which might imply just Ab major triad with G bass, which would create a minor ninth interval between G and Ab, which is dissonant. So maybe it's actually an Abmaj7 chord.

Assuming that, then Ab/G is Abmaj7 in third inversion. Similarly, Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 in third inversion.

Let's check the other chords:

Eb/G is Eb major triad with G in bass: G is the third of Eb, so first inversion. Correct.

Bbm/F is Bbm triad with F in bass: Bbm is Bb-Db-F, so F is the fifth, so second inversion. Correct.

So putting this together in Ab major:

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6/4
- Ab/G = Imaj7 (if we consider it Abmaj7/G)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7

But in the sequence, we have Ab/G, not Abmaj7/G. However, given that later there's Dbmaj7/F, which explicitly has "maj7", maybe Ab/G is just Ab major triad over G bass. But that would create a G-Ab clash. However, in some contexts, especially in jazz or extended harmony, it might be a different chord. Alternatively, perhaps the piece is in a minor key.

Wait, let's consider Ab minor. Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But harmonic minor would raise the Gb to G natural. So Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. Wait, Cb is B, Fb is E. So scale: Ab, Bb, B (Cb?), wait no:

Wait, standard harmonic minor raises the 7th scale degree. Natural minor for Ab is: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb (F#). Wait, maybe better to think enharmonically. Ab minor key signature is: 7 flats? No, actually, Ab minor has 5 flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb), but since it's the relative minor of Cb major, which is not practical. Usually, people use the key signature of its relative major. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, considering Gdim as a common-tone diminished chord. Common-tone diminished chords are used to embellish a major or minor chord by having the same root. For example, Cdim over C bass to lead to C major. But here the bass is moving.

Wait, looking at the bass notes again: mostly G, with some Fs. So G is the dominant note in the bass. Maybe the key is C minor? Because in C minor, G is the dominant (v), but Gdim would be... Let's see. In C minor harmonic, the chords include G as major (V), but Gdim would be if it's natural minor? Wait, no.

Wait, another approach: the progression seems to have a lot of Gdim chords alternating with other chords. If Gdim is the common tone, perhaps the tonal center is G? But Gdim as a tonic is unusual. Wait, but in jazz, sometimes diminished chords are used as passing chords between tonics.

Wait, looking at the chords: Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F. Let's see the roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. Wait, those roots are a half-step apart? Eb to Bb is a fifth, not sure.

Wait, Eb/G has root Eb, but bass G. Maybe the chord roots are not matching the bass. So focus on the chord roots:

Gdim (root G), Eb/G (root Eb), Bbm/F (root Bb), Ab/G (root Ab), Dbmaj7/F (root Db). So roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db.

Hmm, G to Eb is minor third down, Eb to Bb is perfect fifth, Bb to Ab is major second down, Ab to Db is perfect fourth up. Not obvious.

Wait, maybe it's a circle of fifths progression? Let's see: Db - Ab - Eb - Bb - F - C - G... But the roots we have are Db, Ab, Eb, Bb, G. So Db, Ab (P5 down), Ab to Eb (P5 down), Eb to Bb (P5 down), Bb to G... Not quite. G is a minor third up from Eb? Maybe not.

Wait, another idea: all these chords might be related to the diminished scale. Gdim is part of the G half-diminished or diminished scale. But not sure.

Wait, looking at the notes used:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb

Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb

Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Db

So compiling all notes: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Wait, these notes are all the notes of the Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes! Ab major scale has G as the seventh degree. So all the notes fit into Ab major. Therefore, the key is Ab major.

But let's confirm:

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords:

Gdim = G, Bb, Db (vii° in Ab)

Eb/G = G, Eb, Bb (Eb is V in Ab, first inversion)

Bbm/F = F, Bb, Db (Bbm is ii in Ab? Wait, no. In Ab major, the ii chord is Bb minor: Bb, Db, F. Yes! So Bbm is ii, and Bbm/F is second inversion.

Ab/G: If we consider Ab major chord with G in bass, but G is not part of Ab major triad. However, Ab major 7th chord is Ab, C, Eb, G. So Abmaj7/G is the third inversion. Given that later we have Dbmaj7/F, it's likely that Ab/G is implying Abmaj7. So this chord is Imaj7 in third inversion.

Dbmaj7/F: Db is the IV chord in Ab major. Dbmaj7 is IVmaj7, and F is the third of Db, so third inversion (since Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C; third inversion would be C in bass, wait no: inversions for 7th chords are 1st (3rd in bass), 2nd (5th), 3rd (7th). So Dbmaj7 in third inversion has C in bass. Wait, but here it's Dbmaj7/F. F is the third of Db, so first inversion. Wait, confusion here.

Wait, chord inversions for triads: first inversion is third in bass, second inversion is fifth. For seventh chords: root position (root bass), first inversion (third), second (fifth), third (seventh).

So Dbmaj7 consists of Db (root), F (third), Ab (fifth), C (seventh).

Dbmaj7/F would be first inversion (third in bass), yes. Similarly, Abmaj7/G would be third in bass (G is seventh of Abmaj7), so third inversion.

Yes, so:

- Abmaj7/G: third inversion (G is the seventh)
- Dbmaj7/F: first inversion (F is the third)

So given that, the progression uses diatonic chords from Ab major:

- Gdim (vii°)
- Eb (V)
- Bbm (ii)
- Abmaj7 (I)
- Dbmaj7 (IV)

But why the frequent Gdim? Let's see the progression:

Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Bbm/F | Ab/G | Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Dbmaj7/F | Gdim

So it's like a repeating pattern: [Gdim x2, Eb/G x2] then [Gdim x2, Bbm/F, Ab/G], then [Gdim x2, Eb/G x2], then [Gdim x2, Dbmaj7/F], Gdim.

This seems like Gdim is being used as a passing chord between the other chords. In Ab major, Gdim (vii°) often leads to Ab (I). But here, it's alternating with Eb/G (V), so maybe it's a back-and-forth between V and vii°, which is common because vii° acts as a leading chord to I, but here it's going to V? Wait, no.

Wait, in Ab major:

- vii° (Gdim) leads to I (Ab)
- V (Eb) leads to I (Ab)

But in the progression, we have Gdim leading to Eb/G. Hmm. Maybe it's a different function. Alternatively, considering secondary leading tones.

Wait, Eb is the V of Ab. Gdim is vii° of Ab. But when we have Gdim followed by Eb, perhaps Gdim is acting as a common tone diminished chord related to Eb.

Wait, let's take Gdim to Eb/G. Gdim has notes G, Bb, Db. Eb major has Eb, G, Bb. So the common tones are G and Bb. The Db in Gdim moves down to C (but in Eb/G, there's no C; wait, Eb/G is G, Eb, Bb). So Db to Eb? Maybe chromatic movement.

Wait, another thought: the repeated use of Gdim with other chords might indicate that G is not the root but the common tone. If the bass is staying on G for many chords, but then in some places it goes to F.

Wait, Ab/G chord: if the bass stays on G, then Ab/G would be a chord over G pedal. But then Bbm/F has bass F.

Alternatively, looking at the chord progression in terms of minor key. Let's consider Ab minor.

Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb (enharmonically: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, Gb). But harmonic minor would have G natural instead of Gb. So Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. Which is equivalent to: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G.

But the chords present notes like Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, F (from Bbm/F), G. Wait, there's an F natural in Bbm/F chord (since Bbm is Bb-Db-F). In Ab harmonic minor, F would be F natural? Wait, no:

Wait, in Ab natural minor, the sixth degree is Fb (which is E), but in harmonic minor, the seventh is raised to G natural, but sixth remains Fb/E. Wait, this is confusing. Let's spell Ab harmonic minor properly:

Root: Ab

2: Bb

3: Cb (B)

4: Db

5: Eb

6: Fb (E)

7: G (natural, since raised from Gb)

So notes: Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G.

But in the given chords, we have F natural (from Bbm/F chord: F, Bb, Db). So F natural isn't in Ab harmonic minor. Hmm. So maybe not Ab minor.

Wait, another candidate: Gb minor? Relative to Bbb major, messy. How about C minor?

C minor natural: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B natural

Chords:

Gdim: in C minor, would Gdim be the iv chord? No. Wait, in C minor, the diatonic chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v°: Gdim (if natural minor), but in harmonic minor, v is G major

VI: Ab

VII: Bb

So in natural minor, Gdim would be the v chord? Wait no:

Wait, scale degrees for natural minor:

i: C D Eb F G Ab Bb (C natural minor)

Triads:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

vii°: Bdim

Wait, so in C natural minor, the vii° is Bdim. Not Gdim.

In harmonic minor, with B natural:

Scale: C D Eb F G Ab B

Triads:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III+: Ebaug

iv: Fm

V: G

VI: Ab

vii°: Bdim

Wait, so G is major in harmonic minor.

Hmm. Not seeing Gdim as a diatonic chord in C minor.

Wait, maybe F minor? Let's check.

F natural minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

Harmonic minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, E

Chords:

Diatonic vii° in F minor would be Eb dim (Eb, Gb, Bbb), which is enharmonically D#dim, but not Gdim.

Not helpful.

Wait, going back to Ab major. All the notes fit into Ab major. Let's confirm each chord's function:

- Gdim: vii° leading to I, but here it's used in between V and other chords.

Eb/G is V6 (first inversion of V). In Ab major, V is Eb, so Eb/G makes sense.

Bbm/F is ii6/4 (second inversion of ii).

Ab/G is Imaj7 in third inversion (if we assume the maj7).

Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7 in first inversion.

So the progression has the following functional harmony:

vii° - V6 - vii° - ii6/4 - I6/4 (if Ab/G is considered as I with added G) - etc.

Wait, but the repeated vii° might be for a chromatic bass line. The bass alternates G and F. G to F is a whole step down. In Ab major, the bass movement from G (vii) to F (VI? No, F is the sixth scale degree in Ab major). Wait, in Ab major, the scale degrees:

I: Ab

ii: Bb

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: G°

So F is the sixth degree, forming vi minor.

But the bass goes G (vii°), then F (vi), but in the chord Bbm/F, the chord is ii, not vi.

Hmm, maybe the bass line is descending: G, F, E, etc., but here it's mostly G with occasional F.

Wait, another idea: the progression could be in Gb major? Let's see.

Gb major scale: Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

But we have Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, F, and G natural. G natural is not in Gb major; it would be F#. So no.

Wait, but the chords include G natural (as bass note), Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, F. So the notes are Ab, Bb, C (from Ab/G chord: Ab/G has Ab, C, Eb?), wait wait:

Wait, hold on. Ab/G chord: if it's Ab major triad with G bass, then the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. So C natural is present. In Ab major scale, C is the third degree (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G). Yes, so C is in Ab major.

Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C. All in Ab major.

Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb. G is in Ab major (7th degree).

Bbm/F: Bb, Db, F. Bb is ii, Db is iv, F is vi.

So yes, all notes are diatonic to Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

As for the mode, since all chords fit into major scale, it's Ionian mode. But maybe there's a modal feel, but given the presence of major IV (Dbmaj7) and V (Eb), it's likely straightforward major.

Wait, but the frequent use of vii° might give a different feel, but still in major key.

Alternatively, considering the chord progression revolves around Ab, but with a lot of Gdim, which is the leading tone chord, so it's definitely Ab major.

Wait, but let's check for other possibilities. Could it be F minor? Let's see.

F minor natural: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

Harmonic minor has E natural.

Chords in the progression have Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G (natural). In F minor natural, G is the second degree (minor key: whole step between i and ii). G natural is present. Let's see:

- Gdim in F minor? Scale degrees: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. So chord on G would be G-Ab-C, which is Gm7b5? Wait, triad: G, Bb, Db – yes! In F natural minor, the ii chord is G diminished (G, Bb, Db). So Gdim would be ii° in F minor.

Then Eb/G: Eb major with G bass. In F minor, Eb is the VII chord. Eb major is borrowed from harmonic minor (since in natural minor, VII is Eb major already). Wait, in natural minor, VII is major.

Ab/G: Ab major chord. In F minor, Ab is the III chord (relative major key is Ab major). So Ab would be III in F minor.

Dbmaj7/F: Db is iv in F minor (natural minor: Db major? No, iv in natural minor is minor. Wait, confusion.

Wait, F minor scale:

Natural: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

Harmonic: raises Eb to E natural.

So chords:

i: Fm

ii°: Gdim

III: Ab

iv: Bbm

V: C dim or major depending on harmonic/natural

VI: Db

VII: Eb

So in natural minor:

- Gdim is ii°

- Eb is VII (major)

- Ab is III

- Bbm is iv

- Db would be VI, but Db major is not diatonic; in natural minor, VI is Db major? Wait:

Wait, in natural minor, the triads:

i: Fm (F, Ab, C)

ii°: G° (G, Bb, Db)

III: Ab (Ab, C, Eb)

iv: Bbm (Bb, Db, F)

v°: C° (C, Eb, Gb) [but Gb not present here]

VI: Db (Db, F, Ab)

vii°: Eb° (Eb, Gb, Bbb)

Wait, hold on:

For F natural minor:

Note: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

Triad on F: F, Ab, C → Fm

G: G, Bb, Db → Gdim

Ab: Ab, C, Eb → Ab

Bb: Bb, Db, F → Bbm

C: C, Eb, Gb → Cdim (but Gb not in our chords; we have G natural)

Db: Db, F, Ab → Db

Eb: Eb, Gb, Bbb → effectively E dim, but not matching.

But in our chord progression, we have C natural (from Ab/G chord: Ab, C, Eb). In F minor natural, C is the fifth degree, and the III chord (Ab) has C as its third. So Ab major is diatonic. Similarly, Db major is VI in F minor natural.

Wait, so let's map the chords to F minor:

- Gdim = ii°

- Eb/G = VII with first inversion? Eb/G: G is not part of Eb triad in F minor. Eb as VII chord is Eb major (Eb, G, Bb). Yes! So Eb/G is the first inversion of VII chord.

- Bbm/F = iv chord (Bbm) in second inversion (F bass).

- Ab/G = III chord (Ab) with G bass (which is a non-chord tone for triad, but if considering Ab major 7th, G is the seventh).

- Dbmaj7/F = VI chord (Db) with major 7th, in first inversion (F bass).

So in F minor, the chords make sense as:

- Gdim (ii°)

- Eb/G (VII6)

- Bbm/F (iv6/4)

- Ab/G (III with added 7th)

- Dbmaj7/F (VI7)

Moreover, F minor's relative major is Ab, so they share the same key signature. So depending on the tonal center, it could be either Ab major or F minor.

The progression ends on Gdim, which is not tonic for either. But the chord that appears to function as a tonic might be Ab or Fm.

But in the sequence, we have Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F. In minor keys, the VI chord (Db) is often used, and III (Ab) is the relative major.

However, the progression has a lot of Gdim (ii° in F minor), which again, is similar to vii° in Ab major.

To determine whether it's major or minor, look for the presence of leading tone. In Ab major, the leading tone is G (7th degree), which is in the Gdim chord. In F minor, the leading tone would be E natural (in harmonic minor), but the chords don't have E natural; we have Eb instead. All chords use Eb, not E natural. So likely natural minor, but in natural minor, the v chord is minor, but here we have Eb major as VII.

Wait, this is a bit tricky. In rock/pop music, sometimes minor keys use the major VII chord from natural minor. So F natural minor has Eb as VII major. So if the tonal center is F minor (natural), then:

- Tonic: Fm

- But the chords go to Ab (III), Db (VI), Eb (VII), which are all characteristic of natural minor progressions (e.g., i - VII - VI - V, etc.)

However, in this progression, there is no F minor chord presented. The bass moves to F in Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F chords, but the chord on F is not F minor. Wait, Bbm/F is Bbm chord with F bass, Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 with F bass. So F is in the bass but the chord isn't Fm.

Similarly, in Ab major, we don't have the V chord leading to I frequently; instead, we have Eb which is V, but it's alternating with vii°.

Hmm. How to decide between Ab major and F minor.

One test is whether the progression feels like it resolves to Ab or to Fm.

The last chord before the final Gdim is Dbmaj7/F. Db is VI in F minor and IV in Ab major. The progression ends on Gdim, which would want to resolve to Ab in major or to Am in... No.

In Ab major, Gdim (vii°) strongly pulls to Ab. In F minor, Gdim is ii°, which would pull to Bb (iv), but not as strong.

Given the repeated movement between Gdim and Eb/G (which is V in Ab, VII in Fm), it's more likely Ab major because V-I is a strong cadence in major, whereas in minor, the cadence is often V-i (with harmonic minor's raised 7th). But here, the V chord (Eb) is used, which in minor would be Eb major as VII in natural minor, not the V.

Wait, crucial point: In minor keys, the dominant chord (V) is typically major due to the raised 7th in harmonic minor. So in F minor, the V chord would be C major (to pull to Fm). But in this progression, there is no C chord; instead, we have Eb which is the VII in natural minor. So this suggests it's in Ab major, where Eb is the V chord.

The presence of Eb (V) strongly pointing to Ab (I) suggests Ab major, whereas in F minor, Eb would be a less strong chord (subtonic). Given the frequency of Eb/G paired with Gdim (which is vii° leading to I), it makes more sense in Ab major.

Additionally, the Dbmaj7 is IV in Ab major, a common chord, whereas VI in minor is less dominant.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

As for mode, since it's using major scale with all diatonic chords and strong V-I motion (implied by Eb leading to Ab, although Ab isn't stated directly in the progression except possibly as Ab/G), it's Ionian mode (i.e., major key, not modal).

Wait, but the progression doesn't clearly state the tonic chord (Ab or Fm). However, the Ab/G chord suggests that Ab is a point of arrival. Let's see the structure:

Looking at the chord sequence, there's a section: ...Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G...

So after two Gdim, it goes to Bbm/F then Ab/G. In Ab major, Gdim (vii°) leads to Ab (I), so the Ab/G would be that resolution. Even though it's Ab in first inversion (or third inversion of maj7), it's still pointing to Ab as tonic.

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7 leading possibly to a resolution, but followed by Gdim which leads back to Ab.

Therefore, I think the key is Ab major.

Double-checking for any accidentals outside Ab major: all chords use only notes from Ab major. Yes.

Final answer: Key is Ab major, Ionian mode.

The given chord progression consists primarily of diatonic chords within **Ab major** (Ionian mode). Here's a concise breakdown:

### **Key Determination**
- All chord tones (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G) align perfectly with the **Ab major scale** (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G).
- **Functional Harmonic Roles**:
  - **Gdim**: vii° (leading-tone diminished chord), which naturally resolves to **Ab** (I).
  - **Eb/G**: V first inversion (dominant chord), strongly pulling toward **Ab**.
  - **Bbm/F**: ii second inversion (supertonic minor chord).
  - **Ab/G**: I chord in third inversion (Imaj7), emphasizing **Ab** as tonic.
  - **Dbmaj7/F**: IVmaj7 first inversion (subdominant major seventh chord).

### **Why Ab Major?**
- The progression hinges on the **vii°-V-I relationship** (Gdim → Eb → Ab), a hallmark of major-key harmonic motion.
- While the final chord is Gdim (vii°), the repeated movement from **Gdim → Eb/G → Ab/G** resolves toward **Ab**, confirming **Ab** as the tonal center.
- **No modal ambiguity**: All chords derive from the major scale, and there are no accidental alterations pointing to a mode (e.g., Dorian, Mixolydian).

### **Why Not F Minor?**
- While F minor shares the same key signature, the progression lacks a functional **V-i cadence** (e.g., C major → F minor), which is typical in minor keys.
- **Eb** functions as **V in Ab major** (strong dominant), whereas in F minor, Eb would act as a *weaker* subtonic (VII in natural minor), not driving toward F.

---

### ✅ Final Answer  
- **Key**: **Ab major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (standard major scale, no modal mixture)  

This progression is firmly rooted in **Ab Ionian**, with Gdim acting as the leading-tone chord driving harmonic motion toward the tonic (Ab).

**Assistant - Qwen 235B**

Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their functions

Let’s spell out the chords:

- **Gdim (G°):** G–Bb–Db  
  - Diminished triad
  - Common in minor keys as the **ii° chord in F harmonic minor** or as **vii° leading tone chord**
- **Eb/G:** First inversion of Eb major (G–Bb–Eb)
  - Eb major chord with G in bass
- **Bbm/F:** First inversion of Bb major (F–Bb–D)
  - Bb major chord with F in bass
- **Ab/G:** Ab major chord with G in bass (G–Ab–C–Eb)
  - This creates a dissonance (G and Ab next to each other)
- **Dbmaj7/F:** Db major 7th with F in bass (F–Ab–C–Eb)
  - F is the 3rd of Dbmaj7

Note: All chords have either G or F in the bass in inversions, suggesting voice-leading or pedal point.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the root movement and harmonic context

List of chord roots:
G – G – Eb – Eb  
G – G – Bb – Ab  
G – G – Eb – Eb  
G – G – Db – G

So we have:  
G → Eb → G → Bb → Ab → G → Eb → G → Db → G

Notable chords:
- **Gdim** appears repeatedly
- **Eb/G**, **Bbm/F**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F** — all have **G or F** in the bass
- **Dbmaj7/F** is particularly interesting — Dbmaj7 = C#maj7 enharmonically, but spelled as Db

---

### Step 3: Consider possible keys

Let’s examine possible tonal centers.

#### Is this in **G minor**?
- Gdim is **ii°** in **F major / F mixolydian**, or **vii°** in **Ab major**
- Gdim is **ii°** in **F harmonic minor** (F G Ab Bb Cb Db E → Gdim = G Bb Db)

But let’s look at other chords:

- **Eb major** = VI in G minor, or **bVI** in F minor
- **Bb major** = III in G minor (but G minor has Bb, so Bb is III)
- **Ab major** = iv in Eb minor, or bVII in Bb
- **Dbmaj7** = bII in C minor, but also appears in **Ab major** as **V/IV**?

But **Dbmaj7** is a major 7th chord — not diatonic in G minor or F minor.

Wait: **Dbmaj7** is diatonic to **Ab major**: Ab has F, Ab, C, Eb — yes, **C is natural**, but Dbmaj7 has **C**, which is correct.

So:
- **Ab major key:** F is the 6th, G is not in the key
- But Gdim has G–Bb–Db — G is not in Ab major (Ab Bb C Db Eb F G)
  - Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G → yes, G is the 7th scale degree
  - But G–Bb–Db = Gdim, which is **vii°** in Ab major?

Check: Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G  
Degrees: I – ii – iii – IV – V – vi – vii°  
So **Gdim** is **vii°** of Ab major — yes.

Now check other chords in **Ab major**:
- **Eb** = V (Eb major is dominant in Ab)
- **Eb/G** = first inversion V — fine
- **Bb** = ii in Ab — but Bb major is **not** diatonic to Ab major — Ab major has Bb minor (Bb–Db–F), not Bb major (Bb–D–F)
  - So **Bb major** implies a **modal mixture** or **secondary dominant**
- Bb major has **D**, which is not in Ab major → chromatic
- **Ab/G** = Ab major with G in bass → Ab/G is just embellishment
- **Dbmaj7** = IV chord in Ab major — Db is IV — Db major 7 is **IVmaj7**, which is **not diatonic** to Ab major
  - Ab major has **Db major**, but the 7th would be **Cb**, not **C natural**
  - So Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C → has **C natural**, but Ab major has **C natural**
    - Wait: Ab major: A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G
    - So C is natural, so **Dbmaj7** = **Db–F–Ab–C** → all notes are in Ab major!
    - Yes! F is the 3rd, C is the 7th — both in Ab major

So **Dbmaj7** is **IVmaj7** in **Ab major** — but Ab major doesn’t normally use **IVmaj7** because the subdominant in major is minor (Fm in C, etc.), but wait:

In **Ab major**, IV is **Db major** (Db–F–Ab), and **Dbmaj7** is possible if the 7th is C, which is diatonic — so **Dbmaj7** is **IVmaj7** and is **diatonic** to Ab major — yes!

But earlier: **Bb/F** — Bb major — not diatonic to Ab major — Ab major has **Bbm**, not BbM.

Bb major (Bb–D–F) — D is not in Ab major (Ab has C, Db) — D is the **raised 4th** — **chromatic**.

So **Bb major** is not in Ab major — unless it's a secondary chord.

Perhaps it’s **V of IV**? IV in Ab is Db, V of Db is Ab — not Bb.

Bb is **V of Eb**, but Eb is **V of Ab**, so Bb could be **V/V/V** — that’s stretched.

Alternatively, **Bb major** is **III** in **F minor**, but we’re seeing Eb, which is IV in F minor.

Let’s reconsider.

Wait — **Eb/G**, **Bbm/F**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F**

Try **F minor**?

F minor natural: F G Ab Bb Cb Db Eb
But we have many chords with **major** qualities: Eb (major), Bb (major), Ab (major), Db (major) — all are major.

So perhaps **F Dorian**? (F G Ab Bb C D Eb)

F Dorian: F–G–Ab–Bb–C–D–Eb

Let’s check chords:
- Gdim: G–Bb–Db → G is in F Dorian, Bb yes, Db yes → G–Bb–Db = vii° → possible
- Eb/G: Eb major (Eb–G–Bb) — G is in F Dorian, but **Eb major** is IV in F Dorian — yes, Dorian has **major IV**
- Bbm/F: Bb major — Bb–D–F — D is the 6th of F Dorian → yes, **V chord** — but **Bb major** is **V** in F Dorian? Wait:
  - F Dorian: i = Fm, ii = Gm, bIII = Ab, IV = Bb, v = Cm, bVI = Db, bVII = Eb
  - So **IV = Bb major**, yes — so Bbm/F is **IV** in first inversion — correct

But **Ab/G** — Ab major — Ab–C–Eb

Ab is bIII in F Dorian — so **bIII chord** — Ab major — yes — that is standard in Dorian: **bIII** is major

- Ab/G = Ab major with G in bass — G is in F Dorian — possible
- Dbmaj7/F = Db–F–Ab–C — Db is bVI in F Dorian — Db major is not in F Dorian — F Dorian has **Db minor** (Db–Fb–Ab) — Fb = E, not F

But here we have **F natural**, not Fb

So F natural is **major 3rd** of Db — so it’s **Db major**, not minor — not in F Dorian

Wait — Dorian has **Db minor**, not Db major

So Dbmaj7 is **not** in F Dorian — it has **F natural**, but F Dorian has F natural — but the chord on Db would be **Db–F–Ab** — that’s **Db major**, not minor — because the third is **F**, which is natural — but in F Dorian, the scale has **F natural**, so the chord **Db–F–Ab** = **Db major**, yes!

Wait — is that right?

F Dorian: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb

So on **Db**, built on scale: Db (enharmonic C#), but we call it Db

Scale degrees: Db would be bvi

Chord on bvi: Db–F–Ab → F is the 3rd — F is natural in F Dorian — so the chord is **Db major** — yes!

And 7th: add **C**, which is the 6th of F Dorian — yes, **C natural**

So **Dbmaj7** = Db–F–Ab–C — all notes in F Dorian — yes!

So chord on bVI is **Dbmaj7** — **bVImaj7** — which is **characteristic of Dorian mode**

Similarly:
- i = Fm
- ii = Gm
- bIII = Ab
- IV = Bb
- v = Cm (or C7 if harmonic)
- bVI = Dbmaj7
- bVII = Eb

So let's map your chords to **F Dorian**:

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db → G is ii° — so **ii°** in F Dorian — but Dorian has **G minor**, not G diminished — problem.

G minor would be G–Bb–D, but here we have G–Bb–Db → **Db**, not D → so **Gdim**, not Gm

So Gdim has **Db**, not D — but **D** is in F Dorian, so **Gm** would fit — but **Gdim** has **Db**, which is also in F Dorian?

Wait: F Dorian: F G Ab Bb C D Eb — so both **D** and **Db**?

No — D and Db are different — F Dorian has **D natural**, not **Db**

Wait: F Dorian = mode of Gb major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G → wait, no:

F Dorian: starts on F, uses the Bb major scale: F G Ab Bb C D Eb

So notes: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb

No **Db** — so **Db is not in F Dorian**!

But Gdim = G–Bb–Db — **Db** is not in F Dorian → so **Gdim not possible in F Dorian**

Contradiction.

So **F Dorian is out** because it has D natural, not Db.

But all Gdim chords imply **Db**.

So **scale must include Db**.

Try **Ab major** again.

Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Contains: G, Bb, Db → so **Gdim = vii°** → yes!
- Eb/G: Eb–G–Bb → G and Bb are in Ab major, Eb is V → yes
- Bbm/F: Bb–D–F → but **D** is not in Ab major (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G) — so D natural is **not** in key → chromatic
- Ab/G: Ab–C–Eb → G in bass — G is in scale (7th) — fine
- Dbmaj7/F: Db–F–Ab–C — all notes in Ab major — yes, **IVmaj7** — Db is IV

But **Bbm/F = Bb major**, which requires **D**, not in Ab major → so chromatic

So Bb major is **not diatonic** — unless it's a secondary dominant.

What if **Bb major** is **V of Eb**? Eb is V of Ab — so Bb is V/V — **secondary dominant**

Bb → Eb — yes: Bb (V of Eb) → Eb (V of Ab) — so **V7/V → V → I** is common

But here it’s Bb → Ab/G — not Eb

But Eb appears earlier and later.

The progression is cyclic, so perhaps: Dbmaj7 → Gdim → ...

Wait: **Dbmaj7/F** → **Gdim**

Db = IV, Gdim = vii° — IV–vii° — not a typical resolution, but possible.

But **Gdim → Eb/G** — Gdim (vii°) → Eb (V) — that’s **very common** in Ab major: vii° → V

Similarly, **Gdim → Ab/G** — vii° → I6 — also possible

But we have: Gdim → Eb/G (vii° → V), then Eb/G → Gdim — that's odd

Order:
... Ab/G → Gdim → Gdim → Eb/G ...

Ab/G → Gdim → Eb/G — so **I → vii° → V** — very plausible in **Ab major**

Also: after Eb/G → Gdim — V → vii°? Less common — usually V → I

But it could be **deceptive resolution** or voice-leading

But the **Dbmaj7/F** is interesting

After second Eb/G, we have:
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

So **Gdim → Dbmaj7** — that’s vii° → IV — possible but not strong

But then **Dbmaj7 → Gdim** — IV → vii° — not standard

But maybe it’s about bass line.

Let’s look at the **bass line**:

From the inversions:
- Gdim: G (assumed) → G in bass
- Eb/G: G in bass
- Bbm/F: F in bass
- Ab/G: G in bass
- Dbmaj7/F: F in bass

So bass: G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G

So mostly **G**, with two **F** appearances: under Bbm and Dbmaj7

So G is a **pedal tone** for most of the progression.

This suggests **G** is important — perhaps a **pedal point** or part of a **passing motion**

But G is the **leading tone** in **Ab major** — **vii°** — which resolves **up to Ab** — so it makes sense to emphasize G in the vii° chord

Now, **Dbmaj7/F** has **F** in bass — F is the **5th** of Db, but also the **6th** of Ab scale — and F–G motion in bass to Gdim

Similarly, **Bbm/F** has F in bass — Bb major — which is **V/V** — V of Eb

So possible progression in **Ab major**:

- Gdim = vii° → leads to V or I
- Eb/G = V6 — dominant
- Bbm/F = V/V (Bb) — secondary dominant leading to Eb
- Ab/G = I6 — tonic
- Dbmaj7/F = IV6 with maj7 — subdominant

So the harmonic flow could be:

vii° → V → vii° → V/V → V → vii° → V → vii° → IV → vii° → V (implied?) →...

But the structure seems to be:

**[Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G] ×2**  
Then instead of Eb/G, we have **Dbmaj7/F**, then back to Gdim

So first two phrases: Gdim → Eb/G  
Then: Gdim → Bbm/F → Ab/G → Gdim → Eb/G  
Then repeat, but last part: Gdim → Dbmaj7/F → Gdim

So perhaps: tonicization of **V** (Eb) via **V/V = Bb**, and then **IV** (Db) as a chromatic variant or modal interchange?

But **Dbmaj7** is diatonic — so not chromatic

Wait — in **Ab major**, IV is **Db major**, so Dbmaj7 is just **IVmaj7**

So the progression is largely diatonic to **Ab major**, except:
- **Bb major** = Bb–D–F → D not in key → so **chromatic** chord — but functions as **V of Eb (V/V)**
- All other chords: Gdim (vii°), Eb (V), Ab (I), Db (IV) — all diatonic

So the only non-diatonic chord is **Bb major** (V/V)

That’s acceptable as a **secondary dominant**

So overall, the tonal center is **Ab major**, with:
- vii° = Gdim
- V = Eb
- V/V = Bb
- I = Ab
- IV = Dbmaj7

And the mode is therefore **Ionian (major)**, not a mode like Dorian or Mixolydian.

But is Ab **major** or **Ab Lydian**? Lydian has #4, but here no #4 — so just **major**.

But the progression keeps returning to Gdim — which is **vii°** — often used as a **tonic substitute or approach to V**

The **pedal G in bass** supports its function as the **leading tone**

---

### Final Analysis:

- **Key: Ab major**
- **Mode: Ionian (major)**
- **Chord Functions:**
  - Gdim = vii° (leading tone chord)
  - Eb/G = V6 (dominant)
  - Bbm/F = V/V (secondary dominant, chromatic)
  - Ab/G = I6 (tonic)
  - Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj6 (subdominant with added 7th)

Despite the chromatic Bb major, the tonic is strongly suggested by Ab chord and resolution from Gdim/Eb.

### ✅ Conclusion:

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

The repeated Gdim emphasizes the **vii°** chord, creating tension that resolves to **Eb (V)** and **Ab (I)**, and **Dbmaj7** is a diatonic IV chord. The use of **V/V** (Bb) briefly emphasizes the dominant, but the key center remains **Ab**.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by analyzing this step by step.

First, I need to list out all the chords and see what notes they contain. Starting with Gdim. A diminished seventh chord is typically G-Bb-Db-F. But wait, sometimes it's written as Gdim7, which is G-Bb-Db-F. But here it's just Gdim, which could be a triad: G-Bb-Db. I should confirm that. Diminished triads are root, minor third, diminished fifth. So Gdim triad is G, Bb, Db. But in the context of chords in a progression, especially when written as "Gdim" without the 7, it's likely a triad. However, sometimes people use "dim" for diminished seventh, but I think in most notation, "dim" is triad and "dim7" is the seventh. But to be safe, I should check the specific chords.

Looking at the next one: Eb/G. That's an Eb major chord with G in the bass. So Eb major is Eb, G, Bb. So Eb/G would be G, Eb, Bb. Then Bbm/F is Bb minor with F in the bass. Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So F, Bb, Db. Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass: Ab, C, Eb. So G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait, no. Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So when it's Ab/G, that means G is the bass note, so the notes would be G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait, but a chord with Ab in the bass would be Ab major, but here it's Ab/G, so G is the bass note, so it's a first inversion or something. Wait, actually, when it's written as X/Y, Y is the bass note. So Ab/G means the chord is Ab major, but with G as the bass note. So the notes would be G (bass), then the Ab major chord notes which are Ab, C, Eb. So the full notes would be G, Ab, C, Eb. But that might be an Ab major chord in third inversion? Because the root is Ab, so the order would be Ab, C, Eb, but with G in the bass, so the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. Alternatively, maybe a G minor 7th chord? Wait, G, Bb, Db, F would be Gø7, but here it's Ab/G. Let me check.

Wait, Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So with G in the bass, that's G, Ab, C, Eb. But is that a valid chord? Let's see: the root would be Eb? Because Eb is the fifth of Ab. No, actually, the chord is an Ab major triad with G as the bass note. So the intervals from G: G to Ab is minor second, G to C is perfect fourth, G to Eb is minor sixth. So it's a G minor 7th without the fifth? Wait, G minor 7th is G, Bb, D, F. No, this is different. Alternatively, this might be an Ebmaj7 chord? Because Ebmaj7 is Eb, G, Bb, D. But here it's Ab/G. Let me check the notes: Ab, C, Eb with G bass. So notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. So G is the bass, then Ab, C, Eb. So the notes present are G, Ab, C, Eb. Now, let's see what scale this might belong to.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at the chord progression as a whole. Let's list all the chords:

1. Gdim (G, Bb, Db)
2. Gdim (same)
3. Eb/G (bass G, chord Eb major: Eb, G, Bb) so G, Eb, Bb (but actually, when written as Eb/G, the chord is Eb major with G in bass, so notes are G, Eb, Bb. The top notes would be Eb and Bb over G. So the notes present: G, Eb, Bb. So it's like a G minor 7th? G, Bb, D, F. But here we have G, Eb, Bb. So D is missing. So perhaps it's a Gm7 chord without the fifth? Or Eb6? Wait, Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So in first inversion, G, Bb, Eb. But Eb/G could be G as bass, the chord Eb major, so the notes are Eb, G, Bb with G on the bottom. So G is bass, then Eb and Bb. So the notes are G, Eb, Bb. So that's a G minor 7th chord without the D? Because G minor 7th is G, Bb, D, F. But here there's no D or F. So maybe it's a different chord.

Wait, maybe better to write all the chords in terms of their notes. Let's go through each chord:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Gdim (same)
- Eb/G: bass is G, the chord is Eb major. So notes are G, Eb, Bb (since Eb major is Eb, G, Bb; with G as bass, so the notes would be G (bass), then Eb, Bb above. So the chord is G, Eb, Bb. So notes: G, Bb, Eb.
- Eb/G (same as above)
- Gdim (G, Bb, Db)
- Gdim (same)
- Bbm/F: bass F, chord Bb minor. Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So with F in bass, notes: F, Bb, Db. So F, Bb, Db.
- Ab/G: bass G, chord Ab major. Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. So with G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb. Notes: G, Ab, C, Eb.
- Then Gdim (G, Bb, Db)
- Gdim (same)
- Eb/G (same as before: G, Eb, Bb)
- Eb/G (same)
- Gdim (G, Bb, Db)
- Gdim (same)
- Dbmaj7/F: bass F, chord Db major 7. Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So with F bass: F, Db, Ab, C. Notes: F, Db, Ab, C.
- Then Gdim: G, Bb, Db

So let's list all the unique notes across the entire progression. Let's collect all notes used.

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (since Eb/G has G bass, and the chord is Eb major, which is Eb, G, Bb. So yes, notes G, Eb, Bb)

Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db (since Bbm is Bb, Db, F, bass F)

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb

Dbmaj7/F: F, Db, Ab, C

So let's list all notes present in the entire progression:

- G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C

Now let's list them: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, let's order them:

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. That's seven notes. Let's see what scale this could be.

Check the intervals. C, Db (minor second), Eb (minor third), F (perfect fourth), G (perfect fifth), Ab (minor sixth), Bb (minor seventh). Hmm, a minor scale with all minor seconds? Wait, no. Let's check if this is a mode of a scale.

Alternatively, the notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Let's see: starting from C: C (root), Db (minor second), Eb (minor third), F (perfect fourth), G (perfect fifth), Ab (minor sixth), Bb (minor seventh). So that's the C Phrygian mode? Because the Phrygian mode has a flattened second. The standard Phrygian mode for C would be C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! That's exactly C Phrygian. Wait, no: the Phrygian mode is the 3rd mode of the major scale. For example, E Phrygian would be E, F, G, A, B, C, D. But in terms of intervals, Phrygian has flat 2, flat 3, flat 6, flat 7. Wait, in the C Phrygian, the degrees are 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. So yes: C (1), Db (b2), Eb (b3), F (4), G (5), Ab (b6), Bb (b7). Exactly. So the notes fit C Phrygian.

But wait, is the key C Phrygian? Let's check how the chords function.

But another way is to see if there's a tonic chord. In Phrygian mode, the tonic is minor. Let's see if there's a chord that could be the tonic. However, in the progression, the chords used include Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F.

Wait, Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7, which is built on Db. But Db is part of the C Phrygian scale. The chords in C Phrygian would be:

Chords built on each degree:

C minor (C, Eb, G), but as a scale degree I chord.

II: Db major 7 (Db, F, Ab, C)

III: Eb minor 7 (Eb, Gb, Bb, Db), but in our case, the scale is C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So the chord built on Eb would be Eb, Gb, Bb, Db. But Gb is not in our scale; wait the scale is C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Eb is the third degree. So Eb minor chord: Eb, Gb, Bb. But Gb isn't in the scale. Because the scale has Eb, but the third of Eb chord would be Gb. However, in the scale, the note above Eb would be F, but for the chord on Eb, it's Eb-Gb-Bb. But Gb is not present here because our scale has Db, but no Gb. Wait, hold on: in the C Phrygian scale, the notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Eb is present, but there's no Gb. So the chord built on Eb would be Eb minor (Eb, Gb, Bb), but Gb is not in the scale. So that's a problem. So maybe the scale isn't C Phrygian because it's missing some notes?

Wait, actually, the C Phrygian scale does contain Gb? No, wait. Wait, C Phrygian: the scale degrees are 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. So C is 1, Db (b2), Eb (b3), F (4), G (5), Ab (b6), Bb (b7). Now, the third note of the scale is Eb. To build a chord on Eb, you stack thirds: Eb (root), Gb (minor third), Bb (perfect fifth), Db (minor seventh). But Gb is not in the scale we have here. Our scale has Ab (b6) and Bb (b7), but no Gb. Instead, the scale has Eb, F, G, Ab, etc. So Gb is not present. So if the scale is C Phrygian, then the note Gb would be part of it, but in our progression, we have notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. There is no Gb. So actually, the scale has Bb (flat seventh), but the third degree from C is Eb, but for the chord on Eb, you'd need Gb, but in the progression we don't have Gb. So perhaps the scale isn't C Phrygian.

Wait, let's look at all the notes again. The notes we have in total are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Let's list all the notes in the scale as a set: {C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb}. Now, check if that's a regular scale. The interval pattern between consecutive notes (C to Db is half step), Db to Eb is whole step (but Db to Eb is actually a minor second?), wait no: Db to Eb is a whole step (two half steps). Wait, C to Db is 1 semitone (minor second), Db to Eb: Db to D is semitone, D to Eb is semitone, so total 2 semitones, a whole step. Eb to F: Eb to E is semitone, E to F is another semitone, so 2 semitones, whole step. Wait no: Eb to E is a semitone, E to F is a semitone, so Eb to F is two semitones, a whole step. Then F to G: whole step. G to Ab: semitone. Ab to Bb: whole step. Then Bb to C: whole step. Wait, but this is if we list the scale in order.

Wait let's arrange the notes in ascending order:

C (0), Db (1), Eb (3), F (5), G (7), Ab (8), Bb (10), then to C (12). Wait, in semitones:

C is 0

Db: 1

Eb: 3 (because C to D is 2 semitones, but Eb is 3 semitones from C? Wait, no. Let's count semitones from C:

C: 0

Db: 1

D: 2

Eb: 3

E: 4

F: 5

F#: 6

G: 7

Ab: 8

A: 9

Bb: 10

B: 11

So in the set we have, the notes are C (0), Db (1), Eb (3), F (5), G (7), Ab (8), Bb (10). So the intervals between consecutive notes:

C to Db: 1 semitone

Db to Eb: 2 semitones (Db=1, Eb=3)

Eb to F: 2 semitones (3 to 5)

F to G: 2 semitones (5 to 7)

G to Ab: 1 semitone (7 to 8)

Ab to Bb: 2 semitones (8 to 10)

Bb to C: 2 semitones (10 to 12)

So the interval pattern is: H, W, W, W, H, W, W. Wait, that's the same as the Phrygian mode, but wait: the standard Phrygian mode has the pattern H-W-W-W-H-W-W. Wait, no: for example, E Phrygian (starting on E) is E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E. Intervals from E: E-F (H), F-G (W), G-A (W), A-B (W), B-C (H), C-D (W), D-E (W). So the interval pattern for Phrygian is H-W-W-W-H-W-W.

But in our case, starting from C:

C to Db: H

Db to Eb: W (2 semitones)

Eb to F: W

F to G: W

G to Ab: H

Ab to Bb: W

Bb to C: W

So that's H, W, W, W, H, W, W. Which matches the Phrygian mode pattern. So yes, the scale with notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb is C Phrygian. Because C Phrygian is the same as the 3rd mode of Ab major? Wait, but regardless of the parent key, the scale itself is Phrygian mode.

But wait, sometimes people think of the scale as C Phrygian, which is the same as Ab major scale. Let's check. Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes! Ab major scale: Ab (root), Bb (2), C (3), Db (4), Eb (5), F (6), G (7). Wait, no: actually, Ab major key has notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Yes. So if you take the notes of Ab major scale, which is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Now, if you start on C, the scale would be C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! So C Phrygian mode is the same as the Ab major scale starting on the 3rd degree (C is the 3rd of Ab major: Ab - Bb - C). So Ab major (key of Ab major) has the notes where C Phrygian is the 3rd mode.

But in the progression, what's the home chord? Let's check the chords used.

Looking at the chords:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db. In C Phrygian, G is the 5th degree. G diminished chord would be a diminished chord on 5th? Wait, usually in a minor scale, the 5th chord is a minor 7th flat 5 or something. Let's build chords on the C Phrygian scale.

C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

I: C minor (C, Eb, G) but with some extensions? But in our progression, do we see a C minor chord? Not really. The chords listed don't include Cm or C.

II: Db major (Db, F, Ab). Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C. Yes! In the progression, we have Dbmaj7/F, which is Db major 7th with F in bass. So the root of the last chord before the end is Dbmaj7/F. That's significant. Also, earlier we have Bbm/F: Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So Bbm chord. And Ab/G: Ab major with G bass.

Wait, Db major chord is present as Dbmaj7. Also, Ab major chord is present. Let's see:

In the key of Ab major, which contains the notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Now, let's see the chords.

Ab major key:

I: Ab major

II: Bb minor

III: C minor

IV: Db major

V: Eb major

VI: F minor

VII: G diminished

Yes, in Ab major, the VII chord is G diminished. Exactly. So Gdim would be the VII chord. Then Eb/G? Eb major would be the V chord. But Eb/G: the chord is Eb major with G bass. In Ab major scale, Eb is the V chord (Eb major: Eb, G, Bb). So Eb/G is a first inversion of Eb major.

Similarly, Bbm/F: Bb minor is the II chord. Bbm (Bb, Db, F), so with F in bass is a first inversion.

Ab/G: Ab major with G in bass (so third inversion), since Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb, and with G bass—wait, Ab with G bass, notes G, Ab, C, Eb. Which might be considered as a rootless Ab major chord? Or a G minor chord? Wait, G minor is G, Bb, D. But here we have G, Ab, C, Eb. That's G, Ab, C, Eb. So that's Gdim7? Because Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, F. But here we have Ab instead of Bb, and C and Eb. No. Alternatively, perhaps Abmaj7? No.

Wait in Ab major scale, the VII chord is G diminished. But Ab/G is not part of the Ab scale's chords. Let's see the chords in Ab major:

Chords:

I: Abmaj

II: Bbm

III: Cm

IV: Dbmaj

V: Ebm (Ebm? No, wait in Ab major, the V chord is Eb major. Wait Ab major scale has Eb as the 5th. Eb major is Eb, G, Bb. Yes. So V is Eb major.

VI: Fm (F, Ab, C)

VII: Gdim

Yes. So Gdim is seventh chord.

In the progression:

Gdim Gdim (VII)

Eb/G (V in first inversion: Eb major with G bass)

Bbm/F (II, Bbm chord with F bass. Bbm is Bb minor: Bb, Db, F; with F bass: F, Bb, Db. Which is F, Bb, Db. That's the IV chord in Ab major? Wait no, in Ab major, IV is Db major. Bbm is II chord. So yes.

Ab/G: what chord is this? Ab major chord in third inversion. But Ab major is the tonic. So Ab/G would be Ab major with G bass. In the scale of Ab major, the tonic chord is Ab, C, Eb. When played with G in bass, notes G, Ab, C, Eb. Which notes correspond to? The G is the leading tone, but Ab is the tonic. So perhaps it's a Gm7b5 chord? Wait G, Bb, Db, F is Gm7b5 (half dim). But here it's G, Ab, C, Eb. So G, Ab (b2), C (4th), Eb (b6). Wait, maybe Gmin7(b9)? No, this seems confusing.

Wait in Ab major key, the II chord is Bbm. Then IV is Dbmaj. So the chord Ab/G... If the key is Ab major, then Ab is tonic. So the Ab maj chord with G in bass: G is the leading tone (since in Ab major, G is the VII note). So Ab chord with G in bass is Ab with a G bass note, so the chord would be Abmaj with G in bass, which is a bit of a dissonance because G is the leading tone to Ab? Wait no, actually in Ab major, the note above G would be Ab, so G is the leading tone to Ab. So having G in the bass while playing Ab chord would create a minor 9th interval between G and Ab, which is quite dissonant. That might not be standard, but perhaps it's a passing chord.

Wait, but looking at the chords used:

- Gdim (VII)

- Eb/G (V first inversion)

- Bbm/F (II first inversion)

- Ab/G (tonic chord with G bass? Not sure)

- Dbmaj7/F (IV maj7 with F bass)

Dbmaj7: in Ab major, Db is the IV chord. So Dbmaj7 would be IVmaj7. Then F is the sixth of the key, so Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C. With F bass, it's F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, what's the tonic? In Ab major key, the tonic is Ab. But in the progression, do we ever see a clear Ab chord without the bass? For example, Ab major chord: Ab, C, Eb. In the progression we have "Ab/G", which is Ab major chord with G bass. So when played as Ab/G, it's G, Ab, C, Eb. So the top notes are Ab, C, Eb, which is Ab major. So the chord is Ab major, but with G in bass. So maybe it's a common chord in the progression.

Another chord: the first chords are Gdim Gdim, which is the VII chord. Then Eb/G, which is V. Then Bbm/F, which is II. So the progression is VII - V - II - ...? But in standard key, the V to I is common, but here maybe the tonic is Ab.

Also, the Dbmaj7 chord is IV. So if the key is Ab major, then chords would be VII (Gdim), V (Eb), II (Bbm), IV (Db). So the progression includes VII, V, II, IV. That makes sense for a key of Ab major. Then the Dbmaj7/F: since F is part of Db chord (Dbmaj7 has F as the third), so with F bass, it's an inversion.

Similarly, the Eb/G: Eb chord has G as the third, so in first inversion. Bbm/F: Bbm chord has F as the fifth (Bbm is Bb, Db, F), so F is fifth—so Bbm/F is first inversion (F, Bb, Db), which is common.

Now, where is the tonic chord? In the progression, Ab/G is present. Ab major chord is the tonic (I), so even though it's inverted, it's likely the tonic chord. So the key would be Ab major. But the question is about key and mode. Wait, but key is generally the major or minor key, and mode would be the scale used. But if it's in Ab major, then the mode would be Ionian. However, in Ab major, all chords would be diatonic. Let's check the chords.

Chords in Ab major:

I: Abmaj

II: Bbm

III: Cm

IV: Dbmaj

V: Ebmaj

VI: Fm

VII: Gdim

Looking at the progression:

Gdim — yes, VII

Eb/G — Ebmaj/I (but Eb major is V, and Eb/G would be V in first inversion)

Bbm/F — Bbm (II), with F as bass (Bbm is Bb, Db, F; so F is fifth of the chord, so in first inversion)

Ab/G — Abmaj (I), with G in bass (so seventh note as bass; third inversion of Abmaj)

Dbmaj7/F — Dbmaj7 is IV, and Dbmaj7 has F as third, so F bass would be third inversion

So all chords fit within Ab major.

Now, the progression alternates between these chords. So it's in Ab major. But in Ab major, the mode would be Ionian. However, sometimes when the tonic chord isn't present, but in this case, we have Abmaj chord (even if inverted), so the key is Ab major.

Wait, but the progression starts with Gdim (VII), then Eb/G (V), then Bbm/F (II), etc. But the tonic chord Ab is present as Ab/G. So the key is Ab major.

But wait, another way: in Ab major, the VII chord is Gdim. But sometimes people might consider the key as C Phrygian, which is the same notes, but root on C. However, if the chord progression centers around Ab as the tonic (especially with Ab/G and possibly other Ab chords), then it's more likely Ab major. But let's see if there's a chord that clearly resolves to Ab. For example, if there's a V to I cadence. In the progression, after Eb/G (V), but the next chord is Bbm/F (II), so not directly resolving. Hmm. Let's see the actual progression:

Gdim (VII) – Gdim (VII) – Eb/G (V) – Eb/G (V) – Gdim (VII) – Gdim (VII) – Bbm/F (II) – Ab/G (I) – Gdim (VII) – Gdim (VII) – Eb/G (V) – Eb/G (V) – Gdim (VII) – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F (IV)

So looking at this, after Fm, wait no. Let's see the chords:

After the 7th chord in the sequence: Bbm/F followed by Ab/G. So Bbm is II, Ab is I. So II to I is a common cadence (like Deceptive Cadence if V to VI, but II to I is also a subdominant to tonic). But in Ab major, II chord is Bbm. So Bbm to Ab is II to I, which is a common progression in some contexts, but usually V to I is more definitive. However, here we have V (Eb) leading into II? Not exactly. Let's see: the sequence before the Ab/G is Bbm/F – Ab/G. So Bbm to Ab (II to I). Yes, that's a cadence. Then after that, back to Gdim, etc.

But also, the Dbmaj7/F is IV chord. Then Gdim, so IV to VII. Not sure. But overall, the presence of Ab as a chord (even if inverted) and the fact that all the chords fit into Ab major points towards Ab major as the key.

Alternatively, if the tonic was C, but in C Phrygian mode, the VII chord would be Bbm (since in C Phrygian, the VII chord would be based on Bb: Bb, Db, F, Ab). Wait, let's build chords for C Phrygian.

C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Chords:

Cm (C, Eb, G)

Dbmaj (Db, F, Ab)

Ebm (Eb, Gb, Bb) — but Gb is not in our progression, but our current progression doesn't have Gb. Wait, our progression has notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Ebm chord would require Gb, which isn't present. So that's a problem. So in C Phrygian, the III chord would be diminished or minor with a Gb. But our chord progressions don't have a Gb, so perhaps the VII chord for Bb. Let's see:

Bb minor chord: Bb, Db, F. Which is present. But in C Phrygian, Bb is the VII note. So Bbm chord is VII chord. But Ab is the VI note. So Ab major chord would be VI chord. But in the progression we have Ab/G as a chord.

If the key was C Phrygian, the tonic chord would be Cm, but we don't see any C minor chords in the progression. The closest would be a chord that includes C, Eb, G, but we don't have that. So that makes C Phrygian less likely as the tonic because the tonic chord isn't present.

So if the progression doesn't have a clear C chord, but does have Ab major chord (even inverted as Ab/G), then likely the key is Ab major, with Gdim as VII chord. Because all chords used are diatonic to Ab major.

Let me confirm. Notes in Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords:

Abmaj: Ab, C, Eb

Bbm: Bb, Db, F

Cm: C, Eb, G

Dbmaj: Db, F, Ab

Ebmaj: Eb, G, Bb

Fm: F, Ab, C

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Yes. So looking at the progression chords:

Gdim — yes, seventh chord.

Eb/G: Ebmaj with G bass: Ebmaj is Eb, G, Bb. So yes.

Bbm/F: Bbm (Bb, Db, F) with F bass → F, Bb, Db.

Ab/G: Abmaj with G bass → G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 (Db, F, Ab, C), F bass → F, Db, Ab, C.

All chords fit Ab major scale. There's no Cm chord, which is in the scale (C, Eb, G), but it's not present. But sometimes progressions don't use all chords. So the most likely key is Ab major. However, the mode would be Ionian if it's a major key. But the user asked for key and mode. Key is usually the tonic note and quality, like Ab major, mode might be Ionian. But sometimes people refer to the scale mode. But in this case, since there's a clear dominant chord (Eb major, V), and tonic Ab, it's Ab major.

But let's see if there's a case where it's in a minor key. Suppose if we thought it's F minor. F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. Which is same as Ab major. Yes, F minor scale is relative minor of Ab major. So F natural minor is same as Ab major scale, which is the relative minor. So key could be F minor, with the tonic chord Fm. But looking at the progression, we have Fm? Let's see. In Ab major scale, Fm is VI chord: F, Ab, C. Is Fm present? The chords we have: Eb/G (Eb, G, Bb), Bbm/F (Bbm), which includes F but as the fifth. But there's no explicit Fm chord. The Dbmaj7/F chord contains F, Db, Ab, C. So Dbmaj7 with F bass: Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So F is part of the chord. But the chord itself is Dbmaj7, not Fm. So Fm is not directly present. However, Fm would be F, Ab, C. But in the progression, do we have that? The Dbmaj7/F has notes F, Db, Ab, C, which includes F, Ab, C—that's Fm add 11 or something? No, Fm would be F, Ab, C. Dbmaj7/F has F, Db, Ab, C. So yes, the notes of Fm are present (F, Ab, C) plus Db. So it's not strictly the Fm chord. So the VI chord Fm isn't really present as a triad.

Whereas in Ab major, the tonic is present as Abmaj in various forms (Ab/G is Ab with G bass; the C and Eb are above). So the Ab chord is definitely present. In the progression, the chords include Ab as the highest-level chord in the Ab/G inversion. So even though it's inverted, the root is still Ab.

Therefore, the key is Ab major. The mode is Ionian (since major keys are Ionian mode).

But wait, another possibility: sometimes with diminished chords, you might be in minor key. For example, a key like Ab minor. But let's see. Ab minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But that has Cb and Fb, which we don't see in the notes. The notes we have are natural Eb, F, Ab, etc., so probably not a minor key.

Another check: the presence of Dbmaj7. In Ab major, Db is IV, so Dbmaj7 is the IV chord (which is a major 7th chord). That works. In minor keys, the IV chord is usually minor or diminished, but here it's a major 7th, so suggests major key.

Also, the V chord is Eb major (Ebmaj), which is major. In a minor key, the V chord is often minor or diminished, but in natural minor it's minor, in harmonic minor it's major. However, in this progression, there's an Eb major chord (V), which would fit if in a harmonic minor. But if key is Ab minor, then natural minor is Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. But that's not matching our notes since we have no Cb or Fb. But if it's harmonic minor, then the major VII. However, in this case, the presence of Eb major chord (V) would make sense in harmonic minor. But then let's check.

If key is Ab harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. But wait, the seventh degree is G natural. So notes would be Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G. But our progression includes F, not Fb. Also, the notes we have are F natural (as in Bbm/F chord), and Ab, etc. So F natural is present, but Fb would be E. So no, that's not matching. So natural minor would have F natural. Ab natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G. Wait, natural minor would have flat 6th and 7th, but the natural minor scale is Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb? No, wait. Let's think.

Standard natural minor scale: minor scale with flat 3, 6, 7.

So Ab natural minor would be: Ab (1), Bb (2), Cb (b3), Db (4), Eb (5), Fb (b6), Gb (b7).

Wait, but in our progression, we have F natural. So F is present, but Fb would be E. So no, the scale we have has F natural. So if we consider F natural as the 6th degree, then in Ab minor, the 6th should be natural minor, but Ab natural minor's 6th is Fb (E), which is not present. So there's a conflict.

Alternatively, maybe it's Dorian mode. But I don't think so.

The most straightforward conclusion is that the key is Ab major, since all chords fit within the Ab major scale, tonic is Ab (even though inverted), and dominant Eb major chord is present.

Another check: G diminished chord is the VII chord in Ab major, which is common. Also, in Ab major, the VII chord is G dim, which is present in the progression multiple times. The V chord is Eb major, which is used (Eb/G). The II chord is Bbm (Bb minor), which is present as Bbm/F. The IV chord is Dbmaj, which is present as Dbmaj7/F. And Ab major as the tonic is present.

So the key is Ab, major. Mode would be Ionian. However, sometimes people might say "key of Ab" without specifying mode, but since it's major, the mode is Ionian. But strictly speaking, the key is Ab major.

Wait, but the question says "determine key and mode". Key usually refers to the tonic note and quality (major/minor), and mode can be specified. But sometimes key refers to the mode. But typically, "key" is major or minor with a tonic, and mode would be specified separately if it's not major/minor. However, since it's clearly a major key, the mode would be Ionian.

Alternatively, if someone considers the scale mode, then Ab major scale is Ionian, so the mode is Ionian. Yes.

But to confirm, let's see if there's a strong tonic chord. In the progression, the Ab/G chord appears in the middle. When they play Ab/G, the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. So the Ab root is present but in the higher register. So it's still the tonic chord. Also, there's no other chord that stands out as stronger tonic.

So conclusion: key of Ab major, mode Ionian.

But sometimes people might say it's in the key of Ab, and the mode is major (Ionian).

Alternatively, another thought: sometimes with chord progressions that are based around diminished chords, people might consider different keys. But in this case, it seems consistent with Ab major.

Another way to check: look at the Dbmaj7 chord. In Ab major, Dbmaj7 is IV chord, which is major seventh. That's correct. If it were C Phrygian, Db would be II chord (which is major), but the tonic would be Cm, which isn't present.

Also, the Gdim in Ab major is VII, which is common.

So yes, Ab major key.

But let's check one more thing. The chord "Bbm/F". Bbm is Bb, Db, F. With F in bass. In the key of Ab major, F is the sixth degree. The Bbm chord is second degree.

Another chord: Dbmaj7/F. Db is fourth degree, and F is the sixth. So Dbmaj7 with F bass. In Ab major, Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So F is the third of Dbmaj7, so bass F is third inversion.

So all chords fit.

Therefore, the key is Ab major (or Ab Ionian mode).

But to phrase the answer: "The key is A-flat major, and the mode is Ionian."

But let's make sure. Alternatively, someone might interpret the progression as having a different tonic. Let's see if there's a V-I cadence. The progression is:

... Bbm/F Ab/G ... So Bbm to Ab. That's II-V? No, Bbm is II, Ab is I. So II to I. It's not a perfect cadence (V to I), but still a cadence. However, in Ab major, it's possible.

If the V chord (Eb) was followed by I (Ab), that would be strong. Let's see: the progression has Eb/G followed by Gdim. So Eb (V) followed by Gdim (VII), which is not a standard cadence. But maybe after that, it goes to Bbm/F, etc. Hmm. Maybe the harmonic function isn't as clear with that, but all chords fit Ab major.

Another check: are there any chromatic notes outside the Ab major scale? Our notes are Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So all natural, no accidentals outside. No sharps or flats beyond Ab major. So no. So yes, definitely Ab major.

So key is Ab major, mode Ionian.

The chord progression provided contains all notes from the **Ab major scale** (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G), with no chromatic alterations outside this scale. All chords are diatonic to Ab major, confirming the key and mode.

### Key Analysis:
- **Tonic (I): Ab major** – The Ab/G chord (Ab, C, Eb with G in the bass) clearly establishes Ab as the tonic. While inverted, the root (Ab) and core notes of the tonic chord are present.
- **V (dominant): Eb major** – The Eb/G chord (Eb, G, Bb) is the V chord of Ab major, a classic harmonic function.
- **VII (leading-tone): Gdim** – The Gdim chord (G, Bb, Db) is the diminished VII chord in Ab major, common in major-key progressions.
- **II (supertonic): Bbm** – The Bbm/F chord (Bb, Db, F) is the II chord of Ab major.
- **IV (subdominant): Dbmaj7** – The Dbmaj7/F chord (Db, F, Ab, C) is the IV chord in first inversion.

### Mode Confirmation:
- The **Ab major scale** corresponds to the **Ionian mode**, as it follows the standard major scale pattern (W-W-H-W-W-W-H).  
- There are no minor-scale characteristics (e.g., no harmonic minor raised seventh or Dorian flat 3), and all chords align perfectly with Ab major.

### Final Answer:
**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian**  

This progression functions entirely within the diatonic framework of **Ab major (Ionian)**, with clear tonic (Ab), dominant (Eb), and subdominant (Db) harmonic relationships. The presence of the Ab tonic chord (even when inverted) and the absence of any non-diatonic accidentals solidify this conclusion.

**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B**

To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

```
Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim
```

Let’s analyze it step by step.

---

### Step 1: List and interpret the chords

We'll rewrite each chord in root position for easier analysis (but keep the bass notes as given, since they may imply inversion or a bass motion).

| Chord          | Root | Type       | Bass Note | Notes (approx.)                        |
|----------------|------|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Eb/G           | Eb   | minor?/dim?| G         | G Bb Eb (likely Eb minor with G in bass)|
| Eb/G           | Eb   | minor/dim? | G         | G Bb Eb                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Bbm/F          | Bb   | minor      | F         | F Ab Bb (Bb minor triad with F in bass)|
| Ab/G           | Ab   | major?     | G         | G Ab C (Ab major with G in bass → G Ab C) |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Eb/G           | Eb   | minor/dim? | G         | G Bb Eb                                |
| Eb/G           | Eb   | minor/dim? | G         | G Bb Eb                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Dbmaj7/F       | Db   | major 7    | F         | F Ab C Eb (Db major 7 = Db F Ab C → bass F) |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |

---

### Step 2: Identify tonic and key center

We see **Gdim** repeated many times — it's the most frequent chord. And the progression often cycles back to it. That strongly suggests **G is the tonic**.

But wait — is Gdim a major or minor key? Diminished chords are rarely *tonic* in major/minor keys unless it’s a leading tone chord.

In traditional harmony:

- The **leading tone chord** in a minor key is diminished (e.g., Bdim in C minor).
- In major keys, the VII chord is often a diminished triad (e.g., Bdim in C major).

So Gdim = **leading tone chord** → implying a **key based on A** (since G is the 7th of A).

Let’s test **A harmonic minor**:

- A harmonic minor scale: A B C D E F G#
- Chords on 7th degree: G#° — but we have **Gdim** (G Bb Db) — not G# B D.

That’s a problem. Gdim = G-Bb-Db — which is a **whole step below A**, not half step.

So **Gdim** as leading tone would require **A# as tonic**, which we don’t have.

---

Wait — let’s look at the **other chords**: **Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F**

Let’s look at the **bass note motion** — it might be more telling.

Bass notes in order:

**G — G — G — G — G — G — F — G — G — G — G — G — G — G — F — G**

So the bass is mostly G, but drops to **F** on two chords: **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F**

So two chords have **F** in the bass: **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F**

That strongly suggests **F** is being used as a pedal tone or bass anchor at points.

Let’s look at **Dbmaj7/F**:

- Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C
- With F in bass → F Ab C Db → this is **Fmaj7#11** or more likely **Db major in 2nd inversion** — but the notes **F, Ab, C, Db** are also the notes of:

### F altered dominant or F half-diminished 7? — No.

Let’s think differently.

What if we consider the **key center to be F**?

Let’s build **F harmonic minor**:

F G Ab Bb C Db E

Chords in F harmonic minor:

i: Fm  
ii°: G°  
III+: Ab aug  
iv: Bbm  
v: Cm  
VI: Db  
VII: E°

Wait — our chords:  
Gdim (G°) ✅  
Bbm ✅  
Ab/G → Ab major with G bass → Ab is VI  
Dbmaj7 ✅ → Db is VI in F harmonic minor?

But **Dbmaj7** is unusual — in F harmonic minor, VI is **Db major** — yes! That’s correct.

F harmonic minor key:

- Notes: F G Ab Bb C Db E  
- Chords:  
  i: Fm  
  ii°: G° ✅  
  III+: Ab+  
  iv: Bbm ✅  
  v: Cm  
  VI: Db ✅  
  VII°: E°

We have:  
→ Gdim (ii°) ✅  
→ Bbm (iv) ✅  
→ Ab (VI) — but we have **Ab/G**, meaning Ab major with G in bass → still Ab major triad  
→ Dbmaj7 (VI with major 7th) ✅ (Dbmaj7 is Db F Ab C — which are all in F harmonic minor scale!)  
→ Gdim again

**Bingo!**

**All chords are diatonic to F harmonic minor!**

Let’s map it:

| Chord        | Function in F Harmonic Minor | Notes              |
|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Gdim         | ii° (leading tone to iii)    | G Bb Db ✅         |
| Eb/G         | ??? Wait — Eb/G?             | G Bb Eb — this is a problem |

Wait — **Eb/G**? G Bb Eb = Eb minor triad with G in bass → **Eb minor** = Ebb? In F harmonic minor, Eb? Not in scale!

F harmonic minor: F G Ab Bb C Db E — **no Eb!**

So **Eb/G = G Bb Eb** → this is an **Eb minor triad (Eb G Bb)** — but with G in bass → G Bb Eb = same notes.

Is Eb in F harmonic minor? — **NO.**

F harmonic minor has: F G Ab Bb C Db E → no E natural, no Eb.

So Eb is **outside** the key.

But wait — **Eb/G = G Bb Eb** — that’s the same as **Bb minor 7 (no root)**? Not helpful.

Wait — what chord is G Bb Eb?

Notes: G Bb Eb = G diminished 7th without the D? No — Gdim is G Bb Db. This is **G Bb Eb** → that’s a **Bb minor triad in second inversion**, or **Ebsus4?** No.

Actually: **G Bb Eb = Eb minor with G in bass** — **Eb minor** = Eb G Bb → yes.

So **Eb minor** is the chord — but in F harmonic minor? Is Eb minor a diatonic chord?

F harmonic minor scale: F G Ab Bb C Db E → no Eb.

So this chord **Eb minor** is **not diatonic** to F harmonic minor.

But wait — could it be **Bb minor 7?** Bb D F Ab — no, we have G Bb Eb — that’s Eb minor (1st inversion) — G is the 5th?

Wait: **Eb minor** notes: Eb (root), G (3rd), Bb (5th).

So **Eb/G = G (5th), Bb (root), Eb (root?)** — no: if chord is Eb minor and bass is G, then G is the 3rd.

So chord **Eb/G = Eb minor with 3rd in bass** = 1st inversion.

But still — **Eb minor** is not in F harmonic minor.

Hmm. So contradiction?

Wait — **could Eb be a typo?** Is it possible it’s **E°**? But it's written Eb/G.

Let me check: **Bbm/F = F Ab Bb** — F is 5th of Bb minor? Wait, Bb minor = Bb Db F — so with F in bass → F Ab Bb is **Bb minor in first inversion**.

Okay.

What if the chord is **E°/G**? E G B — but we have Eb/G — written clearly as Eb.

Wait — maybe **Eb/G** is meant to be **E diminished?** Unlikely notation.

Alternative idea: **Is the key D minor?**

D minor: D E F G A Bb C

Chords:

i: Dm  
ii°: E°  
III: F  
iv: Gm  
v: Am  
VI: Bb  
VII: C

Do we have any of these? We have Gdim — not in D minor.

Gdim = G Bb Db — but in D minor, G is the 4th degree → Gm, not Gdim.

Nope.

---

Back to F harmonic minor. We have:

- Gdim ✅ ii°  
- Bbm ✅ iv  
- Dbmaj7 ✅ VI (major 7th is common in minor keys for color)  
- Ab — VI is Ab major → yes, diatonic  

But **Eb/G** — what if **Eb is actually D#?** No, written Eb.

Perhaps **Eb/G is a borrowed chord**.

Wait — **G Bb Eb** — let’s look at this as a chord: it's the same as **Bb minor 7?** No, Bb minor 7 = Bb Db F Ab — we have G Bb Eb.

G Bb Eb = **G diminished 5th chord?** No, diminished triad is root + m3 + m5 — G Bb Db would be Gdim.

G Bb Eb = G, Bb (m3), Eb (dim5 from G? G to Eb is diminished 5th? G to D# is aug5, G to Eb = diminished 5th? Let’s count:

G to Bb = minor 3rd  
G to Eb = diminished 5th? G to Eb = 6 half steps → G Ab A Bb B C Db D Eb — wait that's 8 half steps?

G = 0  
G# = 1  
A = 2  
A# = 3  
B = 4  
C = 5  
C# = 6  
D = 7  
D# = 8  
E = 9  
F = 10  
F# = 11  
G = 12

So Eb = 8 → from G=0, that’s **augmented 5th?**

Wait: G to Bb = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)  
G to Eb = 8 half steps — that’s **augmented 5th** (since perfect 5th is G to D = 7 half steps; G to D# = 8 = augmented 5th)

So G Bb Eb = **G minor with augmented 5th?** → **G+** (G augmented)!

Wait! G Bb Eb = G + Bb + Eb — that’s **G augmented triad**, not diminished!

Let me double-check:

- G to Bb: **minor 3rd**
- Bb to Eb: **minor 3rd**
- G to Eb: **diminished 5th?** Let's count: G→A→B→C→D→Eb: that’s 6 half steps? No.

G = 0  
G# = 1  
A = 2  
A# = 3  
B = 4  
C = 5  
C# = 6  
D = 7  
D# = 8  
E = 9  

Eb = 8? Wait — in equal temperament, **Eb = D#**.

But **G + Bb + Eb** → G to Eb = from G to D# = 8 half steps → that’s an **augmented 5th**.

And G to Bb = 3 = minor 3rd

So triad: root (G), minor 3rd, augmented 5th — that’s a **G augmented chord** (G+)

Ah! So **Eb/G** might be miswritten or misread — but **G Bb Eb is G augmented**, not Eb minor.

Wait — if the chord is labeled **Eb/G**, that suggests **Eb is root**, G is bass. So Eb - G - Bb = Eb minor.

But Eb to G is major 3rd (4 semitones), G to Bb is minor 3rd (3 semitones), Eb to Bb is perfect 5th → so **Eb minor triad**.

But **G Bb Eb** is **same as Eb G Bb**, so **Eb minor** with G in bass.

So chord symbol **Eb/G** = Eb minor chord, G in bass.

So chord is still Eb minor.

So now we have an **Eb minor chord** — which is **not in F harmonic minor**.

But… what if we think of **Eb minor** as **#iv in F harmonic minor?**

F harmonic minor: F G Ab Bb C Db E

#IV would be: B#? No.

Alternative: **What if the key is Bb minor?**

Bb harmonic minor: Bb C Db Eb F G C#

Wait — let’s list it:

Bb harmonic minor: Bb C Db Eb F G A# — not matching.

Wait — **Gdim appears often**, so perhaps **G is tonic** and we’re in G minor?

G minor scale: G A Bb C D Eb F

Ah! Here’s the key!

## G harmonic minor:

Notes: G A Bb C D Eb F♯ — wait, harmonic minor raises 7th → **F#**

But we have **F** and **Eb** — and **no F#**

G natural minor: G A Bb C D Eb F — yes! That’s **G natural minor**, not harmonic!

G natural minor = G A Bb C D Eb F

Now chords:

i: Gm  
ii°: A°  
III: Bb  
iv: Cm  
v: Dm  
VI: Eb  
VII: F

Our chords:

- Gdim — but in G natural minor, G is i = Gm, not Gdim. ❌

Wait — Gdim = G Bb Db — but Gm = G Bb D

We have Db, not D — so Gdim has Db, so **flat 5**, which is not natural minor.

So Gdim doesn't fit G natural minor either.

Wait — what if we use **G melodic minor descending?**

G melodic minor descending: G F Eb D C Bb A — same as G natural.

Still, Gm is G Bb D, not Gdim.

So **Gdim** — we need G, Bb, Db — that’s 7 notes below the root? No.

Gdim = function of **F# harmonic minor**?

F# harmonic minor: F# G# A B C# D E — VII° = E° — not Gdim.

I’m going back — let’s look at the **Dbmaj7/F** chord.

Dbmaj7/F = Db F Ab C with F in bass → F Ab C Db

That chord contains: **F, Ab, C, Db**

What key has those notes?

Let’s build a scale around F, Ab, Db.

F, Ab, Db = descending minor 3rds → F to Ab (m3), Ab to Db (m3) — this is a **diminished 7th chord**: F Ab Cb Ebb — no.

Wait: F Ab C Db — that’s **Dbmaj7 (Db F Ab C)** — so Db major 7th. The only thing is bass is F.

So Db major 7th chord with F in bass.

So Db root.

If Db is tonic, then key is Db major or Db minor.

Db major: Db Eb F G Ab Bb C (C? not in scale — Db major has Cb)

Db major: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb

But our chord has C natural! → **C natural** — so Db major doesn't work.

Db minor: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bbb Cb — also has Cb, not C.

But we have **C natural** — so **C is natural**, not Cb.

So **Db is not the tonic**.

But the chord **Dbmaj7** = Db F Ab C → notes: Db, F, Ab, C

List intervals: Db to F = M3, F to Ab = m3, Ab to C = M3 → so it's spelled Db – F – Ab – C — that’s **Dbmaj7**

But Db is **only** major if we have F##? No — F is natural.

Db major has F natural? Let's check:

Db major scale: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb → so F is natural ✅

And C in Db major? **Cb** (C flat), not C natural.

So **C natural is outside Db major.**

But Dbmaj7 has C natural — **that’s the 7th of Db major? NO — in Db major, the 7th is Cb**.

Therefore, **Dbmaj7 with C natural** is not diatonic to Db major — it’s **Db Lydian?** Db E F G A B C — too many changes.

Wait — Dbmaj7 with C natural = **Db major 7th with natural 7?** That’s impossible — in standard theory, the 7th must be Cb to be diatonic.

But in **modal mixture**, it might be borrowed.

Perhaps it's **C major** key?

C major: C D E F G A B — no Gdim or Db.

Not matching.

Let’s try another approach.

---

## Let’s look at the bass notes and root motion.

The pattern is mostly **Gdim**, with some **F** bass.

Chords where bass is not G:

- Eb/G → bass G  
- Bbm/F → bass F  
- Ab/G → bass G  
- Dbmaj7/F → bass F  

So the only two **non-G** bass notes: **F**

So **F** is a pivot.

Now, what chord is **Bbm/F**? F Ab Bb → F is 5th, so Bb minor.

What chord is **Dbmaj7/F**? F Ab C Db → F is 5th of Db? Db to F is major 6th → so F is major 6th of Db.

Actually, in Dbmaj7, the notes are Db F Ab C — so **F is the major 3rd**, Ab is 5th, C is 7th.

So F is the **3rd**, not 5th. Therefore, **Dbmaj7/F** = Db major 7th with 3rd in bass → **1st inversion**.

Similarly, **Bbm/F** = Bb minor with 5th in bass (F is 5th of Bb).

So we have:

- Chords with **F in bass**: Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F  
→ F = 5th of Bbm, and 3rd of Dbmaj7

Both chords have **F** in common.

And **Gdim** — which is G Bb Db

Look: **Gdim = G Bb Db**

**Bbm = Bb D F**

**Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C**

So common tone among Gdim, Bbm, Dbmaj7: **Bb** and **F**?

Let’s stack the triads:

- Gdim: G – Bb – Db  
- Bbm: Bb – D – F  
- Dbmaj7: Db – F – Ab – C

So Bb is in Gdim and Bbm. F is in Bbm and Dbmaj7.

It’s as if this is a **voice-leading progression**: Gdim → Bbm → Dbmaj7, and Bb moves to F, Db moves to Ab?

Wait — let’s try to hear this as a descending chromatic bass: G → F → Eb? But we have Eb/G → G in bass again.

Wait — maybe the key is **F minor**? We tried F harmonic.

Wait — let’s try **F Dorian** or something.

Too vague.

Let me consider a new idea.

What if the key is **Bb major**?

Bb major: Bb C D Eb F G A

Chords:

i: Bbm  
ii: Cm  
III: D°  
iv: Eb  
v: Fm  
VI: Gm  
VII: A°

We have Gdim — is Gdim diatonic? G is VI — Gm, not Gdim.

No.

Wait — we have **Bbm** — which is i in Bb major — good.

We have **Cb?** No.

Wait — we have **Db** — not in Bb major.

No.

---

## Breakthrough: Eb/G = G Bb Eb — G Bb = minor 3rd, Bb to Eb = perfect 4th? No.

Wait — **G Bb Eb** = Let’s invert it.

Move G to top: Bb Eb G → that’s **Bb minor 7th chord without 5th?** No — Bb – Eb – G = Bb (root), Eb (4th), G (6th?).

Not working.

Wait — **Eb/G = G Bb Eb** — what if it’s **E diminished 7th**? E G B D — no.

Here’s the insight: **G Bb Db = Gdim**, we have that.

**G Bb Eb = ?**

G to Bb = m3

Bb to Eb = m3

Therefore, **G Bb Eb** = **diminished 7th chord with root on Bb?** Bb D F Ab — no.

G Bb Eb — notes spaced in minor 3rds: G to Bb (3 semitones), Bb to Eb (4 semitones) — not equal.

Wait: G to Bb = 3 semitones  
Bb to Eb = 6 semitones — **G to Eb = 8 semitones** → which is **augmented 5th**

So **G Bb Eb = G augmented chord** (G+)

And **G+ is G, Bb, E#** — but it's spelled as Eb, not E# — so enharmonic.

So in equal temperament, **G+ = G Bb Eb**.

So perhaps every **Eb/G** is meant to be **G augmented**, not Eb minor.

In that case, we can reinterpret:

### Reinterpreted chords with G+ (G augmented) instead of Eb/G:

| Chord          | Correct interpretation | Notes         | Notes in key? |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| G+             | G+                     | G Bb E# (Eb)  |               |
| G+             | G+                     | G Bb Eb       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Bbm            | Bb minor               | Bb D F        |               |
| Ab/G           | Ab with G bass         | G Ab C        |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| G+             | G+                     | G Bb Eb       |               |
| G+             | G+                     | G Bb Eb       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Dbmaj7/F       | Dbmaj7 with F bass     | F Ab C Db     |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |

Now — **G° and G+** in the same progression? That’s unusual but possible in augmented harmony or chromatic.

Let’s try to find a **key that includes G°, G+, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7**

G° = G Bb Db  
G+ = G Bb E# = G Bb Eb  
Bbm = Bb D F  
Ab = A Bb C  
Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C

Let’s take all unique notes:

- G, Bb, Db, Eb, D, F, A, C

So notes: A, C, D, F, G, Bb, Db, Eb

That’s 8 notes.

Now build a scale from F: F G A Bb C D Eb Db — wait, Db is B#? No.

F A Bb Db Eb C D — doesn’t form a scale.

Too many accidentals.

Try: **Ab major**?

Ab: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Notes: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G — that’s **7 notes**.

Our chords:

- Gdim: G Bb Db — all in Ab major ✅  
- G+: G Bb E# — but Eb ≠ E# — here we have **Eb**, not E#  
So G Bb Eb = G Bb Eb — in Ab major, we have **Eb**, not D# — so G Bb Eb = G Bb + Eb — Eb is 6th of Ab — not raised.

G is the 7th degree of Ab major — which is **Bb?** Let’s see:

Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Degrees:
1. Ab  
2. Bb  
3. C  
4. Db  
5. Eb  
6. F  
7. G

So G is the leading tone — chord on VII: **G7?** But it's a **major 7th chord?** No — in major key, VII° is diminished.

G Bb Db — **Gdim** ✅ — perfect — diatonic VII° in Ab major.

Now G+ = G Bb E# — but in Ab major, the note above G is Ab — not E#. We have Eb, not E#.

So G Bb Eb = G Bb + Eb — Eb is the 5th of the key.

So G Bb Eb = G (root) Bb (m3) Eb (aug5? — no, G to Eb is **diminished 5th**? G to D = 7 semitones, G to Eb = 8 semitones — **augmented 5th**)

But in Ab major, there is **no E#**, only Eb.

So G Bb Eb is not diatonic — but it’s very close: **G Bb and Eb** — Eb is the 5th degree of Ab, but the chord is G Bb Eb = **Gb major?** No.

Wait — perhaps the **Ab major** scale **does include Gdim**, and **Bbm?**

In Ab major: Bbm is not diatonic — Bb is II, so Bb minor? In major key, II is minor — yes!

In Ab major:

- I: Ab  
- II: Bbm  
- III: C°  
- IV: Db  
- V: Eb  
- VI: F  
- VII: G°

We have ALL of the following:

- Gdim ✅ (VII°)  
- Bbm ✅ (II°)  
- Ab/G → Ab major with G in bass → Ab major (VI?) wait — Ab is I

Ab/G = bass G, chord Ab — so G Ab C → G is 7th, Ab is root — so Ab major in 3rd inversion?

But chord symbol Ab/G → chord is Ab major, bass G — possible.

- Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th? Db is IV — in Ab major, IV is Db → so Dbmaj7? We usually don’t have major 7th on IV in major keys, but it can be borrowed.

Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C

In Ab major, F is VI, Ab is I.

Dbmaj7 has notes Db F Ab C — which are **IV, VI, I, VII** — all diatonic! Because Ab major has:

Db = IV  
F = VI  
Ab = I  
C = III

So.Dbmaj7 is composed of notes: Db (IV), F (VI), Ab (I), C (III) — so it’s just **a quartal or tertian chord made from scale tones** — perfect.

And **Eb/G** — if it’s meant to be **G+ = G Bb Eb**, and Eb is the V in Ab major — and G Bb Eb = G + Eb — with Eb = 5th degree.

Is G Bb Eb in Ab major? G = VII, Bb = II, Eb = V — all scale tones.

So the chord G Bb Eb is built on G, with Bb and Eb — which are the 2nd and 5th degrees — so it’s **a G diminished chord with a raised 5th?** No, Eb is flattened 5th.

But Eb is a **diatonic tone**.

So perhaps **Eb/G** is meant to be **G, Bb, Eb — with Bb = m3, Eb = dim5** — but Eb is the 5th degree, which is natural, and G to Eb is **diminished 5th (8 semitones)** — yes! So **Gdim** is G Bb Db — but here it’s G Bb Eb — **that’s not Gdim, it’s G+?**

Wait — G to Eb = 8 semitones = **augmented 5th** (since perfect 5th = 7)

So **G Bb Eb = G augmented triad**.

But in Ab major, the only augmented chord is **C+** on III if we raise the 5th, but we don’t have an augmented chord naturally.

This is a stretch.

Perhaps **Eb/G** is a **mistake**, and it was meant to be **Db/G**?

Db/G = G Bb Db — Gdim. But we already have Gdim.

We already have 2 Gdim, then Eb/G — likely **not** meant to be Gdim again.

Perhaps the composer is using **G minor** with borrowed chords.

Let me consider **G minor** with **modal mixture** from Ab major? Too vague.

---

## Best solution: The key is **Ab major**

Because:

- Gdim is **VII°** — standard in major keys ✅  
- Bbm is **II°** — minor ii in major key ✅  
- Ab major chord ✅  
- Dbmaj7: Db (IV), F (VI), Ab (I), C (III) — all diatonic → so Dbmaj7 is a **major 7th** version of IV — common in jazz/pop for modal flavor ✅  
- Eb/G — if we take it as G Bb Eb — G is VII, Bb is II, Eb is V — so this is a **rootless chord** or **inversion** — but it's an **augmented sonority** — possible chromatic passing chord or borrowed.

In fact, in Ab major, the chord **Bb minor 7** = Bb D F Ab — and if we have **Bbm/F**, that's fine.

So with **E natural or E#** we don’t have — but we have **Eb**, which is diatonic.

So **G Bb Eb = G, Bb, Eb**:  
- G = VII  
- Bb = II  
- Eb = V

All are **scale tones**.

The chord G Bb Eb can be interpreted as **an F half-diminished 7th without the 5th?** F - A - C - Eb → we have G Bb Eb — no.

Another way: G Bb Eb = **Ebsus4(11)?** No.

Actually, **G Bb Eb** = **E-flat major with G in bass** — which is Eb major triad, G = major 3rd — so **Eb major in 1st inversion**.

And **Eb is the dominant of Ab** → so **Eb = V** in Ab major — so **Eb major** chord? But in Ab major, the V chord is **Eb minor**!

Ab major → V = Ebm.

So **Eb major** would be a **borrowed major V** from Ab minor.

Ah! **That’s it!**

### Therefore, we are in **Ab major**, but borrowing the **major V chord** from Ab minor — which is **Ebm → Eb**.

So:

- Gdim = Ab major’s VII° ✅  
- Bbm = Ab major’s II° ✅  
- **Eb = borrowed from Ab minor (V)** ✅  
- Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7 in Ab — common jazz extension ✅  
- Ab/G = Ab major with G in bass — G is the leading tone, so it’s a **chromatic passing bass** or **inversion for voice leading** ✅  

And the progression is:

**Gdim (VII°) — Eb/G (V maj, borrowed) — Gdim — Bbm/F (II° with 5th bass) — Ab/G (I with leading tone bass) — Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7 with 3rd bass) — Gdim**

This is a very plausible, jazzy, chromatic progression in **Ab major** with modal mixture (borrowed V major).

The **Eb/G** is **Eb major with G in bass** — Eb = V, G = 3rd of Eb, so it’s strong voice leading.

And Dbmaj7/F — F = 3rd of Db, Db = IV → so **moving from V (Eb) to IVmaj7 (Db)** with chromatic step — Eb → Db.

Perfect!

## ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: Ab major**  
> **Mode: Major (Ionian)**, with **modal mixture** (borrowing the major V chord from Ab minor for color)

### Why?
- All chords use notes from the Ab major scale, except **Eb** (V chord) which is major instead of Ebm — a borrowed chord from **Ab minor**.
- Gdim is the diatonic leading tone chord (VII°) — the most frequent, acting as a color tone or passing chord.
- The bass motion (G–F–G–F) and chord progression suggest a strong pull toward Ab, and Dbmaj7 is a jazz-friendly IV chord.
- The progression is not strictly diatonic but is **diatonically anchored in Ab major** with chromatic embellishment.

This is a rich, jazzy, colorful progression **centered in Ab major** — common in film, jazz pop, or modern harmony.

### ✅ Answer:
**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)** with **borrowed V chord (Eb major)** from Ab minor (modal mixture)

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

The chord progression you've provided is:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

Let’s analyze this step by step to determine the key and mode.

---

### Step 1: Look at the Chord Qualities and Common Tones

- **Gdim** = G–B♭–D♭ (or G–B♭–D♭–F♭ enharmonically = G–B♭–C♯–E)
- **Eb/G** = Eb major in first inversion = G–B♭–Eb
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ minor in second inversion = F–B♭–D♭
- **Ab/G** = A♭ major over G in the bass = G–A♭–C–E♭
- **Dbmaj7/F** = D♭ major 7 with F in the bass = F–A♭–C♭–E♭ (but C♭ = B, so spelled as F–A♭–B–E♭ enharmonically)

This last chord is unusual as written; **Dbmaj7** = D♭–F–A♭–C♭, which contains a **C♭** (enharmonic to B). But in the context of **F in the bass**, it's likely functioning as **F–A♭–C♭–E♭**.

But note: C♭ is awkward. In practice, many would respell Dbmaj7 as **C#maj7** if in a sharp key, but here we’re likely in a flat key.

---

### Step 2: Identify Possible Tonal Centers

We see a strong recurrence of **Gdim**, and many chords contain **G in the bass** or share common tones with Gdim.

- **Gdim** = G–B♭–D♭
- **Eb/G** = G–B♭–E♭ → shares G and B♭ with Gdim
- **Bbm/F** = F–B♭–D♭ → shares B♭ and D♭
- **Ab/G** = G–A♭–C–E♭ → contains G in bass, but other notes are from A♭ major
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F–A♭–C♭–E♭ → all notes from D♭ major (or enharmonic C# major)

Also note that **Gdim** is a common chord in **E♭ minor** and **E♭ harmonic minor**, as it is the **#viio7** (or viio7 of the dominant).

Wait—let’s check **E♭ minor**:

- E♭ natural minor: E♭–F–G♭–A♭–B♭–C♭–D♭
- E♭ harmonic minor: E♭–F–G♭–A♭–B♭–C♭–**D♮**

But **Gdim = G–B♭–D♭**, which is not diatonic to E♭ minor (which has G♭, not G♮).

So perhaps the key is **E♭ major**?

E♭ major scale: E♭–F–G–A♭–B♭–C–D

Now, **Gdim = G–B♭–D♭** → includes **D♭**, which is **not in E♭ major** (E♭ major has D♮).

So Gdim is **not diatonic to E♭ major or minor**.

But **Gdim** is diatonic to **A♭ major**:

A♭ major: A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭–F–G

→ **Gdim = G–B♭–D♭** → yes! All notes are in A♭ major.

So **G° = vii° in A♭ major**.

Now check other chords:

- **Eb/G**: E♭ major = V in A♭ major → first inversion, fine.
- **Bbm/F**: B♭ minor = ii chord in A♭ major (ii = B♭m), and F in bass = second inversion → makes sense.
- **Ab/G**: A♭ major with G in bass – this is a **VII7 chord**, or more precisely, a **major chord over leading tone** – this is a **common cadential embellishment** in A♭ major: G is the leading tone, so Ab/G creates a strong pull to A♭.
- **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭maj7 = IVmaj7 in A♭ major (since IV = D♭), and F is the 3rd of D♭, so F in bass = first inversion → valid.

So **ALL chords are diatonic or functional within A♭ major**, except for one observation:

- **Gdim** appears constantly – which is the **vii° chord** in A♭ major – often used to lead to I (A♭) or to substitute for V.

But wait: The progression **never actually resolves to A♭**. It circles around Gdim and neighbors, but ends on **Gdim**.

However, that doesn’t mean the key isn’t A♭ – it may be avoiding the tonic for color or tension.

Also note that **Gdim** can be viewed as an **incomplete dominant**: in A♭, the V chord is E♭, and Gdim shares two notes with E♭7 (E♭7 = E♭–G–B♭–D♭ → remove root = G–B♭–D♭ = Gdim). So Gdim is often used as a **rootless E♭7**, functioning as dominant.

Thus, this progression is **centered around the dominant area of A♭ major**, using the **vii° chord (Gdim)** as a harmonic pedal or substitute.

---

### Step 3: Consider Mode

Since all chords fit within **A♭ major** (no accidentals outside the key), and the harmonies are functional (ii, V, IV, vii°, etc.), the **mode is Ionian** (i.e., **major**).

There’s no consistent use of modal mixture or modal interchange that would suggest Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.

---

### Conclusion:

**Key: A♭ major**  
**Mode: Ionian (Major)**

Even though the tonic A♭ is not explicitly stated as a chord (except possibly implied in Ab/G), the harmonic material is entirely derived from A♭ major, and Gdim functions as the leading-tone diminished chord resolving (or pulling toward) A♭.

So the key is **A♭ major**.

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's get into the weeds a bit. This is a jazz/gospel progression, and the bassline is as important as the chord symbols. We'll use John A. Kent’s *Almanac for Musicians* system (based on Bud Powell, Bill Evans, and Nat Cole voicings) to label what we hear.

We're in the “country” of G, but not the key signature of G major. This passage sits on the ♭3 of the key (B♭) the whole time; the mode is the parallel Dorian built on that pitch—whatever key-signature you may write, the listener hears “B♭ Dorian with a back-door leading tone (A♮).”

**TONIC (home) = G♭ (enharmonic F♯)**

Any time you see the falsetto motion G♭–G♭m–E♭/G–G♭m you can be sure you are hearing chromatic inflection of the Ab-7 / Db7 / Gbmaj cadence—i.e. a ii–V–I in Gb.

Therefore:

**GROUND KEY**………………… G♭ major  
**MODAL AREA** (local tonic)… B♭ Dorian (ear center)

Chord-by-chord functional label:

1. Gdim (A♭–B–D♭–F)……………iiØ7 in Gb (A♭Ø7 **V** of B♭ Dorian)  
2. Gdim (repeat)…………………same  
3. E♭/G (E♭ triad with G in bass)…IV in Gb, or “backwards” I of relative minor (E♭major heard over the local B♭)  
4. E♭/G (repeat)…………………same  
5. Gdim……………………………iiØ7 again, setting up the B♭m-7 next door  
6. B♭m/F (B♭m triad = B♭–D♭–F)…tonic minor triad of the mode (B♭ Dorian)  
7. A♭/G……………………………chromatic slide of IVmaj7 down a semitone (Neighbour chord to the ii)  
8. Gdim……………………………iiØ7  
9. –14. repeat of the same ii–IV motion over F bass  

15. Dbmaj7/F (Db–F–Ab–C/F)……bVIImaj7 in Gb; here it sounds like a back-door cadence; in B♭ Dorian it is VImaj7 (sub-dominant)  

16. Gdim……………………………iiØ7 / house of the turnaround.

**Bottom line**  
- The piece never leaves the neighbourhood of G♭ (Ⅰ), but the melodic interest sits on the Ⅲrd degree of that key—B♭.  
- Functionally everything orbits B♭ as a modern “Dorian camp,” so you can safely tell a rhythm section:

“Key of G flat; vamp is II–V (Gdim7 – C7(#11)) landing on B♭ Dorian feel.”

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze the chord progression step by step:  

**Progression:**
```
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim
```

---

### Step 1: Identify possible tonal centers

You have a few key tonal hints here:

- **Eb major/G (i.e. Eb major in first inversion)** appears repeatedly — this strongly suggests **Eb major or Eb minor** as home key possibilities.

- **Dbmaj7/F** is the IVmaj7 chord (if in Ab major), or the **♭VIImaj7** chord if in Eb major (since Db is a whole step below Eb).

- **Bbm/F** is the ii chord in Ab major, or the **v chord** in Eb minor.

- **Ab/G** is an unusual chord — a rootless *Ab7/G* type (flat 7 chord with lowered bass). That could function as a **V7sus4 (Ab7)** resolving to Eb, or a passing chord toward Eb.

---

### Step 2: Interpret common-tone and resolution patterns

Notice the **Gdim** (G–Bb–Db) repeating everywhere:

- Gdim could function as a **leading-tone diminished chord** in **Ab major/minor** (leading to Ab).  
- But we don’t clearly *resolve* to Ab except through Ab/G (which is unusual).  
- Gdim also shares two notes (G and Bb) with **Eb/G**, so it may serve as a **chromatic neighbor chord** or a tension builder around Eb.

---

### Step 3: Test possible keys

Let’s test both **Eb major** and **Ab major** as candidates.

**If in Eb major:**
- Eb/G = I⁶  
- Bbm/F = v (from Eb minor, borrowed)  
- Ab/G = IV⁷ over G (with an unusual bass)  
- Dbmaj7/F = ♭VIImaj7⁶  
- Gdim = vii° of Ab (harmonic function serving as tension around IV or ♭VII)

**If in Ab major:**
- Eb/G = V⁶  
- Bbm/F = ii⁶  
- Dbmaj7/F = VImaj7⁶  
- Gdim would be vii°/ii (leading-tone dim to Bbm), which works sometimes  
- Ab/G = Imaj7sus/G or I chord with a chromatic bass

Eb major seems slightly more stable harmonically — its I chord (Eb major) recurs, and most of the other chords can be viewed as colorful borrowings or modal mixture chords.

---

### Step 4: Consider mode or tonal color

Given the frequent use of **bVII (Dbmaj7)** and **borrowed v (Bbm)**, this suggests a **mixolydian** or **modal interchange** flavor — Eb **mixolydian** is a sensible label (since Eb Mixolydian has Db and Bb minor would fit inside it).

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Likely key center:** Eb  
- **Likely mode:** **Mixolydian** (Eb major with lowered 7th, giving the Db chord and Bbm borrowings)
- **Functional characterization:** A modal Eb tonal center with chromatic and common-tone diminished colorings (Gdim providing tension around Eb).  

**Answer:**  
**Key: Eb**  
**Mode: Eb Mixolydian (with diminished color chords around G)**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or in minor keys, so I should look for clues about the key.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

1. Gdim

2. Gdim

3. Eb/G

4. Eb/G

5. Gdim

6. Gdim

7. Bbm/F

8. Ab/G

9. Gdim

10. Gdim

11. Eb/G

12. Eb/G

13. Gdim

14. Gdim

15. Dbmaj7/F

16. Gdim

Now, I see that Eb/G is written, which means an Eb major chord with a G in the bass. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb minor with F in the bass, and Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass, and Dbmaj7/F is Db major 7 with F in the bass.

Gdim is a diminished chord. Since it's written as Gdim, it's likely a diminished triad or a full diminished seventh? In common notation, Gdim usually means G diminished triad, but in context, it might imply a diminished seventh. I'll assume it's a diminished triad for now, but I might need to consider the seventh.

To find the key, I should look at the chords that are not diminished. We have Eb, Bbm, Ab, and Dbmaj7.

Eb major, Bb minor, Ab major, Db major. These are all flats, so probably a key with flats.

Let me think about the relationships. Eb, Ab, and Db are all major chords, and Bbm is minor.

In major keys, the I, IV, V are major, and ii, iii, vi are minor. In minor keys, i, iv, v are minor, but V is often major, and there might be other changes.

But here we have a mix, and diminished chords.

Gdim is repeated a lot. Gdim could be a leading tone chord in some key. For example, in Ab major, the vii° chord is Gdim. Similarly, in other keys.

Let me list the possible keys for Gdim as vii°.

If Gdim is vii°, then the tonic would be Ab. Because in Ab major, the leading tone is G, and vii° is Gdim.

In Ab minor, the leading tone is G, but in harmonic minor, the vii° is Gdim, but Ab minor has seven flats, which is uncommon, but possible.

But let's see the other chords: Eb, Bbm, Ab, Db.

If the key is Ab major, then:

- I: Ab

- IV: Db

- V: Eb

- vi: Bbm? In Ab major, the vi chord is Fm, not Bbm. Bbm would be the ii chord in Ab major? Let's see the scale of Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So chords:

- I: Ab

- ii: Bbm

- iii: Cm

- IV: Db

- V: Eb

- vi: Fm

- vii°: Gdim

So in Ab major, we have Bbm which is ii, Eb which is V, Db which is IV, and Gdim which is vii°. That matches perfectly.

We have Bbm/F, which is just Bbm with F bass, so it's still the ii chord.

We have Ab/G, which is Ab major with G bass. Ab is I, and G is the leading tone, so this is like a I chord with a dominant seventh? Ab/G would be Ab major with G in bass, which is similar to a V7 chord? Let's see: if we have Ab/G, that means notes G, Ab, C, Eb. That is actually the same as G7b9? G, B, D, F is G7, but here we have Ab, C, Eb which are Ab major, but with G bass, so the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. This is like a dominant seventh chord with a flat ninth? But G is the root, so it might be functioning as a G7 chord with alterations.

But in the context of Ab major, G7 would be the V7/V or something? Let's see.

In Ab major, the V chord is Eb, so G7 is not diatonic. G7 would be V7 of C, but C is not in Ab major.

Ab/G has notes G, Ab, C, Eb. If we think of G as root, then it has b9 (Ab), no third? Wait, for a G chord, the third should be B, but here we have Ab and C and Eb. So it's G, Ab, C, Eb. This is missing the third, so it's ambiguous. But since it's written as Ab/G, it might be implying a slash chord where the bass is G, and the chord is Ab major, so it's not necessarily a G chord.

In music theory, when we have a slash chord, the bass note is important for the harmonic function.

In this progression, we have Gdim frequently, and then Ab/G, which might be leading to something.

Also, we have Dbmaj7/F, which is Db major 7 with F bass, so notes F, Db, F, Ab, C? Dbmaj7 is Db F Ab C, and with F bass, so notes F, Db, Ab, C. This is like an F minor chord with major seventh? F, Ab, C is Fm, but with Db and C, so it's Fm with added Db and C? Not standard.

Perhaps it's functioning as a subdominant or something.

But back to the key. From the chords, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Db, all fit in Ab major, and Gdim is the vii°.

So Ab major seems likely.

But let's confirm the mode. Ab major is a major key, so mode is major.

But we have diminished chords used frequently, which is common in major keys as passing chords.

Now, let's look at the progression in sequence.

The progression starts with Gdim, then Eb/G, which is Eb with G bass. Eb/G has notes G, Eb, G, Bb? Eb major is Eb G Bb, so with G bass, it's still Eb major chord.

Similarly, later Bbm/F, which is Bbm with F bass, so notes F, Bb, Db, F? Bbm is Bb Db F, so with F bass, it's still Bbm chord.

Ab/G is Ab with G bass, notes G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F is Db F Ab C with F bass, so notes F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, in Ab major, the Gdim should resolve to Ab, but here it often goes to Eb/G or other chords.

Let's see the resolution: after Gdim, we have Eb/G, which is V chord with G bass? In Ab major, V is Eb, so Eb/G is still V, but with third in bass? Not sure.

Then after some Gdim, we have Bbm/F, which is ii chord, then Ab/G, which is I chord with leading tone in bass, so it might be a cadence.

Then again Gdim to Eb/G, and finally Dbmaj7/F to Gdim.

Dbmaj7 is IV in Ab major, and then to Gdim, which is vii°, which should resolve to I, but it ends on Gdim? That might be for tension, but let's see the overall.

Perhaps the key is Ab major, and the progression uses diatonic chords except for the slash chords which add color.

But let's see if all chords are diatonic in Ab major.

Gdim: notes G, Bb, Db? Gdim triad is G Bb Db, which is diatonic to Ab major because Ab major has G, Bb, Db? Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G, so notes G, Bb, Db are all in the scale, so Gdim is diatonic.

Eb: Eb G Bb, diatonic.

Bbm: Bb Db F, diatonic.

Ab: Ab C Eb, diatonic.

Db: Db F Ab, diatonic.

Dbmaj7: Db F Ab C, and C is in Ab major? Ab major has C natural? Yes, Ab major has C natural, so Dbmaj7 is Db F Ab C, and C is the major seventh, so it's diatonic because the seventh of Db is C, which is in key.

So all chords are diatonic to Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

Now, about the mode: since it's Ab major, the mode is Ionian, but in common parlance, we just say major.

So key: Ab major.

But let's confirm the first and last chords. It starts with Gdim and ends with Gdim. That might be unusual, but it's possible for a progression to end on a diminished chord for effect.

In terms of harmony, Gdim often leads to Ab, but here it doesn't resolve directly, but in the progression, it might be implying Ab.

We have Ab/G which is like I with leading tone bass, which emphasizes the tonic.

So I think Ab major is correct.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

So for the answer, I should say Key: Ab major.

But the question says "determine key and mode". Since it's major, mode is major.

Sometimes mode might refer to something else, but here it's clear.

So final answer.

The chord progression primarily uses chords diatonic to Ab major: Gdim (vii°), Eb (V), Bbm (ii), Ab (I), Db (IV), and Dbmaj7 (IVmaj7). The frequent use of Gdim, which is the leading tone chord in Ab major, reinforces this key. The progression starts and ends on Gdim, creating tension, but the harmonic context confirms Ab major as the tonic.

**Key:** Ab major  
**Mode:** Ionian (major)

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. List the chords with their likely interpretations**

- **Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ (F♭) — fully diminished 7th chord, symmetric.
- **Eb/G** = G Eb G B♭ — Eb major triad over G bass (Eb = E♭ G B♭), so this is Eb major in 1st inversion.
- **Bbm/F** = F B♭ D — B♭ major triad over F bass (B♭ = B♭ D F), so this is B♭ major in 2nd inversion.
- **Ab/G** = G Ab C Eb — Ab major triad over G bass (Ab = A♭ C E♭).
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F Db F Ab C — D♭maj7 in 3rd inversion (D♭ F A♭ C).

---

**2. Look for a tonal center**

The progression is:

Gdim – Eb/G – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Eb/G – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

So chords in root position (ignoring bass for function):

- Gdim (vii° of something)
- Eb (I or VI)
- Bb (IV or V)
- Ab (bVII or III)
- Dbmaj7 (bII or IV)

---

**3. Try key of C minor**

In C minor:
- Gdim = G B♭ D♭ F♭ (enharmonic to E) — that’s G°7 = vii°7 of C minor.
- Eb = III (relative major)
- Bb = VII in natural minor, but in harmonic minor Bb would be rare; but Bbm is not in C minor (Bbm = B♭ D♭ F) — Wait, Bbm is B♭ D♭ F, which is not in C minor natural/harmonic/melodic. So maybe not C minor.

---

**4. Try key of Ab major**

Ab major: chords: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.
- Gdim = vii° of Ab major
- Eb = V
- Bbm = ii
- Ab = I
- Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7

This fits well:
Gdim (vii°), Eb/G (V), Gdim (vii°), Bbm/F (ii), Ab/G (I with G bass), Gdim (vii°), Eb/G (V), Gdim (vii°), Dbmaj7/F (IV), Gdim (vii°).

Bass line: G in many chords, Gdim as a common-tone diminished.

---

**5. Mode**

Key = **A♭ major** (Ionian mode).  
No sign of minor tonic (Cm), so not Ab minor.

---

**6. Check the G bass pedal**

Yes, G is a pedal point in many chords:  
Gdim (G in bass), Eb/G (G in bass), Bbm/F (F bass), Ab/G (G bass), Dbmaj7/F (F bass), etc. So not entirely strict G pedal, but G is emphasized.

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{A\text{-flat major}}
\]

**Key:** A♭ major  
**Mode:** Ionian

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**
    *   **Input:** A sequence of chords: `Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim`
    *   **Task:** "Determine key and mode."

2.  **Initial Impression & First Pass Analysis:**
    *   The chords are a bit unusual. I see a lot of `Gdim`. This is a strong clue. `Gdim` (G-Bb-Db) is the leading-tone chord to Ab major.
    *   I see `Eb/G`. This is an Eb major triad in first inversion. The notes are G-Bb-Eb. This shares two notes (G and Bb) with the Gdim chord. This reinforces the idea that G is a important note, likely the leading tone.
    *   I see `Bbm/F`. This is a Bb minor triad in first inversion. The notes are F-Ab-Bb. This is the subdominant chord (iv) in the key of F minor, or the submediant chord (vi) in the key of Db major. It also contains Ab, which is the likely tonic.
    *   I see `Ab/G`. This is an Ab major triad with G in the bass. The notes are G-C-Ab. This is a very strong signal. It's an Ab major chord with its leading tone (G) in the bass. This is a classic "cadential 6/4" feel, or at least a very strong dominant preparation. It screams "Ab is the tonic."
    *   I see `Dbmaj7/F`. This is a Db major 7th chord in first inversion. The notes are F-Ab-Db-Db? No, F-Ab-Db-C. This is the subdominant chord (IV) in the key of Ab major. It contains Ab and C, the tonic and mediant of Ab major.

3.  **Synthesize the Clues - Form a Hypothesis:**
    *   **Hypothesis 1: Ab Major.**
        *   `Gdim` is the vii° chord (leading-tone chord). It resolves strongly to Ab.
        *   `Eb/G` is the V chord (Eb major) in first inversion. It also resolves strongly to Ab. The G in the bass is the leading tone.
        *   `Ab/G` is the I chord (Ab major) with the leading tone in the bass. This is a very strong tonic confirmation.
        *   `Dbmaj7/F` is the IV chord (Dbmaj7) in first inversion. It's a very common pre-dominant chord.
        *   `Bbm/F` is the vi chord (Bbm) in first inversion. This is also a common pre-dominant chord.
    *   **Hypothesis 2: F Minor.**
        *   `Gdim` could be seen as the vii°/III (leading to the mediant, Ab major). This is plausible but less common as a central chord.
        *   `Eb/G` would be the III chord (Ab major) with G in the bass. Again, plausible.
        *   `Bbm/F` is the iv chord (Bbm) in first inversion. This is a strong chord in F minor.
        *   `Ab/G` would be the III chord (Ab major) with G in the bass.
        *   `Dbmaj7/F` would be the VI chord (Dbmaj7) in first inversion.
        *   The problem with F minor is the lack of a strong Cm (iv) or Fm (i) or Eb (VII) or C (V). The pull feels overwhelmingly towards Ab, not F. The `Gdim` and `Eb/G` both point directly to Ab as the resolution point.

4.  **Refine the Hypothesis (Ab Major is the winner):**
    *   The progression seems to be built around a pull to Ab. The `Gdim` and `Eb/G` chords both function as dominants (or dominant preparations) for Ab.
    *   The presence of `Dbmaj7/F` (the IV chord) and `Bbm/F` (the vi chord) further solidifies the diatonic landscape of Ab major.
    *   The mode is Major. Why? Because the chords used (`Gdim`, `Eb`, `Ab`, `Dbmaj7`, `Bbm`) are all diatonic to the key of Ab major (except for the borrowed Bbm, which is very common). There's no indication of a lowered 6th or 7th scale degree that would define a minor mode (like F natural minor or F dorian). The entire harmonic language points to the major scale.

5.  **Structure the Answer:**

    *   **Start with a clear, direct answer.** "The key is **Ab Major**." This immediately satisfies the user's primary question.
    *   **Provide the "Why" - The Analysis.** This is the most important part. Break it down chord by chord or function by function.
        *   **The Tonic Center:** Explain *why* Ab is the tonic. Point to the `Ab/G` chord as the strongest evidence. Mention that it's the I chord with the leading tone in the bass.
        *   **The Dominant Function:** Explain how `Gdim` and `Eb/G` both act as dominant chords that pull to Ab.
            *   `Gdim` is the vii°7 chord (leading-tone chord). Explain its notes (G-Bb-Db) and how they all resolve up to the notes of an Ab major chord (Ab-C-Eb).
            *   `Eb/G` is the V chord (Eb major) in first inversion. Explain that the G in the bass is the leading tone.
        *   **The Pre-Dominant Function:** Explain the role of the other chords in setting up the dominant.
            *   `Dbmaj7/F` is the IV chord (subdominant).
            *   `Bbm/F` is the vi chord (submediant). Explain that while Bbm is diatonic, it also has a minor, "pre-dominant" feel.
    *   **Address the "Mode" part of the question.**
        *   State clearly: "The mode is **Major**."
        *   Explain why. The chords are derived from the Ab major scale. There are no altered scale degrees (like a Cb or Fb) that would suggest a minor mode (like F minor). The harmonic character is unambiguously major.
    *   **Provide a Summary Table.** This is a great way to visualize the information. List the chord, its function in Ab Major, and the notes. This makes the analysis very easy to follow.
        *   `Gdim` -> vii°7 -> G-Bb-Db
        *   `Eb/G` -> V6 -> G-Bb-Eb
        *   `Ab/G` -> I6 (with leading tone) -> G-Ab-C
        *   `Bbm/F` -> vi6 -> F-Ab-Bb
        *   `Dbmaj7/F` -> IVmaj7 6 -> F-Ab-C-Db
    *   **Add a concluding paragraph.** Summarize the findings. Mention that the progression creates a strong sense of tension and release centered around the Ab major chord, using a mix of dominant and pre-dominant chords. This adds a nice, polished finish to the explanation.

6.  **Final Review:** Read through the entire answer. Is it clear? Is it accurate? Does it directly answer the user's question? Is the tone helpful and informative? The structure looks good: direct answer, detailed analysis, summary, conclusion. The logic is sound and well-supported by the chord progression itself.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **Ab Major**.

Here is a detailed analysis of how this conclusion is reached:

### 1. Identifying the Tonic (The "Home" Chord)

The strongest clue is the chord **Ab/G**. This is an Ab major triad (Ab - C - Eb) with G in the bass. The note G is the leading tone to Ab. Placing the leading tone in the bass underneath the tonic chord is a very strong harmonic statement that firmly establishes **Ab as the tonic**.

### 2. Analyzing the Chord Functions in Ab Major

Let's break down each chord and its function within the key of Ab Major (Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G).

*   **Gdim (G - Bb - Db):** This is the **vii°7** chord of Ab Major. It's built on the leading tone (G) and its primary function is to create tension that resolves up to the tonic chord (Ab). Its notes all resolve up by a half step: G -> Ab, Bb -> C, Db -> Eb. This is a classic dominant function.

*   **Eb/G (G - Bb - Eb):** This is the **V6** chord (the dominant chord, Eb Major, in first inversion). Like the Gdim, its purpose is to lead strongly to the tonic (Ab). The G in the bass is the leading tone, reinforcing the pull towards Ab.

*   **Bbm/F (F - Ab - Bb):** This is the **vi6** chord (the submediant chord, Bb minor, in first inversion). In a major key, the vi chord is a common "pre-dominant" chord, often leading to the IV or V chord. It shares the tonic note (Ab) and helps move the progression forward.

*   **Ab/G (G - Ab - C):** As mentioned before, this is the **I chord** (Ab Major) with the leading tone (G) in the bass. This is the point of resolution.

*   **Dbmaj7/F (F - Ab - C - Db):** This is the **IVmaj7** chord (the subdominant chord, Db Major 7, in first inversion). This is another very strong pre-dominant chord that naturally leads to the dominant (Gdim or Eb).

### 3. Determining the Mode

The mode is **Major**.

The reasoning is straightforward:
1.  All the chords used are either diatonic to Ab Major or have a clear dominant function leading to Ab Major.
2.  The tonic chord is established as a **major** chord (Ab).
3.  There are no chords or notes suggesting a minor tonic (like an Fm chord or a consistent Cb). The entire harmonic language points to the major scale.

### Summary Table

| Chord | Notes | Function in Ab Major |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gdim** | G - Bb - Db | **vii°7** (Leading-tone chord) |
| **Eb/G** | G - Bb - Eb | **V6** (Dominant chord, 1st inversion) |
| **Ab/G** | G - Ab - C | **I** (Tonic chord with leading tone in bass) |
| **Bbm/F** | F - Ab - Bb | **vi6** (Submediant chord, 1st inversion) |
| **Dbmaj7/F** | F - Ab - C - Db | **IVmaj7** (Subdominant chord, 1st inversion) |

### Conclusion

The progression is built around a powerful pull to the Ab major chord. It uses a variety of dominant-function chords (`Gdim`, `Eb/G`) and pre-dominant chords (`Bbm/F`, `Dbmaj7/F`) to create and resolve tension, all centered on the tonic of **Ab Major**.

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking**

### Reasoning

**Assessing Chord Functions**

I'm now carefully examining the chord functions within this progression. I've begun dissecting the individual chords, paying close attention to their construction and potential roles. The G diminished chord is under the microscope. I'm also considering the Eb/G as a potential pivot.


**Considering Key Signatures**

Right now, I'm focusing on key signature possibilities. Considering the Gdim chord's role, I am leaning toward either Ab major or F minor, as the vii° in the progression. Analyzing the Eb/G chord, it could be a V/iii or a relative major V. The Bbm/F presents another challenge, as it is potentially pointing towards F as a key, or functioning within a different context.


**Identifying Potential Tonic**

I'm now weighing the likelihood of Ab major or F minor as the tonal center. The analysis shows each key is supported by specific chord function interpretations. I will be looking closely at how the chords resolve, considering the frequent motion to Eb/G to confirm my final analysis.


**Pinpointing Tonal Center**

The progression analysis is continuing. I've deduced the likely tonal center to be Ab major or F minor, with solid arguments for each. The consistent presence of the G diminished chord supports this conclusion. The chord's function as a leading tone diminished, or auxiliary chord, further reinforces my hypothesis.


**Finalizing Tonal Analysis**

I've determined that Ab major is the tonal center, confirmed by the chord functions. The analysis demonstrates a strong diatonic pull toward the I chord, with common jazz practices such as chromaticism. The Gdim acts as a leading tone, resolving to V, while the Dbmaj7/F confirms a perfect cadence. The mode is Ionian.




The provided chord progression strongly suggests a key center built around the chords $Eb$ (V), $Db$ (IV), $Bbm$ (ii), and utilizing the leading tone chord, $Gdim$ ($\text{vii}^\circ$).

**1. Analyze the Chords and Functions:**

*   **$Gdim$ (G - Bb - Db):** This is the diminished triad built on G. In the flat keys, this chord often functions as the **leading-tone triad ($\text{vii}^\circ$)** of $Ab$ Major (or $F$ Minor).
*   **$Eb/G$ (Eb Major):** This is the **Dominant chord ($\text{V}$) of $Ab$ Major**.
*   **$Bbm/F$ (Bb Minor):** This is the **Supertonic chord ($\text{ii}$) of $Ab$ Major** (or Subdominant chord ($\text{iv}$) of $F$ Minor).
*   **$Dbmaj7/F$ (Db Major 7):** This is the **Subdominant Major 7th chord ($\text{IVmaj7}$) of $Ab$ Major**.
*   **$Ab/G$ (Ab Major):** This is the **Tonic chord ($\text{I}$) of $Ab$ Major**.

**2. Determine the Key Center:**

The consistent use of $Gdim$ (the leading tone) resolving or moving toward the dominant ($Eb$) and the final progression ending on the subdominant ($\text{IV}$), $Dbmaj7$, points overwhelmingly to **Ab Major** as the tonic.

All the chords ($Ab, Bbm, Dbmaj7, Eb, Gdim$) are perfectly diatonic to $Ab$ Major (Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G).

**3. Determine the Mode:**

Since the dominant chord ($Eb$) is major, and the overall quality is derived from the established Major scale built on Ab, this is the standard major mode.

***

**Key:** Ab Major
**Mode:** Ionian (Major)

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

The provided chord progression is:

**Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Dbmaj7/F - Gdim**

To determine the key and mode, we need to analyze the chords, paying close attention to the frequently occurring harmonies and the dominant root movement.

### 1. Breakdown of Key Chords and Roots

* **G dim ($G, B\flat, D\flat$)**: A diminished triad. This chord is often found in minor keys or as a leading-tone chord (LTC).
    * If it's a vii° chord, it suggests the tonic is one half step higher ($A\flat, B, D\flat$, etc.).
* **Eb/G ($G, B\flat, E\flat$)**: An Eb major chord in first inversion (bass on G).
    * This chord is IV in $B\flat$ major, and VI in $G$ minor or $B\flat$ minor.
* **Bbm/F ($F, B\flat, D\flat$)**: A $B\flat$ minor chord in second inversion.
    * This suggests $B\flat$ minor.
* **Ab/G ($G, C, E\flat, A\flat$)**: This is an $A\flat$ major chord with a G in the bass. This creates a highly dissonant non-functional chord if viewed strictly as $A\flat/G$. **Howerver, given the context (Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F), the most likely interpretation of $A\flat/G$ in this mode is an altered dominant or a suspension/passing chord leading back to Gdim.**
* **Dbmaj7/F ($F, A\flat, C, D\flat$)**: A $D\flat$ major 7th chord in first inversion.
    * This chord is the VII chord in $E\flat$ harmonic minor, or the $IV$ chord in $A\flat$ major, or the $VI$ chord in $F$ minor.

### 2. Identifying Potential Tonic Centers

The most striking feature is the **overwhelming presence of Gdim** and the frequent use of chords derived from $B\flat$ or $E\flat$ major/minor.

#### Scenario A: G Minor/G Phrygian

* **Gdim ($G, B\flat, D\flat$)**: This is not the natural vii° of G minor ($F\sharp^\circ$). It uses $D\flat$ instead of $D$ and $B\flat$ instead of $B$.
* **Eb/G**: VI chord (Common in G natural minor/Aeolian).
* **Bbm/F**: Not a diatonic chord in G minor.
* **Dbmaj7/F**: Not a diatonic chord in G minor.

#### Scenario B: $B\flat$ Minor

* **Gdim ($G, B\flat, D\flat$)**: $D\flat$ is the subtonic, $B\flat$ is the tonic. $G$ is the submediant. This is not a diatonic chord, but is very close to the $V$ chord in $B\flat$ minor when inverted ($F, A\flat, C$).
* **Eb/G**: Subdominant (iv) in first inversion. ($E\flat, G, B\flat$). Diatonic.
* **Bbm/F**: Tonic (i) in second inversion. ($B\flat, D\flat, F$). Diatonic.
* **Dbmaj7/F**: Mediant (III) in first inversion. ($D\flat, F, A\flat, C$). Diatonic.

The diatonic chords of **$B\flat$ Natural Minor (Aeolian)** are: $B\flat m, C^\circ, D\flat, E\flat m, F m, G\flat, A\flat$.

Let's re-examine the given chords against $B\flat$ Minor:

| Chord | Function in $B\flat$ Minor | Diatonic? | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bbm/F** | **i** (Tonic) | Yes | Strong indicator of $B\flat$ minor. |
| **Eb/G** | iv Major?! | No ($E\flat$ minor is iv) | This chord introduces $G$ and $B\flat$ but uses an $E\flat$ major triad. This suggests the parallel major or a modal mixture. |
| **Gdim** | Non-diatonic | No | $G, B\flat, D\flat$. This chord uses notes from $B\flat$ minor ($G, B\flat, D\flat$). The structure is $vi - i - III$. |
| **Dbmaj7/F** | III Major 7 | Yes (A\flat is Ab maj) | F, Ab, C, Db - Diatonic to $B\flat$ minor. |

The music is centered heavily on the notes $B\flat, D\flat, F$ (Tonic), $E\flat$ and $G$.

### 3. The Power of the G Diminished Chord

The chord that dominates the progression is **Gdim**. In film scoring and modal music, a diminished triad built on the **submediant (VI)** is a common signature of **Phrygian or Minor mode** mixed with elements of the $V$ function (often the Neapolitan or the altered dominant).

Let's revisit the notes used by the entire progression:
$G, B\flat, D\flat, E\flat, F, A\flat, C$ (from $D\flat maj7$).

This collection of notes ($B\flat, C, D\flat, E\flat, F, G, A\flat$) is the scale of **$B\flat$ Natural Minor (Aeolian)**.

The only chord that seems to break the diatonic pattern is $E\flat/G$ (iv in $B\flat$ Aeolian should be $E\flat m$). However, in non-classical composition, switching $E\flat m$ to $E\flat$ is a common modal interchange, borrowing the subdominant from $B\flat$ Major.

Now, let's understand the repeated use of **Gdim**:

$G$ is the VI degree of $B\flat$ minor. The use of $D\flat$ implies a relationship to $D\flat$ major (III).

In $B\flat$ minor, the ii° chord is $C^\circ$ ($C, E\flat, G\flat$), and the iv chord is $E\flat m$.

The progression reads like a sequence of non-functional or slowly moving harmonic blocks surrounding the tonic ($B\flat m/F$) and III ($D\flat maj7$).

* **Gdim** acts as a haunting, suspended harmony, based on the VI degree ($G$).
* The harmonic rhythm suggests $B\flat$ minor as the tonic, but the use of the submediant ($G$) as the root of the dominant chord, and the presence of $E\flat$ major (borrowed from $B\flat$ Major), points toward a mixture of minor and major modes around $B\flat$.

### Conclusion on Key and Mode

1. **Tonic:** The presence of $B\flat$ minor (Bbm/F) and the collection of accidentals strongly center the tonality around **$B\flat$**.
2. **Mode:** The primary scale used is **$B\flat$ Natural Minor (Aeolian)** ($B\flat, C, D\flat, E\flat, F, G, A\flat$).
3. **Modal Interchange:** The use of $E\flat$ Major (Eb/G) borrows the Subdominant from the parallel major ($B\flat$ Major), slightly weakening the pure Aeolian sound but fitting comfortably within a minor key context.

The constant repetition of Gdim (a chord built on the VI degree) provides the specific dark, suspended quality characteristic of this progression, typical of film scores.

**KEY AND MODE:** **B-flat Minor (Aeolian)**

*(Note: While the use of Gdim is complex—it is the vii° of $A\flat$ minor—its context alongside Bbm and D flat major resolves it as a chromaticized chord within the B-flat minor environment, functioning as a non-diatonic suspension built on VI)*
