To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

```
Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim
```

Let’s analyze it step by step.

---

### Step 1: List and interpret the chords

We'll rewrite each chord in root position for easier analysis (but keep the bass notes as given, since they may imply inversion or a bass motion).

| Chord          | Root | Type       | Bass Note | Notes (approx.)                        |
|----------------|------|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Eb/G           | Eb   | minor?/dim?| G         | G Bb Eb (likely Eb minor with G in bass)|
| Eb/G           | Eb   | minor/dim? | G         | G Bb Eb                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Bbm/F          | Bb   | minor      | F         | F Ab Bb (Bb minor triad with F in bass)|
| Ab/G           | Ab   | major?     | G         | G Ab C (Ab major with G in bass → G Ab C) |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Eb/G           | Eb   | minor/dim? | G         | G Bb Eb                                |
| Eb/G           | Eb   | minor/dim? | G         | G Bb Eb                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |
| Dbmaj7/F       | Db   | major 7    | F         | F Ab C Eb (Db major 7 = Db F Ab C → bass F) |
| Gdim           | G    | diminished | G         | G Bb Db                                |

---

### Step 2: Identify tonic and key center

We see **Gdim** repeated many times — it's the most frequent chord. And the progression often cycles back to it. That strongly suggests **G is the tonic**.

But wait — is Gdim a major or minor key? Diminished chords are rarely *tonic* in major/minor keys unless it’s a leading tone chord.

In traditional harmony:

- The **leading tone chord** in a minor key is diminished (e.g., Bdim in C minor).
- In major keys, the VII chord is often a diminished triad (e.g., Bdim in C major).

So Gdim = **leading tone chord** → implying a **key based on A** (since G is the 7th of A).

Let’s test **A harmonic minor**:

- A harmonic minor scale: A B C D E F G#
- Chords on 7th degree: G#° — but we have **Gdim** (G Bb Db) — not G# B D.

That’s a problem. Gdim = G-Bb-Db — which is a **whole step below A**, not half step.

So **Gdim** as leading tone would require **A# as tonic**, which we don’t have.

---

Wait — let’s look at the **other chords**: **Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F**

Let’s look at the **bass note motion** — it might be more telling.

Bass notes in order:

**G — G — G — G — G — G — F — G — G — G — G — G — G — G — F — G**

So the bass is mostly G, but drops to **F** on two chords: **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F**

So two chords have **F** in the bass: **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F**

That strongly suggests **F** is being used as a pedal tone or bass anchor at points.

Let’s look at **Dbmaj7/F**:

- Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C
- With F in bass → F Ab C Db → this is **Fmaj7#11** or more likely **Db major in 2nd inversion** — but the notes **F, Ab, C, Db** are also the notes of:

### F altered dominant or F half-diminished 7? — No.

Let’s think differently.

What if we consider the **key center to be F**?

Let’s build **F harmonic minor**:

F G Ab Bb C Db E

Chords in F harmonic minor:

i: Fm  
ii°: G°  
III+: Ab aug  
iv: Bbm  
v: Cm  
VI: Db  
VII: E°

Wait — our chords:  
Gdim (G°) ✅  
Bbm ✅  
Ab/G → Ab major with G bass → Ab is VI  
Dbmaj7 ✅ → Db is VI in F harmonic minor?

But **Dbmaj7** is unusual — in F harmonic minor, VI is **Db major** — yes! That’s correct.

F harmonic minor key:

- Notes: F G Ab Bb C Db E  
- Chords:  
  i: Fm  
  ii°: G° ✅  
  III+: Ab+  
  iv: Bbm ✅  
  v: Cm  
  VI: Db ✅  
  VII°: E°

We have:  
→ Gdim (ii°) ✅  
→ Bbm (iv) ✅  
→ Ab (VI) — but we have **Ab/G**, meaning Ab major with G in bass → still Ab major triad  
→ Dbmaj7 (VI with major 7th) ✅ (Dbmaj7 is Db F Ab C — which are all in F harmonic minor scale!)  
→ Gdim again

**Bingo!**

**All chords are diatonic to F harmonic minor!**

Let’s map it:

| Chord        | Function in F Harmonic Minor | Notes              |
|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Gdim         | ii° (leading tone to iii)    | G Bb Db ✅         |
| Eb/G         | ??? Wait — Eb/G?             | G Bb Eb — this is a problem |

Wait — **Eb/G**? G Bb Eb = Eb minor triad with G in bass → **Eb minor** = Ebb? In F harmonic minor, Eb? Not in scale!

F harmonic minor: F G Ab Bb C Db E — **no Eb!**

So **Eb/G = G Bb Eb** → this is an **Eb minor triad (Eb G Bb)** — but with G in bass → G Bb Eb = same notes.

Is Eb in F harmonic minor? — **NO.**

F harmonic minor has: F G Ab Bb C Db E → no E natural, no Eb.

So Eb is **outside** the key.

But wait — **Eb/G = G Bb Eb** — that’s the same as **Bb minor 7 (no root)**? Not helpful.

Wait — what chord is G Bb Eb?

Notes: G Bb Eb = G diminished 7th without the D? No — Gdim is G Bb Db. This is **G Bb Eb** → that’s a **Bb minor triad in second inversion**, or **Ebsus4?** No.

Actually: **G Bb Eb = Eb minor with G in bass** — **Eb minor** = Eb G Bb → yes.

So **Eb minor** is the chord — but in F harmonic minor? Is Eb minor a diatonic chord?

F harmonic minor scale: F G Ab Bb C Db E → no Eb.

So this chord **Eb minor** is **not diatonic** to F harmonic minor.

But wait — could it be **Bb minor 7?** Bb D F Ab — no, we have G Bb Eb — that’s Eb minor (1st inversion) — G is the 5th?

Wait: **Eb minor** notes: Eb (root), G (3rd), Bb (5th).

So **Eb/G = G (5th), Bb (root), Eb (root?)** — no: if chord is Eb minor and bass is G, then G is the 3rd.

So chord **Eb/G = Eb minor with 3rd in bass** = 1st inversion.

But still — **Eb minor** is not in F harmonic minor.

Hmm. So contradiction?

Wait — **could Eb be a typo?** Is it possible it’s **E°**? But it's written Eb/G.

Let me check: **Bbm/F = F Ab Bb** — F is 5th of Bb minor? Wait, Bb minor = Bb Db F — so with F in bass → F Ab Bb is **Bb minor in first inversion**.

Okay.

What if the chord is **E°/G**? E G B — but we have Eb/G — written clearly as Eb.

Wait — maybe **Eb/G** is meant to be **E diminished?** Unlikely notation.

Alternative idea: **Is the key D minor?**

D minor: D E F G A Bb C

Chords:

i: Dm  
ii°: E°  
III: F  
iv: Gm  
v: Am  
VI: Bb  
VII: C

Do we have any of these? We have Gdim — not in D minor.

Gdim = G Bb Db — but in D minor, G is the 4th degree → Gm, not Gdim.

Nope.

---

Back to F harmonic minor. We have:

- Gdim ✅ ii°  
- Bbm ✅ iv  
- Dbmaj7 ✅ VI (major 7th is common in minor keys for color)  
- Ab — VI is Ab major → yes, diatonic  

But **Eb/G** — what if **Eb is actually D#?** No, written Eb.

Perhaps **Eb/G is a borrowed chord**.

Wait — **G Bb Eb** — let’s look at this as a chord: it's the same as **Bb minor 7?** No, Bb minor 7 = Bb Db F Ab — we have G Bb Eb.

G Bb Eb = **G diminished 5th chord?** No, diminished triad is root + m3 + m5 — G Bb Db would be Gdim.

G Bb Eb = G, Bb (m3), Eb (dim5 from G? G to Eb is diminished 5th? G to D# is aug5, G to Eb = diminished 5th? Let’s count:

G to Bb = minor 3rd  
G to Eb = diminished 5th? G to Eb = 6 half steps → G Ab A Bb B C Db D Eb — wait that's 8 half steps?

G = 0  
G# = 1  
A = 2  
A# = 3  
B = 4  
C = 5  
C# = 6  
D = 7  
D# = 8  
E = 9  
F = 10  
F# = 11  
G = 12

So Eb = 8 → from G=0, that’s **augmented 5th?**

Wait: G to Bb = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)  
G to Eb = 8 half steps — that’s **augmented 5th** (since perfect 5th is G to D = 7 half steps; G to D# = 8 = augmented 5th)

So G Bb Eb = **G minor with augmented 5th?** → **G+** (G augmented)!

Wait! G Bb Eb = G + Bb + Eb — that’s **G augmented triad**, not diminished!

Let me double-check:

- G to Bb: **minor 3rd**
- Bb to Eb: **minor 3rd**
- G to Eb: **diminished 5th?** Let's count: G→A→B→C→D→Eb: that’s 6 half steps? No.

G = 0  
G# = 1  
A = 2  
A# = 3  
B = 4  
C = 5  
C# = 6  
D = 7  
D# = 8  
E = 9  

Eb = 8? Wait — in equal temperament, **Eb = D#**.

But **G + Bb + Eb** → G to Eb = from G to D# = 8 half steps → that’s an **augmented 5th**.

And G to Bb = 3 = minor 3rd

So triad: root (G), minor 3rd, augmented 5th — that’s a **G augmented chord** (G+)

Ah! So **Eb/G** might be miswritten or misread — but **G Bb Eb is G augmented**, not Eb minor.

Wait — if the chord is labeled **Eb/G**, that suggests **Eb is root**, G is bass. So Eb - G - Bb = Eb minor.

But Eb to G is major 3rd (4 semitones), G to Bb is minor 3rd (3 semitones), Eb to Bb is perfect 5th → so **Eb minor triad**.

But **G Bb Eb** is **same as Eb G Bb**, so **Eb minor** with G in bass.

So chord symbol **Eb/G** = Eb minor chord, G in bass.

So chord is still Eb minor.

So now we have an **Eb minor chord** — which is **not in F harmonic minor**.

But… what if we think of **Eb minor** as **#iv in F harmonic minor?**

F harmonic minor: F G Ab Bb C Db E

#IV would be: B#? No.

Alternative: **What if the key is Bb minor?**

Bb harmonic minor: Bb C Db Eb F G C#

Wait — let’s list it:

Bb harmonic minor: Bb C Db Eb F G A# — not matching.

Wait — **Gdim appears often**, so perhaps **G is tonic** and we’re in G minor?

G minor scale: G A Bb C D Eb F

Ah! Here’s the key!

## G harmonic minor:

Notes: G A Bb C D Eb F♯ — wait, harmonic minor raises 7th → **F#**

But we have **F** and **Eb** — and **no F#**

G natural minor: G A Bb C D Eb F — yes! That’s **G natural minor**, not harmonic!

G natural minor = G A Bb C D Eb F

Now chords:

i: Gm  
ii°: A°  
III: Bb  
iv: Cm  
v: Dm  
VI: Eb  
VII: F

Our chords:

- Gdim — but in G natural minor, G is i = Gm, not Gdim. ❌

Wait — Gdim = G Bb Db — but Gm = G Bb D

We have Db, not D — so Gdim has Db, so **flat 5**, which is not natural minor.

So Gdim doesn't fit G natural minor either.

Wait — what if we use **G melodic minor descending?**

G melodic minor descending: G F Eb D C Bb A — same as G natural.

Still, Gm is G Bb D, not Gdim.

So **Gdim** — we need G, Bb, Db — that’s 7 notes below the root? No.

Gdim = function of **F# harmonic minor**?

F# harmonic minor: F# G# A B C# D E — VII° = E° — not Gdim.

I’m going back — let’s look at the **Dbmaj7/F** chord.

Dbmaj7/F = Db F Ab C with F in bass → F Ab C Db

That chord contains: **F, Ab, C, Db**

What key has those notes?

Let’s build a scale around F, Ab, Db.

F, Ab, Db = descending minor 3rds → F to Ab (m3), Ab to Db (m3) — this is a **diminished 7th chord**: F Ab Cb Ebb — no.

Wait: F Ab C Db — that’s **Dbmaj7 (Db F Ab C)** — so Db major 7th. The only thing is bass is F.

So Db major 7th chord with F in bass.

So Db root.

If Db is tonic, then key is Db major or Db minor.

Db major: Db Eb F G Ab Bb C (C? not in scale — Db major has Cb)

Db major: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb

But our chord has C natural! → **C natural** — so Db major doesn't work.

Db minor: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bbb Cb — also has Cb, not C.

But we have **C natural** — so **C is natural**, not Cb.

So **Db is not the tonic**.

But the chord **Dbmaj7** = Db F Ab C → notes: Db, F, Ab, C

List intervals: Db to F = M3, F to Ab = m3, Ab to C = M3 → so it's spelled Db – F – Ab – C — that’s **Dbmaj7**

But Db is **only** major if we have F##? No — F is natural.

Db major has F natural? Let's check:

Db major scale: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb → so F is natural ✅

And C in Db major? **Cb** (C flat), not C natural.

So **C natural is outside Db major.**

But Dbmaj7 has C natural — **that’s the 7th of Db major? NO — in Db major, the 7th is Cb**.

Therefore, **Dbmaj7 with C natural** is not diatonic to Db major — it’s **Db Lydian?** Db E F G A B C — too many changes.

Wait — Dbmaj7 with C natural = **Db major 7th with natural 7?** That’s impossible — in standard theory, the 7th must be Cb to be diatonic.

But in **modal mixture**, it might be borrowed.

Perhaps it's **C major** key?

C major: C D E F G A B — no Gdim or Db.

Not matching.

Let’s try another approach.

---

## Let’s look at the bass notes and root motion.

The pattern is mostly **Gdim**, with some **F** bass.

Chords where bass is not G:

- Eb/G → bass G  
- Bbm/F → bass F  
- Ab/G → bass G  
- Dbmaj7/F → bass F  

So the only two **non-G** bass notes: **F**

So **F** is a pivot.

Now, what chord is **Bbm/F**? F Ab Bb → F is 5th, so Bb minor.

What chord is **Dbmaj7/F**? F Ab C Db → F is 5th of Db? Db to F is major 6th → so F is major 6th of Db.

Actually, in Dbmaj7, the notes are Db F Ab C — so **F is the major 3rd**, Ab is 5th, C is 7th.

So F is the **3rd**, not 5th. Therefore, **Dbmaj7/F** = Db major 7th with 3rd in bass → **1st inversion**.

Similarly, **Bbm/F** = Bb minor with 5th in bass (F is 5th of Bb).

So we have:

- Chords with **F in bass**: Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F  
→ F = 5th of Bbm, and 3rd of Dbmaj7

Both chords have **F** in common.

And **Gdim** — which is G Bb Db

Look: **Gdim = G Bb Db**

**Bbm = Bb D F**

**Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C**

So common tone among Gdim, Bbm, Dbmaj7: **Bb** and **F**?

Let’s stack the triads:

- Gdim: G – Bb – Db  
- Bbm: Bb – D – F  
- Dbmaj7: Db – F – Ab – C

So Bb is in Gdim and Bbm. F is in Bbm and Dbmaj7.

It’s as if this is a **voice-leading progression**: Gdim → Bbm → Dbmaj7, and Bb moves to F, Db moves to Ab?

Wait — let’s try to hear this as a descending chromatic bass: G → F → Eb? But we have Eb/G → G in bass again.

Wait — maybe the key is **F minor**? We tried F harmonic.

Wait — let’s try **F Dorian** or something.

Too vague.

Let me consider a new idea.

What if the key is **Bb major**?

Bb major: Bb C D Eb F G A

Chords:

i: Bbm  
ii: Cm  
III: D°  
iv: Eb  
v: Fm  
VI: Gm  
VII: A°

We have Gdim — is Gdim diatonic? G is VI — Gm, not Gdim.

No.

Wait — we have **Bbm** — which is i in Bb major — good.

We have **Cb?** No.

Wait — we have **Db** — not in Bb major.

No.

---

## Breakthrough: Eb/G = G Bb Eb — G Bb = minor 3rd, Bb to Eb = perfect 4th? No.

Wait — **G Bb Eb** = Let’s invert it.

Move G to top: Bb Eb G → that’s **Bb minor 7th chord without 5th?** No — Bb – Eb – G = Bb (root), Eb (4th), G (6th?).

Not working.

Wait — **Eb/G = G Bb Eb** — what if it’s **E diminished 7th**? E G B D — no.

Here’s the insight: **G Bb Db = Gdim**, we have that.

**G Bb Eb = ?**

G to Bb = m3

Bb to Eb = m3

Therefore, **G Bb Eb** = **diminished 7th chord with root on Bb?** Bb D F Ab — no.

G Bb Eb — notes spaced in minor 3rds: G to Bb (3 semitones), Bb to Eb (4 semitones) — not equal.

Wait: G to Bb = 3 semitones  
Bb to Eb = 6 semitones — **G to Eb = 8 semitones** → which is **augmented 5th**

So **G Bb Eb = G augmented chord** (G+)

And **G+ is G, Bb, E#** — but it's spelled as Eb, not E# — so enharmonic.

So in equal temperament, **G+ = G Bb Eb**.

So perhaps every **Eb/G** is meant to be **G augmented**, not Eb minor.

In that case, we can reinterpret:

### Reinterpreted chords with G+ (G augmented) instead of Eb/G:

| Chord          | Correct interpretation | Notes         | Notes in key? |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| G+             | G+                     | G Bb E# (Eb)  |               |
| G+             | G+                     | G Bb Eb       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Bbm            | Bb minor               | Bb D F        |               |
| Ab/G           | Ab with G bass         | G Ab C        |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| G+             | G+                     | G Bb Eb       |               |
| G+             | G+                     | G Bb Eb       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |
| Dbmaj7/F       | Dbmaj7 with F bass     | F Ab C Db     |               |
| Gdim           | G°                     | G Bb Db       |               |

Now — **G° and G+** in the same progression? That’s unusual but possible in augmented harmony or chromatic.

Let’s try to find a **key that includes G°, G+, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7**

G° = G Bb Db  
G+ = G Bb E# = G Bb Eb  
Bbm = Bb D F  
Ab = A Bb C  
Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C

Let’s take all unique notes:

- G, Bb, Db, Eb, D, F, A, C

So notes: A, C, D, F, G, Bb, Db, Eb

That’s 8 notes.

Now build a scale from F: F G A Bb C D Eb Db — wait, Db is B#? No.

F A Bb Db Eb C D — doesn’t form a scale.

Too many accidentals.

Try: **Ab major**?

Ab: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Notes: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G — that’s **7 notes**.

Our chords:

- Gdim: G Bb Db — all in Ab major ✅  
- G+: G Bb E# — but Eb ≠ E# — here we have **Eb**, not E#  
So G Bb Eb = G Bb Eb — in Ab major, we have **Eb**, not D# — so G Bb Eb = G Bb + Eb — Eb is 6th of Ab — not raised.

G is the 7th degree of Ab major — which is **Bb?** Let’s see:

Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Degrees:
1. Ab  
2. Bb  
3. C  
4. Db  
5. Eb  
6. F  
7. G

So G is the leading tone — chord on VII: **G7?** But it's a **major 7th chord?** No — in major key, VII° is diminished.

G Bb Db — **Gdim** ✅ — perfect — diatonic VII° in Ab major.

Now G+ = G Bb E# — but in Ab major, the note above G is Ab — not E#. We have Eb, not E#.

So G Bb Eb = G Bb + Eb — Eb is the 5th of the key.

So G Bb Eb = G (root) Bb (m3) Eb (aug5? — no, G to Eb is **diminished 5th**? G to D = 7 semitones, G to Eb = 8 semitones — **augmented 5th**)

But in Ab major, there is **no E#**, only Eb.

So G Bb Eb is not diatonic — but it’s very close: **G Bb and Eb** — Eb is the 5th degree of Ab, but the chord is G Bb Eb = **Gb major?** No.

Wait — perhaps the **Ab major** scale **does include Gdim**, and **Bbm?**

In Ab major: Bbm is not diatonic — Bb is II, so Bb minor? In major key, II is minor — yes!

In Ab major:

- I: Ab  
- II: Bbm  
- III: C°  
- IV: Db  
- V: Eb  
- VI: F  
- VII: G°

We have ALL of the following:

- Gdim ✅ (VII°)  
- Bbm ✅ (II°)  
- Ab/G → Ab major with G in bass → Ab major (VI?) wait — Ab is I

Ab/G = bass G, chord Ab — so G Ab C → G is 7th, Ab is root — so Ab major in 3rd inversion?

But chord symbol Ab/G → chord is Ab major, bass G — possible.

- Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th? Db is IV — in Ab major, IV is Db → so Dbmaj7? We usually don’t have major 7th on IV in major keys, but it can be borrowed.

Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C

In Ab major, F is VI, Ab is I.

Dbmaj7 has notes Db F Ab C — which are **IV, VI, I, VII** — all diatonic! Because Ab major has:

Db = IV  
F = VI  
Ab = I  
C = III

So.Dbmaj7 is composed of notes: Db (IV), F (VI), Ab (I), C (III) — so it’s just **a quartal or tertian chord made from scale tones** — perfect.

And **Eb/G** — if it’s meant to be **G+ = G Bb Eb**, and Eb is the V in Ab major — and G Bb Eb = G + Eb — with Eb = 5th degree.

Is G Bb Eb in Ab major? G = VII, Bb = II, Eb = V — all scale tones.

So the chord G Bb Eb is built on G, with Bb and Eb — which are the 2nd and 5th degrees — so it’s **a G diminished chord with a raised 5th?** No, Eb is flattened 5th.

But Eb is a **diatonic tone**.

So perhaps **Eb/G** is meant to be **G, Bb, Eb — with Bb = m3, Eb = dim5** — but Eb is the 5th degree, which is natural, and G to Eb is **diminished 5th (8 semitones)** — yes! So **Gdim** is G Bb Db — but here it’s G Bb Eb — **that’s not Gdim, it’s G+?**

Wait — G to Eb = 8 semitones = **augmented 5th** (since perfect 5th = 7)

So **G Bb Eb = G augmented triad**.

But in Ab major, the only augmented chord is **C+** on III if we raise the 5th, but we don’t have an augmented chord naturally.

This is a stretch.

Perhaps **Eb/G** is a **mistake**, and it was meant to be **Db/G**?

Db/G = G Bb Db — Gdim. But we already have Gdim.

We already have 2 Gdim, then Eb/G — likely **not** meant to be Gdim again.

Perhaps the composer is using **G minor** with borrowed chords.

Let me consider **G minor** with **modal mixture** from Ab major? Too vague.

## Best solution: The key is **Ab major**

Because:

- Gdim is **VII°** — standard in major keys ✅  
- Bbm is **II°** — minor ii in major key ✅  
- Ab major chord ✅  
- Dbmaj7: Db (IV), F (VI), Ab (I), C (III) — all diatonic → so Dbmaj7 is a **major 7th** version of IV — common in jazz/pop for modal flavor ✅  
- Eb/G — if we take it as G Bb Eb — G is VII, Bb is II, Eb is V — so this is a **rootless chord** or **inversion** — but it's an **augmented sonority** — possible chromatic passing chord or borrowed.

In fact, in Ab major, the chord **Bb minor 7** = Bb D F Ab — and if we have **Bbm/F**, that's fine.

So with **E natural or E#** we don’t have — but we have **Eb**, which is diatonic.

So **G Bb Eb = G, Bb, Eb**:  
- G = VII  
- Bb = II  
- Eb = V

All are **scale tones**.

The chord G Bb Eb can be interpreted as **an F half-diminished 7th without the 5th?** F - A - C - Eb → we have G Bb Eb — no.

Another way: G Bb Eb = **Ebsus4(11)?** No.

Actually, **G Bb Eb** = **E-flat major with G in bass** — which is Eb major triad, G = major 3rd — so **Eb major in 1st inversion**.

And **Eb is the dominant of Ab** → so **Eb = V** in Ab major — so **Eb major** chord? But in Ab major, the V chord is **Eb minor**!

Ab major → V = Ebm.

So **Eb major** would be a **borrowed major V** from Ab minor.

Ah! **That’s it!**

### Therefore, we are in **Ab major**, but borrowing the **major V chord** from Ab minor — which is **Ebm → Eb**.

So:

- Gdim = Ab major’s VII° ✅  
- Bbm = Ab major’s II° ✅  
- **Eb = borrowed from Ab minor (V)** ✅  
- Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7 in Ab — common jazz extension ✅  
- Ab/G = Ab major with G in bass — G is the leading tone, so it’s a **chromatic passing bass** or **inversion for voice leading** ✅  

And the progression is:

**Gdim (VII°) — Eb/G (V maj, borrowed) — Gdim — Bbm/F (II° with 5th bass) — Ab/G (I with leading tone bass) — Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7 with 3rd bass) — Gdim**

This is a very plausible, jazzy, chromatic progression in **Ab major** with modal mixture (borrowed V major).

The **Eb/G** is **Eb major with G in bass** — Eb = V, G = 3rd of Eb, so it’s strong voice leading.

And Dbmaj7/F — F = 3rd of Db, Db = IV → so **moving from V (Eb) to IVmaj7 (Db)** with chromatic step — Eb → Db.

Perfect!

## ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: Ab major**  
> **Mode: Major (Ionian)**, with **modal mixture** (borrowing the major V chord from Ab minor for color)

### Why?
- All chords use notes from the Ab major scale, except **Eb** (V chord) which is major instead of Ebm — a borrowed chord from **Ab minor**.
- Gdim is the diatonic leading tone chord (VII°) — the most frequent, acting as a color tone or passing chord.
- The bass motion (G–F–G–F) and chord progression suggest a strong pull toward Ab, and Dbmaj7 is a jazz-friendly IV chord.
- The progression is not strictly diatonic but is **diatonically anchored in Ab major** with chromatic embellishment.

This is a rich, jazzy, colorful progression **centered in Ab major** — common in film, jazz pop, or modern harmony.
