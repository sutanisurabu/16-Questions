Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their functions

Let’s spell out the chords:

- **Gdim (G°):** G–Bb–Db  
  - Diminished triad
  - Common in minor keys as the **ii° chord in F harmonic minor** or as **vii° leading tone chord**
- **Eb/G:** First inversion of Eb major (G–Bb–Eb)
  - Eb major chord with G in bass
- **Bbm/F:** First inversion of Bb major (F–Bb–D)
  - Bb major chord with F in bass
- **Ab/G:** Ab major chord with G in bass (G–Ab–C–Eb)
  - This creates a dissonance (G and Ab next to each other)
- **Dbmaj7/F:** Db major 7th with F in bass (F–Ab–C–Eb)
  - F is the 3rd of Dbmaj7

Note: All chords have either G or F in the bass in inversions, suggesting voice-leading or pedal point.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the root movement and harmonic context

List of chord roots:
G – G – Eb – Eb  
G – G – Bb – Ab  
G – G – Eb – Eb  
G – G – Db – G

So we have:  
G → Eb → G → Bb → Ab → G → Eb → G → Db → G

Notable chords:
- **Gdim** appears repeatedly
- **Eb/G**, **Bbm/F**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F** — all have **G or F** in the bass
- **Dbmaj7/F** is particularly interesting — Dbmaj7 = C#maj7 enharmonically, but spelled as Db

---

### Step 3: Consider possible keys

Let’s examine possible tonal centers.

#### Is this in **G minor**?
- Gdim is **ii°** in **F major / F mixolydian**, or **vii°** in **Ab major**
- Gdim is **ii°** in **F harmonic minor** (F G Ab Bb Cb Db E → Gdim = G Bb Db)

But let’s look at other chords:

- **Eb major** = VI in G minor, or **bVI** in F minor
- **Bb major** = III in G minor (but G minor has Bb, so Bb is III)
- **Ab major** = iv in Eb minor, or bVII in Bb
- **Dbmaj7** = bII in C minor, but also appears in **Ab major** as **V/IV**?

But **Dbmaj7** is a major 7th chord — not diatonic in G minor or F minor.

Wait: **Dbmaj7** is diatonic to **Ab major**: Ab has F, Ab, C, Eb — yes, **C is natural**, but Dbmaj7 has **C**, which is correct.

So:
- **Ab major key:** F is the 6th, G is not in the key
- But Gdim has G–Bb–Db — G is not in Ab major (Ab Bb C Db Eb F G)
  - Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G → yes, G is the 7th scale degree
  - But G–Bb–Db = Gdim, which is **vii°** in Ab major?

Check: Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G  
Degrees: I – ii – iii – IV – V – vi – vii°  
So **Gdim** is **vii°** of Ab major — yes.

Now check other chords in **Ab major**:
- **Eb** = V (Eb major is dominant in Ab)
- **Eb/G** = first inversion V — fine
- **Bb** = ii in Ab — but Bb major is **not** diatonic to Ab major — Ab major has Bb minor (Bb–Db–F), not Bb major (Bb–D–F)
  - So **Bb major** implies a **modal mixture** or **secondary dominant**
- Bb major has **D**, which is not in Ab major → chromatic
- **Ab/G** = Ab major with G in bass → Ab/G is just embellishment
- **Dbmaj7** = IV chord in Ab major — Db is IV — Db major 7 is **IVmaj7**, which is **not diatonic** to Ab major
  - Ab major has **Db major**, but the 7th would be **Cb**, not **C natural**
  - So Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C → has **C natural**, but Ab major has **C natural**
    - Wait: Ab major: A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G
    - So C is natural, so **Dbmaj7** = **Db–F–Ab–C** → all notes are in Ab major!
    - Yes! F is the 3rd, C is the 7th — both in Ab major

So **Dbmaj7** is **IVmaj7** in **Ab major** — but Ab major doesn’t normally use **IVmaj7** because the subdominant in major is minor (Fm in C, etc.), but wait:

In **Ab major**, IV is **Db major** (Db–F–Ab), and **Dbmaj7** is possible if the 7th is C, which is diatonic — so **Dbmaj7** is **IVmaj7** and is **diatonic** to Ab major — yes!

But earlier: **Bb/F** — Bb major — not diatonic to Ab major — Ab major has **Bbm**, not BbM.

Bb major (Bb–D–F) — D is not in Ab major (Ab has C, Db) — D is the **raised 4th** — **chromatic**.

So **Bb major** is not in Ab major — unless it's a secondary chord.

Perhaps it’s **V of IV**? IV in Ab is Db, V of Db is Ab — not Bb.

Bb is **V of Eb**, but Eb is **V of Ab**, so Bb could be **V/V/V** — that’s stretched.

Alternatively, **Bb major** is **III** in **F minor**, but we’re seeing Eb, which is IV in F minor.

Let’s reconsider.

Wait — **Eb/G**, **Bbm/F**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F**

Try **F minor**?

F minor natural: F G Ab Bb Cb Db Eb
But we have many chords with **major** qualities: Eb (major), Bb (major), Ab (major), Db (major) — all are major.

So perhaps **F Dorian**? (F G Ab Bb C D Eb)

F Dorian: F–G–Ab–Bb–C–D–Eb

Let’s check chords:
- Gdim: G–Bb–Db → G is in F Dorian, Bb yes, Db yes → G–Bb–Db = vii° → possible
- Eb/G: Eb major (Eb–G–Bb) — G is in F Dorian, but **Eb major** is IV in F Dorian — yes, Dorian has **major IV**
- Bbm/F: Bb major — Bb–D–F — D is the 6th of F Dorian → yes, **V chord** — but **Bb major** is **V** in F Dorian? Wait:
  - F Dorian: i = Fm, ii = Gm, bIII = Ab, IV = Bb, v = Cm, bVI = Db, bVII = Eb
  - So **IV = Bb major**, yes — so Bbm/F is **IV** in first inversion — correct

But **Ab/G** — Ab major — Ab–C–Eb

Ab is bIII in F Dorian — so **bIII chord** — Ab major — yes — that is standard in Dorian: **bIII** is major

- Ab/G = Ab major with G in bass — G is in F Dorian — possible
- Dbmaj7/F = Db–F–Ab–C — Db is bVI in F Dorian — Db major is not in F Dorian — F Dorian has **Db minor** (Db–Fb–Ab) — Fb = E, not F

But here we have **F natural**, not Fb

So F natural is **major 3rd** of Db — so it’s **Db major**, not minor — not in F Dorian

Wait — Dorian has **Db minor**, not Db major

So Dbmaj7 is **not** in F Dorian — it has **F natural**, but F Dorian has F natural — but the chord on Db would be **Db–F–Ab** — that’s **Db major**, not minor — because the third is **F**, which is natural — but in F Dorian, the scale has **F natural**, so the chord **Db–F–Ab** = **Db major**, yes!

Wait — is that right?

F Dorian: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb

So on **Db**, built on scale: Db (enharmonic C#), but we call it Db

Scale degrees: Db would be bvi

Chord on bvi: Db–F–Ab → F is the 3rd — F is natural in F Dorian — so the chord is **Db major** — yes!

And 7th: add **C**, which is the 6th of F Dorian — yes, **C natural**

So **Dbmaj7** = Db–F–Ab–C — all notes in F Dorian — yes!

So chord on bVI is **Dbmaj7** — **bVImaj7** — which is **characteristic of Dorian mode**

Similarly:
- i = Fm
- ii = Gm
- bIII = Ab
- IV = Bb
- v = Cm (or C7 if harmonic)
- bVI = Dbmaj7
- bVII = Eb

So let's map your chords to **F Dorian**:

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db → G is ii° — so **ii°** in F Dorian — but Dorian has **G minor**, not G diminished — problem.

G minor would be G–Bb–D, but here we have G–Bb–Db → **Db**, not D → so **Gdim**, not Gm

So Gdim has **Db**, not D — but **D** is in F Dorian, so **Gm** would fit — but **Gdim** has **Db**, which is also in F Dorian?

Wait: F Dorian: F G Ab Bb C D Eb — so both **D** and **Db**?

No — D and Db are different — F Dorian has **D natural**, not **Db**

Wait: F Dorian = mode of Gb major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G → wait, no:

F Dorian: starts on F, uses the Bb major scale: F G Ab Bb C D Eb

So notes: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb

No **Db** — so **Db is not in F Dorian**!

But Gdim = G–Bb–Db — **Db** is not in F Dorian → so **Gdim not possible in F Dorian**

Contradiction.

So **F Dorian is out** because it has D natural, not Db.

But all Gdim chords imply **Db**.

So **scale must include Db**.

Try **Ab major** again.

Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Contains: G, Bb, Db → so **Gdim = vii°** → yes!
- Eb/G: Eb–G–Bb → G and Bb are in Ab major, Eb is V → yes
- Bbm/F: Bb–D–F → but **D** is not in Ab major (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G) — so D natural is **not** in key → chromatic
- Ab/G: Ab–C–Eb → G in bass — G is in scale (7th) — fine
- Dbmaj7/F: Db–F–Ab–C — all notes in Ab major — yes, **IVmaj7** — Db is IV

But **Bbm/F = Bb major**, which requires **D**, not in Ab major → so chromatic

So Bb major is **not diatonic** — unless it's a secondary dominant.

What if **Bb major** is **V of Eb**? Eb is V of Ab — so Bb is V/V — **secondary dominant**

Bb → Eb — yes: Bb (V of Eb) → Eb (V of Ab) — so **V7/V → V → I** is common

But here it’s Bb → Ab/G — not Eb

But Eb appears earlier and later.

The progression is cyclic, so perhaps: Dbmaj7 → Gdim → ...

Wait: **Dbmaj7/F** → **Gdim**

Db = IV, Gdim = vii° — IV–vii° — not a typical resolution, but possible.

But **Gdim → Eb/G** — Gdim (vii°) → Eb (V) — that’s **very common** in Ab major: vii° → V

Similarly, **Gdim → Ab/G** — vii° → I6 — also possible

But we have: Gdim → Eb/G (vii° → V), then Eb/G → Gdim — that's odd

Order:
... Ab/G → Gdim → Gdim → Eb/G ...

Ab/G → Gdim → Eb/G — so **I → vii° → V** — very plausible in **Ab major**

Also: after Eb/G → Gdim — V → vii°? Less common — usually V → I

But it could be **deceptive resolution** or voice-leading

But the **Dbmaj7/F** is interesting

After second Eb/G, we have:
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

So **Gdim → Dbmaj7** — that’s vii° → IV — possible but not strong

But then **Dbmaj7 → Gdim** — IV → vii° — not standard

But maybe it’s about bass line.

Let’s look at the **bass line**:

From the inversions:
- Gdim: G (assumed) → G in bass
- Eb/G: G in bass
- Bbm/F: F in bass
- Ab/G: G in bass
- Dbmaj7/F: F in bass

So bass: G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G

So mostly **G**, with two **F** appearances: under Bbm and Dbmaj7

So G is a **pedal tone** for most of the progression.

This suggests **G** is important — perhaps a **pedal point** or part of a **passing motion**

But G is the **leading tone** in **Ab major** — **vii°** — which resolves **up to Ab** — so it makes sense to emphasize G in the vii° chord

Now, **Dbmaj7/F** has **F** in bass — F is the **5th** of Db, but also the **6th** of Ab scale — and F–G motion in bass to Gdim

Similarly, **Bbm/F** has F in bass — Bb major — which is **V/V** — V of Eb

So possible progression in **Ab major**:

- Gdim = vii° → leads to V or I
- Eb/G = V6 — dominant
- Bbm/F = V/V (Bb) — secondary dominant leading to Eb
- Ab/G = I6 — tonic
- Dbmaj7/F = IV6 with maj7 — subdominant

So the harmonic flow could be:

vii° → V → vii° → V/V → V → vii° → V → vii° → IV → vii° → V (implied?) →...

But the structure seems to be:

**[Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G] ×2**  
Then instead of Eb/G, we have **Dbmaj7/F**, then back to Gdim

So first two phrases: Gdim → Eb/G  
Then: Gdim → Bbm/F → Ab/G → Gdim → Eb/G  
Then repeat, but last part: Gdim → Dbmaj7/F → Gdim

So perhaps: tonicization of **V** (Eb) via **V/V = Bb**, and then **IV** (Db) as a chromatic variant or modal interchange?

But **Dbmaj7** is diatonic — so not chromatic

Wait — in **Ab major**, IV is **Db major**, so Dbmaj7 is just **IVmaj7**

So the progression is largely diatonic to **Ab major**, except:
- **Bb major** = Bb–D–F → D not in key → so **chromatic** chord — but functions as **V of Eb (V/V)**
- All other chords: Gdim (vii°), Eb (V), Ab (I), Db (IV) — all diatonic

So the only non-diatonic chord is **Bb major** (V/V)

That’s acceptable as a **secondary dominant**

So overall, the tonal center is **Ab major**, with:
- vii° = Gdim
- V = Eb
- V/V = Bb
- I = Ab
- IV = Dbmaj7

And the mode is therefore **Ionian (major)**, not a mode like Dorian or Mixolydian.

But is Ab **major** or **Ab Lydian**? Lydian has #4, but here no #4 — so just **major**.

But the progression keeps returning to Gdim — which is **vii°** — often used as a **tonic substitute or approach to V**

The **pedal G in bass** supports its function as the **leading tone**

---

### Final Analysis:

- **Key: Ab major**
- **Mode: Ionian (major)**
- **Chord Functions:**
  - Gdim = vii° (leading tone chord)
  - Eb/G = V6 (dominant)
  - Bbm/F = V/V (secondary dominant, chromatic)
  - Ab/G = I6 (tonic)
  - Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj6 (subdominant with added 7th)

Despite the chromatic Bb major, the tonic is strongly suggested by Ab chord and resolution from Gdim/Eb.

### ✅ Conclusion:

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

The repeated Gdim emphasizes the **vii°** chord, creating tension that resolves to **Eb (V)** and **Ab (I)**, and **Dbmaj7** is a diatonic IV chord. The use of **V/V** (Bb) briefly emphasizes the dominant, but the key center remains **Ab**.
