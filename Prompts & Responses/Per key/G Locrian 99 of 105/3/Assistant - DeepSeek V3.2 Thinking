**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or in minor keys, so I should look for clues about the key.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

1. Gdim

2. Gdim

3. Eb/G

4. Eb/G

5. Gdim

6. Gdim

7. Bbm/F

8. Ab/G

9. Gdim

10. Gdim

11. Eb/G

12. Eb/G

13. Gdim

14. Gdim

15. Dbmaj7/F

16. Gdim

Now, I see that Eb/G is written, which means an Eb major chord with a G in the bass. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb minor with F in the bass, and Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass, and Dbmaj7/F is Db major 7 with F in the bass.

Gdim is a diminished chord. Since it's written as Gdim, it's likely a diminished triad or a full diminished seventh? In common notation, Gdim usually means G diminished triad, but in context, it might imply a diminished seventh. I'll assume it's a diminished triad for now, but I might need to consider the seventh.

To find the key, I should look at the chords that are not diminished. We have Eb, Bbm, Ab, and Dbmaj7.

Eb major, Bb minor, Ab major, Db major. These are all flats, so probably a key with flats.

Let me think about the relationships. Eb, Ab, and Db are all major chords, and Bbm is minor.

In major keys, the I, IV, V are major, and ii, iii, vi are minor. In minor keys, i, iv, v are minor, but V is often major, and there might be other changes.

But here we have a mix, and diminished chords.

Gdim is repeated a lot. Gdim could be a leading tone chord in some key. For example, in Ab major, the vii° chord is Gdim. Similarly, in other keys.

Let me list the possible keys for Gdim as vii°.

If Gdim is vii°, then the tonic would be Ab. Because in Ab major, the leading tone is G, and vii° is Gdim.

In Ab minor, the leading tone is G, but in harmonic minor, the vii° is Gdim, but Ab minor has seven flats, which is uncommon, but possible.

But let's see the other chords: Eb, Bbm, Ab, Db.

If the key is Ab major, then:

- I: Ab

- IV: Db

- V: Eb

- vi: Bbm? In Ab major, the vi chord is Fm, not Bbm. Bbm would be the ii chord in Ab major? Let's see the scale of Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So chords:

- I: Ab

- ii: Bbm

- iii: Cm

- IV: Db

- V: Eb

- vi: Fm

- vii°: Gdim

So in Ab major, we have Bbm which is ii, Eb which is V, Db which is IV, and Gdim which is vii°. That matches perfectly.

We have Bbm/F, which is just Bbm with F bass, so it's still the ii chord.

We have Ab/G, which is Ab major with G bass. Ab is I, and G is the leading tone, so this is like a I chord with a dominant seventh? Ab/G would be Ab major with G in bass, which is similar to a V7 chord? Let's see: if we have Ab/G, that means notes G, Ab, C, Eb. That is actually the same as G7b9? G, B, D, F is G7, but here we have Ab, C, Eb which are Ab major, but with G bass, so the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. This is like a dominant seventh chord with a flat ninth? But G is the root, so it might be functioning as a G7 chord with alterations.

But in the context of Ab major, G7 would be the V7/V or something? Let's see.

In Ab major, the V chord is Eb, so G7 is not diatonic. G7 would be V7 of C, but C is not in Ab major.

Ab/G has notes G, Ab, C, Eb. If we think of G as root, then it has b9 (Ab), no third? Wait, for a G chord, the third should be B, but here we have Ab and C and Eb. So it's G, Ab, C, Eb. This is missing the third, so it's ambiguous. But since it's written as Ab/G, it might be implying a slash chord where the bass is G, and the chord is Ab major, so it's not necessarily a G chord.

In music theory, when we have a slash chord, the bass note is important for the harmonic function.

In this progression, we have Gdim frequently, and then Ab/G, which might be leading to something.

Also, we have Dbmaj7/F, which is Db major 7 with F bass, so notes F, Db, F, Ab, C? Dbmaj7 is Db F Ab C, and with F bass, so notes F, Db, Ab, C. This is like an F minor chord with major seventh? F, Ab, C is Fm, but with Db and C, so it's Fm with added Db and C? Not standard.

Perhaps it's functioning as a subdominant or something.

But back to the key. From the chords, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Db, all fit in Ab major, and Gdim is the vii°.

So Ab major seems likely.

But let's confirm the mode. Ab major is a major key, so mode is major.

But we have diminished chords used frequently, which is common in major keys as passing chords.

Now, let's look at the progression in sequence.

The progression starts with Gdim, then Eb/G, which is Eb with G bass. Eb/G has notes G, Eb, G, Bb? Eb major is Eb G Bb, so with G bass, it's still Eb major chord.

Similarly, later Bbm/F, which is Bbm with F bass, so notes F, Bb, Db, F? Bbm is Bb Db F, so with F bass, it's still Bbm chord.

Ab/G is Ab with G bass, notes G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F is Db F Ab C with F bass, so notes F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, in Ab major, the Gdim should resolve to Ab, but here it often goes to Eb/G or other chords.

Let's see the resolution: after Gdim, we have Eb/G, which is V chord with G bass? In Ab major, V is Eb, so Eb/G is still V, but with third in bass? Not sure.

Then after some Gdim, we have Bbm/F, which is ii chord, then Ab/G, which is I chord with leading tone in bass, so it might be a cadence.

Then again Gdim to Eb/G, and finally Dbmaj7/F to Gdim.

Dbmaj7 is IV in Ab major, and then to Gdim, which is vii°, which should resolve to I, but it ends on Gdim? That might be for tension, but let's see the overall.

Perhaps the key is Ab major, and the progression uses diatonic chords except for the slash chords which add color.

But let's see if all chords are diatonic in Ab major.

Gdim: notes G, Bb, Db? Gdim triad is G Bb Db, which is diatonic to Ab major because Ab major has G, Bb, Db? Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G, so notes G, Bb, Db are all in the scale, so Gdim is diatonic.

Eb: Eb G Bb, diatonic.

Bbm: Bb Db F, diatonic.

Ab: Ab C Eb, diatonic.

Db: Db F Ab, diatonic.

Dbmaj7: Db F Ab C, and C is in Ab major? Ab major has C natural? Yes, Ab major has C natural, so Dbmaj7 is Db F Ab C, and C is the major seventh, so it's diatonic because the seventh of Db is C, which is in key.

So all chords are diatonic to Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

Now, about the mode: since it's Ab major, the mode is Ionian, but in common parlance, we just say major.

So key: Ab major.

But let's confirm the first and last chords. It starts with Gdim and ends with Gdim. That might be unusual, but it's possible for a progression to end on a diminished chord for effect.

In terms of harmony, Gdim often leads to Ab, but here it doesn't resolve directly, but in the progression, it might be implying Ab.

We have Ab/G which is like I with leading tone bass, which emphasizes the tonic.

So I think Ab major is correct.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

So for the answer, I should say Key: Ab major.

But the question says "determine key and mode". Since it's major, mode is major.

Sometimes mode might refer to something else, but here it's clear.

So final answer.

The chord progression primarily uses chords diatonic to Ab major: Gdim (vii°), Eb (V), Bbm (ii), Ab (I), Db (IV), and Dbmaj7 (IVmaj7). The frequent use of Gdim, which is the leading tone chord in Ab major, reinforces this key. The progression starts and ends on Gdim, creating tension, but the harmonic context confirms Ab major as the tonic.

**Key:** Ab major  
**Mode:** Ionian (major)
