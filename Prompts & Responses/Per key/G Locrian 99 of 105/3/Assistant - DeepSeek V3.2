Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. List the chords with their likely interpretations**

- **Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ (F♭) — fully diminished 7th chord, symmetric.
- **Eb/G** = G Eb G B♭ — Eb major triad over G bass (Eb = E♭ G B♭), so this is Eb major in 1st inversion.
- **Bbm/F** = F B♭ D — B♭ major triad over F bass (B♭ = B♭ D F), so this is B♭ major in 2nd inversion.
- **Ab/G** = G Ab C Eb — Ab major triad over G bass (Ab = A♭ C E♭).
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F Db F Ab C — D♭maj7 in 3rd inversion (D♭ F A♭ C).

---

**2. Look for a tonal center**

The progression is:

Gdim – Eb/G – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Eb/G – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

So chords in root position (ignoring bass for function):

- Gdim (vii° of something)
- Eb (I or VI)
- Bb (IV or V)
- Ab (bVII or III)
- Dbmaj7 (bII or IV)

---

**3. Try key of C minor**

In C minor:
- Gdim = G B♭ D♭ F♭ (enharmonic to E) — that’s G°7 = vii°7 of C minor.
- Eb = III (relative major)
- Bb = VII in natural minor, but in harmonic minor Bb would be rare; but Bbm is not in C minor (Bbm = B♭ D♭ F) — Wait, Bbm is B♭ D♭ F, which is not in C minor natural/harmonic/melodic. So maybe not C minor.

---

**4. Try key of Ab major**

Ab major: chords: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.
- Gdim = vii° of Ab major
- Eb = V
- Bbm = ii
- Ab = I
- Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7

This fits well:
Gdim (vii°), Eb/G (V), Gdim (vii°), Bbm/F (ii), Ab/G (I with G bass), Gdim (vii°), Eb/G (V), Gdim (vii°), Dbmaj7/F (IV), Gdim (vii°).

Bass line: G in many chords, Gdim as a common-tone diminished.

---

**5. Mode**

Key = **A♭ major** (Ionian mode).  
No sign of minor tonic (Cm), so not Ab minor.

---

**6. Check the G bass pedal**

Yes, G is a pedal point in many chords:  
Gdim (G in bass), Eb/G (G in bass), Bbm/F (F bass), Ab/G (G bass), Dbmaj7/F (F bass), etc. So not entirely strict G pedal, but G is emphasized.

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{A\text{-flat major}}
\]

**Key:** A♭ major  
**Mode:** Ionian
