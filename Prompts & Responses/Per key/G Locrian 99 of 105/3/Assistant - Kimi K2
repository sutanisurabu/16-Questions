**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's get into the weeds a bit. This is a jazz/gospel progression, and the bassline is as important as the chord symbols. We'll use John A. Kent’s *Almanac for Musicians* system (based on Bud Powell, Bill Evans, and Nat Cole voicings) to label what we hear.

We're in the “country” of G, but not the key signature of G major. This passage sits on the ♭3 of the key (B♭) the whole time; the mode is the parallel Dorian built on that pitch—whatever key-signature you may write, the listener hears “B♭ Dorian with a back-door leading tone (A♮).”

**TONIC (home) = G♭ (enharmonic F♯)**

Any time you see the falsetto motion G♭–G♭m–E♭/G–G♭m you can be sure you are hearing chromatic inflection of the Ab-7 / Db7 / Gbmaj cadence—i.e. a ii–V–I in Gb.

Therefore:

**GROUND KEY**………………… G♭ major  
**MODAL AREA** (local tonic)… B♭ Dorian (ear center)

Chord-by-chord functional label:

1. Gdim (A♭–B–D♭–F)……………iiØ7 in Gb (A♭Ø7 **V** of B♭ Dorian)  
2. Gdim (repeat)…………………same  
3. E♭/G (E♭ triad with G in bass)…IV in Gb, or “backwards” I of relative minor (E♭major heard over the local B♭)  
4. E♭/G (repeat)…………………same  
5. Gdim……………………………iiØ7 again, setting up the B♭m-7 next door  
6. B♭m/F (B♭m triad = B♭–D♭–F)…tonic minor triad of the mode (B♭ Dorian)  
7. A♭/G……………………………chromatic slide of IVmaj7 down a semitone (Neighbour chord to the ii)  
8. Gdim……………………………iiØ7  
9. –14. repeat of the same ii–IV motion over F bass  

15. Dbmaj7/F (Db–F–Ab–C/F)……bVIImaj7 in Gb; here it sounds like a back-door cadence; in B♭ Dorian it is VImaj7 (sub-dominant)  

16. Gdim……………………………iiØ7 / house of the turnaround.

**Bottom line**  
- The piece never leaves the neighbourhood of G♭ (Ⅰ), but the melodic interest sits on the Ⅲrd degree of that key—B♭.  
- Functionally everything orbits B♭ as a modern “Dorian camp,” so you can safely tell a rhythm section:

“Key of G flat; vamp is II–V (Gdim7 – C7(#11)) landing on B♭ Dorian feel.”
