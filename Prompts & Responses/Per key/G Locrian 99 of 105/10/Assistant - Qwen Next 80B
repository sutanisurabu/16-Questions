This chord progression:

**Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**

is a fascinating, chromatic, and moody progression — typical of jazz, film noir, or modal ambient music. Let’s break it down to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### Step 1: List all chords with bass notes

We’ll analyze each chord and its **bass note**, since many are slash chords, and the bass note is often critical in these contexts.

| Chord         | Notes (Root + Extensions)     | Bass Note |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |
| Eb/G          | G, Bb, Eb                     | G         |
| Eb/G          | G, Bb, Eb                     | G         |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |
| Bbm/F         | F, Ab, Bb, Db? (Bbm = Bb, Db, F) | F         |
| Ab/G          | G, Bb, Db, F? (Ab7 = Ab, C, Eb, G) → likely Ab7/G | G         |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |
| Eb/G          | G, Bb, Eb                     | G         |
| Eb/G          | G, Bb, Eb                     | G         |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |
| Dbmaj7/F      | F, Ab, C, Db (Dbmaj7 = Db, F, Ab, C) | F         |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                     | G         |

Note: 
- `Eb/G` = chord = Eb diminished triad (Eb, Gb, Bbb? No — wait! Let's correct this.)
   - **Actually, Gdim = G-Bb-Db**
   - **Eb/G = G in bass, chord is Eb minor?** But written as “Eb/G”, which usually means **Eb major or minor triad with G in bass**.
   - Eb triad = Eb-G-Bb → so **Eb/G = G, Eb, Bb** → which is **Gm7♭5** or **Ghalf-dim7** (same as Gdim7 without the 7th).

Ah! **This is the key insight**.

---

### Step 2: Re-interpret all "Eb/G" and "Bbm/F" as actual harmonies

Let’s reinterpret each slash chord as a **full chord quality**, using the **bass note as root**.

- **Gdim** = G° = G-Bb-Db
- **Eb/G** = Bass is G, chord is Eb triad → G-Eb-Bb → **G, Bb, Eb** → this is the **G half-diminished 7 chord without the 7th**, i.e., **Gm7♭5** (same as G°7 minus the F).  
  But Gm7♭5 = G-Bb-Db-F → Here we have G-Bb-Eb → so **it’s missing the F**. But Eb is the ♭5 of G? No.

Wait — let's take a step back and analyze **intervallically** from the bass.

#### Think in terms of **G as tonic** for now

Let’s assume **G** is the tonal center and analyze notes in relation to G.

- Gdim = G-Bb-Db → G root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th → G°
- Eb/G = G (bass), E♭ and B♭ → so notes: G, B♭, E♭  
  → Intervals from G:  
  - B♭ = minor 3rd  
  - E♭ = **minor 6th** (not a standard triad tone over G)

Minor 6th over G isn't in G minor scale.

Wait — G minor scale: G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F

Ah! **Eb is the ♭6 of G minor**.

So G, Bb, Eb = **Gm6♭5?** Not standard.  
But **G, Bb, Eb** = **Bb major chord in second inversion**? No — still seems like a G chord with added ♭6.

Alternatively, think of it as **Gb major**? That doesn’t help.

Wait — let's think: **G, Bb, Eb** = **E♭ altered triad** — if we re-name G as F#, then F#-A-C#? Not helpful.

Alternative approach:

---

### Step 3: Look for common harmonic functions

Let’s look at **Eb/G** as **Gm7♭5** (G-Bb-Db-F) — but here the 7th (F) is missing.

But wait — what if **Eb/G** is a **Bbm7/F**? Let’s look at **Bbm/F**.

Bbm = Bb, Db, F → **Bbm/F = F, Bb, Db** → which is an **Fm7** or **F half-diminished 7**? F-A-C-E? No.

F, Bb, Db = **F diminished triad** → F-Ab-Cb? Wait:

Bbm = Bb - Db - F  
So Bbm/F = F - Bb - Db → F is bass, then Bb = 4th, Db = ♭6 → F, Bb, Db = **F7♭9? No**

Actually, this is a **diminished triad** on F: F-Ab-Cb, but we have **F, Bb, Db** → that’s **F, Bb, Db**

F to Bb = perfect 4th  
F to Db = diminished 5th → **F diminished triad?** No, Fdim is F-A♭-C♭

We have F, Bb, Db → **Bb, Db, F → Bbm triad in third inversion**.

Big realization:

> **All these slash chords are functioning as inverted diminished or half-diminished chords centered on G.**

Let’s list **all unique notes** used:

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db  
From Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb  
From Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db  
From Ab/G: G, Ab, Bb, Db? → Ab/G = G, Ab, C, Eb?  
- Ab/G = Chord is Ab, bass G → likely **Ab7/G** = G, Bb, Db, Ab → notes: G, Ab, Bb, Db  
→ That’s a **G7♭9** chord!

Wait — **G7♭9 = G, B, D, F, Ab** — but here we don’t have B or D.

We have: G (bass), Ab, Bb, Db

This is: G, Ab, Bb, Db — intervals from G:

- Ab = minor 9th  
- Bb = minor 3rd  
- Db = diminished 5th

So: G, Bb, Db, Ab → this is **G°7♭9**? Not standard, but **G half-diminished 7 with added ♭9** = **Gm7♭5♭9**

But Gm7♭5 = G Bb Db F — we don’t have F, we have Ab.

So: **Gm7♭5(add ♭9)** — unusual, but possible in jazz.

Then **Dbmaj7/F = F, Ab, C, Db**

F, Ab, C, Db → F is bass  
Intervals: F to Ab = minor 3rd  
F to C = perfect 5th  
F to Db = ♭6

So: **Fm6(add ♭6)?** No — better: **Dbmaj7/F** = Db, F, Ab, C → so notes are Db, F, Ab, C.

That’s **Db major 7** on top of F.

Db – F = major 3rd  
Db – Ab = perfect 5th  
Db – C = major 7th → yes, Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C

Bass is F → F is the 3rd of Dbmaj7 → so this is **first inversion Db major 7**

So Dbmaj7/F = **F as 3rd of Db major 7**

Now: **Db major 7 → Db, F, Ab, C**

What key is Db major in? Db major scale = Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

That’s **Db major**.

Now what’s the relationship between Db and G?

G to Db = **minor 6th apart** — or **enharmonically**, G = A♭, so G and Db are major 3rd apart? Wait:

G = G  
Db = Db

Interval: G to Db = **diminished 6th** (G to E is M6, G to Eb is m6, G to Db = diminished 6th)

But **Db major = 5 flats**, G natural = 1 sharp — not related tonally.

But we keep seeing Gdim and Eb/G.

Wait — what if the tonal center is **not G**, but **Eb**?

Try **Eb** as tonic.

Eb scale: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D

Now look at chords:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db → G is ♭6 of Eb?  
Bb = ♭3?  
Db = ♭6

So Gdim = G-Bb-Db = ♭6 - ♭3 - ♭6? Not helpful.

What if the key is **Gb major**? That has 6 flats — unlikely.

Another idea:

Let’s look at **Dbmaj7/F**

Dbmaj7 = Db, F, Ab, C  
F is the 3rd of Db.

Now, **F is also the root of Bbm triad** (Bbm = Bb, Db, F) — so Bbm/F = F (bass), Bb, Db — which is **Bbm triad in 2nd inversion**

But Bbm is **the ♭vi chord in Db major**! Yes!

In Db major:

- I = Db
- ii = Ebm
- iii = Fm
- IV = Gb
- V = Ab
- vi = Bbm
- vii° = C°

So **Bbm = vi chord**

**Dbmaj7 = I maj7**

And **Bbm/F = vi chord with 3rd in bass**

Perfect.

Now what is **Gdim**?

Gdim = G, Bb, Db — which notes are these?

In Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C — Wait, **G is not in Db major**!

G is **Gb** (G natural) — in Db major scale, there is **Gb**, not G.

So **G** = **Gb enharmonically?** But G and Gb are different pitches.

Wait — **G natural is not in Db major**.

But we are seeing **Gdim** — G, Bb, Db — Db and Bb are in Db major, G is not.

Unless this is **borrowed from parallel minor**?

Db minor scale = Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

Now Gb is in Db minor, but we have G natural — which is **the leading tone to Ab**, so perhaps **borrowed from Ab minor?**

Wait — G natural is **the ♯7 of Ab**, so this is **borrowed from Ab harmonic minor or Phrygian?**

This is getting too layered.

Let me try a new tactic.

---

## ✅ Breakthrough Insight: The progression centers on **G half-diminished (Gm7♭5)** as the tonic!

Look at these chords:

- Gdim = G, Bb, Db — **Gm7♭5 without 7th**
- Eb/G = G, Bb, Eb — **This is the same as Gm7♭5 but with ♭6 instead of ♭7** (F)
   → Gm7♭5 = G, Bb, Db, F — here we have G, Bb, Eb
   → So **Eb = ♭6** — this is **Gm6♭5**

But that’s rare.

Wait — **Bbm/F = F, Bb, Db** → That’s the **Bbm triad** — which is **relative minor?**

Bbm = Bb-Db-F → this is **Gm7♭5 without the G**? No — Gm7♭5 is G-Bb-Db-F → Bbm is Bb-Db-F, which is **the 3rd, 5th, 7th** of Gm7♭5!

**So Bbm is the arpeggio of the bottom three notes of Gm7♭5 — that’s the same as a chord rooted on III of Gm7♭5? No.**

Actually:

Gm7♭5 = G-**Bb-Db-F**

So **Bbm triad = Bb-Db-F** → exactly the **last three notes of Gm7♭5**

In jazz, this is called **“quartal harmony”** or **“upper structure triad”**

**Bbm over G = Gm7♭5**

Yes!!

> **Bbm triad over G bass = Gm7♭5**

Similarly:

**Eb/G = G-Bb-Eb** = G, Bb, Eb — which is G, the root, Bb = minor 3rd, Eb = **♭6**

That’s Gm6♭5 — rare, but possible in modal jazz.

But now:

**Ab/G = G, Ab, Bb, Db**

G = root  
Ab = ♭9  
Bb = ♭3  
Db = ♭5  
→ **G7♭9** — but G7 has a major 3rd (B), not Bb! So it’s **G7♭9 with flat 3rd?** Unusual.

Wait — it's actually **Gm7♭5♭9** — a very dark, altered chord.

Finally — **Dbmaj7/F = F, Ab, C, Db**

This is **Dbmaj7 with F in bass**

F is the **3rd of Dbmaj7**

So we have:

**Dbmaj7/F = F (3rd) as bass**

And Dbmaj7 = Db, F, Ab, C → all diatonic to **Db major**

Now, the **Entire Progression** uses **Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F**, and repeats.

Here’s the critical connection:

> **Dbmaj7 is tonic. We just confirmed it's a major 7 chord.**

If **Dbmaj7** is the tonic, then what is G?

In Db major:  
- Db (I)  
- Eb (ii)  
- F (iii)  
- Gb (IV)  
- Ab (V)  
- Bbm (vi)  
- C° (vii°)

**G natural is not in Db major — Gb is.**

So **G natural = Gb enharmonically? No — they are different.**

Unless this is **in Db minor?**

Db minor = Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C — still no G natural.

**G natural = the ♭2 of Ab?** or **♯7 of Gb?**

Wait — G natural is the **leading tone to Ab**.

G natural → Ab = minor 2nd resolution.

Similarly, in **Ab minor**, G is the ♯7.

So perhaps the progression is **borrowing from Ab minor**?

But Db major is the only stable chord — the **Dbmaj7/F** anchors us to **Db** as the key center.

We see:

- Bbm triad = vi chord in Db major — appears as Bbm/F
- Gdim = ? Not in Db major scale — G natural is foreign

But here’s an **enharmonic interpretation**:

What if **Gdim** is really **F#dim** = F#-A-C

F# = Gb — which *is* in Db major? No — Db major has **Gb**, not F#.

Db major = Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C — yes, Gb is there.

So **F#dim = Gbdim** if we treat it as enharmonic.

So maybe **Gdim** = **Gbdim** = **Gb-Bbb-Dbb?** No — not likely.

Wait — here's the ELIMINATING clue:

### In the chord **Dbmaj7/F**, the notes are **F, Ab, C, Db**

The notes in this chord are: **C, Db, F, Ab**

All are **diatonic to Db major**

**G natural appears in Gdim, Eb/G, Ab/G** — all are **G natural**

But **G natural Is NOT in Db major**

So this is a **modulation** or **modal mixture**

Wait — here's the true key:

### The chord **Dbmaj7/F** is the only truly "home" chord — and it is **Db major 7**

All other chords are **passing or borrowed** — but they all relate to **F underpinning** other chords.

Let’s construct a central tonal center using the **bass notes** and **chord roots**:

Bass notes used: G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G

So bass is almost **all G**, except two F’s: on **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F**

Two bar(s) with F bass — but 14 bars with G bass.

So **G is the bass drone** — hundreds of modern ambient/jazz pieces use this — **G is the tonal center**, even if the chord above changes.

That means — **we are in a G-centered mode**, with chromatic harmonies above.

So the key is **G**, but what mode?

G natural = likely **G Dorian? G Aeolian?**

G Aeolian (natural minor): G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F

Now look at the notes in all chords:

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db — Db is **not** in G minor! G minor has D, not Db.

G aeolian = G A Bb C D Eb F

So notes: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

But in Gdim: Db — not D

So **Db is a ♭5** — suggesting G Locrian? G Locrian: G A Bb C D Eb F → **no Db**

**G Locrian = G A Bb C Db Eb F** — yes! Db is the ♭5!

Let’s check **G Locrian mode**:

- G (1)
- A (2)
- Bb (♭3)
- C (4)
- **Db (♭5)**
- Eb (♭6)
- F (♭7)

Perfect!

Now analyze all the chords with this in mind.

### All chords can be mapped to G Locrian!

| Chord         | Notes   | Function in G Locrian |
|---------------|---------|------------------------|
| Gdim          | G,Bb,Db | tonic ° chord. Perfect for Locrian (i°) |
| Eb/G          | G,Bb,Eb | G root, ♭3 (Bb), ♭6 (Eb) — **Gm6♭5** — common in Locrian sound |
| Bbm/F         | F,Bb,Db | This is Bbm triad: Bb, Db, F → in G Locrian: |
|               |         | Bb = ♭3, Db = ♭5, F = ♭7 → **iii°7 arpeggio?** Bbm is the **iii7 chord** in C minor — but in G Locrian: Bb is ♭3, so Bbm is a chord built on ♭3 — it’s a chromatic passing chord, but notes all fit in G Locrian |
| Ab/G          | G,Ab,Bb,Db | G root, ♭9 (Ab), ♭3 (Bb), ♭5 (Db) — **Gm7♭5♭9** — textbook Locrian with added ♭9! |
| Dbmaj7/F      | F,Ab,C,Db | F = ♭7, Ab = ♭6**, C = 4**, Db = ♭5 — all from G Locrian! |
| Gdim          | G,Bb,Db | tonic again |

**All notes fit EXACTLY in G Locrian mode.**

G Locrian is:  
**G A Bb C Db Eb F**

Chord notes observed:

- G (root)
- Bb (♭3)
- Db (♭5)
- Eb (♭6)
- F (♭7)
- Ab (♭6 ♭6 again? Wait — Ab = ♭6? In G Locrian, ♭6 is **Eb**, not Ab.

Wait! **Ab is not in G Locrian!**

G Locrian = G, A, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

**Ab is not there. Ab = ♭6 if G were root? Let’s calculate:**

G to Ab = minor 2nd — **♭9**

In G Locrian: the notes are **G A Bb C Db Eb F**

So:  
- A = 2  
- C = 4  
- Eb = ♭6  
- F = ♭7

**Ab = G♯** — not in scale

So when we see **Ab/G**, we’re playing **Ab** — which is **the ♭9** — not diatonic to G Locrian.

What is Ab in relation to G? **♭9**

So Ab is an **outside chromatic passing tone** — a very common sound in jazz, especially in Locrian because the mode itself is unstable.

So:

> The progression is **centered in G Locrian** (G minor with ♭2, ♭5, ♭6, ♭7) — and it uses **Ab as a chromatic ♭9 passing tone** to tension and release.

The Dbmaj7/F is the point of compromise — but even Dbmaj7's notes (Db, F, Ab, C)

In G Locrian:
- Db = ♭5
- F = ♭7
- C = 4
- Ab = **chromatic** — not in scale! Ab is not in G Locrian.

So **C** and **F** and **Db** are diatonic — **Ab is extra**

So even Dbmaj7/F has an **outside tone Ab**

So maybe the entire progression is in **G Locrian**, with **notes ♭9 and ♭6 borrowed from outside**?

Wait — or perhaps **Ab is enharmonic to G#** — which is the leading tone to G? That’s in harmonic minor — but we're in Locrian.

I think we’ve done enough.

---

## ✅ FINAL ANSWER:

> **Key: G**  
> **Mode: Locrian**  
> **With chromatic passing tones (Ab, Eb) for added color**

### Why?

- **Gdim** = tonic diminished chord → hallmark of Locrian mode.
- **Eb/G** = G-m6♭5 → ♭6 adds color, natural in modal jazz.
- **Bbm/F** and **Ab/G** = chromatic passing chords using notes from the G Locrian scale (Bb, Db, F) with added Ab = ♭9 for tension.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F (♭7), Db (♭5), C (4), Ab (chromatic) — still anchored in G as tonal center.

The bass is overwhelmingly **G**, and all chords are built using non-diatonic extensions grounded in **G Locrian**.

In jazz/film music, it's common to use **Locrian** for dark, unsettling, suspenseful textures — exactly what this progression evokes.

### ✅ Conclusion:

> **Key: G**  
> **Mode: Locrian**  
> With chromatic passing tones (especially Ab) — not conflicting, but enhancing the instability characteristic of Locrian.

This is a **G Locrian** progression with added tensions — a masterpiece of modal jazz harmony.
