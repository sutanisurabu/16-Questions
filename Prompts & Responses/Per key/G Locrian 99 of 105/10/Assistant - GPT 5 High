**Analyzing Chord Structure**

I'm exploring the chords here, particularly the frequent Gdim (G-Bb-Db). When placed over Db Lydian, it takes on the character of a tritone chord based on #11 (G) and b7 (possibly Bb). I’m mapping out the degrees relative to Db: Db(1), Eb(2), F(3), G(#4), Ab(5), Bb(6), C(7). Gdim corresponds to the intervals #4, 6, and 1. I’ve also noted how the Eb/G chord functions as the II major chord in Db Lydian, while Ab/G isn’t diatonic as a triad.**Exploring Chord Structures**

I’m realizing that the Ab major chord with G as the bass creates an Abmaj7/G structure, incorporating G as a leading tone. This consists of the notes G, Ab, C, and Eb, which are all diatonic in Db Lydian. The Bbm/F chord serves as the vi chord in Db major, translating to a vi minor in Db Lydian. I’m seeing that the repeated Gdim functions as a leading-tone diminished triad resolving to Ab, further confirmed by the sequence leading to Ab/G.**Analyzing Chord Relationships**

I'm considering how Gdim connects to Ab/G as a leading-tone diminished chord for Ab. The overall harmonic center might be Eb/G or Dbmaj7/F, but interestingly, the final Gdim doesn’t resolve to the tonic. I notice that Dbmaj7/F is the only I-chord, and Eb/G is frequently used as the II6 chord. It seems our pitch collection aligns with the Ab major diatonic, confirming the chords' relationships like Eb/G being the V in Ab major and Bbm/F as the ii chord in second inversion.**Clarifying Chord Functions**

I'm identifying that Dbmaj7/F serves as the IVmaj7 chord in Ab major, with the third in the bass. The Gdim functions as the leading-tone diminished triad (vii°) in Ab major. In this context, the chords include vii° (Gdim), V6 (Eb/G), and possibly ii6 with Bbm/F being a II minor triad in second inversion. I note that Gdim's repetition suggests it as a leading tone to I. However, the tonic center appears to lean towards Ab major rather than Db Lydian, focusing instead on the key signature.**Determining Key and Mode**

I'm analyzing the chords here: IVmaj7 (Dbmaj7/F), ii minor, and V major fit into Ab Ionian major, with Gdim as a vii° triad. The progression revolves around Eb/G (V6), Gdim (vii°), and Bbm/F (ii), leading me to conclude it's in Ab major. While Db Lydian could work since the notes match, functional roles suggest Ab is the tonic. Ultimately, for clarity, I’d state that the key is Ab major (Ionian) based on the common harmonic functions.

Ab major (Ionian).

Why: Every chord is diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6/4
- Ab/G = Imaj7 over 7
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in first inversion

The pitch collection (Db–Eb–F–G–Ab–Bb–C) also equals Db Lydian, but the functional harmony (V, ii, IV, vii°) points to Ab as the tonal center.
