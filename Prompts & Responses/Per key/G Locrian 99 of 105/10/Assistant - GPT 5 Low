### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to analyze the chord progression, which includes several Gdim chords and slash chords indicating bass notes. I'm considering whether Gdim is a diminished triad or a fully diminished seventh; I'll assume it's a triad (G, Bb, Db). The other chords are Eb/G (Eb major over G), Bbm/F (B-flat minor over F), Ab/G (Ab major over G), and Dbmaj7/F (Db major seventh over F). 

I need to determine the key; Gdim functions as the vii° chord in the key of Ab major.**Clarifying chord functions**

I'm analyzing the chords again. Eb/G has G in the bass, but is actually an Eb major triad (Eb, G, Bb). This means it's a first inversion V (V6) chord in the key of Ab major. Next, Bbm/F is a B-flat minor triad with F in the bass, functioning as ii6 in Ab major. 

Then for Ab/G, I note that it features G in the bass. This inversion is a bit unusual; typical inversions would usually be Ab/C or Ab/Eb. It creates a flat seventh in relation to the Ab major chord.**Exploring chord relationships**

When I look at Ab/G, it seems to act as a non-chord tone bass. It could be seen as a passing 7th, like an Abmaj7 without the seventh, since G is the leading tone in Ab major. However, it’s not just Ab; it's noted as Ab/G, which might imply an Abmaj7/G. 

Moving on to Dbmaj7/F, in Ab major, Db is the IV chord and is indeed diatonic. This means Dbmaj7 (Db, F, Ab, C) fits within Ab major, especially since the scale contains C natural.**Mapping chord functions**

All the notes are indeed in Ab major. When I look at F in the bass, it suggests IVmaj7 in first inversion, fitting within the key. This makes me think the progression is primarily in Ab major, with G mostly appearing as a passing bass note through Gdim, Eb/G, and Ab/G. 

So, mapping the functions: Gdim acts as the vii° (leading-tone diminished), Eb/G is V6, Bbm/F is ii6, and Ab/G seems like Imaj7, possibly in third inversion, with the major seventh (G) in the bass.**Determining key and mode**

The presence of Eb suggests an F Aeolian center rather than Ab major, but I need to consider if there's a stronger pull to Ab. The repeated Gdim leads to Eb/G, with both chords sharing G and Bb in common, indicating a voice-leading connection. 

Ultimately, while the music might waver between F minor and Ab major, the repeated leading-tone G indicates Ab major is likely the key. So, I would conclude with: Key: Ab major, Mode: Ionian. The chords map well to this key.

Ab major (Ionian).

Explanation (brief):
- All chords are diatonic to Ab major: Gdim (vii°), Eb/G (V6), Bbm/F (ii6/4), Ab/G (~Imaj7/7), Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7/3).
- The same collection is also F natural minor (Aeolian), but the functions used (vii° and V of Ab) point more strongly to Ab major as the tonal center.
