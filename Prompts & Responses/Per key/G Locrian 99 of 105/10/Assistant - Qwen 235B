Let's analyze this progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

The chord progression provided is:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

---

### Step 1: List the Chords

Let’s list the chords clearly with their **root notes**:

1. Gdim (G–Bb–Db)  
2. Gdim  
3. Eb/G (G–Bb–Eb)  
4. Eb/G  
5. Gdim  
6. Gdim  
7. Bbm/F (F–Bb–Db)  
8. Ab/G (G–Eb–Gb) → note: Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass  
9. Gdim  
10. Gdim  
11. Eb/G  
12. Eb/G  
13. Gdim  
14. Gdim  
15. Dbmaj7/F (F–Ab–C–Eb)  
16. Gdim

So the roots of the chords are:

**G – G – G – G – G – G – F – G – G – G – G – G – G – G – F – G**

But more importantly, let’s list the **harmonic content**:

- Gdim (G–Bb–Db)
- Eb/G (G–Bb–Eb) → so it's an **Eb major** chord with G in bass
- Bbm/F (F–Bb–Db) → **Bb minor** with F in bass
- Ab/G → **Ab major** (Ab–C–Eb), bass G
- Dbmaj7/F → **Db major 7** (Db–F–Ab–C), bass F

So we can extract the unique chords:
- Gdim
- Eb/G (Eb major over G)
- Bbm/F (Bb minor over F)
- Ab/G (Ab major over G)
- Dbmaj7/F (Db major 7 over F)

This suggests movement between chords rooted around **G**, **F**, **Eb**, **Ab**, **Db**, **Bb**

### Step 2: Look for Key Centers

Let’s look at the notes involved in these chords:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb
- Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db
- Ab/G: G, Eb, Ab (Gb enharmonic), C
- Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Eb

Let’s collect all the **pitches** used:

- G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C

So the full set of notes:
**F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb**

Sorted: **F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb**

This is the **F Locrian** mode? Let’s check:

But let’s map this collection to a scale.

Wait — let’s sort the notes:
F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

Compare to **F minor scales**:

- F natural minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb → **Exactly matches!**

Yes! The notes:
**F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb** — that’s the **F natural minor** scale.

So the **key is F minor**, and the **mode** is **Aeolian**.

But wait — does Gdim make sense in F minor?

Yes: In **F minor**, the diatonic chords are:

- i: Fm
- ii°: Gdim
- III: Ab
- iv: Bbm
- v: Cm (or C7 in harmonic minor)
- VI: Db
- VII: Eb

Wait — but we have **Dbmaj7**, which is **VI**, and **Eb**, which is **VII**, and **Ab**, and **Bbm**, and **Gdim**.

All of these are **diatonic to F natural minor**:

- Gdim = **ii°** ✅
- Eb = **VII** (major) ✅
- Bbm = **iv** ✅
- Ab = **III** ✅
- Dbmaj7 = **VI** (major 7) ✅

And all chords are using inversions (slash chords) to emphasize **G** and **F** in the bass — suggesting **pedal tone or bass movement between G and F**.

Note that the bass alternates a lot between **G** and **F**, and the tonal center seems to gravitate around **F minor**, even though the progression starts and ends on Gdim.

However, Gdim is the **ii° chord** in F minor, not the tonic. So why does it feel recurring?

This could be a **modal** or **voice-leading-driven** progression, possibly with a **pedal tone** or **descending bassline**.

Let’s look at the bass motion:

Bass notes:
- G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G

So it alternates between **G** and **F**, with G dominating.

But the resolution to **Dbmaj7/F** (F in bass) suggests a moment of stability.

But no F minor chord appears outright — which is interesting.

Still, all chords are diatonic to **F natural minor**.

So even without the tonic chord (Fm), the progression uses only chords from **F minor**, especially:

- Gdim (ii°)
- Eb (VII)
- Bbm (iv)
- Ab (III)
- Dbmaj7 (VI)

These are all chords from the **F natural minor** key.

Moreover, **Gdim** is not a tonic in any common key — it’s a diminished ii chord. So it's unlikely we are in **G diminished** or G Locrian.

Locrian mode (e.g. G Locrian) would be: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F — which is the same set but starting on G. That’s actually just **G Locrian = F natural minor mode starting on G**.

So is this **G Locrian**?

Potentially — but Locrian is very rare in practice, especially as a tonal center, because of the unstable diminished tonic.

Instead, this progression **borrows heavily from ii°–vii–IV–bIII–bVI** in minor, which is common in jazz, film scores, or moody pop/rock.

The repeated **Gdim** functions as a **predominant chord**, leading to Eb (VII), Ab (III), Bbm (iv), Db (VI), etc.

The bass alternates between **G and F**, suggesting a descending **bass line: G – F**, which may be supporting a **modal or chromatic** flavor.

But the **tonic** implied by the harmonies is **F minor**, even if it’s not stated.

### Conclusion:

- **All chords are diatonic to F natural minor.**
- The progression revolves around **Gdim (ii°)** but doesn't tonicize it.
- The only plausible **key center** is **F minor**.
- The **mode** represented by the scale **F G Ab Bb C Db Eb** is the **Aeolian mode**, i.e., **natural minor**.

Therefore:

> ✅ **Key: F minor**  
> ✅ **Mode: Aeolian (natural minor)**

Even though the tonic chord (Fm) is absent, the harmonic content and chord functions are rooted in **F minor**. This is an example of a progression implying a key without stating the tonic chord directly — common in modern music.

Alternatively, if we hear **G** as a pedal tone or tonal center despite the instability, one might *analyze* it as **G Locrian**, but that would be **theoretical** rather than functional, due to the lack of resolution and the instability of a diminished tonic.

But in practical tonal harmony, this is best understood as:

> **Key: F minor**  
> **Mode: Aeolian**

✅ **Final Answer:**  
**Key: F minor**  
**Mode: Aeolian**
