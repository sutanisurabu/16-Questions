Let’s break this down step by step.

**1. List the chords with their likely interpretations**

- **Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ (F♭) — fully diminished 7th chord, symmetric.
- **Eb/G** = G Eb G B♭? Wait, Eb/G means Eb major triad with G in bass: Eb = Eb G B♭, so Eb/G is just first inversion.
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ D F with F in bass (first inversion).
- **Ab/G** = Ab C Eb with G in bass — that’s Ab major triad over G bass, creating a dominant 7th-like sound: G B♭ C Eb? No, Ab = Ab C Eb, bass G = G Ab C Eb = Abmaj7/G, which is G–Ab–C–Eb. Enharmonically G–G#–C–D#. That’s an odd polychord but functionally maybe a G7♭9 without the B? Actually G–Ab–C–Eb = G–G#–C–D# = G7♭9 (B is missing though). Could be G half-dim? No, half-dim is G B♭ D♭ F. This is G Ab C Eb = G B♭(C?) Wait, Ab = G#. So G–G#–C–D# = G–G#–C–E#? No, Eb = D#. So G–G#–C–D#. That’s G–G#–C–D#. G# is ♭9, C is ♭5? No, C is P4 from G, but in G7♭9 chord: G B D F Ab. We have G Ab C Eb. Compare: G7♭9 = G B D F Ab. We have C instead of B and Eb instead of D and F. So it’s not G7♭9. Let’s respell: G Ab C Eb = Abmaj7/G = G Ab C Eb. In terms of G root: G (1), Ab (♭9), C (11), Eb (♭13). That’s a G7sus♭9♭13 sound — unusual. Could be functioning as a G altered or G Phrygian dominant chord.

- **Dbmaj7/F** = F Db F Ab C — so Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C, with F in bass.

**2. Look for key clues**

Gdim is often a passing diminished chord in minor keys or as a common-tone diminished in major.  
Eb/G is Eb major (Eb G B♭).  
Bbm/F is B♭ minor (B♭ D♭ F).  
Ab/G we already looked at.  
Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C.

Let’s check possible keys by grouping these chords:

- Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D.  
Chords: Eb (I), Bbm (vi), Ab (V), Gdim? Gdim = G B♭ D♭ F♭ (E) — not in Eb major (has B♭, D♭ not in Eb major — D♭ is ♭6 in Eb major? No, Eb major has D nat, so D♭ is ♭7? Actually Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D. Gdim = G Bb Db Fb(E). Bb is in Eb major, but Db is not (Db is C#), Fb = E nat is not in Eb major (has F). So Gdim not diatonically in Eb major.

- C minor scale (relative minor of Eb major): C D Eb F G Ab Bb C.  
Gdim = G Bb Db Fb(E) — Bb is in C minor, but Db is not (C harmonic minor has B nat, not Bb, but natural minor has Bb, so Db is ♭5? Not in natural minor either). So Gdim not purely diatonic to C natural minor, but in C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B. Gdim = G Bb Db Fb(E) — Bb vs B? Bb is not in C harmonic minor. So Gdim not in C harmonic minor. So Gdim is likely a secondary leading-tone chord or common-tone diminished.

---

**3. Functional progression guess**

Gdim → Eb/G → Gdim → Bbm/F → Ab/G → Gdim → Eb/G → Gdim → Dbmaj7/F → Gdim.

Gdim appears repeatedly, maybe acting as a common-tone diminished of G, or as vii°7 of something.

If Gdim = G B♭ D♭ E (F♭=E), then it’s the vii°7 of A♭ minor (A♭ harmonic minor: Gdim7 = G B♭ D♭ E = vii°7 of A♭m).  
But here it resolves often to Eb/G (Eb major). Eb is VI in A♭ minor — possible: A♭ minor key: chords: Gdim7 (vii°7) → Eb (VI) — a deceptive resolution in A♭ minor.

Also Gdim → Bbm: B♭ minor is iv in F minor? Or v in E♭ minor? Let’s check: Gdim7 in B♭ minor? B♭ min harmonic: B♭ C D♭ Eb F G♭ A♭ B♭. Gdim7 = G B♭ D♭ F♭(E) — G is ♮7? No, B♭ harmonic minor has A♭ as ♮7, so G is ♭7? Actually B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C Db Eb F Gb A B♭. G is not in that scale (has Gb). So Gdim not in B♭ harmonic minor.

---

**4. Try C minor / Eb major context**

In C minor: Gdim7 not diatonic, but could be borrowed?  
But Dbmaj7 is from somewhere else — Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C. That’s ♭IImaj7 in C minor — Neapolitan chord. Yes! In C minor, Dbmaj7 is Nmaj7.  
So likely key is **C minor**.

Check: C minor chords:  
Gdim? Not diatonic but maybe used as a passing chord.  
Eb = III.  
Bbm = v (Bbm in C natural minor).  
Ab/G = Ab major over G — Ab is ♭VII in C minor.  
Dbmaj7 = Nmaj7.  
Gdim could be a chromatic alteration of G half-dim (G B♭ D♭ F) which is viiø7 in C minor — but Gdim7 is G B♭ D♭ E — so they raised F to E — that’s the *dim7* chord from C harmonic minor’s vii°7? No, in C harmonic minor, vii°7 is Bdim7 = B D F A♭. So Gdim7 is unrelated to C harmonic minor’s vii°7.

But Gdim7 = B♭dim7 = D♭dim7 = Edim7 (symmetric). So maybe it’s functioning as Edim7 = E G B♭ D♭, which is vii°7 of F minor. But F minor not present.

---

**5. Look at the final cadence**

Dbmaj7/F → Gdim.  
Dbmaj7 is N in C minor, usually goes to V (G or G7). Gdim is like a rootless G7♭9 (Gdim7 = B♭ D♭ E G; G7♭9 = G B D F A♭; not the same but similar if G in bass — here Gdim has G in bass, so G B♭ D♭ E — that’s G7♭9♭5? Actually G7♭9 = G B D F Ab; replace B with B♭ and D with D♭ and F with E? Not matching. But G B♭ D♭ E = E dim7 with G bass = same as Gdim7. So maybe it’s just a diminished chord used as a dominant substitute.

Given Dbmaj7 (Neapolitan) → Gdim (dominant function) → could resolve to Cm.  
So key is **C minor**.

**6. Mode**

C minor = Aeolian mode if natural minor, but with Dbmaj7 and possibly harmonic minor elements, it’s just standard **minor key** (Aeolian/Harmonic minor mixture).

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{C\ minor}
\]
Key: C minor. Mode: Natural/Harmonic minor (traditional minor key).
