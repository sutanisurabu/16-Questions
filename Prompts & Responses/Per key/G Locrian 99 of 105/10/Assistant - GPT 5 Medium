**Analyzing the vii° triad in Ab major**

The vii° triad uses the scale degrees 7-2-4, specifically G, Bb, and Db. In the context of Ab major, this G dim triad supports the key center. The repeated Gdim suggests the importance of Ab major as the harmonic center. The Eb/G chord acts as the dominant, with G leading up to Ab, creating a pleasing resolution. The presence of Bbm/F indicates that B-flat minor is functioning as ii in Ab major. This arrangement showcases the harmonic relationships effectively.**Examining the Bbm and Ab/G chords**

Bbm consists of Bb, Db, and F, and with F in the bass, it forms a second inversion triad. Then we have Ab/G, which is an Ab major triad over G. It resembles a passing chord, but also could indicate Abmaj7/G if the G is implied as the seventh. With G in the bass, it’s a third inversion of the major seventh chord, where the major seventh (G) is below the root (Ab). This adds complexity to the harmony!**Exploring Ab major and related chords**

Ab/G indeed functions as an Abmaj7 in third inversion, fitting perfectly within the Ab major key, particularly since the major seventh (G natural) is included. Dbmaj7/F also fits as IVmaj7 in Ab major. The recurring G bass notes point strongly to Ab as the tonic. While we don't see the Ab root chord directly, the Ab/G strongly suggests Ab major harmony. The key is clearly Ab major, which can also be considered as F minor, making the Gdim a ii° in that context.**Analyzing Gdim and related chords in F minor**

The Gdim chord fits within F natural minor as a diatonic element. The Eb/G acts as the VII chord with the third in bass, while Bbm/F is in second inversion as the iv chord. Ab/G could represent a bIIImaj7/G within minor, suggesting the Abmaj7/G. The major seventh includes G natural, aligning with the leading tone to Ab. The chord sequence shows a functional flow, leading us through vii°, and V in first inversion, ultimately suggesting a prevalent leading-tone sonority throughout.**Determining the key and mode**

In analyzing the chords, Gdim functions as vii° while Eb/G as V6 and Bbm/F as ii6/4. Ab/G represents Imaj7/7 and Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7/3, all aligning with Ab major's functional harmony. The repeated G bass emphasizes the leading tone. While F minor diatonically aligns, the absence of C or C7 suggests a weaker minor identity. Thus, I conclude the key is Ab major, with the mode being Ionian (major). The harmonic progression remains predominantly focused on Ab major functions.

Key: Ab major
Mode: Ionian (major)

Why:
- Gdim functions as vii° in Ab major.
- Eb/G is V in first inversion (V6).
- Bbm/F is ii in second inversion (ii6/4).
- Ab/G is Abmaj7 with the major 7th in the bass (Imaj7/7).
- Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7 in first inversion.

All chords are diatonic to Ab major, and the repeated G bass prolongs the leading tone/major 7th of Ab. While these chords also fit F natural minor, the lack of a dominant (C or C7) and the strong vii°–V emphasis point to Ab major rather than F minor.
