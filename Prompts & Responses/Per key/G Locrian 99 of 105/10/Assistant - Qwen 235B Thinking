**Assistant - Qwen 235B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, let me try to figure out the key and mode for this chord sequence. The chords given are:

Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim

First, I need to recall what diminished chords usually do. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or as leading tones to other chords. Gdim is G-Bb-Db. Diminished chords can be tricky because they are symmetrical, meaning they repeat every minor third, so Gdim, Bb dim, Db dim, and E dim are all the same notes.

Looking at the chords, there's a lot of Gdim here. Then Eb/G—Eb major with G in the bass. Eb/G is the first inversion of Eb major, which is the V chord in Ab major. Wait, so if Eb is the V, then Ab would be the tonic. But let's check.

Bbm/F is Bb major with F in the bass. Bb is the IV chord in F major, but maybe in another key. Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass. Ab is the bVII in Bb, but maybe related to another scale.

Wait, let's list all the chords with their roots:

Gdim (G), Eb/G (Eb), Bbm/F (Bb), Ab/G (Ab), Dbmaj7/F (Db)

So the roots here are G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. Hmm, these seem to be moving in a circle of fifths or something? Let's see. G to Eb is a minor third down (or major sixth up). Eb to Bb is a perfect fifth down. Bb to Ab is a minor second down. Ab to Db is a perfect fourth down (or fifth up). Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the bass notes since some chords are inversions. The bass notes are: G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G.

Wait, let's parse each chord's bass note:

Gdim (G), Gdim (G), Eb/G (G), Eb/G (G), Gdim (G), Gdim (G), Bbm/F (F), Ab/G (G), Gdim (G), Gdim (G), Eb/G (G), Eb/G (G), Gdim (G), Gdim (G), Dbmaj7/F (F), Gdim (G)

So bass notes: mostly G and F. So the bass is alternating between G and F. So the bass line is G-G-G-G-G-G-F-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-F-G

Hmm. That suggests maybe the key is centered around G, but Gdim is a chord that's not diatonic to G major or minor. In G natural minor, the diatonic diminished chord would be Bdim (B-D-F). Gdim would be out of key.

Wait, maybe it's in Ab major? Let's check. Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So in Ab major, the diatonic chords would have G as the 7th scale degree, so Gdim would be the vii° chord. Oh! So in Ab major, the leading tone chord is Gdim. That makes sense. So Gdim is vii° in Ab major.

Let's see if other chords fit. Eb/G: Eb is the V chord in Ab (since Ab's V is Eb). Eb/G is first inversion V chord. That works. Bbm/F: Bb is the IV chord in Ab. Bb major is IV in Ab (since Ab major scale: IV is Db? Wait no. Wait Ab major scale is Ab Bb C Db Eb F G. So I: Ab, ii: Bbm, iii: Cm, IV: Db, V: Eb, vi: Fm, vii°: Gdim.

Wait hold on, in Ab major, IV should be Db, not Bb. Wait Bb would be the ii chord, but as major? No, in major keys, the ii chord is minor. So Bb major would be a borrowed chord or something else.

Hmm, maybe this is in G minor? Let's check G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So diatonic chords: i: Gm, ii°: Adim, III: Bb, iv: Cm, v: Dm, VI: Eb, VII: F.

Wait Gdim isn't in G natural minor. Gdim would have G-Bb-Db, but in G natural minor the notes are G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F. So the third scale degree is Bb, but Db isn't in the scale. So Gdim isn't diatonic to G natural minor.

G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#. The v chord becomes D major, and there's an augmented ii, but Gdim still isn't there. Wait harmonic minor raises the 7th, so F becomes F#, but Gdim is G-Bb-Db, which still has Db, not in the scale.

Wait maybe it's in a different mode. Let's think about the chords again.

We have a lot of Gdim, which is G-Bb-Db. Then Eb/G (Eb major with G bass), which is G-Bb-Eb. Bbm/F is F-Ab-Bb. Ab/G is G-Ab-Cb? Wait Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so Ab/G would be G-Ab-C-Eb? Wait no, Ab major triad is Ab, C, Eb. So Ab/G is G in the bass, so the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. Similarly, Dbmaj7/F is F-Ab-C-Db.

Wait, maybe looking at all the chord tones:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb

Bbm/F: F, Ab, Bb

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb (assuming Ab major triad, but wait Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so inversion with G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb)

Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Db

So collecting all the notes used:

G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C

Let's list them:

G, Ab, A? No, wait Ab is there. Wait:

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G adds Eb

Bbm/F adds F, Ab

Ab/G adds C (since Ab major is Ab-C-Eb)

Dbmaj7/F adds C and Db, and F, Ab

Wait, so notes present: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

That's a scale: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. Let's arrange in order:

G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. This is the same as the Ab major scale starting on G. Wait, Ab major is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So starting on G, it's G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. Which is the G Locrian mode.

Locrian mode is the 7th mode of the major scale, which has a diminished tonic chord. So in Ab major, the 7th degree is G, so G Locrian would have Gdim as the i chord.

Let's confirm: G Locrian notes are G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. Yes, exactly the notes we have here.

Check if chords make sense in G Locrian.

i°: Gdim (matches)

II: Ab major (Ab/G is Ab major in first inversion)

iii: Bb major (Bbm/F? Wait no, in Locrian, the iii should be Bb minor? Wait hold on, modes have specific chord qualities.

Wait Locrian mode: since it's the 7th mode of major, the chords are built as follows:

In G Locrian (from Ab major):

i°: G-Bb-Db

II: Ab-C-Eb (Ab major)

iii°: Bb-Db-F (Bbdim? Wait no. Wait scale degrees:

G Locrian: G (1), Ab (b2), Bb (b3), C (4), Db (b5), Eb (b6), F (b7)

So triads:

i: G-Bb-Db = diminished (correct)

II: Ab-C-Eb = major

iii: Bb-Db-F = diminished? Wait, Bb-Db-F is Bb diminished? No, Bb-Db-Fb would be diminished, but F is natural here. Wait Bb-Db-F: Db to F is major third (Db-Eb-F is two semitones? Wait interval from Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third (Db-Eb-F = two semitones? Wait Db to F is actually a major third: Db-Eb-F is two whole steps? Wait no:

Wait Db to Eb is major second, Eb to F is major second, so Db to F is major third (4 semitones: Db-D-Eb-E-F? No, better to count semitones:

Db to F: Db to D is 1, D to Eb 2, Eb to E 3, E to F 4? No, wait:

Db to E is 3 semitones (Db-D-Eb-E), but F is one semitone above E, so Db to F is 4 semitones? Wait no:

Wait standard semitone count:

C to C# is 1, C to D is 2, etc.

Db to E: Db to D is 1, D to Eb 2, Eb to E 3, so Db to E is 3 semitones? Wait actually, easier to use absolute:

Db = 1, D = 2, Eb = 3, E = 4, F = 5, so Db to F is 5 - 1 = 4 semitones? Wait maybe I should just recall intervals.

Bb to Db: minor third (3 semitones)

Db to F: major third (4 semitones)

So Bb-Db-F is a minor triad? Wait no: minor triad is minor third + major third. Wait minor triad: root, minor third (3 semitones), perfect fifth (7 semitones). Major triad: root, major third (4), perfect fifth (7). Diminished is root, minor third, diminished fifth (6 semitones).

So Bb-Db-F: Bb to Db is minor third (3 semitones), Db to F is major third (4 semitones), so total Bb to F is 7 semitones (perfect fifth). Wait that's Bb minor triad? Wait no: Bb-Db-F is Bb minor, since minor triad is root, minor third, perfect fifth. Yes, because Bb to Db is minor third, Bb to F is perfect fifth.

Wait hold on, so in G Locrian (scale degrees 1, b2, b3, 4, b5, b6, b7), the iii chord is built on b3, which is Bb:

Bb (b3), C (4), Db (b5)? Wait no, chord built on third degree would be Bb, C, Eb? Wait no, need to take every other note.

Wait, for triads in the mode:

Starting on G (1): G, Bb, Db (1, b3, b5) -> diminished

Starting on Ab (b2): Ab, C, Eb (b2, 4, b6) -> since C is natural in Ab major, which is the 3rd scale degree of Ab major, so Ab-C-Eb is major (b2, natural 4, b6? Wait scale degrees in G Locrian:

1=G, 2=Ab, 3=Bb, 4=C, 5=Db, 6=Eb, 7=F

Wait no, mode degrees are:

G Locrian: 1=G, 2=Ab (b2), 3=Bb (b3), 4=C (4), 5=Db (b5), 6=Eb (b6), 7=F (b7)

So building triads by 1,3,5:

i: G, Bb, Db (1, b3, b5) = diminished

ii: Ab, C, Eb (b2, 4, b6) = Ab major (since C is natural, Eb is b6)

III: Bb, Db, F (b3, b5, b7) = Bb diminished? Wait Bb-Db-F: Db is b5 of G, but as a triad on Bb: the third is Db (minor third above Bb), fifth is F (which is a diminished fifth from Bb, since Bb to F is perfect fifth, but in the key... Wait interval from Bb to F: normally perfect fifth, but since in G Locrian the 5th degree is Db (b5), does that affect it? Wait no, intervals are absolute.

Bb to F: 7 semitones, which is perfect fifth. Wait but Bb-D is major third, D-F is minor third, but Bb to Db is minor third (3 semitones), Db to F is major third (4 semitones), so Bb-Db-F is a minor triad? Wait no: minor triad is root, minor third (3 semitones), perfect fifth (7 semitones). Bb to Db is 3 semitones (minor third), Bb to F is 7 semitones (perfect fifth). So yes, Bb minor triad. But in G Locrian, the chord on Bb (the b3) would be minor? Hmm, but earlier I thought maybe Bb major.

Wait in our chord sequence we have Bbm/F. So Bb minor chord. Which matches if it's the iii chord in G Locrian. Wait but in the chord list it's written as Bbm/F. So Bb minor.

Earlier I thought it was Bb major, but if it's Bbm, then yes. Wait the user wrote "Bbm/F", which is Bb minor with F in bass. So that's a minor chord.

Similarly, Ab/G: if it's Ab major, but in G Locrian, Ab would be the II chord, which is major as we saw.

Let's re-express all chords in terms of G Locrian:

Gdim is i°

Eb/G: Eb is the bVI chord in G Locrian? Wait scale degrees:

G Locrian: 1=G, b2=Ab, b3=Bb, 4=C, b5=Db, b6=Eb, b7=F

So chords:

bVI would be Eb. What's the quality? Eb triad: Eb, G, Bb. In G Locrian, G is 1, Bb is b3, so Eb-G-Bb is Eb major (since G is natural relative to Eb? Wait Eb major scale has G natural, yes. So Eb major is the bVI chord in G Locrian.

Similarly, Bbm is iii (Bb minor: Bb, Db, F. Wait Bb-Db-F: Bb minor, yes. Because Db is the b5 of the G Locrian scale, but as a third in the Bb triad, it's a minor third (Bb to Db). Fifth is F, which is the b7 of G, but as fifth in Bb triad it's perfect fifth.

Ab is bII major (Ab, C, Eb)

Dbmaj7 would be the bV degree. Db is the b5, so Db major? Wait Db triad in G Locrian: Db, F, Ab. Which is Db major (F is the natural 3rd for Db major). But in G Locrian, Db is the b5, so the chord on Db would be Db major, making it a bV major chord.

So let's map:

Gdim = i°

Eb/G = bVI chord (Eb major) in first inversion

Bbm/F = iii chord (Bb minor) in first inversion

Ab/G = bII chord (Ab major) in first inversion

Dbmaj7/F = bV major 7th chord in first inversion

So putting it all together, the chord progression is heavily centered around i° (Gdim), with movements to bVI, iii, bII, bV.

This seems to be in G Locrian mode.

But let's check common cadences or typical progressions. Locrian is rare because of the diminished tonic chord, making it unstable, but it's possible.

Another way: since all these chords fit in Ab major scale (since G Locrian is the 7th mode of Ab major), but the tonic here seems to be G because of the frequent Gdim and bass notes staying on G. The piece starts and ends on Gdim, with the bass mostly on G, suggesting G is the tonic.

Therefore, the key is G, and the mode is Locrian.

Wait but just to make sure, could it be another mode?

Let's think about the chords again. The Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th. Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. So with F in bass, it's F-Ab-C-Db.

If we consider the entire set of notes, as I did before: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. That's G Locrian, as it's the same as Ab major.

Another check: In G Locrian, dominant chord would be... but Locrian has a b5, so the V chord is diminished. Not much of a dominant. But here we have Eb as a chord, which is bVI. Eb major's dominant would be Ab, which is here as bII.

It's common in jazz or modal pieces to have a static tonic with passing chords. Given the repeated Gdim chords, and other chords moving chromatically or diatonically within the Locrian scale, it seems likely to be G Locrian.

Wait, but let's see another angle. Sometimes diminished chords are used as passing chords between major/minor chords. Here Gdim appears between chords with G in the bass. For example, Gdim to Eb/G: both have G bass, so the upper notes move Bb-Db to Bb-Eb? Not sure.

Alternatively, considering that Gdim is often used as a substitute for a dominant chord a half-step above. For example, Gdim could act as a V7b9 for Ab. Since Gdim is part of Ab7b9 (Ab-C-Eb-Gb-Bb), wait Gdim is G-Bb-Db, which is actually the upper structure of Ab7: G would be the major seventh of Ab, but dim chord is different.

Wait, diminished chords can function as dominant chords. Specifically, a diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone (in minor keys) often serves a dominant function. But here it's a half-diminished or fully diminished? Gdim as written probably means fully diminished (G-Bb-Db-F), but the user wrote "Gdim" which can be ambiguous. Wait, in chord symbols, "dim" usually means fully diminished seventh, but sometimes triad. Wait in the list, it's "Gdim" repeated, and other chords like Dbmaj7. The presence of Dbmaj7 suggests seventh chords are specified, so "Gdim" might be triad. Hmm.

Wait user wrote "Gdim" multiple times. In many contexts, Gdim as a triad is G-Bb-Db, and fully diminished seventh would be Gdim7 = G-Bb-Db-F. Since there's a Dbmaj7, which is four-note chord, it's possible that Gdim here is triad. Let's assume they are triads for now.

So Gdim triad: G-Bb-Db

Eb/G: Eb major triad with G in bass: G-Bb-Eb

Bbm/F: Bb minor triad with F in bass: F-Ab-Bb

Ab/G: Ab major triad with G in bass: G-Ab-C-Eb? Wait triad would be Ab-C-Eb, so inversion with G bass: G-Ab-C-Eb? No, triad only has three notes. Wait Ab/G would be G-Ab-Eb (if triad), but actually bass note G and chord Ab, so notes G (bass), Ab, C, Eb? No, confusion here.

Wait, chord symbols like Ab/G mean play Ab chord with G as bass note. Ab major triad is Ab-C-Eb, so Ab/G would have notes G, Ab, C, Eb. Depending on instrumentation, but essentially four notes. Similarly, Eb/G is G, Bb, Eb.

So let's consider all chord tones:

Gdim (triad): G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb

Bbm/F: F, Ab, Bb

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb (assuming Ab major triad + G bass)

Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Db

So all notes involved: G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, F#

Wait no, specific notes:

G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C

No sharps or other flats. So the notes are G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. As before.

This set corresponds to G Locrian (Ab major scale starting on G).

Alternatively, could it be another scale? Let's see:

G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F – this is a seven-note scale with semitones between G-Ab, Db-Eb, and F-G? Wait intervals:

G to Ab: semitone

Ab to Bb: whole tone

Bb to C: whole tone

C to Db: semitone

Db to Eb: whole tone

Eb to F: whole tone

F to G: semitone

Wait that's the pattern for Locrian mode: semitone, whole, whole, semitone, whole, whole, whole? No, wait standard Locrian mode (from major scale's 7th degree) has intervals:

half, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half? Wait no.

Wait Ionian (major) intervals: W W H W W W H

So starting from 7th degree for Locrian:

H W H W W H W W ? Wait no, better:

The Locrian mode has the following step pattern: semitone, whole tone, semitone, whole tone, whole tone, whole tone, semitone? Wait no.

Wait let's take Ab major: Ab (W) Bb (W) C (H) Db (W) Eb (W) F (W) G (H) Ab

So steps: W W H W W W H

Thus, G Locrian would start at G: G (H) Ab (W) Bb (W) C (H) Db (W) Eb (W) F (W) G? Wait no, the intervals between degrees:

Between G and Ab: semitone (H)

Ab to Bb: whole (W)

Bb to C: whole (W)

C to Db: semitone (H)

Db to Eb: whole (W)

Eb to F: whole (W)

F to G: Whole? Wait F to G is whole tone. Wait but in Ab major, G to Ab is semitone.

Wait the scale degrees intervals for G Locrian:

1 (G) to b2 (Ab): H

b2 to b3 (Bb): W

b3 to 4 (C): W

4 to b5 (Db): H

b5 to b6 (Eb): W

b6 to b7 (F): W

b7 to 8 (G): W? Wait no, from F to G is a whole tone, but in Ab major scale, the last interval is G to Ab which is H, but the interval from F to G in Ab major is W.

Wait, yes, in Ab major: F to G is whole tone, G to Ab is semitone.

Thus, G Locrian step pattern:

H, W, W, H, W, W, W

Yes, that's correct for Locrian: half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole.

So G Locrian: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Which matches our notes.

Therefore, the key center is G, and the mode is Locrian.

Another check: common chords in Locrian. The tonic chord is diminished, which matches the frequent Gdim. The other chords:

bII: Ab major

biii: Bb minor (as we have Bbm)

bIV: C minor? Wait not sure. Wait scale degrees:

In G Locrian:

i°: Gdim

bII: Ab

biii: Bbm

iv: Cdim? Wait chord on C (4th degree): C-Eb-Gb? Wait in G Locrian, 4th degree is C natural. Triad built on C: C, Eb, Gb (but Gb is not in our scale; our scale has G natural and F). Wait no, G Locrian notes are G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. So chord on C would be C, Eb, G. But G is the tonic, which is a major third above Eb? Eb to G is major third, so C minor triad (C-Eb-G). Wait C-Eb-G is C minor.

Wait confusion arises because depending on mode, the triads change. But in our chord progression, we don't have a chord on C, but we do have Ab and Bbm.

In any case, the preponderance of G in the bass with Gdim chords, and all notes fitting G Locrian, it's safe to say the mode is G Locrian.

But just to check another possibility: could this be in Ab major with some modal mixture?

In Ab major, Gdim is the vii° chord. Often vii° substitutes for V, but here we have Eb as V. The progression could be centered around Ab, but the bass stays on G and F, not Ab.

The chord progression moves Gdim - Eb/G - etc., so bass on G a lot, suggesting G is the tonic.

Another angle: tritone substitution? Not sure.

Or maybe it's a jazz progression where Gdim is used as a passing chord between chords with G bass. But the repetition of Gdim suggests it's more structural.

Wait, let's look at the entire sequence:

Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim

So grouping:

[Gdim x2, Eb/G x2, Gdim x2, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim x2, Eb/G x2, Gdim x2, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim]

So the progression cycles through variations of Gdim interrupted by Eb/G, then later Bbm/F and Ab/G, then back, and finally Dbmaj7/F leading back to Gdim.

In G Locrian, Db is the b5, so Db major is a characteristic sound (major chord on the fifth scale degree, which is flattened). Dbmaj7/F would be a chord from the mode.

Also, Ab is b2, major chord; Eb is b6, major; Bb is b3, minor.

This fits Locrian's harmony.

Another mode: could it be C Phrygian? Wait C Phrygian is C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Doesn't match our notes which include C and Db but also G as central.

Wait our note collection is G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. So possible modes:

- G Locrian (Ab major)

- Ab Ionian (Ab major)

- Bb Aeolian (Bb natural minor)

- etc.

But given the emphasis on G root chords (Gdim throughout), it's pointing to G modal center.

If it were Ab major, we'd expect Ab as a strong tonic, but the progression doesn't land on Ab much—it's more centered around G.

Bbm/F is F-Ab-Bb, which is Bb minor first inversion. In Bb Aeolian (Bb natural minor), scale is Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. But we have G natural instead of Gb, so no.

Wait our notes have G natural, not Gb. So Bb Aeolian would have Gb, but we have G natural, so not Aeolian.

Similarly, C Dorian would have C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. We don't have D or A.

So sticking with G Locrian seems best.

Potential confirmation: the Dbmaj7 chord. Db is the b5 in G Locrian, so a major chord there is characteristic of Locrian (since the fifth is flattened but the chord is major). In contrast, in most other modes, b5 would be a diminished or minor chord, but Locrian here borrows from the major scale's bV.

Wait, actually in Locrian mode, the fifth degree chord (b5) would be diminished if diatonic, but wait no:

In G Locrian, scale: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

Chord on Db (b5): Db, F, Ab. Which is Db major. Because F and Ab are natural in this scale (F is the b7, Ab is the b2). Wait F is a major third above Db, yes: Db to F is major third (4 semitones), so Db major triad. So the b5 chord is major in Locrian mode. That is a characteristic of Locrian—in the natural mode, the b5 chord is major. Wait, is that correct?

Wait scale degrees for chord on Db (b5):

Db (b5), Eb (b6), F (b7), G (1), Ab (b2), Bb (b3), C (4)

Triad on Db: Db, F, Ab

Db to F is major third (Db-Eb-F is two semitones? Wait no, Db to F is a major third: 4 semitones.

Db to D = 1, D to Eb = 2, Eb to E = 3, E to F = 4. Yes, 4 semitones.

F to Ab is minor third (3 semitones). So Db-F-Ab is a major triad (root, major third, perfect fifth). Yes, because Db to F is major third, Db to Ab is perfect fifth (7 semitones).

So yes, in G Locrian, the bV (Db) chord is major. Hence Dbmaj7 makes sense here.

Similarly, Eb (bVI) is major: Eb-G-Bb.

Ab (bII) is major: Ab-C-Eb.

Bb (bIII) would be minor: Bb-Db-F.

Which matches our chords: Bbm.

Therefore, all the chords fit diatonically into G Locrian.

Thus, the key is G, and the mode is Locrian.

The chord progression provided is deeply rooted in **G Locrian mode**, part of the **Ab major scale** (since Locrian is the 7th mode of a major scale). Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Key and Mode**
- **Key**: **G**  
- **Mode**: **Locrian**  
- **Parent Scale**: **Ab major** (G Locrian = Ab major starting on G)  
- **Notes in Scale**: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**  

---

### **Why G Locrian?**
1. **Tonic Emphasis**:  
   - The progression starts, ends, and frequently returns to **Gdim**, with the **bass rooted on G** (except for two instances of F).  
   - In Locrian, the **tonic chord is diminished** (i°), which aligns perfectly with the repeated Gdim.

2. **Chord Analysis** (within G Locrian):  
   - **Gdim (i°)**: Tonic chord (G-Bb-Db), characteristic of Locrian.  
   - **Eb/G (bVI)**: Eb major (Bb minor third, Eb perfect fifth) — diatonic to Locrian.  
   - **Bbm/F (iii)**: Bb minor (Bb-Db-F) — natural iii chord in Locrian.  
   - **Ab/G (bII)**: Ab major (Ab-C-Eb) — diatonic bII chord.  
   - **Dbmaj7/F (bV)**: Db major 7th (Db-F-Ab-C) — unique to Locrian, where the bV chord is **major** (unlike Phrygian or other modes).

3. **Scale Consistency**:  
   All chord tones (G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F) fit precisely within **G Locrian** (Ab major scale starting on G). No chromatic alterations or borrowed chords are required.

4. **Harmonic Function**:  
   - The **bV (Dbmaj7)** and **bII (Ab)** chords are signature Locrian harmonies.  
   - The **bVI (Eb)** acts as a strong submediant, reinforcing the mode’s dissonant yet functional cadence toward Gdim.

---

### **Why Not Another Mode?**
- **Ab Major?**  
  While Ab major shares the same notes, the **bass and tonal center never resolve to Ab**. The progression overwhelmingly emphasizes **G** as the gravitational point.  
- **Bb Aeolian?**  
  Bb natural minor would require **Gb** (not G natural) — incompatible with the scale.  
- **Other Modes?**  
  Phrygian, Dorian, or Mixolydian would introduce incompatible intervals (e.g., major 3rd, natural 5th) not present here.

---

### **Conclusion**
The progression is **firmly in G Locrian**, leveraging its signature diminished tonic and flattened scale degrees (b2, b3, b5, b6, b7). This mode’s dissonant quality (especially Gdim as the tonic) suits the unresolved, cyclical nature of the progression.

**Final Answer**:  
**Key = G, Mode = Locrian** (G Locrian, derived from Ab major).
