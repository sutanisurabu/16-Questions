To determine the key and mode of this chord progression, let’s analyze the chords and look for tonal centers, functional relationships, and possible key signatures.

### Given Chord Progression:
```
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim
```

### Step 1: Identify chord qualities and roots

- **Gdim**: G–B♭–D♭ (fully diminished triad)
- **Eb/G**: Eb major with G in the bass → G–B♭–Eb
- **Bbm/F**: B♭ minor with F in the bass → F–B♭–D♭
- **Ab/G**: Ab major with G in the bass (Ab–C–Eb over G) → G–Ab–C–Eb (essentially G as a bass note under Ab major)
- **Dbmaj7/F**: Db major 7 with F in bass → F–Ab–Db–C

Note: Gdim appears very frequently—possibly a pedal or tonal anchor.

### Step 2: Look for a possible tonal center

The chord **Gdim** uses the notes: **G – B♭ – D♭**

This is a symmetrical chord (diminished triad = stacked minor thirds). It’s enharmonically equivalent to:
- B♭dim (B♭–D♭–F♭ ≈ E)
- D♭dim (D♭–F♭–A♭♭ ≈ G)
- Edim (E–G–B♭)

Because of this symmetry, Gdim can resolve or function in several keys.

However, the frequent use of **Eb/G** (Eb major with G in bass) suggests **G** may be acting as a bass pedal or even a temporary tonal center.

Also, **Ab/G** is an unusual chord—it's an Ab major triad over G, which creates a **G–Ab–C–Eb** cluster. This sounds like a **G7♭9** without the fifth (G–B♭–D–F–Ab), but here we don’t have D or F—so maybe not.

Wait: **Ab/G = G–Ab–C–Eb** → This is identical to **G half-diminished (Gø7)** if you reinterpret Ab as G# (but that’s not quite right enharmonically).

Alternatively, consider that many of these chords contain notes from **G harmonic minor** or **G natural minor**:

- G natural minor: G A B♭ C D E♭ F G  
- G harmonic minor: G A B♭ C D E♭ F# G

But we see **Db (C#)** in **Dbmaj7/F**, which contains **Db, F, Ab, C** → that C is **major 7** of Db.

So **C natural** appears—this contradicts **G harmonic minor** (which has F#), but fits **G natural minor** (F natural).

Wait—but **C natural** is also in **Eb major** (Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D).

In fact, **Eb major** contains:
- Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D

Check chord notes:

- **Gdim**: G–B♭–D♭ → D♭ is **not** in Eb major (Eb major has D natural)
- So Gdim introduces **D♭**, which is **chromatic** in Eb.

But **Dbmaj7** contains **Db, F, Ab, C** → all of which are in **Ab major** (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G)

Check **Ab major scale**: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

- Gdim = G–Bb–Db → all in Ab major! (G = leading tone, Bb = supertonic, Db = subdominant)
- Eb/G = Eb (I in Eb, but also **iii** in C minor or **V** in Ab? Wait: in **Ab major**, Eb is the **V chord** → Eb major = V of Ab)
- Bbm = Bb–Db–F → this is **ii** in Ab major
- Ab = I in Ab major
- Db = IV in Ab major
- Dbmaj7/F = first inversion of Dbmaj7 → still IVmaj7 in Ab

So **everything fits into Ab major** except perhaps the persistent **G bass**.

But note:
- G is the **leading tone** in Ab major.
- Gdim is the **vii° chord** in Ab major → naturally occurs.
- Eb/G = V6 (first inversion of V chord) in Ab → very common.
- Bbm/F = ii6 in Ab major
- Ab/G = I with leading tone in bass → a type of **cadential 6/4** or **leading-tone bass**—used for tension before resolution.
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in first inversion → also diatonic to Ab major (though IV is more common in minor; in major, it’s a **modal mixture** or **subdominant color**)

Wait: **Db is not diatonic to Ab major**—Ab major has **D natural**, not **Db**.

Hold on! Let's double-check:

**Ab major scale**: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G → yes! **Db is the 4th scale degree**. So **Db is diatonic**.

So **Dbmaj7** is the **IVmaj7** chord in Ab major. That’s **not typical in classical harmony** (IV is usually major triad, but maj7 is jazz/pop extension), but it’s **diatonic**.

So all chords are diatonic to **Ab major**, with G as the leading tone.

Now why is **Gdim** so persistent? Because it’s **vii°**, and using it as a pedal or repeated chord creates tension that wants to resolve to **Ab**.

Also, **Eb/G** is **V6**, which also leads to I.

**Ab/G** is a bit unusual—**Ab over G** is essentially a **G bass under tonic**, giving a strong pull to resolve (G → Ab voice leading).

So the harmonic motion is **circling around Ab**, using its diatonic chords, especially the leading tone (G) in bass.

Thus, the key is likely **Ab major**.

But could it be **F minor**?

F minor scale: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

- Gdim = G–Bb–Db → **ii°** in F minor (yes!)
- Eb/G = Eb major over G → Eb is **VII** in F minor
- Bbm/F = Bbm = **iv** in F minor
- Ab/G = Ab = **bVI** in F minor
- Dbmaj7 = **bIII** in F minor

So all chords also fit **F minor**!

Now which is more plausible?

- **Gdim as ii°** in F minor vs **vii°** in Ab major
- In minor keys, ii° is common, but in major keys, vii° is less emphasized but still used.
- However, the **persistent G bass** suggests **G as a leading tone → Ab**, not as a supertonic → F.

Also, **Dbmaj7** is **bIII** in F minor (modal mixture from F major) but is **IV** in Ab major—more naturally diatonic.

But **Eb chord**: in F minor, Eb is **VII**, which is common. In Ab major, Eb is **V**, which is **strongly functional**.

The presence of **Eb (V)** going to **Ab (I)** suggests **Ab major**.

Moreover, the final chord is **Gdim**, not resolving—but if it’s a fragment, the expected resolution would be to **Ab**.

Also, **Ab/G** strongly implies **G → Ab** voice leading.

### Step 3: Consider mode

If key is **Ab major**, mode is **Ionian**.

But the frequent use of diminished chords and minor iv-like sounds might suggest **minor**, but all chords fit **Ab major** without requiring modal mixture.

Wait—**Bbm** is **ii** in Ab major → that’s **minor ii**, which is normal in major keys (ii chord is minor).

Everything checks out for **Ab major**.

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: **A♭ major**
- **Mode**: **Ionian (major)**

The progression makes extensive use of the leading tone (G) and dominant (Eb) to create tension around the tonic Ab, even if Ab major isn’t explicitly stated as a root-position chord until possibly implied by **Ab/G**.

Thus, the tonal center is **Ab**, and the mode is **major (Ionian)**.
