Let's analyze the chords to determine the key and mode:

### Chords:
Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Bbm/F | Ab/G | Gdim | Gdim | Eb/G | Eb/G | Gdim | Gdim | Dbmaj7/F | Gdim

---

### Step 1: Identify the root notes and chord qualities

- **Gdim**: G diminished triad (G–Bb–Db)
- **Eb/G**: Eb major triad in first inversion (Eb–G–Bb, with G in bass)
- **Bbm/F**: Bb minor triad in first inversion (Bb–Db–F, with F in bass)
- **Ab/G**: Ab major triad in second inversion (Ab–C–Eb, with G in bass)
- **Dbmaj7/F**: Dbmaj7 in first inversion (Db–F–Ab–C, with F in bass)

---

### Step 2: Look for tonal center

The **Gdim** chord appears **8 times** out of 16 chords — it's clearly the **center of gravity**.

So, we ask:  
> What key or mode has **G as the root** and features **G diminished** so prominently?

---

### Step 3: Analyze the scale that fits Gdim and the surrounding chords

G diminished triad = G–Bb–Db  
This is **stacked minor thirds**, which implies **diminished harmony**, not diatonic to major or natural minor.

But we also see:

- **Eb major** (Eb–G–Bb)
- **Bb minor** (Bb–Db–F)
- **Ab major** (Ab–C–Eb)
- **Db major 7** (Db–F–Ab–C)

These chords suggest **Eb major** or **Bb minor** as the **parent scale**.

---

### Step 4: Check if Gdim is a **passing chord** or **functional**

Gdim is **not diatonic** to Eb major or Bb minor.  
But **Gdim** can be interpreted as:

- **vii°7 of Ab major** (G is the leading tone to Ab)
- **iii°7 of Eb major** (Gdim as iii° is rare, but possible in chromatic passages)
- **i°7 in G diminished scale** (but G is not the tonic of a key)

However, **Gdim** is **not resolving to Ab**, so it's **not functioning as vii°7/Ab**.

Instead, the **Gdim** is **static** — it keeps returning, suggesting **G is the tonal center**, and the **mode is based on G diminished**.

---

### Final Determination:

- **Tonal center**: G
- **Chord quality**: Diminished
- **Scale**: **G diminished scale** (octatonic)
- **Mode**: **G diminished mode** (not a traditional mode like Dorian or Phrygian, but a **symmetric diminished tonality**)

---

### ✅ Answer:
**Key: G**  
**Mode: Diminished (G diminished tonality)**
