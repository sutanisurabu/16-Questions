This piece is in the **key of G minor** (specifically, it uses the **harmonic minor scale** for much of the motion).

Here is the breakdown of why, using Roman numeral analysis and consideration of unusual chords:

* **Key Tonal Center:** The progression begins and features frequent returns to **Gdim** (G-Bb-Db). While a diminished triad is not usually a tonic, in a minor key context, the **harmonic minor scale** raises the 7th (**F#**) and creates a strong **leading tone function**. However, the progression's root movement often centers on G and Bb/Eb.

* **Analyzing the Chords:**
    * **Gdim:** Diminished chord built on the tonic/root (G). In Gm harmonic minor (G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F#), the tonic diminished triad (using the lowered 3rd and lowered 5th from the parallel major) is common as a color chord or a transitional dominant.
    * **Eb/G (i6/4 or IIIb/V):** This is an inversion of the Eb major chord, which is the **bVI** (submediant) in G minor. The presence of the G root reinforces the centrality of G.
    * **Bbm/F:** This is not a standard diatonic chord in G minor. The Bb minor chord (Bb-Db-F) is the **bIII** chord. Placing F in the bass makes it a common tone with the Gdim that follows.
    * **Ab/G:** The Ab Major chord is the **bII** (Neapolitan) chord in G minor. This is a very common chord in minor keys, often leading to the dominant. Placing G in the bass here is very striking, acting as a dissonant suspension or pedal point underneath the Neapolitan.
    * **Dbmaj7/F:** The Dbmaj7 (Db-F-Ab-C) contains notes from the Ab chord (Db and Ab are roots/3rds of Ab). This is essentially an extension of the Neapolitan tonality, momentarily emphasizing the key of Db major, which is far removed from G minor. However, both Db and Eb are common in G minor's relative keys and chromatic colorings.

* **Focusing on the Root Movement and Phrasing:**
    The progression is dominated by the tonic root (G) and the bVI (Eb), moving through various colorations (Gdim, Eb/G).

**Conclusion:**

The piece is in **G minor**.

The **mode** is best described as **G natural minor (Aeolian)** with heavy use of **chromaticism** and **Neapolitan Harmony (Ab)**. The constant use of Gdim (G-Bb-Db) also suggests elements of the **Harmonic Minor** scale (which would include an F# if used as a dominant leading tone, but here the lowered 5th, Db, is prominent instead).

* **Key:** **G Minor**
* **Mode:** Primarily **Aeolian (Natural Minor)** with **Chromatic Alterations** and heavy use of **Neapolitan (Phrygian) Harmony**. The specific diminished chord on G (Gdim) is a common voicing in the minor key when using non-functional harmony or modal interchange.
