Let's analyze the given chord progression step by step:  

**Progression:**
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F  Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

---

### 1. Identify the chords involved

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db  
- **Eb/G** = G–Bb–Eb  
- **Bbm/F** = F–Bb–Db  
- **Ab/G** = G–Ab–C–Eb  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F–Ab–Db–C

---

### 2. Take note of the pitch collection that appears

From those chords, the pitches used are:
**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

That’s **seven notes**.

Arranging them from G upwards:  
**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G**

That scale looks like **G Locrian** — the 7th mode of **Ab major**.

In other words, **G Locrian** is:
G – Ab – Bb – C – Db – Eb – F.

---

### 3. Check functionally if the chords fit G Locrian

- **Gdim (G–Bb–Db)** = i° (tonic diminished)
- **Eb/G (Eb–G–Bb)** = VI⁶ (fits the key signature of Ab major)
- **Bbm/F (Bb–Db–F)** = iv⁶
- **Ab/G (Ab–C–Eb–G)** = bVIImaj7(#5)? Well, it’s more like a major seventh built on the lowered seventh degree (Ab) with G as bass — a borrowed color chord, still diatonic to Ab major.
- **Dbmaj7/F (Db–F–Ab–C)** = bIIImaj7⁶ — also diatonic to Ab major (the parent key).

All of these chords fit comfortably under the diatonic collection of **Ab major**.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**
The chords all use notes from **Ab major**, but with **G** as a recurring bass/root of the tonic diminished chord, giving that *Locrian* feel.

### **Key and Mode:**  
**G Locrian (mode of Ab major).**

**Parent key:** Ab major  
**Modal center:** G
