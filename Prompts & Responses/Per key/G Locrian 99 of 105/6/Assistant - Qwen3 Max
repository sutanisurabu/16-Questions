To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Look for Tonal Center / Resolution

The progression keeps returning to **Gdim**, which suggests **G** might be a focal point. However, diminished chords are symmetrical and ambiguous—they can function in multiple keys.

But also notice:
- **Eb/G**: This is an **Eb major chord with G in the bass** → essentially a **first-inversion Eb major** chord (Eb = root, G = third).
- **Bbm/F**: Bb minor with F in the bass → first-inversion Bb minor.
- **Ab/G**: Ab major with G in the bass → this is an **Ab major chord over G**, which is essentially a **G7♭9 without the root** (G–B♭–D♭–F–A♭), a dominant chord.
- **Dbmaj7/F**: Db major 7 with F in the bass → this is **F as the third of Db**, so again first-inversion Db major 7.

So we’re seeing chords built from **Eb**, **Bb**, **Ab**, **Db**, and **G**.

Look at how these relate:

- **Eb major key**: Contains Eb, Ab, Bb, Db (as the 6th degree, but **Db is not diatonic to Eb major**—Db is the ♭6, which is from **Eb minor**).
- **Gdim**: G–B♭–D♭–F (fully diminished 7th would include F, but even triad is G–B♭–D♭). The notes of Gdim (G–B♭–D♭) appear in **Ab harmonic minor** and **E♭ minor**.

Let’s test **Eb minor** (key signature: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭ — but natural minor has C♮; harmonic minor raises C to C♮→C♯? Wait, no: **Eb natural minor** = Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db — but that’s messy. Better to think in terms of **enharmonic equivalents**.)

Alternatively, consider **Ab major**:
- Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G
- Chords: Dbmaj7 is the **IV** chord in Ab major.
- Eb is the **V** chord in Ab major → but Eb/G is just Eb major in 1st inversion → fits.
- Bbm is the **ii** chord in Ab major → Bbm/F is first inversion → fits.
- Gdim? In Ab major, the **vii°** chord is Gdim! Yes! In Ab major:
  - vii° = G–B♭–D♭ → **G diminished**.

- Ab/G? That’s Ab major over G → this is **Ab/G = G bass with Ab major on top** → essentially a **G7sus♭9** or just a **bass note approaching Ab**. But also note: in Ab major, **G** is the **leading tone**—so G in the bass under Ab creates a strong pull to Ab.

So far, **Ab major** explains:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb = V
- Bbm = ii
- Dbmaj7 = IV
- Ab = I (implied by Ab/G)

The **Ab/G** chord strongly implies resolution to **Ab**, even if Ab major isn't explicitly stated as a root-position chord. The G in the bass (leading tone) under Ab creates a **cadential 6/4-like tension** resolving to Ab.

Now, what about **Dbmaj7/F**? In Ab major, Db is the **IV**, and F is the 3rd → so Db/F is a common inversion.

Thus, almost all chords fit **Ab major**:

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6 (first inversion V chord)
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = I with leading tone in bass (a type of embellishment or suspension)
- Dbmaj7/F = IV6

**But wait**: Is there an actual **Ab major chord** in root position? Not explicitly—but **Ab/G** strongly implies it, and the consistent return to Gdim (vii°) supports Ab as tonic.

### Step 2: Consider Mode

All chords fit **Ab Ionian (major)**. No modal mixture needed—though Dbmaj7 is diatonic to Ab major (IV chord).

**G diminished** is the natural vii° in major keys.

**Conclusion**:

- **Key**: **Ab major**
- **Mode**: **Ionian (Major)**

Even though the tonic Ab major chord is not played in root position, the harmonic context strongly implies **Ab** as the tonal center.

✅ **Final Answer**: **Key = Ab major, Mode = Ionian**
