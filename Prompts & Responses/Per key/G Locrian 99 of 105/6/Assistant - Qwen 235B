Let's analyze the given chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**:

### Chord Sequence:
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F Gdim
```

We can group them in bars of 4 for easier analysis:

```
| Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G |
| Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G |
| Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G |
| Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F Gdim |
```

### Step 1: Understand the Chords

Let’s break down each chord and its notes.

#### 1. **Gdim** (G diminished)
- Notes: G, Bb, Db
- A common function: often acts as a **vii°** chord in a major or minor key, especially leading to a tonic or dominant.

#### 2. **Eb/G** (Eb major with G in the bass)
- Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
- Bass note: G
→ So chord tones: G, Eb, G, Bb → essentially **Eb major in first inversion**
- Function: Could be **I or i** (if in Eb major or minor), or **bVI** in G minor.

#### 3. **Bbm/F** (Bb major with F in the bass)
- Bb major: Bb, D, F
- Bass: F → first inversion
- Could be **IV** in **F major**, **iv** in **Eb minor**, or **II** in **Ab major**, etc.

#### 4. **Ab/G** (Ab major with G in bass)
- Ab major: Ab, C, Eb
- Bass: G → **this is a non-chord tone in bass!** G is not in Ab major.
→ So this is **Ab major over G** — a **slash chord**.
→ Notes: G, Ab, C, Eb
This is interesting: **G Ab C Eb** → That’s a **G half-diminished 7th** (Gm7b5): G, Bb, Db, F? Wait — not quite.

Wait — chord is **Ab/C/Eb** with **G** in bass → **G–Ab–C–Eb**

G, Ab, C, Eb — this isn't a standard chord. Let's analyze intervalically:

- G to Ab = minor second
- G to C = #11 (augmented 4th)
- G to Eb = minor 7th

So: G, Ab, C, Eb → This looks like a **G7b9** without the 3rd or 5th? Not quite.

Alternatively: It's **Ab major over G**, which creates a **polychord** or **voicing**. But functionally, this is often used as a **tritone substitution** or **Neapolitan**-related harmony.

Wait — Ab major over G is enharmonically interesting.

But let’s note: **Ab/G** → This is very similar to a **German augmented sixth (Ger+6)** chord in the key of G.

Hold that thought.

#### 5. **Dbmaj7/F** (Db major 7 over F)
- Dbmaj7: Db, F, Ab, C
- Bass: F → So first inversion.
- Notes: F, Ab, C, Db
- F–Ab = minor third, Ab–C = major third, C–Db = minor second
→ Interval structure: m3, M3, m2 — not a very common chord stack.

But note: This sounds very close to a **Neapolitan chord** in the key of **C minor** or **C major**, where **N6 = Db major in first inversion (F in bass)** → **Db/F** — yes! That’s exactly **N6**, the **Neapolitan 6th chord**, which is **very common in minor keys**.

Ah! That’s a big clue.

The **Neapolitan chord** is typically the **bII6** chord, built on the flattened second scale degree, in first inversion, and commonly used in **minor keys**.

So **Db/F** (or Dbmaj7/F) → **very likely N6 in C minor**.

That points strongly to **C minor**.

Let’s test that.

---

### Step 2: Consider Key — Is it C minor?

Let’s test all chords in **C minor**:

- **C natural minor** scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb
- **Harmonic minor** raises the 7th: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B

Now examine each chord:

1. **Gdim** = G, Bb, Db
- In C minor: G is the 5th, Bb is the b7, Db is the b9 (of G)
- Gdim is **vii° of Ab major** — but also appears in **C harmonic minor** as the **vii° chord**.
- In **C harmonic minor**, the **vii° chord is B diminished** — not Gdim.

Wait — Gdim is **not** the vii° of C minor.

C minor key chords:
- i: Cm
- ii°: Ddim
- III: Eb
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm (in natural minor), or **G major** (if V) in harmonic minor
- VI: Ab
- VII: Bb

But Gdim is **not diatonic** to **C natural minor** or **harmonic minor** — because:
- G + Bb + Db → Bb is diatonic, Db is **not** in C natural minor — Db is the flat 6, which isn't present.

C natural minor has **Ab**, not **Db**.

Gdim = G, Bb, Db — **Db is NOT in C minor scale**.

So Gdim is **not diatonic** to C minor.

Hmm. Contradiction?

Wait — unless we’re in **G harmonic minor**?

Let’s try **G minor**.

---

### Try: G minor

G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F  
G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, **F#**

But in our progression, we see **Ab**, **Db**, **Eb**, **F**, **G**, **Bb** — lots of flats, no sharps.

So **F#** isn't likely — so **not G harmonic minor**.

So Gdim in **Bb minor**?

Try **Bb minor**:
- Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab → has Db
- But we have **Ab major** — Ab is the **VII** chord in Bb minor — possible
- Db is **III**, Eb is **iv**, Bb is i

But we have **Gdim** = G, Bb, Db — that’s **vii° of Ab major**, or **#i° in Bb minor** — chromatic

Hmm.

Wait — think about **Eb minor**?

Eb minor: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db → enharmonic to D

But we have lots of **G**, **Bb**, **Db** — appears related to **G diminished**.

Ah! Here’s a key idea:

### Gdim is a **common tone diminished chord** or leading tone chord to **Ab**.

Notice:
- **Gdim** → leads to **Ab/G**? Or **Eb/G**?

But look: after Gdim we go to **Eb/G**, not Ab.

Wait — Gdim and Eb/G — that’s only a semitone apart in root: G to G → same bass? No — **Eb/G** has **G in bass**.

Wait! Many of these chords have **G in the bass**:
- Eb/G → G in bass
- Bbm/F → F in bass
- Ab/G → G in bass
- Dbmaj7/F → F in bass
- Gdim → probably G in bass

So **bass line**:
G – G – G – G  
G – G – F – G  
G – G – G – G  
G – G – F – G

So bass: mostly **G**, then **F**, then back to G.

So the bass alternates between G and F.

So perhaps the **tonic is G**, and the F to G is a **cadence**?

But we have **Gdim**, which is unstable.

But Gdim is **G–Bb–Db**, which is the **leading tone diminished chord of Ab major**.

In fact:
- **Gdim → Ab** is a **common progression**: vii° → I in **Ab major**

Let’s test: **Ab major key**?

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Look at the chords:
- Gdim = G, Bb, Db → **vii° chord of Ab major** ✅
- Eb/G = G, Eb, G, Bb → Eb major over G → Eb is **V**, G is **5th of Eb**, but in Ab major, Eb is the **V chord**!
  - So **Eb/G** is **V6** in **Ab major** ✅
- Bbm/F = Bb (F, Ab, C), F in bass → **IV chord in first inversion** in Ab major ✅
- Ab/G = Ab major over G → Ab is **I**, G is the 7th → first inversion? Ab/G is **I6** in Ab major ✅
- Dbmaj7/F = Db, F, Ab, C → Db is **IV** in Ab major! But with F in bass → **Db/F** is **IV6** in Ab major ✅

Wait — **Db is IV** in Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G → yes, Db is 4th degree.

So Dbmaj7 = **IVmaj7** in Ab major.

Perfectly diatonic.

And Gdim = **vii°** of Ab → leads to I (Ab)

So now let’s re-analyze in **Ab major**:

| Chord       | Function in Ab major |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Gdim        | vii° (leading tone dim) |
| Eb/G        | V6 (dominant, 1st inversion) |
| Bbm/F       | IV6 (subdominant, 1st inversion) |
| Ab/G        | I6 (tonic, 1st inv) |
| Dbmaj7/F    | IV6 (subdominant) |

All chords are **diatonic to Ab major**.

Wait — Dbmaj7 includes a **C** (the major 7th), which is in Ab major (7th note is G, but C is the 4th — Db's major 7th is C).

Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C → yes, C is in Ab major → so Dbmaj7 is simply the **IVmaj7** chord.

Perfect.

So **every chord** fits in **Ab major**.

But why is **Gdim** used so much?

Because:
- **Gdim** = vii° of Ab → common chord to lead to tonic or to V.
- In classical music, **vii°** often substitutes for **V**, or leads to **I** or **V**.

Here, the pattern:
- Gdim → Eb/G → which is **vii° → V6**
- Then: Gdim → Bbm/F → ? vii° → IV6 — less common
- But also Gdim → Ab/G → **vii° → I6** — standard cadence

Also, **Gb dim** (same as F# dim) is enharmonic, but here it's spelled G–Bb–Db → **correct spelling for vii° in Ab**.

---

### Final Analysis

All chords:
- Gdim = G, Bb, Db → vii° in Ab
- Eb/G = Eb (Bb, D, G) wait — Eb is **Bb, D, Eb?** No.

Wait! Mistake.

**Eb major chord**: **Eb, G, Bb**

So Eb/G = G, Eb, G, Bb → notes: **G, Eb, Bb** — that’s **Eb major**, first inversion.

In **Ab major**:
- Ab = I
- Bb = ii
- Cm = iii
- **Db = IV**
- **Eb = V**
- Fm = vi
- Gdim = vii°

Yes! So **Eb major is V** in Ab major.

So **Eb/G** is **V6** → dominant in first inversion — very common.

Similarly:
- **Bbm/F** = Bb major with F in bass → Bb is **ii** chord in Ab major, F is the 5th → **ii6**
- **Ab/G** = I6 → tonic in first inversion
- **Dbmaj7/F** = Db, F, Ab, C → IV chord with F in bass → **IV6**, with added 7 (C), which is diatonic.

So all chords are **diatonic to Ab major**.

### So what is the **key and mode**?

✅ **Key: Ab major**  
✅ **Mode: Ionian (major)**

All chords belong to the **Ab major scale** (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G), and the tonal center feels like **Ab**, especially with:
- **Gdim → Ab/G** (vii° → I): a very strong cadence
- **Eb/G → Ab** would be V → I, but we don’t have that explicitly
However, the repeated use of **Gdim** (leading tone chord) strongly pulls to **Ab**.

Also, the **Ab/G** appears directly after **Ab/G** in the second bar, suggesting a move toward tonic.

The **Dbmaj7/F** (IV6) at the end could suggest a **plagal cadence** if followed by Ab, but it resolves back to Gdim — which then implies repetition.

So overall, **tonic is Ab**, and **Gdim** is creating tension that resolves to Ab.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian**
