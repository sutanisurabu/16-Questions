**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or in minor keys, so I should look for clues about the key.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Bbm/F

- Ab/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Dbmaj7/F

- Gdim

Notice that some chords have slashes, like Eb/G and Bbm/F and Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F. These are slash chords, meaning the chord is played with a different bass note. For example, Eb/G means an Eb major chord with a G in the bass.

Similarly, Bbm/F means Bbm chord with F in the bass, Ab/G means Ab major with G in bass, and Dbmaj7/F means Dbmaj7 with F in bass.

Now, to find the key, I should look at the root movements and see which scale these chords might belong to.

Gdim is a diminished chord. A diminished chord is often vii° in a major key or ii° in a minor key. But it could also be a common-tone diminished chord or something else.

Let me consider the notes in each chord.

First, Gdim: G diminished triad is G, Bb, Db. But since it's diminished, it might be a full diminished seventh chord, but it's written as Gdim, which typically implies a diminished triad, but in context, it might be a diminished seventh. I'll assume it's a diminished triad for now, but in jazz or popular music, dim often implies diminished seventh.

In standard notation, Gdim usually means diminished triad, but in chord progressions, it might be used as a diminished seventh. To be precise, I'll consider the notes.

Let me list the notes for each chord as played.

Start with Gdim: if it's a diminished triad, notes are G, Bb, Db. If it's diminished seventh, it would be G, Bb, Db, E. But since it's written as dim, I'll first assume triad, but let's see the context.

Now, Eb/G: Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb, and with G in bass, so notes are G, Eb, G, Bb? Actually, the chord is Eb major, but bass is G, so the overall notes are G, Eb, G, Bb? But since it's a chord, the notes are from Eb major: Eb, G, Bb, and bass G, so the notes are G, Eb, Bb? But G is already in the chord, so it's just an inversion. So Eb/G is first inversion of Eb major, notes: G, Eb, Bb.

Similarly, Bbm/F: Bbm chord is Bb, Db, F, and with F in bass, so notes: F, Bb, Db. Which is first inversion of Bbm.

Ab/G: Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb, with G in bass, so notes: G, Ab, C, Eb. This is not a standard inversion because G is not in Ab major chord. Ab major has Ab, C, Eb, so adding G in bass means it's a slash chord with bass note not in the chord. So Ab/G has notes G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 chord is Db, F, Ab, C, with F in bass, so notes: F, Db, Ab, C. Which is an inversion since F is in the chord.

Now, back to Gdim. If Gdim is a diminished triad, notes G, Bb, Db. But in the progression, we have Eb/G which has G, Eb, Bb, so Bb is common, and Eb is from Eb major.

Also, we have Bbm/F which has F, Bb, Db, so Db is there.

And Ab/G has G, Ab, C, Eb.

And Dbmaj7/F has F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, let's see the key. I need to find a scale that fits these chords.

First, let's list all the root notes or the chords themselves.

The chords are: Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7. But with slash basses.

Notice that Gdim appears frequently, and Eb/G appears, which is Eb major with G bass.

Also, Ab/G appears, which is Ab major with G bass.

And Dbmaj7/F.

Now, let's consider the bass movement. The bass notes from the slash chords: for Eb/G, bass is G; for Bbm/F, bass is F; for Ab/G, bass is G; for Dbmaj7/F, bass is F.

And Gdim has bass G presumably.

So the bass notes are often G or F.

Now, let's think about the key based on the chords.

Eb major chord suggests key of Eb major or C minor, etc.

Bbm is Bb minor, which is iv in F major or ii in Ab major, etc.

Ab major is IV in Eb major or V in Db major, etc.

Dbmaj7 is Db major seventh, which could be I in Db major or IV in Ab major, etc.

But we have Gdim, which is not diatonically in any major key. In major keys, the diminished chord is vii° which is based on the leading tone.

In Eb major, the vii° would be Ddim, not Gdim.

In Ab major, vii° would be Gdim? Let's check.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So the leading tone is G, and vii° is G diminished? G diminished triad is G, Bb, Db. In Ab major, the seventh degree is G, and the chord built on G is G, Bb, Db, which is indeed a diminished triad because from G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, so yes, Gdim is vii° in Ab major.

Oh! So Gdim is the leading tone chord in Ab major.

Now, let's verify if other chords fit Ab major.

Ab major has chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim.

So we have Bbm which is ii, Eb which is V, and Db which is IV, and we have Dbmaj7 which is IVmaj7, and we have Gdim which is vii°.

But we have Ab/G, which is Ab major with G bass. In Ab major, Ab is I, but with G bass, which is the leading tone, so it's a slash chord that emphasizes the leading tone.

Similarly, Eb/G is Eb with G bass, and Eb is V in Ab major, and G is the third of Eb, but in bass, it might be creating a line.

Also, Bbm/F is Bbm with F bass, and Bbm is ii in Ab major, and F is the fifth of Bbm, so it's first inversion.

Dbmaj7/F is Db with F bass, and Db is IV in Ab major, and F is the third of Db, so first inversion.

So all chords seem to fit in Ab major.

But let's confirm the progression.

The progression has Gdim multiple times, and Eb/G, which is V in first inversion, and Bbm/F which is ii in first inversion, and Ab/G which is I with leading tone bass, and Dbmaj7/F which is IV in first inversion.

So yes, this seems to be in Ab major.

But the mode? Since it's major, the mode is Ionian, but let's see if there's any minor feel.

Ab major is the key, and all chords are diatonically from Ab major except that Ab/G has a G in bass, which is not in the Ab chord, but it's a passing note or something.

In terms of mode, since it's major, it's Ionian.

But let's see the first and last chords are Gdim, which is vii°, so it might be emphasizing the leading tone, but the key is still Ab major.

Sometimes, progressions end on vii°, but that might not resolve, but here it ends on Gdim, which might not be tonic, but in context, since we have Ab and other chords, Ab is implied as tonic.

In the progression, we have Ab/G, which is Ab with G bass, so that might be a way to approach the tonic with leading tone bass.

Similarly, we have Eb/G which is V with third in bass, and Gdim which is vii°.

So overall, the key is Ab major.

But let's double-check if there is any other key.

Suppose we consider Gdim as a chord, if it were G diminished seventh, it would be G, Bb, Db, E, but E is not in Ab major? Ab major has Eb, not E natural. So if Gdim had E natural, it would be G, Bb, Db, E, which is a fully diminished seventh chord, and in Ab major, the vii°7 would be G, Bb, Db, Fb? No, in Ab major, the seventh chord on G would be G, Bb, Db, F, which is a half-diminished seventh, not fully diminished.

In major keys, the vii° is a diminished triad, but if it's a seventh chord, it's half-diminished, meaning minor seventh flat five, so G, Bb, Db, F.

But in the notation, it's written as Gdim, which typically means diminished triad, not necessarily seventh. So in this case, Gdim is just the triad, so notes G, Bb, Db, which is fine for vii° in Ab major.

In the progression, we have Bbm/F, which is Bbm, so notes Bb, Db, F, which is half-diminished if seventh, but here it's triad, so Bbm is minor triad.

And Ab/G has G, Ab, C, Eb, so the G is not part of Ab major chord, but it's in the scale, so it's fine.

Dbmaj7 has Db, F, Ab, C, which all in Ab major.

So yes, Ab major seems correct.

Therefore, the key is Ab major, and the mode is major (Ionian).

But the question says "key and mode", so probably key of Ab major.

But let's confirm the mode. In classical terms, mode is Ionian for major, but sometimes in modern music, modes are different, but here it seems straightforward.

Perhaps since we have leading tone chords, it's clearly major.

So I think key is Ab major.

Now, to write it properly.

So the key is A-flat major.

And mode is major.

But in the answer, I should state key and mode.

Perhaps I should say the key is Ab major.

But let's see the chords: we have Dbmaj7, which is IV, and Eb which is V, etc.

Yes.

So for the final answer.

The chord progression is in the key of **Ab major**. The mode is **Ionian** (major scale). 

The chords fit diatonically within the Ab major scale:
- Gdim is the vii° chord (leading tone diminished).
- Eb/G is the V chord (Eb major) in first inversion, with G in the bass.
- Bbm/F is the ii chord (Bbm minor) in first inversion, with F in the bass.
- Ab/G is the I chord (Ab major) with G in the bass, emphasizing the leading tone.
- Dbmaj7/F is the IV chord (Db major seventh) in first inversion, with F in the bass.

The frequent use of Gdim (vii°) and the resolution to Ab-based chords confirm the tonic of Ab major. The mode is Ionian, as the harmony follows the major scale pattern without modal interchange or shift to minor.
