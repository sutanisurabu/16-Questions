### Reasoning

**Analyzing the Progression's Core**

I'm starting by dissecting the user's chord progression. It seems key to identify any patterns, especially repeating chord sequences that may form the building blocks of a larger harmonic structure. My initial focus is to parse each chord, looking for any immediate relationships.


**Identifying Chord Relationships**

I've begun spelling out the chords to understand their individual components. It's now apparent that some chords are inversions of more basic triads like Eb and Ab, which changes how they function harmonically. I'm noting the non-chordal bass notes as they provide useful harmonic tension. I will rewrite the entire progression with the full chord names to visualize the overall relationships.


**Refining Key Candidate Analysis**

My evaluation of the potential keys has led me to re-examine the chord function within each candidate key. Identifying Gdim as a vii° chord fits Ab major, but some chords, like Eb/G, need further scrutiny. Specifically, I'm verifying the potential secondary dominant functions and pivot chords that could shift the tonal center. The non-chordal bass notes still deserve a special consideration.


**Confirming the Tonal Center**

After analyzing the chord functions within both Ab major and F minor, the prevalence of the Gdim (vii° in Ab major) and the overall harmonic motion leads me to lean toward Ab major. The Eb/G acting as a V chord solidifies this, as the G bass provides a strong resolution pull back to the root of Ab. Therefore, I'm now proceeding, focusing on refining the cadence points and any potential secondary functions that might further define Ab major as the key.


**Considering Possible Cadences**

I'm now examining the cadences within the progression to further solidify the key and mode. The repeated occurrences of Gdim, acting as the leading tone to Ab, coupled with the frequent V chords (Eb/G) confirms Ab major. Further, I'm identifying any deceptive cadences that may add harmonic interest or temporarily obscure the tonal center, which should reinforce my hypothesis.


**Determining the Harmonic Context**

I'm now determining the overall key signature by using the unique note frequencies. Based on the presence of flats, I'm analyzing both Ab major and F minor. Initial chord functions within these potential keys seem to favor Ab major. My focus now is on understanding the pull between dominant and tonic chords to confirm the tonal center.


**Evaluating the Harmonic Context**

I'm now determining the key signature by analyzing the flats present. The chords are pointing towards either Ab major or F minor, and I've begun to consider the function of each chord within both keys. The presence of the dominant chords and the Ab/G suggest the progression's likely root. The non-chordal bass note is a key aspect.


**Refining the Key Analysis**

I'm now determining the key by applying the list of chords I created, and evaluating them in the context of various candidate keys. Based on this, I'm verifying the function of each chord, which includes both the candidate keys Ab Major and F minor. I am now evaluating the presence of the dominant chords to confirm the tonal center.




Based on the chords provided, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **Ab Major**
*   **Mode:** **Major**

### Detailed Analysis

Let's break down why this progression points so clearly to Ab Major. First, we'll list the notes in the Ab Major scale and then analyze how each chord fits into that key.

The Ab Major scale consists of the notes: **Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G**

Now, let's look at each chord in the progression and its function within the key of Ab Major:

1.  **Gdim (G - Bb - Db)**
    *   This is the **vii°** (leading-tone diminished) chord of Ab Major. The leading tone (G) naturally wants to resolve up to the tonic (Ab), making this chord a powerful tool for creating tension that points directly to Ab. Its frequent use at the beginning and end of phrases in this progression strongly establishes this tension-resolution relationship.

2.  **Eb/G (Eb - G - Bb with G in the bass)**
    *   This is the **V** (dominant) chord, an Eb Major triad, in its first inversion. The dominant chord is the single most important chord for establishing a key, and its presence here is a massive clue.

3.  **Bbm/F (Bb - Db - F with F in the bass)**
    *   This is the **ii** (supertonic) chord, a Bb minor triad, in its first inversion. In major keys, the `ii - V - I` progression is extremely common.

4.  **Ab/G (Ab - C - Eb with G in the bass)**
    *   This is the **I** (tonic) chord, an Ab Major triad, played over the leading tone (G). This is a sophisticated and beautiful voicing. The bass note G creates a strong pull to resolve up to the root of the tonic, Ab, further cementing Ab as the tonal center.

5.  **Dbmaj7/F (Db - F - Ab - C with F in the bass)**
    *   This is the **IVmaj7** (subdominant) chord, a Db Major 7th, in its first inversion. The subdominant is another primary chord that helps define the key.

### Summary of Chord Functions in Ab Major:

*   **Gdim:** vii° (leading-tone)
*   **Eb/G:** V (dominant)
*   **Bbm/F:** ii (supertonic)
*   **Ab/G:** I (tonic over the leading-tone)
*   **Dbmaj7/F:** IV (subdominant)

The progression uses the most important chords (I, ii, IV, V, and vii°) to unequivocally establish the key of **Ab Major**. The consistent use of the G in the bass (in Gdim, Eb/G, and Ab/G) acts as a pedal point that constantly reinforces the dominant and leading-tone functions, all pointing toward Ab as the resolution point.
