Let's work this out.

### Step 1: List the chords and analyze the notes

We have these chords:

1. **Gdim**: G - B♭ - D♭  
2. **Eb/G**: E♭ - G - B♭ (G in the bass)  
3. **Bbm/F**: B♭ - D♭ - F (F in the bass)  
4. **Ab/G**: A♭ - C - E♭ (G in the bass)  
5. **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭ - F - A♭ - C (F in the bass)  
6. **Gdim** again

Let’s look at the **note collection** across all chords:

- G, B♭, D♭ (Gdim)  
- E♭, G, B♭ (Eb/G)  
- B♭, D♭, F (Bbm/F)  
- A♭, C, E♭, G (Ab/G)  
- D♭, F, A♭, C (Dbmaj7/F)

Pulling all unique notes together:

**D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C**

That’s **7 notes**, and they are:

**D♭ major scale**: D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C

But here, instead of **G♭**, we have **G natural**.

So this is **not** D♭ major — it’s **D♭ Lydian**, which has a **G natural** instead of G♭.

### Step 2: Confirm the key and mode

- **D♭ major** has 5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭  
- **D♭ Lydian** is the 4th mode of A♭ major, and raises the 4th scale degree (G♭ → G natural)

So the **tonic is D♭**, and the **mode is Lydian**.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: D♭**  
**Mode: Lydian**
