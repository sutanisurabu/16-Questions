**Analyzing musical key and mode**

I’m diving into figuring out the key and mode of this chord progression. It has a lot of G diminished chords, along with some unusual ones like Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, and Dbmaj7/F. The bass notes are noticeably rooted in G and F, and with so many Gdim chords, I’m thinking perhaps the key could be Eb minor. I need to take a closer look at the pitches harmonically, especially examining the G diminished notes: G, Bb, and Db.**Clarifying harmonic functions**

I'm working through the details of this progression. In A-flat minor, the leading tone is G, and the leading-tone triad is indeed G diminished (G, Bb, Db). This also fits in A-flat major as the vii° chord. The Eb/G chord functions as the V in A-flat major. With G in the bass, that makes it a first inversion (V6). Then we have Bbm/F acting as the ii chord, also in first inversion (ii6). The Ab/G seems to serve as the V/V chord.**Exploring chord transformations**

I'm analyzing how Ab/G functions within Ab major. This chord acts like a tonic chord with G as the bass, resembling an accented passing tone or neighbor note. When I consider it, it feels like creating a seventh chord, similar to a polychord or a line cliché. Essentially, Ab/G can be viewed as an Ab major chord with an added seventh, forming a major seventh. It’s like an Abmaj7 but in third inversion, missing the natural G that would typically define the seventh.**Examining chord inversions and functions**

I'm realizing that the Abmaj7 chord consists of Ab, C, Eb, and G. When I write Ab/G, it indicates G as the bass, which functions as the major seventh. So, in a way, I can see Ab/G as an Abmaj7 in third inversion, even though the seventh isn't directly indicated in the chord symbol. It still acts like Imaj7 in Ab major. Then for Dbmaj7/F, this chord sits as IVmaj7 in first inversion. Chords like Eb/G, Bbm/F, and Gdim fit nicely within the Ab major diatonic framework.**Determining the key and mode**

I'm analyzing the chord progression, which alternates between F and G in the bass. The overall key appears to be Ab major, suggesting an Ionian mode. However, I also consider F minor as a relative minor. Gdim serves as a supertonic diminished triad in both keys, functioning differently. The chords fit nicely within the tonal framework of Ab major, particularly with the heavy repetition of Gdim resolving to other diatonic chords. After weighing my options, I lean towards Ab major being the more stable key here.**Confirming key and mode**

Everything aligns with Ab Ionian. In Ab major, the major seventh is G natural, and the Abmaj7 chord uses that. Each chord falls neatly into Ab major: Gdim as vii°, Eb/G as V6, Bbm/F as ii6, Ab/G as Imaj7, and Dbmaj7/F as IVmaj7/3. Thus, the key is definitely Ab major, and the mode is Ionian. While F natural minor is a possibility, the harmonic flow leans strongly toward Ab major. So I’d state: key is Ab major (Ionian), with a brief mapping of the chords.

Ab major (Ionian).

Why: Every chord is diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G ≈ Imaj7 in 3rd inversion
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in 1st inversion

The consistent use of V, ii, IV, and vii° with G as the leading tone points to Ab Ionian.
