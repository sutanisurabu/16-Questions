### Reasoning

**Analyzing chords and key**

I need to figure out the key and mode based on the chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

Here, Gdim is recurring, and Eb/G indicates an Eb major chord in first inversion. Bbm/F and Ab/G follow suit. I see Gdim suggests a G diminished chord, which functions as the leading tone in Ab major, confirming it as the key. So, it appears to be leading-tone diminished, viio in Ab major.**Understanding chord functions**

I realize that Gdim serves as vii° in Ab major, possibly also in Ab minor modal. In Ab major, the Eb/G chord is a V6 since it has the third in the bass. The presence of Gdim as vii° and Eb/G as V6 aligns well with the key of Ab major, indicating a Ionian mode. 

I also noted Bbm/F as ii6 and Ab/G, which could be seen as a tonic chord in Ab major. However, the G in the bass isn't diatonic, but it acts as a dissonant passing tone, functioning as a leading tone. So, Ab/G might represent a 4-3 suspension.**Interpreting chord relationships**

I’m considering that Ab/G might represent a polychord with an Ab major triad over a G bass. This gives a compound chord of G-Ab-C-Eb, which feels a bit like a G half-diminished chord, although not exactly. In common practice, Ab/G often operates as a V7sus4. 

However, in Ab major, Ab/G acts like a tonic chord with the leading tone in the bass. Notably, after two Gdim chords, the progression goes to Bbm/F and then back to Ab/G, indicating neighbor motion centered around the G bass. The prevalence of these chords indeed suggests the key of Ab major.**Final chord analysis**

At the end, I note that Dbmaj7/F is the IVmaj7 in Ab major, and since F is in the bass (the third), it’s a first inversion subdominant chord. All the chords here seem to fit within Ab major, including Gdim, which serves as the leading tone triad. While this diminishes in harmonic minor, Gdim still aligns with the Ab major scale. It’s confirming that the key is indeed Ab major with an Ionian mode. 

Mixolydian doesn’t quite fit since that would require a Gb natural. The presence of Bb minor reinforces that it fits within the major context.**Exploring key and mode options**

I'm examining the chords and considering Ab/G, which contains G natural, important as the leading tone in Ab major. I briefly toyed with the idea of Eb major but found inconsistencies with Gdim and the lack of diatonic support. Moving through other keys like Bb minor and Db major also pointed towards non-diatonic chords.

Ultimately, Ab major works best, given the presence of Dbmaj7, Bbm/F, and the consistent use of Gdim. Although I pondered G Locrian because Gdim is its tonic triad, the emphasis on G as a pedal point suggests a strong tonal center around G. Yet, the predominant return to Gdim might indicate a Locrian feel, even while traditional analysis prefers Ab major. The conclusion could reflect the nuanced use of G.**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing the chord progression, starting and ending with Gdim, which implies G as a tonal center. Without a melody, it remains ambiguous, but I have to decide the key and mode. If the progression is based on the Ab major scale (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G), then it can be interpreted as G Locrian if G is the tonic or Ab Ionian if Ab is the tonic. Given the context, the simplest answer seems to be Ab major, but since they requested the mode, implying it’s more than just major or minor, I’ll present both options. 

The chords suggest: 

- Pitch collection: Ab major.
- Functional center: likely Ab major (Ionian). 
- If G is the tonic, it becomes G Locrian. 

I’ll include Roman numerals while keeping it concise!

Short answer: Ab major (Ionian).

Why:
- All notes fit Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.
- Functional readings in Ab:
  - Gdim = vii° (leading-tone triad)
  - Eb/G = V6
  - Bbm/F = ii6
  - Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/6
  - Ab/G = I with a leading-tone bass neighbor (non-chord-tone bass)

If you instead hear G as the tonal center (it starts/ends on Gdim and often has G in the bass), you can interpret the same pitch collection as G Locrian (Ab major scale with G as tonic).
