Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. Identify the chords and their likely functions**

The chords given are:

- **Gdim**  
- **Eb/G** (Eb major with G in bass)  
- **Bbm/F** (Bbm with F in bass)  
- **Ab/G** (Ab major with G in bass)  
- **Dbmaj7/F** (Dbmaj7 with F in bass)  

---

**2. Understanding Gdim**

Gdim = G Bb Db E (fully diminished 7th chord).  
A diminished 7th chord is symmetrical and can function in multiple keys as a vii°7 or common-tone diminished.

One common use:  
- In **Ab major**, Gdim = vii°7 of Ab.  
- In **Bbm**, Gdim = vii°7 of Bbm (or secondary diminished).  
- In **C minor**, Gdim = vii°7 of Cm.

**3. Look at the progression’s bass line**

Bass notes:  
G – G – Eb – Eb – G – G – F – G – G – G – Eb – Eb – G – G – F – G  

So bass is mostly G and Eb, with F appearing briefly.

**4. Try to fit into a key**

Let’s test **Ab major**:

- Gdim = vii°7 → resolves to Ab (Eb/G is Eb major = IV of Ab, fits).  
- Bbm/F = ii chord in Ab major (with F in bass).  
- Ab/G = I chord with G in bass (G is b7 over Ab, making Ab7 sound, common in bluesy progressions in Ab).  
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in Ab (with F in bass).  

Everything fits perfectly in **Ab major**:

Gdim → Ab (or Ab/G)  
Eb = IV  
Bbm = ii  
Dbmaj7 = IV  
Ab/G = I7

---

**5. Mode**

All chords are diatonic to Ab major except Gdim, which is the leading-tone diminished chord of Ab major (from harmonic/melodic minor usage often, but in major keys the vii° is from harmonic minor).  
So the key is **Ab major**, but the Gdim suggests the harmonic major scale (Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb G?) — actually Gdim implies Ab harmonic major: Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb G natural — but Fb = E natural. Wait, check: Gdim = G Bb Db E (E = Fb enharmonic). Yes, so scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb G Ab — that’s Ab harmonic major.

But in jazz/pop, they just treat it as Ab major with a vii°7.

---

**6. Conclusion**

Key: **Ab major**  
Mode: **Ionian (major)** with occasional harmonic major flavor due to Gdim.

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{Ab\ major}
\]
