### Key and Mode Analysis

The given chord progression (Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim) is **in the key of Ab major**, using the **Ionian mode** (standard major scale).

#### Reasoning
- **Diatonic Fit**: All chords are derived from the Ab major scale (Ab Bb C Db Eb F G):
  - Gdim (vii°): G–Bb–Db (fully diminished, common leading chord).
  - Eb/G (IV6): Eb–G–Bb (Eb major triad inverted on the 7th scale degree).
  - Bbm/F (ii6): Bb–Db–F (Bb minor triad on the 6th scale degree).
  - Ab/G (I7): Ab–C–Eb (Ab major triad on the 7th scale degree; functions like a dominant approach to I).
  - Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7/6): Db–F–Ab–C (Db major 7th inverted on the 6th scale degree).
- **Tonal Center**: The progression emphasizes Ab major through the use of Ab (as root/chord) and diatonic tensions (e.g., repeated Gdim leading to resolutions). No chromatic alterations (e.g., no D natural, Gb, or other accidentals) suggest a modal shift—everything stays within the natural major key.
- **Structure and Function**: It's a repetitive, tension-building sequence (common in jazz standards or ballads) that circles around Ab as home, with diminished chords (Gdim) creating V7-like pulls toward I (Ab). The slash chords add inversions for smooth voice leading but don't change the key.
- **No Modal Indicators**: 
  - No flattened 3rd, 6th, or 7th relative to Ab (e.g., no Gb for Dorian, no A natural for Mixolydian).
  - The major 3rd (C) in Dbmaj7 and Ab confirms Ionian/major.

This progression could be from a jazz or pop context (e.g., reminiscent of standards like "As Time Goes By" in related keys, adapted here). If you have melody, lyrics, or more context, I can refine this further!
