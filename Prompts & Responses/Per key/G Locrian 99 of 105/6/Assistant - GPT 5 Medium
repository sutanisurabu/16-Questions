### Reasoning

**Analyzing key signatures**

I’m looking at flats in the notes: E♭, A♭, and D♭, which hints at keys like E♭ minor/major, A♭ major, and D♭ major with a G diminished chord. The scale that includes these notes isn’t straightforward. For E♭ minor, the G natural doesn’t fit since E♭ minor has G♭. The harmonic and melodic minor scales alter some notes, but G natural still doesn’t belong. E♭ major has a different structure, and G diminished fits as a flat sixth there.**Exploring chord relationships**

In E♭ major, G minor functions as the iii chord, but G diminished doesn’t fit as the vii° chord, which is D diminished. So, G diminished isn’t diatonic to E♭ major. I wonder if it fits in A♭ major, where G natural appears as a major seventh. D♭ is in there as well, and B♭ minor works as ii minor. The E♭ major chord can act as V in A♭ major. This leads to an interesting chord structure with a major seventh bass under the A♭ major chord.**Clarifying chord relations**

I’m considering the A♭ major triad (A♭-C-E♭) along with G in the bass, which gives me A♭maj7/G, even without the fifth. This works out because A♭-C-E♭ plus G generates A♭maj7. Now, looking at G diminished, with notes G-B♭-D♭, I realize it functions as the vii° chord in A♭ major. This sequence sounds interesting: Gdim, E♭/G, B♭m/F, A♭/G, and looping back to Gdim. It all connects nicely!**Analyzing bass movement**

I’m looking at a typical A♭ major progression, focusing on the common-tone bass movement around G, which is the common bass pitch. The chord symbol Gdim usually implies G in the bass, although it can vary. I've listed the bass notes, and they mostly alternate between G and occasional F. This all fits nicely in A♭ major, where G acts as the leading tone and F as the sixth degree, with the B♭m/F and D♭maj7/F chords being diatonic.**Determining key and mode**

A♭ major is indeed strong, functioning in the Ionian mode. The presence of D♭ major indicates we're not in Lydian, so it fits A♭ Ionian. I’ve analyzed the chords, and all notes fit within A♭ major's diatonic collection. Gdim functions as vii°, E♭/G as V6, B♭m as ii, and D♭maj7 as IVmaj7. I considered alternatives, noting the relationship with F minor, where Gdim serves as ii° and D♭ as ♭VI, confirming the connection to both key centers. Given the progression tendencies, I lean toward A♭ major as the dominant functional center.**Determining key and mode**

There isn’t an explicit A♭ in root position, but A♭/G suggests an I chord with a leading tone in the bass. The piece ends on Gdim, avoiding a direct resolution to A♭, which might be intentional. However, E♭/G appearing as V6 indicates an A♭ center. So, I’ll declare the key as A♭ major (Ionian). Gdim functions as vii°, E♭/G as V6, B♭m/F as ii6, and A♭/G as Imaj7/7. While it could also be F minor, the functions lean strongly toward A♭ major.

A♭ major (Ionian).

Why: All chords are diatonic to A♭ major, with clear functions:
- Gdim = vii°
- E♭/G = V6
- B♭m/F = ii6
- A♭/G ≈ Imaj7/7
- D♭maj7/F = IVmaj7/3
The frequent G bass acts as the leading-tone pedal to A♭. (It could be read as relative F natural minor/Aeolian, but the V and vii° behavior points more strongly to A♭ major.)
