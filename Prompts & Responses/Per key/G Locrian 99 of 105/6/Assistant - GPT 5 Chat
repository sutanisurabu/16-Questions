Let's analyze the progression carefully:  

**Progression:**  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

### Step 1: Identify possible tonal centers

We see a lot of **Gdim (G–Bb–Db)** and **Eb/G (Eb–G–Bb)** chords.  
- **Eb/G** is an *Eb major chord in first inversion*.  
- **Gdim** shares two notes with Eb (Gdim = G–Bb–Db; Eb major = Eb–G–Bb). The Db note functions like a “lowered 5th” of Eb, giving a kind of altered subdominant flavor.

We also see **Bbm/F** (B♭ minor), **Ab/G** (A♭ major over G bass), and **Dbmaj7/F** (D♭ major 7 in first inversion).  
All of these chords are **diatonic to E♭ major**:  
- I = Eb  
- ii = Fm  
- iii = Gm (but we have G°)  
- IV = Ab  
- V = Bb  
- vi = Cm  
- vii° = Ddim  

We don’t have an A♭ or D♭ in Eb major, though — D♭ indicates borrowed or modal mixture (from Eb minor or Ab major).

### Step 2: Note the chromatic/borrowed tendencies

- **Gdim** can imply it’s functioning as a **leading-tone chord** to A♭ (in Eb major, vii°/IV), since G is the leading tone of A♭.  
- **Dbmaj7** (♭VI in Eb major) and **Bbm** (ii of Ab major), both suggest **Eb minor / Eb major** mixture (Eb Aeolian or Eb Mixolydian colors).

### Step 3: Consider how chords function

| Chord | Possible Function in Eb | Notes on Sound |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Gdim | vii°/Ab (secondary leading-tone chord) or G° borrowed | Tends toward Ab |
| Eb/G | I in first inversion | Root |
| Bbm/F | ii chord (of Eb major) | Pre-dominant |
| Ab/G | IV with a natural 7 in bass → interesting chromatic shift |
| Dbmaj7/F | ♭VI | Typical borrowed chord from minor key or mixolydian |
| Repeated Gdim | reinforces the tension around G and Ab area |

All roads seem to revolve around Eb as tonal center, but with heavy inflection from the parallel minor (Eb minor or Aeolian) due to the presence of Db and Bbm.

### ✅ **Conclusion**

**Likely Key:** **E♭ major** (with modal mixture / chromatic chords)
  
**Mode:** **E♭ major with mixture from E♭ minor (Aeolian) or E♭ Mixolydian,** due to ♭6 (Db) and ♭7 (Dbmaj7, B♭m) chords.

**Summary:**  
> The progression centers on **E♭** as tonic, but includes modal mixture (♭VI, ♭VII, vii°/IV) giving it a *minor-colored or Mixolydian* flavor. So you could describe the mode as **E♭ major with Aeolian/Mixolydian mixture**, or **E♭ major (tonal center) with chromatic embellishment via G diminished and borrowed chords.**
