### Reasoning

**Analyzing chords and key**

I need to figure out the key and mode based on the chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

Here, Gdim is recurring, and Eb/G indicates an Eb major chord in first inversion. Bbm/F and Ab/G follow suit. I see Gdim suggests a G diminished chord, which functions as the leading tone in Ab major, confirming it as the key. So, it appears to be leading-tone diminished, viio in Ab major.**Understanding chord functions**

I realize that Gdim serves as vii° in Ab major, possibly also in Ab minor modal. In Ab major, the Eb/G chord is a V6 since it has the third in the bass. The presence of Gdim as vii° and Eb/G as V6 aligns well with the key of Ab major, indicating a Ionian mode. 

I also noted Bbm/F as ii6 and Ab/G, which could be seen as a tonic chord in Ab major. However, the G in the bass isn't diatonic, but it acts as a dissonant passing tone, functioning as a leading tone. So, Ab/G might represent a 4-3 suspension.**Interpreting chord relationships**

I’m considering that Ab/G might represent a polychord with an Ab major triad over a G bass. This gives a compound chord of G-Ab-C-Eb, which feels a bit like a G half-diminished chord, although not exactly. In common practice, Ab/G often operates as a V7sus4. 

However, in Ab major, Ab/G acts like a tonic chord with the leading tone in the bass. Notably, after two Gdim chords, the progression goes to Bbm/F and then back to Ab/G, indicating neighbor motion centered around the G bass. The prevalence of these chords indeed suggests the key of Ab major.**Final chord analysis**

At the end, I note that Dbmaj7/F is the IVmaj7 in Ab major, and since F is in the bass (the third), it’s a first inversion subdominant chord. All the chords here seem to fit within Ab major, including Gdim, which serves as the leading tone triad. While this diminishes in harmonic minor, Gdim still aligns with the Ab major scale. It’s confirming that the key is indeed Ab major with an Ionian mode. 

Mixolydian doesn’t quite fit since that would require a Gb natural. The presence of Bb minor reinforces that it fits within the major context.**Exploring key and mode options**

I'm examining the chords and considering Ab/G, which contains G natural, important as the leading tone in Ab major. I briefly toyed with the idea of Eb major but found inconsistencies with Gdim and the lack of diatonic support. Moving through other keys like Bb minor and Db major also pointed towards non-diatonic chords.

Ultimately, Ab major works best, given the presence of Dbmaj7, Bbm/F, and the consistent use of Gdim. Although I pondered G Locrian because Gdim is its tonic triad, the emphasis on G as a pedal point suggests a strong tonal center around G. Yet, the predominant return to Gdim might indicate a Locrian feel, even while traditional analysis prefers Ab major. The conclusion could reflect the nuanced use of G.**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing the chord progression, starting and ending with Gdim, which implies G as a tonal center. Without a melody, it remains ambiguous, but I have to decide the key and mode. If the progression is based on the Ab major scale (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G), then it can be interpreted as G Locrian if G is the tonic or Ab Ionian if Ab is the tonic. Given the context, the simplest answer seems to be Ab major, but since they requested the mode, implying it’s more than just major or minor, I’ll present both options. 

The chords suggest: 

- Pitch collection: Ab major.
- Functional center: likely Ab major (Ionian). 
- If G is the tonic, it becomes G Locrian. 

I’ll include Roman numerals while keeping it concise!

Short answer: Ab major (Ionian).

Why:
- All notes fit Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.
- Functional readings in Ab:
  - Gdim = vii° (leading-tone triad)
  - Eb/G = V6
  - Bbm/F = ii6
  - Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/6
  - Ab/G = I with a leading-tone bass neighbor (non-chord-tone bass)

If you instead hear G as the tonal center (it starts/ends on Gdim and often has G in the bass), you can interpret the same pitch collection as G Locrian (Ab major scale with G as tonic).

### Reasoning

**Analyzing key signatures**

I’m looking at flats in the notes: E♭, A♭, and D♭, which hints at keys like E♭ minor/major, A♭ major, and D♭ major with a G diminished chord. The scale that includes these notes isn’t straightforward. For E♭ minor, the G natural doesn’t fit since E♭ minor has G♭. The harmonic and melodic minor scales alter some notes, but G natural still doesn’t belong. E♭ major has a different structure, and G diminished fits as a flat sixth there.**Exploring chord relationships**

In E♭ major, G minor functions as the iii chord, but G diminished doesn’t fit as the vii° chord, which is D diminished. So, G diminished isn’t diatonic to E♭ major. I wonder if it fits in A♭ major, where G natural appears as a major seventh. D♭ is in there as well, and B♭ minor works as ii minor. The E♭ major chord can act as V in A♭ major. This leads to an interesting chord structure with a major seventh bass under the A♭ major chord.**Clarifying chord relations**

I’m considering the A♭ major triad (A♭-C-E♭) along with G in the bass, which gives me A♭maj7/G, even without the fifth. This works out because A♭-C-E♭ plus G generates A♭maj7. Now, looking at G diminished, with notes G-B♭-D♭, I realize it functions as the vii° chord in A♭ major. This sequence sounds interesting: Gdim, E♭/G, B♭m/F, A♭/G, and looping back to Gdim. It all connects nicely!**Analyzing bass movement**

I’m looking at a typical A♭ major progression, focusing on the common-tone bass movement around G, which is the common bass pitch. The chord symbol Gdim usually implies G in the bass, although it can vary. I've listed the bass notes, and they mostly alternate between G and occasional F. This all fits nicely in A♭ major, where G acts as the leading tone and F as the sixth degree, with the B♭m/F and D♭maj7/F chords being diatonic.**Determining key and mode**

A♭ major is indeed strong, functioning in the Ionian mode. The presence of D♭ major indicates we're not in Lydian, so it fits A♭ Ionian. I’ve analyzed the chords, and all notes fit within A♭ major's diatonic collection. Gdim functions as vii°, E♭/G as V6, B♭m as ii, and D♭maj7 as IVmaj7. I considered alternatives, noting the relationship with F minor, where Gdim serves as ii° and D♭ as ♭VI, confirming the connection to both key centers. Given the progression tendencies, I lean toward A♭ major as the dominant functional center.**Determining key and mode**

There isn’t an explicit A♭ in root position, but A♭/G suggests an I chord with a leading tone in the bass. The piece ends on Gdim, avoiding a direct resolution to A♭, which might be intentional. However, E♭/G appearing as V6 indicates an A♭ center. So, I’ll declare the key as A♭ major (Ionian). Gdim functions as vii°, E♭/G as V6, B♭m/F as ii6, and A♭/G as Imaj7/7. While it could also be F minor, the functions lean strongly toward A♭ major.

A♭ major (Ionian).

Why: All chords are diatonic to A♭ major, with clear functions:
- Gdim = vii°
- E♭/G = V6
- B♭m/F = ii6
- A♭/G ≈ Imaj7/7
- D♭maj7/F = IVmaj7/3
The frequent G bass acts as the leading-tone pedal to A♭. (It could be read as relative F natural minor/Aeolian, but the V and vii° behavior points more strongly to A♭ major.)

**Analyzing musical key and mode**

I’m diving into figuring out the key and mode of this chord progression. It has a lot of G diminished chords, along with some unusual ones like Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, and Dbmaj7/F. The bass notes are noticeably rooted in G and F, and with so many Gdim chords, I’m thinking perhaps the key could be Eb minor. I need to take a closer look at the pitches harmonically, especially examining the G diminished notes: G, Bb, and Db.**Clarifying harmonic functions**

I'm working through the details of this progression. In A-flat minor, the leading tone is G, and the leading-tone triad is indeed G diminished (G, Bb, Db). This also fits in A-flat major as the vii° chord. The Eb/G chord functions as the V in A-flat major. With G in the bass, that makes it a first inversion (V6). Then we have Bbm/F acting as the ii chord, also in first inversion (ii6). The Ab/G seems to serve as the V/V chord.**Exploring chord transformations**

I'm analyzing how Ab/G functions within Ab major. This chord acts like a tonic chord with G as the bass, resembling an accented passing tone or neighbor note. When I consider it, it feels like creating a seventh chord, similar to a polychord or a line cliché. Essentially, Ab/G can be viewed as an Ab major chord with an added seventh, forming a major seventh. It’s like an Abmaj7 but in third inversion, missing the natural G that would typically define the seventh.**Examining chord inversions and functions**

I'm realizing that the Abmaj7 chord consists of Ab, C, Eb, and G. When I write Ab/G, it indicates G as the bass, which functions as the major seventh. So, in a way, I can see Ab/G as an Abmaj7 in third inversion, even though the seventh isn't directly indicated in the chord symbol. It still acts like Imaj7 in Ab major. Then for Dbmaj7/F, this chord sits as IVmaj7 in first inversion. Chords like Eb/G, Bbm/F, and Gdim fit nicely within the Ab major diatonic framework.**Determining the key and mode**

I'm analyzing the chord progression, which alternates between F and G in the bass. The overall key appears to be Ab major, suggesting an Ionian mode. However, I also consider F minor as a relative minor. Gdim serves as a supertonic diminished triad in both keys, functioning differently. The chords fit nicely within the tonal framework of Ab major, particularly with the heavy repetition of Gdim resolving to other diatonic chords. After weighing my options, I lean towards Ab major being the more stable key here.**Confirming key and mode**

Everything aligns with Ab Ionian. In Ab major, the major seventh is G natural, and the Abmaj7 chord uses that. Each chord falls neatly into Ab major: Gdim as vii°, Eb/G as V6, Bbm/F as ii6, Ab/G as Imaj7, and Dbmaj7/F as IVmaj7/3. Thus, the key is definitely Ab major, and the mode is Ionian. While F natural minor is a possibility, the harmonic flow leans strongly toward Ab major. So I’d state: key is Ab major (Ionian), with a brief mapping of the chords.

Ab major (Ionian).

Why: Every chord is diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G ≈ Imaj7 in 3rd inversion
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in 1st inversion

The consistent use of V, ii, IV, and vii° with G as the leading tone points to Ab Ionian.

### Key and Mode Analysis

The given chord progression (Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim) is **in the key of Ab major**, using the **Ionian mode** (standard major scale).

#### Reasoning
- **Diatonic Fit**: All chords are derived from the Ab major scale (Ab Bb C Db Eb F G):
  - Gdim (vii°): G–Bb–Db (fully diminished, common leading chord).
  - Eb/G (IV6): Eb–G–Bb (Eb major triad inverted on the 7th scale degree).
  - Bbm/F (ii6): Bb–Db–F (Bb minor triad on the 6th scale degree).
  - Ab/G (I7): Ab–C–Eb (Ab major triad on the 7th scale degree; functions like a dominant approach to I).
  - Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7/6): Db–F–Ab–C (Db major 7th inverted on the 6th scale degree).
- **Tonal Center**: The progression emphasizes Ab major through the use of Ab (as root/chord) and diatonic tensions (e.g., repeated Gdim leading to resolutions). No chromatic alterations (e.g., no D natural, Gb, or other accidentals) suggest a modal shift—everything stays within the natural major key.
- **Structure and Function**: It's a repetitive, tension-building sequence (common in jazz standards or ballads) that circles around Ab as home, with diminished chords (Gdim) creating V7-like pulls toward I (Ab). The slash chords add inversions for smooth voice leading but don't change the key.
- **No Modal Indicators**: 
  - No flattened 3rd, 6th, or 7th relative to Ab (e.g., no Gb for Dorian, no A natural for Mixolydian).
  - The major 3rd (C) in Dbmaj7 and Ab confirms Ionian/major.

This progression could be from a jazz or pop context (e.g., reminiscent of standards like "As Time Goes By" in related keys, adapted here). If you have melody, lyrics, or more context, I can refine this further!

### Reasoning

**Analyzing the Progression's Core**

I'm starting by dissecting the user's chord progression. It seems key to identify any patterns, especially repeating chord sequences that may form the building blocks of a larger harmonic structure. My initial focus is to parse each chord, looking for any immediate relationships.


**Identifying Chord Relationships**

I've begun spelling out the chords to understand their individual components. It's now apparent that some chords are inversions of more basic triads like Eb and Ab, which changes how they function harmonically. I'm noting the non-chordal bass notes as they provide useful harmonic tension. I will rewrite the entire progression with the full chord names to visualize the overall relationships.


**Refining Key Candidate Analysis**

My evaluation of the potential keys has led me to re-examine the chord function within each candidate key. Identifying Gdim as a vii° chord fits Ab major, but some chords, like Eb/G, need further scrutiny. Specifically, I'm verifying the potential secondary dominant functions and pivot chords that could shift the tonal center. The non-chordal bass notes still deserve a special consideration.


**Confirming the Tonal Center**

After analyzing the chord functions within both Ab major and F minor, the prevalence of the Gdim (vii° in Ab major) and the overall harmonic motion leads me to lean toward Ab major. The Eb/G acting as a V chord solidifies this, as the G bass provides a strong resolution pull back to the root of Ab. Therefore, I'm now proceeding, focusing on refining the cadence points and any potential secondary functions that might further define Ab major as the key.


**Considering Possible Cadences**

I'm now examining the cadences within the progression to further solidify the key and mode. The repeated occurrences of Gdim, acting as the leading tone to Ab, coupled with the frequent V chords (Eb/G) confirms Ab major. Further, I'm identifying any deceptive cadences that may add harmonic interest or temporarily obscure the tonal center, which should reinforce my hypothesis.


**Determining the Harmonic Context**

I'm now determining the overall key signature by using the unique note frequencies. Based on the presence of flats, I'm analyzing both Ab major and F minor. Initial chord functions within these potential keys seem to favor Ab major. My focus now is on understanding the pull between dominant and tonic chords to confirm the tonal center.


**Evaluating the Harmonic Context**

I'm now determining the key signature by analyzing the flats present. The chords are pointing towards either Ab major or F minor, and I've begun to consider the function of each chord within both keys. The presence of the dominant chords and the Ab/G suggest the progression's likely root. The non-chordal bass note is a key aspect.


**Refining the Key Analysis**

I'm now determining the key by applying the list of chords I created, and evaluating them in the context of various candidate keys. Based on this, I'm verifying the function of each chord, which includes both the candidate keys Ab Major and F minor. I am now evaluating the presence of the dominant chords to confirm the tonal center.




Based on the chords provided, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **Ab Major**
*   **Mode:** **Major**

### Detailed Analysis

Let's break down why this progression points so clearly to Ab Major. First, we'll list the notes in the Ab Major scale and then analyze how each chord fits into that key.

The Ab Major scale consists of the notes: **Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G**

Now, let's look at each chord in the progression and its function within the key of Ab Major:

1.  **Gdim (G - Bb - Db)**
    *   This is the **vii°** (leading-tone diminished) chord of Ab Major. The leading tone (G) naturally wants to resolve up to the tonic (Ab), making this chord a powerful tool for creating tension that points directly to Ab. Its frequent use at the beginning and end of phrases in this progression strongly establishes this tension-resolution relationship.

2.  **Eb/G (Eb - G - Bb with G in the bass)**
    *   This is the **V** (dominant) chord, an Eb Major triad, in its first inversion. The dominant chord is the single most important chord for establishing a key, and its presence here is a massive clue.

3.  **Bbm/F (Bb - Db - F with F in the bass)**
    *   This is the **ii** (supertonic) chord, a Bb minor triad, in its first inversion. In major keys, the `ii - V - I` progression is extremely common.

4.  **Ab/G (Ab - C - Eb with G in the bass)**
    *   This is the **I** (tonic) chord, an Ab Major triad, played over the leading tone (G). This is a sophisticated and beautiful voicing. The bass note G creates a strong pull to resolve up to the root of the tonic, Ab, further cementing Ab as the tonal center.

5.  **Dbmaj7/F (Db - F - Ab - C with F in the bass)**
    *   This is the **IVmaj7** (subdominant) chord, a Db Major 7th, in its first inversion. The subdominant is another primary chord that helps define the key.

### Summary of Chord Functions in Ab Major:

*   **Gdim:** vii° (leading-tone)
*   **Eb/G:** V (dominant)
*   **Bbm/F:** ii (supertonic)
*   **Ab/G:** I (tonic over the leading-tone)
*   **Dbmaj7/F:** IV (subdominant)

The progression uses the most important chords (I, ii, IV, V, and vii°) to unequivocally establish the key of **Ab Major**. The consistent use of the G in the bass (in Gdim, Eb/G, and Ab/G) acts as a pedal point that constantly reinforces the dominant and leading-tone functions, all pointing toward Ab as the resolution point.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to unpack this. The chords are written with slash notation, which means they're specifying inversions or added bass notes. For example, Eb/G means an Eb major chord with G in the bass. That's actually a Gm7 chord because G-Bb-Db-Eb makes Gm7 (G-Bb-Db-F? Wait no—Eb/G is G-Eb-G-Bb, which is really Gm7 without the F? Hmm, let me double-check my chord theory.

*Pauses to mentally diagram chords*  
Right:  
- Gdim: G-Bb-Db (diminished triad)  
- Eb/G: G as bass, Eb major (G-Bb-Eb) → that's actually Gm7 without the 7th? No, G-Bb-Eb is a G minor triad with Eb? Wait, that's messy. Actually, Eb/G implies the chord is Eb major (Eb-G-Bb) but played with G in the bass, so the notes are G-Eb-G-Bb. That's enharmonically a Gm7(no5) but functionally it's an inverted Eb chord. In practice, this often functions as a dominant or pre-dominant chord.  

*Realizes this progression is heavy on diminished and minor-7th chords*  
The progression repeats Gdim → Eb/G patterns, then hits Bbm/F (F-Bb-Db-F → Fm7) and Ab/G (G-Ab-C-Eb → Gm6 or Ab6? Wait, Ab/G is G-Ab-C-Eb, which is Gm6, but often analyzed as Ab6 in first inversion). Then ends with Dbmaj7/F (F-Ab-C-Db → F-Db-F-Ab-C? Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C, so with F in bass it's F-Db-Ab-C → that's Fm6 or Dbmaj7/F, same thing).  

*Starts noticing a pattern*  
The recurring Gdim chords stand out. Gdim (G-Bb-Db) is the vii° of Ab major, but also the ii° in F minor. And Eb/G—since Eb major is the V chord in Ab, but with G in bass? Actually, Eb/G is the first inversion of Eb, which is common in cadences.  

*Suspects harmonic minor influence because of the diminished chords*  
Gdim is vii° in Ab major, but in minor keys, the leading tone chord is diminished. If this is in Ab minor, the natural minor would have Gb, but here it's G-natural (in Gdim), which suggests harmonic minor. Ab harmonic minor has G natural as the leading tone.  

*Tests Ab minor key*  
- Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G Ab (Cb=B, Fb=E, so enharmonically Ab Bb Cb? Wait no—standard spelling is Ab Bb Cb? Actually, Ab harmonic minor is Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb G Ab → but Cb is B, Fb is E, so notes: Ab, Bb, B (Cb), Db, Eb, E (Fb), G. So it's Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, E, G. But that's messy. Better to think in terms of raised 7th: natural minor has Gb, harmonic raises it to G. So yes, Gdim is ii° in Ab harmonic minor (Bb-C-Eb? Wait no—ii° in Ab minor harmonic would be Bdim: B-D-F? Confusion reigns.  

*Makes a table*  
Standard chords in Ab minor:  
- Natural minor: i = Abm, ii° = Bbdim, III = Bbmaj, iv = Dbm, v = Ebm, VI = Fb? (enharmonic E), VII = Gb  
- Harmonic minor: same except v becomes V (Ebmaj), and ii° becomes ii° (Bbdim) but with G natural? Wait:  
Ab harmonic minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), G, Ab → but in Western notation, it's spelled with flats: Ab, Bb, Cb (not B), Db, Eb, Fb (not E), G, Ab. But practically, we'd write it as Ab, Bb, B (or Cb?), Db, Eb, E (or Fb?), G. This is why theorists prefer relative majors.  

*Switches to relative major: Ab minor → Cb major? No, relative of Ab minor is Cb major, but that's impractical. Better: Ab minor is relative to Cb major, but Cb is B, so B major? Messy. Standard: Ab minor's relative major is Cb major (enharmonic B major), but nobody uses that. Usually, we say Ab minor has key signature of 4 flats (same as Cb major, but we call it Ab minor with 4 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). In harmonic minor, it has G natural instead of Gb.  

*Checks chord functions*  
- Gdim: G-Bb-Db. In Ab minor harmonic, the leading tone is G, so vii° = Gdim (G-Bb-Db). Yes! That's the leading tone diminished chord.  
- Eb/G: Eb major (Eb-G-Bb) with G bass → G-Eb-G-Bb. In Ab minor, Eb is the V chord (since harmonic minor has major V: Eb major, not Ebm). So Eb/G is first inversion V chord.  
- Bbm/F: F bass, Bb major? Wait no—Bbm/F. Bbm is Bb-Db-F, so with F bass it's F-Bb-Db → Fm7 (F-Ab-C-Eb? No, Bbm is Bb-Db-F, so F-Bb-Db is actually Bbm in first inversion. In Ab minor, Bbm is III (Bb-Db-F → Bb major? Wait no: in minor keys, III is major. Ab harmonic minor: i=Abm, ii°=Bbdim, III= Bbmaj? Wait:  
Scale degrees:  
1. Ab (i) - minor  
2. Bb (ii°) - diminished (Bb-Db-Fb? Fb=E, but Db is natural? In Ab harmonic minor: notes Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), G. So chord on ii: Bb-Db-Fb → Bb-Db-E (since Fb=E), but E is not in the key? This is why harmonic minor chords are:  
- i: Ab-Cb-Eb (Abm)  
- ii°: Bb-Db-F (Bbdim) → because F is the minor 3rd of Bb, but in harmonic minor scale, the 6th is Fb (E), but chord construction uses scale degrees: ii is Bb-Db-Fb → but Fb is E, so Bb-Db-E? That's not a standard chord. I'm confusing myself.  

*Uses practical approach: common cadences*  
The progression has: ...Gdim → Eb/G... repeatedly. Gdim to Eb is a classic cadence in minor keys: vii° resolves to i or V. But here it goes to Eb/G (V), which is common. For example, in C minor: Bdim → G (V). Similarly, here: Gdim → Eb (V of Ab minor). So probably Ab minor key.  

*Confirms with other chords*  
- Bbm/F: Bbm chord (Bb-Db-F) in first inversion (F bass). In Ab minor, Bbm is the III chord (major in harmonic minor? Wait no: in natural minor, III is major, but harmonic minor also has major III? Ab minor natural: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb → III = Cb (B) major? Cb-Eb-Gb → B-D-F, which is B diminished. Messy. Better:  
Standard chords in A minor (to analogize):  
- Natural: i=Am, ii°=Bdim, III=C, iv=Dm, v=Em, VI=F, VII=G  
- Harmonic: i=Am, ii°=Bdim, III+=Caug? No, III is still C major in harmonic minor? Wait no—in A harmonic minor, scale is A B C D E F G# A, so III chord is C-E-G# → C augmented. But in practice, III is often major or augmented.  

For Ab minor:  
- Natural minor scale: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb (Ab Bb B Db Eb E Gb)  
- Chord on III: Cb major → Cb-Eb-Gb → B-D-F (B diminished) → but enharmonically Bdim. That's not right. This is why key signatures matter.  

*Key signature perspective*  
If it's Ab minor, key signature has 4 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. Natural minor uses Gb, harmonic minor raises it to G. So all G's are natural in harmonic minor.  
- Gdim (G-Bb-Db) → fits because G is leading tone.  
- Eb/G → Eb major chord, which is the V chord (since G is leading tone, V is major).  
- Bbm/F → Bb major? But in Ab minor, the III chord should be Bbm (Bb-Db-F), which is minor? Wait no:  
Ab natural minor scale: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb → so third degree is Cb (B), chord is Bb-Db-Fb → Bb-Db-E → which is Bb diminished? I'm making no progress.  

*Alternative approach: chord roots*  
List the root notes (ignoring inversions for now):  
Gdim root G  
Gdim G  
Eb/G root Eb  
Eb/G Eb  
... then Bbm/F root Bb  
Ab/G root Ab? Wait no—Ab/G is Ab chord with G bass, so root is Ab  
Gdim G  
... Dbmaj7/F root Db  

So the root movement is: G - G - Eb - Eb - G - G - Bb - Ab - G - G - Eb - Eb - G - G - Db - G  

That's repetitive: G and Eb dominate, with Bb, Ab, Db.  
Cycle: G → Eb (a minor 3rd down), then later Bb → Ab (minor 2nd down), etc.  

*Recognizes common minor key progression*  
In minor keys, the cadence ii° - V - i is common. Here:  
- Gdim (ii° in Ab minor)  
- Eb (V)  
But it's Eb/G, which is still V.  
Then what's Bbm/F? Bb major in first inversion. In Ab minor, Bb is the Neapolitan chord (bII), which is major. Yes! Neapolitan is common in minor keys: bII major chord.  
Ab minor: I = Abm, bII = Bbm (Bb-Db-F).  
Then Ab/G: Ab chord with G bass → Ab major chord? But in minor key, Ab would be the tonic major? Not usually. Ab/G is G-Ab-C-Eb → that's Gm6, but in context of Ab minor, it might be iv (Dm in A minor analog), but Ab/G... root Ab. Ab chord in Ab minor is i (minor), so Abm. But here it's written as Ab/G, implying Ab major? The slash doesn't change the root quality—Ab/G could be Ab major or minor? The notation says "Ab" which typically means major unless specified.  

*Ah, critical point!*  
In chord symbols:  
- "Ab" alone = Ab major  
- "Abm" = Ab minor  
But in minor keys, the tonic is minor, so if it were Ab minor, we'd expect "Abm" for tonic. But here:  
- Eb/G: Eb major (common for V in minor)  
- Bbm/F: Bb major (Neapolitan)  
- Ab/G: Ab major? But in Ab minor, the tonic chord is Ab minor, not major. Unless...  

*Realizes it might be major key with borrowed chords*  
But Gdim doesn't fit major keys well. Gdim is vii° in Ab major, but Ab major would have Gb, not G. So Gdim suggests G natural, which is foreign to Ab major.  

*Considers F minor*  
Gdim is ii° in F minor (harmonic: F G Ab Bb C Db E F → so G-Ab-C? Wait, ii° = G-Bb-Db? Yes! Gdim is exactly ii° in F minor.  
Let's check:  
F harmonic minor scale: F G Ab Bb C Db E F → chords:  
- i: Fm  
- ii°: Gdim (G-Bb-Db)  
- III+: Abaug? Ab-C-E (but E is natural, so Ab-C-Eb would be Abm, but scale has E natural → Ab-C-E → augmented)  
More importantly:  
- V: C major (since leading tone E)  
- iv: Bbm  
But here we have Eb/G, which is Eb major. In F minor, Eb is the IV chord in natural minor, but in harmonic it's minor? F minor natural: iv = Bbm, but Eb? Eb is bVII.  

Wait:  
- F minor chords:  
  - Natural: i=Fm, ii°=G°, III=Ab, iv=Bbm, v=Eb, VI=Db, VII=Gb  
  - Harmonic: same except v=Eb major (with D), and VII=Gb becomes G major? No—harmonic minor only raises 7th, so v becomes major: Eb → Eb major (Eb-G-Bb).  
In F minor harmonic:  
- v = Eb major  
So Eb/G is first inversion V chord? But V should be C major for F minor. Confusion.  
Standard: in minor key, V is major when harmonic minor is used. So for F minor:  
- Natural minor: v = Ebm (Eb-Gb-Bb)  
- Harmonic minor: v = Eb major (Eb-G-Bb) — yes! Because the leading tone is E natural, so the V chord becomes major.  
So Eb major is V in F harmonic minor.  
Gdim is ii° in F minor (G-Bb-Db).  
Now, Bbm/F: Bbm chord (Bb-Db-F), in first inversion (F bass). In F minor, Bbm is iv (natural minor) or iv? But in harmonic minor, iv is still minor (Bbm).  
Ab/G: Ab chord with G bass. Ab major? In F minor, Ab is III (major in natural/harmonic minor? F natural minor: Ab is III major (Ab-C-Eb). Yes!  
Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7 with F bass → Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C, so F-Ab-C-Db → which is Fm6. In F minor, Db is the VI chord (Db-F-Ab → Db major).  

*Tests F minor hypothesis*  
- Gdim → ii° in F minor  
- Eb/G → V (Eb major) in first inversion  
- Bbm/F → iv (Bb minor) in first inversion? But "Bbm" is written, so minor. In F minor, iv is Bbm.  
Wait the notation says "Bbm/F" — "Bbm" explicitly means Bb minor, so chord is Bb-Db-F → minor triad. Perfect for iv in F minor.  
- Ab/G → "Ab" implies Ab major (Ab-C-Eb), which is III in F minor (since F minor has Ab as the third scale degree, and III is major in natural/harmonic minor).  
- Dbmaj7/F → Db major 7, which is VI7 in F minor (Db major chord).  

*Checks entire progression in F minor*  
Sequence:  
Gdim (ii°) - Gdim (ii°) - Eb/G (V6) - Eb/G (V6) - Gdim (ii°) - Gdim (ii°) - Bbm/F (iv6) - Ab/G (III6) - Gdim (ii°) - Gdim (ii°) - Eb/G (V6) - Eb/G (V6) - Gdim (ii°) - Gdim (ii°) - Dbmaj7/F (VI6) - Gdim (ii°)  

This makes sense!  
- ii° - V - i is a common cadence, but here it's looping ii°-V without resolving to i, which happens in deceptive cadences or cyclical progressions.  
- Bbm/F (iv6) is the subdominant minor, common in minor keys.  
- Ab/G (III6) is the mediant major, a color chord in minor.  
- Dbmaj7/F (VI6) is the submediant major.  
- Ending on Gdim (ii°) creates tension, typical for unresolved cadences.  

*Why not Ab minor?*  
In Ab minor:  
- Gdim = vii° (leading tone chord)  
- Eb/G = V6 (since Eb major is V)  
- But Bbm/F: Bb major. In Ab minor, Bb is bII (Neapolitan), which is major — that fits.  
- Ab/G: would be tonic? But "Ab" implies Ab major, while tonic should be minor. The notation "Ab" suggests major quality, but in minor key context, tonic is minor. Unless it's a Picardy third, but it's not the final chord.  
Dbmaj7/F: in Ab minor, Db is iv (minor), but Dbmaj7 is major — inconsistent unless borrowed.  

Whereas in F minor:  
- All chords fit natural/harmonic minor with diatonic chords:  
  - ii° = G°  
  - V = Eb  
  - iv = Bbm  
  - III = Ab  
  - VI = Db  
No contradictions. The slash inversions are standard voice leading (e.g., Eb/G has G as common tone with Gdim).  

*Confirms with chord functions*  
The progression feels like it's in F minor because:  
- Gdim (G-Bb-Db) → Eb (Eb-G-Bb): smooth voice leading (Bb-Db to G-Bb, with Eb moving to Eb)  
- Then to Bbm (Bb-Db-F): natural descent  
- To Ab (Ab-C-Eb): another step  
All standard minor key movements.  

*Final check: mode*  
The key is F minor. But what mode? The progression uses:  
- G natural (in Gdim), which is the raised leading tone → harmonic minor.  
- But it also uses Bbm (Bb-Db-F) → natural minor's iv chord.  
- And Db major (VI) → natural minor.  
So it's mixing natural and harmonic minor elements, which is common. But the dominant function (Eb major) confirms harmonic minor influence.  

However, the question asks for "key and mode". Typically, "mode" here might refer to major/minor, but technically minor is a mode (Aeolian vs. harmonic minor). Since harmonic minor is a variation, we'd say the key is F minor, and the mode is harmonic minor (due to the major V chord).  

*Conclusion*  
Key: F minor  
Mode: Harmonic minor (because of the raised 7th enabling Eb major chord)  

But to be precise: in tonal music, we say "key of F minor" implying harmonic minor for dominant function, though the progression also uses natural minor chords (iv, VI). Still, the presence of V major (Eb) is definitive for harmonic minor.  

*User's level: probably intermediate musician*  
They gave slash chords, so they know some theory. Might be analyzing a song. I should explain clearly without excessive jargon.  

*Final answer*  
After analysis, the progression centers around F minor, using harmonic minor elements (especially the Eb major V chord). The key is F minor.

Based on the chord progression you provided—**Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**—I've analyzed the harmonic function, voice leading, and theoretical context. Here's a clear breakdown:

---

### **Key: F minor**  
### **Mode: Harmonic minor**  

#### **Why F minor?**  
1. **Chord Functions Align Perfectly**:  
   - **Gdim** = `ii°` (supertonic diminished chord)  
     - In F minor harmonic, the scale is **F–G–A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E–F**.  
     - Gdim (G–B♭–D♭) is the **ii° chord**, built on the raised 7th scale degree (E is implied in harmonic minor, but Gdim acts as a leading-tone chord for cadences).  
   - **Eb/G** = `V⁶` (first-inversion dominant chord)  
     - Eb major (E♭–G–B♭) is the **V chord** in F minor harmonic (due to the raised 7th, E♮, making V major instead of minor).  
     - The `/G` bass note (G) is a common voice-leading choice, creating smooth motion from Gdim (G–B♭–D♭ → G–E♭–B♭).  
   - **Bbm/F** = `iv⁶` (first-inversion subdominant minor chord)  
     - Bbm (B♭–D♭–F) is the **iv chord** in F natural minor.  
     - This appears in the progression, confirming mixed use of natural/harmonic minor (common in practice).  
   - **Ab/G** = `III⁶` (first-inversion mediant major chord)  
     - Ab major (A♭–C–E♭) is the **III chord** in F minor (diatonic to both natural and harmonic minor).  
   - **Dbmaj7/F** = `VI⁶` (first-inversion submediant major chord)  
     - Dbmaj7 (D♭–F–A♭–C) is the **VI chord** in F minor (diatonic to natural minor).  

2. **Cadential Patterns**:  
   - The recurring **Gdim → Eb/G** progression is a classic **`ii° → V`** cadence in minor keys, driving toward resolution (though it avoids resolving to `i` here, creating tension).  
   - This is a hallmark of **harmonic minor** (where V is major due to the raised 7th). Natural minor would use E♭m (not E♭), but here E♭/G is major.  

3. **Key Signature Consistency**:  
   - F minor's key signature has **4 flats** (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭).  
   - All chords fit this:  
     - Gdim = G–B♭–D♭ (uses B♭ and D♭)  
     - Eb = E♭–G–B♭ (uses E♭ and B♭)  
     - Bbm = B♭–D♭–F (uses B♭ and D♭)  
     - Ab = A♭–C–E♭ (uses A♭ and E♭)  
     - Dbmaj7 = D♭–F–A♭–C (uses D♭ and A♭).  
   - **No accidentals** contradict this (e.g., the G♮ in Gdim is the raised 7th of harmonic minor, not a foreign note).  

---

### **Why Harmonic Minor (Not Natural Minor)?**  
- **Critical Evidence**: The **Eb major chord** (V) proves harmonic minor. In natural minor, V would be **E♭m** (E♭–G♭–B♭). Here, it's **E♭/G** (E♭–G–B♭), requiring the **G♮** (raised 7th scale degree in F minor).  
- Mixed use of chords (e.g., `iv` = Bbm from natural minor, `V` = Eb from harmonic minor) is stylistically common, but the dominant function (V major) defines the mode as **harmonic minor**.  
- The progression avoids the tonic (Fm), but the gravitational pull toward **F minor** is clear from context (e.g., Gdim → Eb strongly implies resolution to Fm).  

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**  
- **Ab minor?**  
  - Gdim would be the **vii° chord** (vii° = G–B♭–D♭ in A♭ minor).  
  - But Eb/G would be **III⁶** (not dominant), and Bbm/F would be **bII⁶** (Neapolitan).  
  - **Problem**: The progression centers on **Gdim → Eb/G** as a cadential pair (repeated 4x), which doesn't function as a dominant (V) in Ab minor. Also, Ab minor's V chord is **Eb major**, but the bass motion and chord roles better fit F minor.  
- **C minor?**  
  - Gdim would be **iii°**, but Eb/G would be **VI⁶**—not dominant.  
  - **Problem**: No strong cadential motion here.  
- **Major Keys?**  
  - Gdim doesn't fit any major key diatonically (it implies a raised leading tone, foreign to major).  

---

### **Summary**  
| Component       | Analysis                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Key**         | F minor (tonic center implied by chord functions; progression avoids resolving to Fm but orbits around it) |
| **Mode**        | Harmonic minor (required for the **major V chord**: Eb)                   |
| **Progression Function** | `ii° - ii° - V⁶ - V⁶ - ii° - ii° - iv⁶ - III⁶ - ii° - ii° - V⁶ - V⁶ - ii° - ii° - VI⁶ - ii°` |
| **Why it Works** | Smooth voice leading (e.g., Gdim → Eb/G: B♭ and D♭ → G and B♭; Eb/G → Bbm/F: G and B♭ → F and D♭). Common in jazz, film scores, or Romantic-era harmony for tension. |

This progression is **characteristic of F minor harmonic** due to the dominant V chord (Eb), with borrowed natural minor chords (`iv`, `VI`) adding color. If the song resolved to **Fm**, it would confirm the tonal center—but even unresolved, the functional harmony points unequivocally here. 🎹

Let's analyze the given chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**:

### Chord Sequence:
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F Gdim
```

We can group them in bars of 4 for easier analysis:

```
| Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G |
| Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G |
| Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G |
| Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F Gdim |
```

### Step 1: Understand the Chords

Let’s break down each chord and its notes.

#### 1. **Gdim** (G diminished)
- Notes: G, Bb, Db
- A common function: often acts as a **vii°** chord in a major or minor key, especially leading to a tonic or dominant.

#### 2. **Eb/G** (Eb major with G in the bass)
- Eb major: Eb, G, Bb
- Bass note: G
→ So chord tones: G, Eb, G, Bb → essentially **Eb major in first inversion**
- Function: Could be **I or i** (if in Eb major or minor), or **bVI** in G minor.

#### 3. **Bbm/F** (Bb major with F in the bass)
- Bb major: Bb, D, F
- Bass: F → first inversion
- Could be **IV** in **F major**, **iv** in **Eb minor**, or **II** in **Ab major**, etc.

#### 4. **Ab/G** (Ab major with G in bass)
- Ab major: Ab, C, Eb
- Bass: G → **this is a non-chord tone in bass!** G is not in Ab major.
→ So this is **Ab major over G** — a **slash chord**.
→ Notes: G, Ab, C, Eb
This is interesting: **G Ab C Eb** → That’s a **G half-diminished 7th** (Gm7b5): G, Bb, Db, F? Wait — not quite.

Wait — chord is **Ab/C/Eb** with **G** in bass → **G–Ab–C–Eb**

G, Ab, C, Eb — this isn't a standard chord. Let's analyze intervalically:

- G to Ab = minor second
- G to C = #11 (augmented 4th)
- G to Eb = minor 7th

So: G, Ab, C, Eb → This looks like a **G7b9** without the 3rd or 5th? Not quite.

Alternatively: It's **Ab major over G**, which creates a **polychord** or **voicing**. But functionally, this is often used as a **tritone substitution** or **Neapolitan**-related harmony.

Wait — Ab major over G is enharmonically interesting.

But let’s note: **Ab/G** → This is very similar to a **German augmented sixth (Ger+6)** chord in the key of G.

Hold that thought.

#### 5. **Dbmaj7/F** (Db major 7 over F)
- Dbmaj7: Db, F, Ab, C
- Bass: F → So first inversion.
- Notes: F, Ab, C, Db
- F–Ab = minor third, Ab–C = major third, C–Db = minor second
→ Interval structure: m3, M3, m2 — not a very common chord stack.

But note: This sounds very close to a **Neapolitan chord** in the key of **C minor** or **C major**, where **N6 = Db major in first inversion (F in bass)** → **Db/F** — yes! That’s exactly **N6**, the **Neapolitan 6th chord**, which is **very common in minor keys**.

Ah! That’s a big clue.

The **Neapolitan chord** is typically the **bII6** chord, built on the flattened second scale degree, in first inversion, and commonly used in **minor keys**.

So **Db/F** (or Dbmaj7/F) → **very likely N6 in C minor**.

That points strongly to **C minor**.

Let’s test that.

---

### Step 2: Consider Key — Is it C minor?

Let’s test all chords in **C minor**:

- **C natural minor** scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb
- **Harmonic minor** raises the 7th: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B

Now examine each chord:

1. **Gdim** = G, Bb, Db
- In C minor: G is the 5th, Bb is the b7, Db is the b9 (of G)
- Gdim is **vii° of Ab major** — but also appears in **C harmonic minor** as the **vii° chord**.
- In **C harmonic minor**, the **vii° chord is B diminished** — not Gdim.

Wait — Gdim is **not** the vii° of C minor.

C minor key chords:
- i: Cm
- ii°: Ddim
- III: Eb
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm (in natural minor), or **G major** (if V) in harmonic minor
- VI: Ab
- VII: Bb

But Gdim is **not diatonic** to **C natural minor** or **harmonic minor** — because:
- G + Bb + Db → Bb is diatonic, Db is **not** in C natural minor — Db is the flat 6, which isn't present.

C natural minor has **Ab**, not **Db**.

Gdim = G, Bb, Db — **Db is NOT in C minor scale**.

So Gdim is **not diatonic** to C minor.

Hmm. Contradiction?

Wait — unless we’re in **G harmonic minor**?

Let’s try **G minor**.

---

### Try: G minor

G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F  
G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, **F#**

But in our progression, we see **Ab**, **Db**, **Eb**, **F**, **G**, **Bb** — lots of flats, no sharps.

So **F#** isn't likely — so **not G harmonic minor**.

So Gdim in **Bb minor**?

Try **Bb minor**:
- Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab → has Db
- But we have **Ab major** — Ab is the **VII** chord in Bb minor — possible
- Db is **III**, Eb is **iv**, Bb is i

But we have **Gdim** = G, Bb, Db — that’s **vii° of Ab major**, or **#i° in Bb minor** — chromatic

Hmm.

Wait — think about **Eb minor**?

Eb minor: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db → enharmonic to D

But we have lots of **G**, **Bb**, **Db** — appears related to **G diminished**.

Ah! Here’s a key idea:

### Gdim is a **common tone diminished chord** or leading tone chord to **Ab**.

Notice:
- **Gdim** → leads to **Ab/G**? Or **Eb/G**?

But look: after Gdim we go to **Eb/G**, not Ab.

Wait — Gdim and Eb/G — that’s only a semitone apart in root: G to G → same bass? No — **Eb/G** has **G in bass**.

Wait! Many of these chords have **G in the bass**:
- Eb/G → G in bass
- Bbm/F → F in bass
- Ab/G → G in bass
- Dbmaj7/F → F in bass
- Gdim → probably G in bass

So **bass line**:
G – G – G – G  
G – G – F – G  
G – G – G – G  
G – G – F – G

So bass: mostly **G**, then **F**, then back to G.

So the bass alternates between G and F.

So perhaps the **tonic is G**, and the F to G is a **cadence**?

But we have **Gdim**, which is unstable.

But Gdim is **G–Bb–Db**, which is the **leading tone diminished chord of Ab major**.

In fact:
- **Gdim → Ab** is a **common progression**: vii° → I in **Ab major**

Let’s test: **Ab major key**?

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Look at the chords:
- Gdim = G, Bb, Db → **vii° chord of Ab major** ✅
- Eb/G = G, Eb, G, Bb → Eb major over G → Eb is **V**, G is **5th of Eb**, but in Ab major, Eb is the **V chord**!
  - So **Eb/G** is **V6** in **Ab major** ✅
- Bbm/F = Bb (F, Ab, C), F in bass → **IV chord in first inversion** in Ab major ✅
- Ab/G = Ab major over G → Ab is **I**, G is the 7th → first inversion? Ab/G is **I6** in Ab major ✅
- Dbmaj7/F = Db, F, Ab, C → Db is **IV** in Ab major! But with F in bass → **Db/F** is **IV6** in Ab major ✅

Wait — **Db is IV** in Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G → yes, Db is 4th degree.

So Dbmaj7 = **IVmaj7** in Ab major.

Perfectly diatonic.

And Gdim = **vii°** of Ab → leads to I (Ab)

So now let’s re-analyze in **Ab major**:

| Chord       | Function in Ab major |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Gdim        | vii° (leading tone dim) |
| Eb/G        | V6 (dominant, 1st inversion) |
| Bbm/F       | IV6 (subdominant, 1st inversion) |
| Ab/G        | I6 (tonic, 1st inv) |
| Dbmaj7/F    | IV6 (subdominant) |

All chords are **diatonic to Ab major**.

Wait — Dbmaj7 includes a **C** (the major 7th), which is in Ab major (7th note is G, but C is the 4th — Db's major 7th is C).

Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C → yes, C is in Ab major → so Dbmaj7 is simply the **IVmaj7** chord.

Perfect.

So **every chord** fits in **Ab major**.

But why is **Gdim** used so much?

Because:
- **Gdim** = vii° of Ab → common chord to lead to tonic or to V.
- In classical music, **vii°** often substitutes for **V**, or leads to **I** or **V**.

Here, the pattern:
- Gdim → Eb/G → which is **vii° → V6**
- Then: Gdim → Bbm/F → ? vii° → IV6 — less common
- But also Gdim → Ab/G → **vii° → I6** — standard cadence

Also, **Gb dim** (same as F# dim) is enharmonic, but here it's spelled G–Bb–Db → **correct spelling for vii° in Ab**.

---

### Final Analysis

All chords:
- Gdim = G, Bb, Db → vii° in Ab
- Eb/G = Eb (Bb, D, G) wait — Eb is **Bb, D, Eb?** No.

Wait! Mistake.

**Eb major chord**: **Eb, G, Bb**

So Eb/G = G, Eb, G, Bb → notes: **G, Eb, Bb** — that’s **Eb major**, first inversion.

In **Ab major**:
- Ab = I
- Bb = ii
- Cm = iii
- **Db = IV**
- **Eb = V**
- Fm = vi
- Gdim = vii°

Yes! So **Eb major is V** in Ab major.

So **Eb/G** is **V6** → dominant in first inversion — very common.

Similarly:
- **Bbm/F** = Bb major with F in bass → Bb is **ii** chord in Ab major, F is the 5th → **ii6**
- **Ab/G** = I6 → tonic in first inversion
- **Dbmaj7/F** = Db, F, Ab, C → IV chord with F in bass → **IV6**, with added 7 (C), which is diatonic.

So all chords are **diatonic to Ab major**.

---

### So what is the **key and mode**?

✅ **Key: Ab major**  
✅ **Mode: Ionian (major)**

All chords belong to the **Ab major scale** (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G), and the tonal center feels like **Ab**, especially with:
- **Gdim → Ab/G** (vii° → I): a very strong cadence
- **Eb/G → Ab** would be V → I, but we don’t have that explicitly
However, the repeated use of **Gdim** (leading tone chord) strongly pulls to **Ab**.

Also, the **Ab/G** appears directly after **Ab/G** in the second bar, suggesting a move toward tonic.

The **Dbmaj7/F** (IV6) at the end could suggest a **plagal cadence** if followed by Ab, but it resolves back to Gdim — which then implies repetition.

So overall, **tonic is Ab**, and **Gdim** is creating tension that resolves to Ab.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian**

**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a sequence of chords: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to analyze these chords. Let me write them out clearly:

- Gdim (G diminished)
- Gdim
- Eb/G (E-flat minor over G bass)
- Eb/G
- Gdim
- Gdim
- Bbm/F (B-flat minor over F bass)
- Ab/G (A-flat major over G bass)
- Gdim
- Gdim
- Eb/G
- Eb/G
- Gdim
- Gdim
- Dbmaj7/F (D-flat major 7th over F bass)
- Gdim

Hmm, this looks familiar. Let me think about the chord functions. Diminished chords often serve as passing chords or have specific harmonic roles. The presence of Eb/G and Dbmaj7/F might be key clues. 

Starting with the bass notes: G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G. The bass is mostly G, with some F. But the chords above the bass matter more for key determination. 

Looking at Eb/G: that's E-flat minor with G in the bass. But E-flat minor chord is Eb-G-Bb. If the bass is G, that's the third of the chord, so it's Eb minor first inversion. Similarly, Bbm/F: B-flat minor with F bass. Bbm is Bb-Db-F, so F is the fifth, so it's second inversion? Wait, Bbm/F would be F-Bb-Db, which is actually the same as F diminished? No, Bbm is minor, so Bb-Db-F is the triad. With F in bass, it's F-Bb-Db, which is F diminished? Wait no: Bbm triad is Bb (root), Db (minor third), F (perfect fifth). So Bbm/F means F is the bass note, so the chord is F-Bb-Db. That's actually F diminished? Let's check: F to Bb is perfect fourth, not the usual diminished interval. Diminished chord would have minor thirds throughout. F to Ab is minor third, Ab to Cbb (which is Bbb? Messy). Better to think of intervals: F to Bb is perfect fourth, which isn't diminished. 

Wait, Bbm/F is a B-flat minor chord with F in the bass. So the full chord is F-Bb-Db. The intervals: F to Bb is a perfect fourth, Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third. So it's a first inversion minor triad? No: for a minor triad, root position has root, minor third, fifth. First inversion has third in bass, fifth, root. Second inversion has fifth in bass, root, third. So for Bbm: root is Bb, minor third is Db, fifth is F. So Bbm/F has F (fifth) in bass, so it's second inversion Bbm. Similarly, Eb/G: Eb minor has root Eb, minor third G, fifth Bb. So Eb/G has G (minor third) in bass, so it's first inversion Eb minor. 

Then Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th chord with F in bass. Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. With F in bass, it's F-Db-Ab-C. Which is the same as F half-diminished? Wait, Dbmaj7 in first inversion? Let's see: root Db, third F, fifth Ab, seventh C. So first inversion Dbmaj7 would have F in bass. Yes, so Dbmaj7/F is first inversion Db major seventh. 

So let's list the chords with their standard names:

- Gdim: G-Bb-Db
- Gdim
- Eb/G: Eb minor (first inversion), so G-Bb-Eb (but written as Eb/G, so bass G)
- Eb/G
- Gdim
- Gdim
- Bbm/F: Bb minor second inversion, so F-Bb-Db
- Ab/G: A-flat major over G bass. Ab major triad is Ab-C-Eb. With G in bass, so G-Ab-C-Eb? Wait, Ab chords with G bass. Ab major is notes Ab, C, Eb. With G bass, that's G-Ab-C-Eb. Which is... that's a G half-diminished seventh? G-Bb-Db-F would be G half-diminished, but here it's G-Ab-C-Eb. Ab is G#? No, Ab is A-flat, so G to Ab is minor second? That doesn't make sense. Wait, G-Ab-C-Eb: intervals from G: G to Ab is minor 2nd, Ab to C is major third, C to Eb is minor third. That's actually a G diminished seventh chord? G-Bb-Db-Fb, but Fb is E. No, wait: Gdim7 is G-Bb-Db-Fb (which is E). But here G-Ab-C-Eb: Ab is same as G#? No, in standard notation, Ab is not G#. They're enharmonic, but in key context we have to stick to one. But G-Ab is a minor second, which isn't typical for a diminished chord. Wait, Ab/G might be a misnomer? Or maybe the chord is Ab major with G in bass, but that would create a minor 2nd between G and Ab, which is not common. 

Wait, perhaps Ab/G is meant to be A-flat major over G bass, but let's see what the chord is. Ab major triad: Ab, C, Eb. So notes: G (bass), Ab, C, Eb. So the chord notes are G-Ab-C-Eb. Now, in terms of intervals from G: G to Ab is minor 2nd, Ab to C is major third, C to Eb minor third. That's not a standard chord. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Gdim chord but with Ab instead? Gdim7 is G-Bb-Db-Fb (E natural). But Ab is the same as G#, which would make it G#-B-D-F, but that's not matching. 

Wait, maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps Ab/G is meant to be the chord Ab major with G as the bass, but that creates a G-Ab (minor 2nd), which is dissonant. Alternatively, maybe it's a G minor chord? No. Wait, another possibility: sometimes "Ab/G" might be a slash chord where the upper part is Ab major, but in context, perhaps it's actually an altered chord. Alternatively, maybe "Ab/G" is a typo and should be something like Gb/G or something else? But let's hold that thought and look at the Dbmaj7/F. Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. With F bass: F-Db-Ab-C. Let's see the intervals: F to Db is major sixth, Db to Ab perfect fourth, etc. But more importantly, let's consider common harmonic patterns. 

This chord sequence looks very familiar. I think this is the intro to the song "Stardust" by Hoagy Carmichael. Let me verify. Yes! "Stardust" starts with: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G... and so on. Yes, that's exactly the chords for the first few bars of "Stardust". 

Now, what key is "Stardust" in? It's typically considered to be in the key of E-flat major. Let me check the chords. 

For "Stardust", the key is E-flat major. Let's see how these chords fit into E-flat major. 

E-flat major scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. 

Looking at the chords:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db. In E-flat major, Db is the seventh degree, G is the third degree? Wait, E-flat major notes: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. So Gb is the third (which is also F#), but usually written as Gb, not F# in E-flat. So Gdim: G-Bb-Db. In E-flat major, Db is the 7th tone (subtonic), Gb is the third but flattened? Wait, no: the notes of E-flat major are Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. So the chord Gdim consists of G, Bb, Db. But G is not in E-flat major scale; G is not Gb. G is F# enharmonically, but in E-flat, it's not part of the key. So how does Gdim fit? 

Ah, but diminished chords often serve as passing chords. Let's see the progression. 

In "Stardust", the standard key is E-flat major. The progression is known as a iiø7-V7-Imaj7 or something, but let's analyze the chords in relation to E-flat major. 

First, the Gdim chord. Diminished chords can be used in various ways. The Gdim chord: G-Bb-Db. What's the function? If we consider Eb as the tonic, then Db is the leading tone. Gdim could be a vii°7 of the dominant, but dominant of E-flat is Bb, so vii°7 of Bb would be A-C-Eb-Gb. Doesn't match. Alternatively, Gdim could be a diminished chord leading into E-flat, but how? 

Wait, perhaps the key is B-flat? Let's try B-flat major. Bb major scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. 

Gdim: G, Bb, Db. In Bb major, G is the sixth degree? Bb major has note G natural. Yes, G is the sixth. The Bb major scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab. So chord Gdim in Bb major would contain G, Bb, Db. Bb is root, but Bb is in scale. Db is a flattened second? No, in Bb major, Db is not in scale; it's a chromatic note. Bb major has Ab, not Db. Wait, Bb major: Bb C Db Eb F G Ab. Oh right, yes: Db is the fourth degree? No: Bb (1), C (2), Db (3? No: Bb to C is major second, C to Db is minor second. Wait, no: Bb major scale is Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab. So the third is D natural, not Db. Db is not in Bb major; Bb major has D natural. So Gdim has Db, which is not in Bb major. So not Bb major. 

Wait, let's look at the chord Dbmaj7/F. Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. F in bass. Now, if we're in E-flat major, what is Db? Db is the flattened seventh of Eb. Dbmaj7 would be the seventh chord on Db. But in E-flat major, the seventh scale degree is Db, so a chord built on Db would be Db-F-Ab-C, which is a diminished seventh? No: Db major seventh would be Db-E-F-Ab? No, Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. F is major third, Ab perfect fifth, C major seventh. So Dbmaj7 in E-flat major: the tonic is Eb, so the seventh tone is Db, so a chord built on Db would be Db minor seventh or something? Db minor seventh is Db-Fb-Ab-Cb, which is messy. Actually, Dbmaj7 doesn't fit into E-flat major as a diatonic chord. 

But "Stardust" is usually in E-flat, but let's check the standard song. The chord progression for Stardust's introduction is a classic "circle of fifths" progression. Let me recall the chords for Stardust. 

Standard chords for Stardust: The intro is Gdim, Gdim, Eb7, Eb7, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm7, Ab7, Gdim, Gdim, Eb7, Eb7, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7, Gdim... Wait, but the user wrote "Bbm/F" and "Ab/G" and "Dbmaj7/F". 

Ah, but in the song, the chord after Gdim Gdim is often Eb7 (E-flat dominant seventh), but written as Eb/G? Because Eb7 is Eb-G-Bb-Db. If you put G in the bass, that's Eb7/G. So Eb/G would be a second inversion Eb7 chord. Similarly, Bbm/F: Bbm7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab. If F is in bass, then F-Bb-Db, which is Bbm7/F (second inversion). Ab/G: Ab7 is Ab-C-Eb-Gb. With G in bass? G-Ab-C-Eb. That's Ab7/G which is a common way to notate it, though the bass is G. But Ab7 in root position is Ab-C-Eb-Gb. With G in bass, that's G-Ab-C-Eb. But G is the root of the bass? Wait, no: Ab7/G means the chord is Ab7 with G as the bass note. So notes: G (bass), Ab (root of Ab7), C (third), Eb (fifth), Gb (seventh). So the notes would be G-Ab-C-Eb-Gb. But that's a bit complex. Alternatively, maybe Ab/G is written as Ab7 with G bass, which creates a suspended sound but it's actually the seventh in the bass? Wait, Ab7 chord is Ab, C, Eb, Gb. So if you put Gb in the bass, that's Gb-Ab-C-Eb (Ab7/Gb), but the user wrote Ab/G. So G bass. So notes: G, Ab, C, Eb. But that's G-Ab-C-Eb. The interval between G and Ab is a minor second. This is a bit dissonant, but possible. However, in standard "Stardust", the chord after Bbm/F is typically Ab7. So Ab7 with G in bass would be Ab7/G: Ab7 is Ab, C, Eb, Gb. Bass G doesn't fit because the seventh is Gb, not G. Unless it's a typo and it's supposed to be Ab7/Gb. But the user wrote "Ab/G", which would be G bass for Ab major, but Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. With G bass: G-Ab-C-Eb. 

Alternatively, perhaps "Ab/G" is meant to be a G diminished chord with Ab? No. Another thought: maybe the key is G minor? But Gdim is common in G minor. But let's think. 

Let's analyze the chord tones and see which key they fit into. 

Looking at the Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. F in bass. Now, if we consider this as part of a progression, Dbmaj7 with F bass could be a rootless voicing of F-Db-Ab-C, which might function as a chord in F minor? But F minor's diatonic chords: Fm, Gdim, Ab, Bb, Cm, Dm, Edim. Dbmaj7 isn't diatonic to F minor. 

Wait, what about E-flat major: scale Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. 

Gdim: G, Bb, Db. G is not in Eb major (it's Gb), so G would be a chromatic note. Bb is in the scale, Db is in the scale. So G is outside. 

Eb/G: Eb minor? No, Eb/G is Eb minor with G bass. Eb minor chord is Eb-Gb-Bb. But here Eb/G: if the chord is Eb minor first inversion, the notes are G-Eb-Bb. But in Eb major scale, the third of Eb minor would be Gb, not G. So Eb minor chord has Gb, not G natural. So Eb/G would have G natural, which is not in Eb major (which has Gb). 

Ah! Maybe the key is E-flat minor? But "Stardust" is not in minor. 

Wait, let's think about dominant function. The Bbm/F and Ab/G. If we consider the Bbm, in what key is Bbm a diatonic chord? In G minor? G minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Bbm chord would be Bb-D-F, which is diatonic in G minor? Yes, Bb is the VI of G minor (since minor key, VI is flat). G minor: i, ii°, III+, iv, v, VI, VII. So Bb minor is the VI chord in G minor. Then Ab would be the VII chord (A flat). 

But let's check. In G minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So Bbm is notes Bb, Db, F – wait, Bbm is Bb minor, which is Bb, Db, F. Yes, in G minor, the sixth degree is Eb but the chord would be Bb minor? No: the VI chord in G minor is Eb major? No: for natural minor, G minor is scale degrees: 1=G, 2=A, 3=Bb, 4=C, 5=D, 6=Eb, 7=F. So the VI chord is Eb major. The minor vii chord would be F minor? Not sure. Let's list chords for G natural minor:

i: Gm (G-Bb-D)

ii°: A° (A-C-E)

III: Bb (Bb-D-F) → which is major, so Bb is III.

iv: Cm (C-Eb-G)

v: Dm (D-F-A)

VI: Eb (Eb-G-Bb) – this is major because natural minor has major VI chord.

VII: F (F-A-C) – major VII chord.

So Bbm chord would not be in G minor. Bbm chord (Bb-Db-F) is not diatonic. But if it's G melodic minor... but this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is C minor? Let's see. C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

Bbm would be Bb, Db, F – Bb is the VII chord, which is minor in natural minor? In natural minor, the VII chord is Bb major? C minor: VII chord is Bb (Bb-D-F), yes, major. So Bbm would not be diatonic. 

Back to "Stardust": the original key is usually played in E-flat major, but the progression is actually using the I-VI-II-V progression with some substitutions. Let's list the chords as commonly played in Stardust:

Intro:

Gdim – Gdim

Eb7 – Eb7

Gdim – Gdim

Bbm7 – Ab7

Gdim – Gdim

Eb7 – Eb7

Gdim – Gdim

Dbmaj7 – Gdim

Then it goes to Gm7-C7-Fmaj7... 

Wait, but in the user's input: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim

Ah, so in the song, "Eb/G" is often written as Eb7/G, which is the seventh chord of E-flat with G in the bass. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bbm7 with F in bass. Ab/G would be Ab7 with G in bass? But Ab7 with G bass: the seventh of Ab7 is Gb, so G bass would be a non-chord tone. Alternatively, perhaps the Ab/G is meant to be Ab7 (but with G bass?), which doesn't make sense. Wait, no: Ab7 is Ab-C-Eb-Gb; so the seventh is Gb. If you have a G natural in the bass, that creates a minor second between G and Ab. But in jazz harmony, sometimes you have a suspension or something, but typically for this progression, it's actually Ab7 with Gb in the bass? Or perhaps "Ab/G" is a misnomer, and it's actually "Ab7/Gb" but written as Ab/G for simplicity? Or perhaps the chord is Ab major, and the G is part of the chord. But Ab major with G bass is G-Ab-C-Eb. 

Alternatively, in the song "Stardust", the chord is Ab/G, which is a common way to notate the Ab major chord over a G bass, but in harmony terms, G is a common tone. Wait, but in the standard progression, after Bbm7, the next chord is Ab7. So Ab7 is the chord, and sometimes it's voiced with G in the bass, but Ab7's seventh is Gb, not G natural. However, there might be a note of confusion here. 

Let's take a step back. What's the functional harmony of these chords in the context of a standard jazz tune like "Stardust". 

The typical progression for the intro is:

Gdim (or Gø) — this often functions as a II chord or a passing chord. But in many analyses, the Gdim is actually acting as a half-step leading tone chord. 

In jazz analysis of Stardust:

- The first part: Gdim, Gdim — this is often a diminished chord resolving to Bb (or something). But let's see the following chords. 

Wait, perhaps the key is C major or C minor. Let's see:

If we look at the Dbmaj7 chord — Dbmaj7. If the key were C major, Db is not diatonic. C major has Db? No. 

C minor has Db? Yes, C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Db is not there. 

Wait, the most common key for Stardust is E-flat major, with the progression being:

Starting on Gdim, which is a diminished chord that leads into Eb. The Gdim chord is often considered a vii°7 of the dominant, but in E-flat major, the dominant is Bb. vii° of Bb would be A°7 (A, C, Eb, Gb). Not matching. 

Another approach: in E-flat major, the I chord is Eb. If we have a chord progression that goes to E-flat, what would the preceding chord be? Usually a V chord (Bb7) leading to Eb. But let's see the chord Dbmaj7. Db is the flattened seventh of Eb. So Dbmaj7 would be a chromatic chord leading to Eb, maybe as a IV chord or something. Dbmaj7 to Eb would be a descending chromatic bass note from Db to Eb. But in the sequence given, Dbmaj7/F is played before Gdim. 

Wait, let's look at the last few chords: Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. So Dbmaj7/F is followed by Gdim. Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is F minor. Let's check F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. 

Chords:

i: Fm (F-Ab-C)

ii°: G° (G-Bb-Db)

III: Ab (Ab-C-Eb) — which is major

iv: Bbm (Bb-Db-F)

v: Cm (C-Eb-G)

VI: Db (Db-F-Ab) — major

VII: Eb (Eb-G-Bb) — major

So in F minor:

- Gdim: G° (G-Bb-Db) — which is ii° chord

- Eb/G: Eb is the VII chord. Eb chord is Eb-G-Bb. With G bass: that's Eb first inversion (G-Eb-Bb), which would be VII6 (or VII chord with third in bass)

But Eb/G would be Eb major with G bass — yes, that fits F minor.

- Bbm/F: Bbm is iv chord. With F bass: F-Bb-Db — which for Bbm (Bb-Db-F), so with F bass is second inversion iv. Yes.

- Ab/G: Ab is the III chord. Ab major chord: Ab-C-Eb. With G bass: G-Ab-C-Eb. In F minor scale, Ab is the third degree? F minor notes: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. So Ab is the III degree. Ab chord: Ab-C-Eb. With G in bass — the third of the Ab chord is C, but bass is G. So G is the second diatonic note? F minor scale has G as II. So G-Ab-C-Eb — in terms of intervals from G root: G-Ab (minor second), which would be a suspention or something. But perhaps Ab/G is just the Ab chord over G bass, making the notes G, Ab, C, Eb. In F minor context, this chord has a G as a common tone between G and Ab, but it's not diatonic. 

- Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. With F bass: F-Db-Ab-C. Db is the VI degree in F minor. Db chord is VI. But Dbmaj7 — major seventh chord on VI? In F minor, the VI chord would normally be Db major (Db-F-Ab), but adding a major seventh (C) — Dbmaj7 would be Db-F-Ab-C. Which actually is the same as C half-diminished? No. Dbmaj7 to C natural? Db to C is major seventh? Db to C is minor second? No, Db to C is a major seventh (C is the seventh above Db). Yes: Db to C is major seventh interval (11 semitones). So Dbmaj7 chord. In F minor key, the VI chord is Db major, so Dbmaj7 would be an extended chord on VI. 

But F minor's diatonic chords don't include Dbmaj7; the VI chord is normally Db major (Db-F-Ab), so adding a seventh makes it Dbmaj7, which is not diatonic because F minor's seventh would be Eb, but here the seventh is C. 

Hmm, maybe this is F minor but with chromatic embellishments. 

Another thought: the song "Stardust" is actually in the key of E-flat major, and the chords are using the circle of fifths progression. Let's see the common progression. 

Standard intro for Stardust (in E-flat major):

- Bar 1: Gdim7

- Bar 2: Gdim7

- Bar 3: Eb7

- Bar 4: Eb7

- Bar 5: Gdim7

- Bar 6: Gdim7

- Bar 7: Bbm7

- Bar 8: Ab7

- Bar 9: Gdim7

- Bar 10: Gdim7

- Bar 11: Eb7

- Bar 12: Eb7

- Bar 13: Gdim7

- Bar 14: Gdim7

- Bar 15: Dbmaj7

- Bar 16: Gdim7

Wait, but then the melody resolves to Eb, but the chords Gdim7, Eb7, Bbm7, Ab7 would form a ii-V-I in F minor? Wait:

Gdim7 (G Bb Db F) is the half-diminished chord, which is mi7b5 — so in F minor, Gm7b5 is the ii chord. Because F minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. ii° is G half-diminished. So Gm7b5 is ii chord in F minor. Then Ab7 is the V chord (VII in F natural minor, but typically V would be Cm, but in harmonic minor it's C7; here Ab7 isn't the dominant). Let's see:

In F minor harmonic minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, E (major seventh). So V chord would be C7 (C, E, G, Bb). Doesn't match Ab7. 

But the progression Gm7b5 (ii), Bb7 (III?), Ab7… Hmm. 

Alternatively, the Bbm7 and Ab7 in a cycle. Bbm7 to Ab7 — that's a descending minor third. Or the ii-V in Db major. Bbm7 is minor i chord of Db? No. Bbm7 would be iv of Eb major? Eb major scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Bbm7 is Bb-D-F-Ab — yes, which is the iv chord of Eb major. Ab7 is Ab-C-Eb-Gb — which is a dominant seventh chord on Ab, which in Eb major, Ab is the IV chord, but dominant function would be for resolving to Db. So Ab7 would be the dominant of Db. Then Dbmaj7 would be the I chord of Db major. But this would imply a modulation. 

So in this case, the progression has sections that move towards Db, but the overall key is Eb major. 

But the entire song is in Eb major. Let me confirm: Stardust is usually played in E-flat major. The melody starts on G (which is the third of Eb major). Let's see, melody notes: for the first phrase, "Stardust, moonlight, and love", usually starts on G. G is the 3rd of Eb major. So the tonic is Eb. 

Now, the chords: 

- Gdim7 — this is a diminished 7th chord, which in Eb major would be chromatic. But in jazz harmony, it often serves as a passing chord. Specifically, the Gdim7 (G-Bb-Db-F) can be seen as a vii°7 of the dominant in Eb major, but the dominant is Bb7. vii°7 of Bb would be A°7, so no. Alternatively, it might be a substitute for Bb7 or something. 

But Gdim7 is enharmonically equivalent to Bbdim7, Dbdim7, etc. Bbdim7 is Bb-Db-Fb-Abb (but usually written Bb-Db-Fb-Abb). But often the chord is called Gdim7. 

Another way: the chord progression is I - vi - ii - V in some contexts, but let's see. 

In Eb major: 

I: Eb

vi: Cm

ii: Fm

V: Bb

But the chords here don't match that. 

But looking at the Bbm7 and Ab7 — Bbm7 (Bb-Db-F-Ab), Ab7 (Ab-C-Eb-Gb). Now, moving from Bbm7 to Ab7 — Bbm7 to Ab7 is a minor third down. This is often called a "Tritone Substitution" but not exactly. 

Wait, but Ab7 is the dominant seventh in Db major, as the V chord of Db. And Dbmaj7 is the I chord of Db. So Bbm7, Ab7, Dbmaj7 — this would be a ii-V-I in Db. Let's check:

In Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C.

ii chord would be Ebm, but here Bbm7. Not matching. 

Bbm7 is Bb-Db-F-Ab. In Db major, the notes: Db (1), Eb (2), F (3), Gb (4), Ab (5), Bb (6), C (7). So Bbm7 would be Bb, Db, F, Ab — Bb is the sixth degree, Db the second, F the third, Ab the fifth. Not a standard chord. 

Alternatively, Bbm7 = Bb minor seventh: Bb, Db, F, Ab. In C minor: C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Bbm7 would be Bb, Db, F, Ab. In C minor, this is the VII chord? VII chord in C minor is Bb major (Bb, D, F), so Bbm is minor VII, which isn't diatonic to natural minor. In harmonic minor, VII is Bb major. So Bbm isn't diatonic. 

This is getting too confusing. Let's take a step back. 

The specific sequence provided: 

Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim

This is the intro to "Stardust" by Hoagy Carmichael, which is always played in the key of **E-flat major**. Although the chords include alterations and chromatic movement, the overall key is Eb major. 

Let me verify with the diatonic chords of Eb major:

- Eb major scale: Eb F Gb Ab Bb C Db

- Gdim chord: G, Bb, Db. In Eb major, G is not diatonic (it's Gb), but G is used as chromatic leading tone. However, in jazz harmony, it's common to use Gdim as a passing or embellishing chord. 

- The Eb/G is essentially Eb major triad with G in bass. But Eb major triad is Eb-G-Bb. With G in bass, it's first inversion. However, in this progression, it's often written as Eb7/G — which would be Eb-G-Bb-Db over G bass. That's a common way to write the Eb7 chord in second inversion. 

- Bbm/F: Bbm in first inversion (F in bass) is Bbm chord with F as bass note, so F-Bb-Db. But Bbm7 would be Bb-Db-F-Ab. With F in bass: F-Bb-Db-Ab? So Bbm7/F. Which is a common voicing. 

- Ab/G: likely Ab7. Ab7 chord: Ab-C-Eb-Gb. With G in bass, the notes would be G-Ab-C-Eb-Gb. But the G in bass is a major seventh above Ab (Ab to G is 11 semitones? Ab to A is 1, A to Ab is 11). So G is a minor seventh above Ab (since Ab to Gb is minor seventh; but G natural is a major seventh above Ab? No: Ab to G is major seventh interval (11 semitones: Ab to A is 1 semitone, A to Bb is 2, ..., Ab to G is 11 semitones). Yes, a major seventh. But typically, the seventh in Ab7 is Gb (minor seventh), not G natural. So there might be confusion here. 

However, in the context of the song, the Ab/G is often the Ab dominant seventh chord with the minor seventh in the bass. Wait, Ab7's seventh is Gb, so if the bass is G, that's a minor second above Ab, which is very dissonant. But perhaps in reality, it's written as Ab/G but the performer plays a Gb in the bass. Or it's a typo. 

Despite these nuances, "Stardust" is universally played in the key of **E-flat major**. Even though the progression uses chromatic chords, the tonic is E-flat. The melody centers around E-flat major. 

But let's confirm the tonic. When you hear the song, the resolution is to Eb. The melody notes: the first note is "Stardust" — high G (third of Eb), and it resolves to G, then F, etc. Overall, the song feels rooted in Eb major. 

So even though the chords may not all be diatonic, the key is Eb major. However, some might say it's in E-flat major with a lot of chromaticism. 

Alternatively, could it be C minor? The melody starts on G, which is the middle note of the octave in many minor keys. But "Stardust" is not typically played in minor. 

Another way: check the tonic. If I play E-flat major scale and see if all the chords can be related. But no chord has root on Eb, except possibly later in the song. The intro chords don't have Eb major chord. 

Ah, that's a good point. The intro progression for Stardust doesn't have the tonic chord (Eb major) in the beginning. It starts with Gdim, then Eb7. So Eb7 is the dominant seventh chord of Ab. Wait, no. Eb7 is an E-flat dominant seventh chord. What key does Eb7 belong to? As a dominant seventh, it resolves to Ab major. But in the song, it usually resolves to Eb major later. Wait, no: the progression after the intro goes to Gm7-C7-Fmaj7 etc. 

Wait, no, let's recall the actual chord progression of Stardust. The full progression for Stardust is:

Intro: Gdim7, Gdim7, Eb7, Eb7, Gdim7, Gdim7, Bbm7, Ab7, then Gdim7, Gdim7, Eb7, Eb7, Gdim7, Gdim7, Dbmaj7, G7, then it goes to Gm7, C7, Fmaj7... 

Wait, but that suggests a modulation. The Gdim7 leading to Eb7. In which key? If the song is in F major, Eb7 is the seventh scale degree? Not sure. 

Actually, Stardust is usually played in the key of C major or F major. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up mentally. 

Classic rendition: "Stardust" by Hoagy Carmichael is most commonly played in the key of **E-flat major**. However, due to the chromatic movement of the bass line, it often moves through different keys temporarily. 

But the primary key is E-flat. 

Another way: the Dbmaj7 chord is a major seventh on the flattened seventh of Eb major. So Db is the VII chord in Eb major, but it's usually a dominant seventh chord (Db7) to resolve to C, but not sure. 

Wait, the final resolution of the song is to Eb major. For example, the melody ends on Eb. So the tonic is Eb. 

Given all this, the key is **E-flat major** and it's in **major mode**. The mode is major since it's a major key. 

But wait, sometimes songs are analyzed with the key based on tonic, but modes are related to scale degrees. However, the key is E-flat major, so the mode is Ionian (major). 

But let me see if there's a different perspective. Some might say it's in E-flat major with a lot of chromaticism. Yes. 

Alternatively, considering the chord progression in relation to Eb major:

- The Eb7 chord is the dominant of Ab, but in the song it resolves to Eb? Usually, Eb7 would resolve to Ab, but in the context of the song, it might be using Eb7 as a substitute for Eb major, but that's not standard. 

Actually, the chord progression for Stardust uses a "circle progression" descending by major thirds. For example:

- Gdim7 (G-Bb-Db-F) → Eb7 (Eb-G-Bb-Db) → Bbm7 (Bb-Db-F-Ab) → Ab7 (Ab-C-Eb-Gb) → Dbmaj7 (Db-F-Ab-C) → ...

Yes, this is a famous descending sequence: each chord is a minor third lower. G to Eb to Bb to Ab to Db — each a minor third lower. And a minor third is three half steps. 

So the progression is Gdim7 → Eb7 → Bbm7 → Ab7 → Dbmaj7 → ... 

This is the "Stardust" progression, often called the "circle of thirds" progression. The movement is G - Eb - Bb - Ab - Db — each a minor third down. 

In this case, the key center is not clearly one key, but the song starts on this progression and ultimately resolves to E-flat major. However, typically, the key of the song is considered to be **E-flat major**, even though the intro doesn't have the tonic chord, and the progression itself is more chromatic. But in most contexts, "Stardust" is said to be in the key of E-flat. 

To confirm: if I listen to Stardust, the melody is in E-flat major. The first line of the melody is usually: G, G, E, D, E, etc. — the notes are from Eb major scale (G is third, E is sixth, D is seventh). So yes, E-flat major. 

Therefore, the key is E-flat major, mode is major (Ionian). 

But let's see the chords again. In the key of E-flat major, Eb major scale:

- Gdim7: G-Bb-Db-F. This is not diatonic to Eb major (scale has Gb, not G natural), but it's a chromatic passing chord.

- Eb7: Eb-G-Bb-Db. Yes, this is the seventh chord on Eb — but the seventh chord in Eb major would be Eb7 (I7), which is common in jazz to have the I7 chord.

- Bbm7: Bb-Db-F-Ab. In Eb major scale, the Bb minor is not diatonic. Scale has Bb, so Bbm7 would require Db and F. Scale has Db? No: Eb major has Db? No, Eb major scale has Db as the seventh degree. Wait, Eb major scale is Eb F Gb Ab Bb C Db. So the seventh degree is Db. Bbm7 would be Bb (IV), Db (vii), F (II? No), F is the sixth degree? Let's list all notes in Eb major:

1. Eb

2. F

3. Gb

4. Ab

5. Bb

6. C

7. Db

So the Bbm7 chord: Bb, Db, F, Ab. Bb is 5th, Db is 7th, F is 2nd, Ab is 4th. So yes, that's a diatonic chord? All notes Bb, Db, F, Ab are in Eb major scale. Because Eb major has Ab, Bb, Db, F. Wait, yes:

- Eb major scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db

So all the notes in Bbm7: Bb (5th), Db (7th), F (2nd), Ab (4th) — yes, all are in Eb major. So Bbm7 is a diatonic minor seventh chord built on Bb (which is the fifth scale degree of Eb). But in major key, the fifth degree is usually a major triad (Bb major), but with a minor seventh it would be Bbm7, which has F and Db, etc. However, in standard diatonic harmony, chord on Bb in Eb major would be Bb major (Bb-D-F), but D is not in Eb major scale — because scale has Ab, not D. So Bb major would be Bb-D-F, but Eb major scale has D? No. Eb major scale: note 6 is C, note 7 is Db. There is no D. So the scale has Db, not D natural. So Bb major chord would have Bb, D natural, F — but D natural is not in Eb major scale. Therefore, Bbm7 chord would be Bb-Db-F-Ab. D natural not present; Db replaces D. So Bb-Db-F-Ab would be a minor seventh chord built on Bb, with Db being the minor third. And yes, these notes are in Eb major scale. Because Eb major has Db. So yes, Bbm7 is diatonic to Eb major. 

Similarly, Ab7 chord: Ab-C-Eb-Gb. Ab is 4th degree of Eb major. C is 6th, Eb is 1st, Gb is 3rd. So all in scale. So Ab7 would be a chord built on Ab (IV), which is normally Ab major (Ab-C-Eb), but the seventh is Gb (which is the third of the scale), so the chord would have Eb as the fifth. Wait, Ab7 chord: Ab (root), C (major third), Eb (perfect fifth), Gb (minor seventh). Yes, all these notes are in Eb major scale! 

Eb major scale: notes Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db. So for Ab7:

- Root: Ab

- Third: C

- Fifth: Eb

- Seventh: Gb

All present in the scale. So yes, Ab7 is diatonic to Eb major as the V chord of the subdominant area or something. 

And Dbmaj7: Db-F-Ab-C. Let's see. Dbmaj7 chord has Db (root), F (major third: Db to F is major third), Ab (perfect fifth: Db to Ab is perfect fifth), C (major seventh: Db to C is major seventh). Now in Eb major scale: Db is 7th, F is 2nd, Ab is 4th, C is 6th. All notes present in Eb major scale. So Dbmaj7 is also diatonic to Eb major. 

Wow, that's right! Because in Eb major, the scale contains Db, so a Db major seventh chord would have Db (I in Db but as VII in Eb), but the notes of Dbmaj7 (Db-F-Ab-C) all exist in Eb major. Because Eb major scale has Db, F, Ab, and C. Yes. 

Similarly, Gdim7: G-Bb-Db-F. But Eb major scale has Gb (not G), so G is not diatonic. But in the song, they use G natural. However, sometimes it's written as Gdim7 (G-Bb-Db-F), which has G natural. But in Eb major, the scale has Gb—so G natural would be a chromatic alteration. However, sometimes this chord is interpreted as a vii°7 of Ab (in Ab major), which is G-Bb-Db-Fb. But regardless, the song's tonality is centered on Eb. 

So to summarize:

- All chords except Gdim7 are diatonic to Eb major.

- Gdim7 uses G natural, which is chromatic (since Eb major has Gb), but it's a common passing chord.

- The overall key is E-flat major.

- Mode is major (Ionian).

Even though there's a G-natural, the song's tonic is E-flat, and the melody resolves there. Also, when people say "Stardust is in Eb major", they mean the key center is Eb. 

Therefore, the key is E-flat major, mode is Ionian (major).

The chord progression **Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim** is the iconic intro to **"Stardust" by Hoagy Carmichael**. This progression is universally analyzed in the context of **E-flat major (Eb Major)**.

---

### **Key Analysis: E-flat Major**
- **Tonic (I)**: The song resolves to **E-flat (Eb)** as its central tonal center. The melody and harmonic structure consistently return to Eb as the home note.
- **Diatonic Chords in Eb Major**:
  - **Eb Major Scale**: *Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db*
  - **Bbm7 (Bb-Db-F-Ab)**: Diatonic to Eb Major (built on **Bb**, the 5th degree of Eb Major).
  - **Ab7 (Ab-C-Eb-Gb)**: Diatonic to Eb Major (built on **Ab**, the 4th degree; its notes fit within the scale).
  - **Dbmaj7 (Db-F-Ab-C)**: Diatonic to Eb Major (built on **Db**, the 7th degree; all notes exist in the scale).
  - **Eb/G**: Typically interpreted as **Eb7/G** (first inversion of Eb7), which is also diatonic to Eb Major (Eb-G-Bb-Db with G in bass).

- **Gdim (G-Bb-Db)**: While **G natural** is chromatic to Eb Major (which uses **Gb**), it functions as a chromatic passing chord. This is common in jazz standards like "Stardust," where diminished chords create tension before resolving back to the tonic.

---

### **Mode: Ionian (Major)**
- The progression is firmly rooted in the **major mode (Ionian)**. 
- All diatonic chords align with the **Eb Major scale**, and the melody and harmonic resolution center around **Eb** as the tonic.
- Despite chromatic elements (e.g., Gdim), the overall tonality is **major**, not minor or modal.

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **F Minor?**  
  - While some chords (e.g., Bbm, Ab7) can fit in F minor, the melody and resolution clearly center on **Eb**, not F. Additionally, the Dbmaj7 chord's notes (Db, F, Ab, C) are all in Eb Major but not in F minor (F minor has E natural, not F natural as a diatonic 6th).
- **C Major?**  
  - No diatonic relationship exists between the chords and C Major.  
- **Other Keys?**  
  - No key fits the progression as cohesively as **Eb Major**, which is the standard interpretation for "Stardust" in all jazz and popular music contexts.

---

### **Summary**
- **Key**: **E-flat Major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian (Major)**  
- **Context**: This progression is the iconic intro to **"Stardust"**, a jazz standard famously played in **Eb Major** despite chromatic embellishments (like Gdim). The harmonic language resolves cleanly to **Eb as the tonic**, confirming the key and mode.  

> 💡 **Fun Fact**: The descending minor-third motion (G → Eb → Bb → Ab → Db) is a hallmark of "Stardust," creating a dreamy, nostalgic mood while staying firmly rooted in Eb Major.

### Step 1: Analyze the chords

Let’s write out each chord with its root and quality:

| Chord       | Notes (approx.)        | Function/Analysis |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                | G diminished (ii° in A minor?) |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Eb/G        | G Bb Eb                | **Eb major triad with G in bass** → G is the 3rd → So this is **Eb major** in 1st inversion |
| Eb/G        | G Bb Eb                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Bbm/F       | F Aa C#? → Wait, Bb minor = Bb Db F → with F in bass → **F Bb Db** → **F is the 5th of Bb minor** → So this is **Bb minor in 2nd inversion** |
| Ab/G        | G Ab C Eb? → Ab = Ab C Eb → so Ab major triad with G in bass → **G Ab C Eb** → **Ab major triad (Ab C Eb) + G** → That’s **Ab7**? But written as Ab/G → likely **Ab major with G bass** → chord is **Ab/G → G, Ab, C, Eb** → This is a **G7 chord**? But G7 is G B D F — this has Ab, not B. So not G7. Let's think differently. |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Eb/G        | G Bb Eb                |                   |
| Eb/G        | G Bb Eb                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Dbmaj7/F    | F Ab C E               | Db major 7 = Db F Ab C → with F in bass: **F Ab C Db** → this is **Fmaj7#11? No — better: Db major 7 in 2nd inversion → F is the 5th of Db → So: Dbmaj7/F = F (5th), Ab (7th), C (3rd), Db (root) → so chord tones: F, Ab, C, Db → this is an **Fm7 chord**? Wait, Fm7 = F Ab C Eb — here we have Db, not Eb. So not Fm7. We have **F, Ab, C, Db → notes: F, Ab, C, Db → scales?**

Wait — F, Ab, C, Db → let’s rearrange: Db, F, Ab, C → that’s **Db maj7** yes — Db (root), F (3rd), Ab (5th), C (7th). So with F in bass — that’s **Dbmaj7/F**, as written.

So chord is **Db major 7 with F in bass** — perfectly normal inversion.

| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |

---

### Step 2: Look for a tonal center

We see a recurring chord: **Gdim** — appears 8 times — very prominent.

Also **Eb/G** appears 4 times.

And **Dbmaj7/F** appears once, at the end — very important.

Let’s look at what **Gdim** implies.

- Gdim = G Bb Db — these notes are also in the **Bb harmonic minor** scale and ** Eb major** scale? Let’s test.

What scales contain G, Bb, Db?

- **Bb minor** (natural): Bb C Db Eb F Gb A Bb → contains G? No, G is natural — not in Bb natural minor.
- **Bb harmonic minor**: Bb C Db Eb F Gb A → still no G
- **G minor (natural)**: G Ab Bb C D Eb F G → YES! G, Bb, Db are **1, b3, b5** → G **diminished triad** is the **vii°** chord in **A minor** or **C major**.

But we have Eb/G = G Bb Eb — this is **Eb major** in 1st inversion.

Eb major = Eb F G Ab Bb C D — contains F, G, Ab, Bb — so G and Bb are in Eb major.

Gb? Not here. But we have Gdim = G Bb Db — Db is not in Eb major (Eb major has D natural).

Conflict: Eb major = Eb F G Ab Bb C D — so **D natural**. But Gdim has **Db** → which is **not in Eb major**.

So how can we have both Eb major *and* Gdim (which has Db)?

→ **Db is the b5 of G**, so it’s a chromatic note in Eb major.

This suggests **borrowing** or **modal mixture**.

Let’s consider **C minor**.

C minor natural: C D Eb F G Ab Bb

C minor harmonic: C D Eb F G Ab B **C**

C minor melodic: C D Eb F G A B C (ascending)

In **C minor**, the diatonic vii° is B° = B D F — not Gdim.

Gdim is **not diatonic** to C minor.

Let’s try **Eb major**.

Eb major: Eb F G Ab Bb C D

Gdim = G Bb Db — Db is **not** in Eb major (it has D natural).

So Gdim is **borrowed** from somewhere.

What key has G, Bb, and Db?

→ **Bb minor** (harmonic): Bb C Db Eb F Gb A **Bb**

Still no G natural.

Wait — what about **A minor**?

A natural minor: A B C D E F G — G is natural, but Gdim = G Bb Db → has Bb and Db — not in A minor.

The only scale that naturally contains G, Bb, and Db is **G harmonic minor**?

G harmonic minor: G A Bb C D Eb F# G — has Bb, but not Db — has D natural. So no.

Wait — what if we consider **Ab melodic minor** or something else.

Let’s look at **Dbmaj7/F**.

Dbmaj7/F = F Ab C Db

That is: Db (root), F (3rd), Ab (5th), C (7th) — so **Db major 7**

F is the 5th of Db.

So the **tonal center** at the end is **Db major**.

Now — this appears only once, but it’s the **penultimate** chord — a strong cadential signal.

The progression ends on **Gdim** after Dbmaj7/F — and Gdim is the vii° of **Ab major**!

Let’s test:

In **Ab major**: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

G is the **7th scale degree** → **G leading tone**

Gdim = G Bb Db — that’s the **vii° chord** of **Ab major**

Perfect!

So if the progression ends on Gdim — **vii°** — that’s **not a resolution**.

But just before it: **Dbmaj7/F** — which is **Db major 7** — and Db is the **5th** of Ab.

So: Db → Gdim

That’s **V → vii°**? In Ab major, V is **Eb major** or **Eb7**, not Db.

Wait — Db is **bV** in Ab major — a **tritone substitution**?

Let’s think differently.

Let me list all the bass notes of these chords — the lowest note — that’s a clue to harmony and possible root movement.

Bass notes:

1. G (Gdim)

2. G (Gdim)

3. G (Eb/G)

4. G (Eb/G)

5. G (Gdim)

6. G (Gdim)

7. F (Bbm/F)

8. G (Ab/G)

9. G (Gdim)

10. G (Gdim)

11. G (Eb/G)

12. G (Eb/G)

13. G (Gdim)

14. G (Gdim)

15. F (Dbmaj7/F)

16. G (Gdim)

Bass movement:

G G G G G G **F** **G** G G G G G G **F G**

So bass is mostly **G**, with two **F**’s — on chords 7 and 15.

That suggests that **G** is the tonal center! But Gdim is not a stable chord — it’s unstable.

But let’s look at the chord tones:

Try building the **G diminished scale** — but let’s consider this: **Gdim** and **Eb/G** share G, Bb — and Eb/G is **Eb major**, so third is G — which suggests that **G is the 3rd of Eb major**.

This looks very much like **a diminished chord functioning as a chromatic passing chord between Eb and something else**.

Let’s try to re-interpret the chords as voice-leading.

Notice:

- Gdim = G Bb Db

- Eb/G = G Bb Eb → so only the 5th changes: Db → Eb

So moving from Gdim → Eb/G is: Db → Eb (ascending half-step), Bb stays, G stays.

So it’s **G Bb Db → G Bb Eb** — just a **Db → Eb** move — probably a chromatic passing tone.

Then back to Gdim: Eb → Db.

So the harmony is: **Gdim ↔ Eb major**, flipping Db/Eb.

That’s a **common progression** in pop/rock/jazz: using a **diminished chord** as a chromatic approach to a major chord.

Now — after several of those, we get:

**Bbm/F**

Bbm = Bb Db F → with F in bass → **F Bb Db**

That’s the same as **F minor 7th without the 7th?** Or just **Bbm (1st inversion?)** — no, F is the 5th, so this is **Bbm in 2nd inversion**.

F Bb Db — roots: F = 5th, Bb = root, Db = b3

Then **Ab/G**

Ab = Ab C Eb → with G in bass → G Ab C Eb

That’s four notes — G, Ab, C, Eb

What’s that chord? G Ab C Eb = G, Ab, C, Eb

Convert to tones from G:

- G (root)

- Ab = b2

- C = 4

- Eb = b6

So: G b2 4 b6 — unusual.

G Ab C Eb = **Ab major 7 with G in bass?** Ab major 7 is Ab C Eb G → yes! Exactly.

So **Ab/G = Ab maj7 with G in bass** → so it’s **G root, Ab maj7 upper structure** — functionally **Abmaj7/G** — which is called **G7#5b9?** Not exactly.

Abmaj7 = Ab C Eb G — which is a **minor seventh flat five chord?** No — Ab is major 7th.

Actually: **Ab C Eb G** = Ab maj7 — all major 7th chord.

With G in bass → that’s **Ab (maj7)/G** — which is a **G major 7 sharp 11**? No — better to just call it a **suspension or upper structure**.

G Ab C Eb — this has **two consecutive half steps**: G-Ab and C-Eb (minor 3rd), so special.

But more importantly — we now have:

**F Bb Db** ← Bbm/F

**G Ab C Eb** ← Abmaj7/G

Now, Ab is **one half-step above G**.

So G → Ab is a **chromatic ascent** in bass.

This feels like **modal interchange** or **borrowing from parallel mode**.

Now the big one — Dbmaj7/F = F Ab C Db

Which is **Db maj7** with 5th in bass — so the notes: **Db F Ab C**

Compare to Abmaj7: **Ab C Eb G**

Different.

Now, what is the relationship between **Eb**, **Ab**, **Db**?

E to A to D — each a **perfect 4th** down? Or perfect 5th up?

Eb → Ab = P4 up? Eb to Ab = Ab is 5th above Eb? No:

Eb → Ab: Ab is the perfect 4th above Eb (Eb F G Ab → 4 notes)

Ab → Db: Db is the perfect 4th above Ab (Ab Bb C Db)

So: **Eb → Ab → Db** — each step is a **perfect 4th upward** — or **perfect 5th downward**

So: **Eb → Ab → Db** = 3 chords down by 5ths.

But more importantly — these are all **flat keys**.

Eb major = 3 flats

Ab major = 4 flats

Db major = 5 flats

→ So we're going from **Eb (3 flats) → Ab (4) → Db (5)** — getting flatter.

And these are the same as the **vi, ii, V?** of C minor? Let's see.

C minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C → Ab is **vi**, Eb is **bIII**, Db? Not diatonic.

C minor: diatonic chords: i= Cm, ii°= D°, III= Eb, iv= Fm, v= Gm, VI= Ab, VII= Bb

So Eb = III, Ab = VI — both ARE diatonic in **C minor**.

What about Db? Not diatonic. But **bVII** would be Bb.

Db is **bVII in G minor**? G minor: G A Bb C D Eb F# G — diatonic bVII = F? No — Bb.

Db is **bV in F# minor**? Too far.

But we had **Dbmaj7/F** — and F is the 5th of Db — so Db is the **root**.

And just before that, we had **Ab/G** = Ab maj7 with G bass — so **Ab is rooted at G** — meaning G is bass, but harmony is Ab.

This feels like it’s **centered on G**, but **Ab major** is being **borrowed** as a **chromatic mediant**.

G major: G B D — Ab is the **b9**? Too far.

Wait — **C minor** has Eb and Ab — and **Gdim** is the **vii° of Ab major**.

Let’s flip it.

What if the **key is Ab major**?

Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords:

- G is the **leading tone** — vii° = G Bb Db — **exactly our Gdim!**

- Eb is the **V** chord

- Ab is the tonic

- Db is the **IV** chord

Wait — Db is the **IV** of Ab major? Ab Bb C Db — yes, Db is 4th degree.

So:

- **Gdim** = vii°

- **Eb** = V

- **Db** = IV

In **Ab major**, the chords we have:

- Gdim = vii° — very prominent!

- Eb/G = Eb major with G bass — G is the 3rd of Eb — so this is **Eb** in first inversion — so V chord

- Bbm/F = Bb minor? Wait — Bbm = Bb Db F — but in Ab major, Bb is ii, not Bbm — Ab major should have **Bb minor** i.e. **ii chord**! Yes!

Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

So ii chord = Bb minor — yes! So **Bbm/F** = Bb minor in second inversion — ii chord with 5th in bass — very common.

- Ab/G = Ab major with G in bass — that’s **I chord with leading tone in bass** — **Abmaj7/G** — this is **neapolitan counterfeit**? Or more simply, it's **the tonic with raised 7th in bass?** Not quite — G is not a chord tone in Ab major chord — chord is Ab C Eb — adding G makes it **Abmaj7**.

But in Ab major, the 7th is G — so Ab maj7 is the **tonic seventh chord**.

So **Ab/G = I6/5** — tonic in first inversion? Wait — tonic chord Abmaj7 has chord tones: Ab C Eb G — so if bass is G, it’s a **7th chord in 3rd inversion**.

So — we have:

Chord sequence matched to Ab major:

| Chord       | Ab Major Function | Notes            |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Eb/G        | V (1st inv)       | G Bb Eb — G=3rd  |
| Eb/G        | V                 | G Bb Eb          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Bbm/F       | ii (2nd inv)      | F Bb Db — F=5th  |
| Ab/G        | I (3rd inv/maj7)  | G Ab C Eb — G=7th|
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Eb/G        | V                 | G Bb Eb          |
| Eb/G        | V                 | G Bb Eb          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Dbmaj7/F    | IV (2nd inv)      | F Ab C Db — F=5th|
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |

### Conclusion:

All chords naturally fit into the **key of Ab major**:

- Gdim: vii° — leading tone chord — very common in major keys
- Eb: V chord
- Bbm: ii chord
- Ab: I chord (as Abmaj7)
- Db: IV chord (Dbmaj7)

The use of **inversions** (like Eb/G, Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F) is common voice-leading to keep bass smooth, and often used in pop/rock/jazz progressions.

The **Chromatic movement**: Gdim ↔ Eb (Db ⇄ Eb) is **chromatic passing** between the vii° and V.

The cadence: Dbmaj7/F → Gdim → this is **IV → vii°** — which is a **deceptive resolution**? Not quite — usually vii° resolves to I.

Here, it ends on vii° — **unresolved** — possibly leaving tension.

But in terms of tonality — **everything fits perfectly in Ab major**.

> ✅ **Key: Ab major**  
> ✅ **Mode: Major** (Ionian mode)

### Bonus: Why does it feel ambiguous?

Because Gdim is **so active** and **prominent**, it distracts the ear — sounding like “center” — but it’s a **leading tone chord**, which inherently creates tension to resolve to tonic (Ab). The tonic appears explicitly as **Ab/G** (I chord).

Also, the final “Dbmaj7/F → Gdim” is unusual — IV → vii° is rare — normally it’s vii° → I.

But since it’s the **last chord**, it ends on unresolved tension — perhaps for stylistic/emotional effect — like a “question mark” ending.

But harmony-wise: **it's all in Ab major**.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (Major)**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Look for Tonal Center / Resolution

The progression keeps returning to **Gdim**, which suggests **G** might be a focal point. However, diminished chords are symmetrical and ambiguous—they can function in multiple keys.

But also notice:
- **Eb/G**: This is an **Eb major chord with G in the bass** → essentially a **first-inversion Eb major** chord (Eb = root, G = third).
- **Bbm/F**: Bb minor with F in the bass → first-inversion Bb minor.
- **Ab/G**: Ab major with G in the bass → this is an **Ab major chord over G**, which is essentially a **G7♭9 without the root** (G–B♭–D♭–F–A♭), a dominant chord.
- **Dbmaj7/F**: Db major 7 with F in the bass → this is **F as the third of Db**, so again first-inversion Db major 7.

So we’re seeing chords built from **Eb**, **Bb**, **Ab**, **Db**, and **G**.

Look at how these relate:

- **Eb major key**: Contains Eb, Ab, Bb, Db (as the 6th degree, but **Db is not diatonic to Eb major**—Db is the ♭6, which is from **Eb minor**).
- **Gdim**: G–B♭–D♭–F (fully diminished 7th would include F, but even triad is G–B♭–D♭). The notes of Gdim (G–B♭–D♭) appear in **Ab harmonic minor** and **E♭ minor**.

Let’s test **Eb minor** (key signature: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭ — but natural minor has C♮; harmonic minor raises C to C♮→C♯? Wait, no: **Eb natural minor** = Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db — but that’s messy. Better to think in terms of **enharmonic equivalents**.)

Alternatively, consider **Ab major**:
- Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G
- Chords: Dbmaj7 is the **IV** chord in Ab major.
- Eb is the **V** chord in Ab major → but Eb/G is just Eb major in 1st inversion → fits.
- Bbm is the **ii** chord in Ab major → Bbm/F is first inversion → fits.
- Gdim? In Ab major, the **vii°** chord is Gdim! Yes! In Ab major:
  - vii° = G–B♭–D♭ → **G diminished**.

- Ab/G? That’s Ab major over G → this is **Ab/G = G bass with Ab major on top** → essentially a **G7sus♭9** or just a **bass note approaching Ab**. But also note: in Ab major, **G** is the **leading tone**—so G in the bass under Ab creates a strong pull to Ab.

So far, **Ab major** explains:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb = V
- Bbm = ii
- Dbmaj7 = IV
- Ab = I (implied by Ab/G)

The **Ab/G** chord strongly implies resolution to **Ab**, even if Ab major isn't explicitly stated as a root-position chord. The G in the bass (leading tone) under Ab creates a **cadential 6/4-like tension** resolving to Ab.

Now, what about **Dbmaj7/F**? In Ab major, Db is the **IV**, and F is the 3rd → so Db/F is a common inversion.

Thus, almost all chords fit **Ab major**:

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6 (first inversion V chord)
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = I with leading tone in bass (a type of embellishment or suspension)
- Dbmaj7/F = IV6

**But wait**: Is there an actual **Ab major chord** in root position? Not explicitly—but **Ab/G** strongly implies it, and the consistent return to Gdim (vii°) supports Ab as tonic.

### Step 2: Consider Mode

All chords fit **Ab Ionian (major)**. No modal mixture needed—though Dbmaj7 is diatonic to Ab major (IV chord).

**G diminished** is the natural vii° in major keys.

**Conclusion**:

- **Key**: **Ab major**
- **Mode**: **Ionian (Major)**

Even though the tonic Ab major chord is not played in root position, the harmonic context strongly implies **Ab** as the tonal center.

✅ **Final Answer**: **Key = Ab major, Mode = Ionian**

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's work this out.

### Step 1: List the chords and analyze the notes

We have these chords:

1. **Gdim**: G - B♭ - D♭  
2. **Eb/G**: E♭ - G - B♭ (G in the bass)  
3. **Bbm/F**: B♭ - D♭ - F (F in the bass)  
4. **Ab/G**: A♭ - C - E♭ (G in the bass)  
5. **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭ - F - A♭ - C (F in the bass)  
6. **Gdim** again

Let’s look at the **note collection** across all chords:

- G, B♭, D♭ (Gdim)  
- E♭, G, B♭ (Eb/G)  
- B♭, D♭, F (Bbm/F)  
- A♭, C, E♭, G (Ab/G)  
- D♭, F, A♭, C (Dbmaj7/F)

Pulling all unique notes together:

**D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C**

That’s **7 notes**, and they are:

**D♭ major scale**: D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C

But here, instead of **G♭**, we have **G natural**.

So this is **not** D♭ major — it’s **D♭ Lydian**, which has a **G natural** instead of G♭.

### Step 2: Confirm the key and mode

- **D♭ major** has 5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭  
- **D♭ Lydian** is the 4th mode of A♭ major, and raises the 4th scale degree (G♭ → G natural)

So the **tonic is D♭**, and the **mode is Lydian**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: D♭**  
**Mode: Lydian**

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze the progression carefully:  

**Progression:**  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim  

---

### Step 1: Identify possible tonal centers

We see a lot of **Gdim (G–Bb–Db)** and **Eb/G (Eb–G–Bb)** chords.  
- **Eb/G** is an *Eb major chord in first inversion*.  
- **Gdim** shares two notes with Eb (Gdim = G–Bb–Db; Eb major = Eb–G–Bb). The Db note functions like a “lowered 5th” of Eb, giving a kind of altered subdominant flavor.

We also see **Bbm/F** (B♭ minor), **Ab/G** (A♭ major over G bass), and **Dbmaj7/F** (D♭ major 7 in first inversion).  
All of these chords are **diatonic to E♭ major**:  
- I = Eb  
- ii = Fm  
- iii = Gm (but we have G°)  
- IV = Ab  
- V = Bb  
- vi = Cm  
- vii° = Ddim  

We don’t have an A♭ or D♭ in Eb major, though — D♭ indicates borrowed or modal mixture (from Eb minor or Ab major).

---

### Step 2: Note the chromatic/borrowed tendencies

- **Gdim** can imply it’s functioning as a **leading-tone chord** to A♭ (in Eb major, vii°/IV), since G is the leading tone of A♭.  
- **Dbmaj7** (♭VI in Eb major) and **Bbm** (ii of Ab major), both suggest **Eb minor / Eb major** mixture (Eb Aeolian or Eb Mixolydian colors).  

---

### Step 3: Consider how chords function

| Chord | Possible Function in Eb | Notes on Sound |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Gdim | vii°/Ab (secondary leading-tone chord) or G° borrowed | Tends toward Ab |
| Eb/G | I in first inversion | Root |
| Bbm/F | ii chord (of Eb major) | Pre-dominant |
| Ab/G | IV with a natural 7 in bass → interesting chromatic shift |
| Dbmaj7/F | ♭VI | Typical borrowed chord from minor key or mixolydian |
| Repeated Gdim | reinforces the tension around G and Ab area |

All roads seem to revolve around Eb as tonal center, but with heavy inflection from the parallel minor (Eb minor or Aeolian) due to the presence of Db and Bbm.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

**Likely Key:** **E♭ major** (with modal mixture / chromatic chords)
  
**Mode:** **E♭ major with mixture from E♭ minor (Aeolian) or E♭ Mixolydian,** due to ♭6 (Db) and ♭7 (Dbmaj7, B♭m) chords.

**Summary:**  
> The progression centers on **E♭** as tonic, but includes modal mixture (♭VI, ♭VII, vii°/IV) giving it a *minor-colored or Mixolydian* flavor. So you could describe the mode as **E♭ major with Aeolian/Mixolydian mixture**, or **E♭ major (tonal center) with chromatic embellishment via G diminished and borrowed chords.**

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or in minor keys, so I should look for clues about the key.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Bbm/F

- Ab/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Dbmaj7/F

- Gdim

Notice that some chords have slashes, like Eb/G and Bbm/F and Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F. These are slash chords, meaning the chord is played with a different bass note. For example, Eb/G means an Eb major chord with a G in the bass.

Similarly, Bbm/F means Bbm chord with F in the bass, Ab/G means Ab major with G in bass, and Dbmaj7/F means Dbmaj7 with F in bass.

Now, to find the key, I should look at the root movements and see which scale these chords might belong to.

Gdim is a diminished chord. A diminished chord is often vii° in a major key or ii° in a minor key. But it could also be a common-tone diminished chord or something else.

Let me consider the notes in each chord.

First, Gdim: G diminished triad is G, Bb, Db. But since it's diminished, it might be a full diminished seventh chord, but it's written as Gdim, which typically implies a diminished triad, but in context, it might be a diminished seventh. I'll assume it's a diminished triad for now, but in jazz or popular music, dim often implies diminished seventh.

In standard notation, Gdim usually means diminished triad, but in chord progressions, it might be used as a diminished seventh. To be precise, I'll consider the notes.

Let me list the notes for each chord as played.

Start with Gdim: if it's a diminished triad, notes are G, Bb, Db. If it's diminished seventh, it would be G, Bb, Db, E. But since it's written as dim, I'll first assume triad, but let's see the context.

Now, Eb/G: Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb, and with G in bass, so notes are G, Eb, G, Bb? Actually, the chord is Eb major, but bass is G, so the overall notes are G, Eb, G, Bb? But since it's a chord, the notes are from Eb major: Eb, G, Bb, and bass G, so the notes are G, Eb, Bb? But G is already in the chord, so it's just an inversion. So Eb/G is first inversion of Eb major, notes: G, Eb, Bb.

Similarly, Bbm/F: Bbm chord is Bb, Db, F, and with F in bass, so notes: F, Bb, Db. Which is first inversion of Bbm.

Ab/G: Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb, with G in bass, so notes: G, Ab, C, Eb. This is not a standard inversion because G is not in Ab major chord. Ab major has Ab, C, Eb, so adding G in bass means it's a slash chord with bass note not in the chord. So Ab/G has notes G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 chord is Db, F, Ab, C, with F in bass, so notes: F, Db, Ab, C. Which is an inversion since F is in the chord.

Now, back to Gdim. If Gdim is a diminished triad, notes G, Bb, Db. But in the progression, we have Eb/G which has G, Eb, Bb, so Bb is common, and Eb is from Eb major.

Also, we have Bbm/F which has F, Bb, Db, so Db is there.

And Ab/G has G, Ab, C, Eb.

And Dbmaj7/F has F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, let's see the key. I need to find a scale that fits these chords.

First, let's list all the root notes or the chords themselves.

The chords are: Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7. But with slash basses.

Notice that Gdim appears frequently, and Eb/G appears, which is Eb major with G bass.

Also, Ab/G appears, which is Ab major with G bass.

And Dbmaj7/F.

Now, let's consider the bass movement. The bass notes from the slash chords: for Eb/G, bass is G; for Bbm/F, bass is F; for Ab/G, bass is G; for Dbmaj7/F, bass is F.

And Gdim has bass G presumably.

So the bass notes are often G or F.

Now, let's think about the key based on the chords.

Eb major chord suggests key of Eb major or C minor, etc.

Bbm is Bb minor, which is iv in F major or ii in Ab major, etc.

Ab major is IV in Eb major or V in Db major, etc.

Dbmaj7 is Db major seventh, which could be I in Db major or IV in Ab major, etc.

But we have Gdim, which is not diatonically in any major key. In major keys, the diminished chord is vii° which is based on the leading tone.

In Eb major, the vii° would be Ddim, not Gdim.

In Ab major, vii° would be Gdim? Let's check.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So the leading tone is G, and vii° is G diminished? G diminished triad is G, Bb, Db. In Ab major, the seventh degree is G, and the chord built on G is G, Bb, Db, which is indeed a diminished triad because from G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, so yes, Gdim is vii° in Ab major.

Oh! So Gdim is the leading tone chord in Ab major.

Now, let's verify if other chords fit Ab major.

Ab major has chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim.

So we have Bbm which is ii, Eb which is V, and Db which is IV, and we have Dbmaj7 which is IVmaj7, and we have Gdim which is vii°.

But we have Ab/G, which is Ab major with G bass. In Ab major, Ab is I, but with G bass, which is the leading tone, so it's a slash chord that emphasizes the leading tone.

Similarly, Eb/G is Eb with G bass, and Eb is V in Ab major, and G is the third of Eb, but in bass, it might be creating a line.

Also, Bbm/F is Bbm with F bass, and Bbm is ii in Ab major, and F is the fifth of Bbm, so it's first inversion.

Dbmaj7/F is Db with F bass, and Db is IV in Ab major, and F is the third of Db, so first inversion.

So all chords seem to fit in Ab major.

But let's confirm the progression.

The progression has Gdim multiple times, and Eb/G, which is V in first inversion, and Bbm/F which is ii in first inversion, and Ab/G which is I with leading tone bass, and Dbmaj7/F which is IV in first inversion.

So yes, this seems to be in Ab major.

But the mode? Since it's major, the mode is Ionian, but let's see if there's any minor feel.

Ab major is the key, and all chords are diatonically from Ab major except that Ab/G has a G in bass, which is not in the Ab chord, but it's a passing note or something.

In terms of mode, since it's major, it's Ionian.

But let's see the first and last chords are Gdim, which is vii°, so it might be emphasizing the leading tone, but the key is still Ab major.

Sometimes, progressions end on vii°, but that might not resolve, but here it ends on Gdim, which might not be tonic, but in context, since we have Ab and other chords, Ab is implied as tonic.

In the progression, we have Ab/G, which is Ab with G bass, so that might be a way to approach the tonic with leading tone bass.

Similarly, we have Eb/G which is V with third in bass, and Gdim which is vii°.

So overall, the key is Ab major.

But let's double-check if there is any other key.

Suppose we consider Gdim as a chord, if it were G diminished seventh, it would be G, Bb, Db, E, but E is not in Ab major? Ab major has Eb, not E natural. So if Gdim had E natural, it would be G, Bb, Db, E, which is a fully diminished seventh chord, and in Ab major, the vii°7 would be G, Bb, Db, Fb? No, in Ab major, the seventh chord on G would be G, Bb, Db, F, which is a half-diminished seventh, not fully diminished.

In major keys, the vii° is a diminished triad, but if it's a seventh chord, it's half-diminished, meaning minor seventh flat five, so G, Bb, Db, F.

But in the notation, it's written as Gdim, which typically means diminished triad, not necessarily seventh. So in this case, Gdim is just the triad, so notes G, Bb, Db, which is fine for vii° in Ab major.

In the progression, we have Bbm/F, which is Bbm, so notes Bb, Db, F, which is half-diminished if seventh, but here it's triad, so Bbm is minor triad.

And Ab/G has G, Ab, C, Eb, so the G is not part of Ab major chord, but it's in the scale, so it's fine.

Dbmaj7 has Db, F, Ab, C, which all in Ab major.

So yes, Ab major seems correct.

Therefore, the key is Ab major, and the mode is major (Ionian).

But the question says "key and mode", so probably key of Ab major.

But let's confirm the mode. In classical terms, mode is Ionian for major, but sometimes in modern music, modes are different, but here it seems straightforward.

Perhaps since we have leading tone chords, it's clearly major.

So I think key is Ab major.

Now, to write it properly.

So the key is A-flat major.

And mode is major.

But in the answer, I should state key and mode.

Perhaps I should say the key is Ab major.

But let's see the chords: we have Dbmaj7, which is IV, and Eb which is V, etc.

Yes.

So for the final answer.

The chord progression is in the key of **Ab major**. The mode is **Ionian** (major scale). 

The chords fit diatonically within the Ab major scale:
- Gdim is the vii° chord (leading tone diminished).
- Eb/G is the V chord (Eb major) in first inversion, with G in the bass.
- Bbm/F is the ii chord (Bbm minor) in first inversion, with F in the bass.
- Ab/G is the I chord (Ab major) with G in the bass, emphasizing the leading tone.
- Dbmaj7/F is the IV chord (Db major seventh) in first inversion, with F in the bass.

The frequent use of Gdim (vii°) and the resolution to Ab-based chords confirm the tonic of Ab major. The mode is Ionian, as the harmony follows the major scale pattern without modal interchange or shift to minor.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. Identify the chords and their likely functions**

The chords given are:

- **Gdim**  
- **Eb/G** (Eb major with G in bass)  
- **Bbm/F** (Bbm with F in bass)  
- **Ab/G** (Ab major with G in bass)  
- **Dbmaj7/F** (Dbmaj7 with F in bass)  

---

**2. Understanding Gdim**

Gdim = G Bb Db E (fully diminished 7th chord).  
A diminished 7th chord is symmetrical and can function in multiple keys as a vii°7 or common-tone diminished.

One common use:  
- In **Ab major**, Gdim = vii°7 of Ab.  
- In **Bbm**, Gdim = vii°7 of Bbm (or secondary diminished).  
- In **C minor**, Gdim = vii°7 of Cm.

---

**3. Look at the progression’s bass line**

Bass notes:  
G – G – Eb – Eb – G – G – F – G – G – G – Eb – Eb – G – G – F – G  

So bass is mostly G and Eb, with F appearing briefly.

---

**4. Try to fit into a key**

Let’s test **Ab major**:

- Gdim = vii°7 → resolves to Ab (Eb/G is Eb major = IV of Ab, fits).  
- Bbm/F = ii chord in Ab major (with F in bass).  
- Ab/G = I chord with G in bass (G is b7 over Ab, making Ab7 sound, common in bluesy progressions in Ab).  
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in Ab (with F in bass).  

Everything fits perfectly in **Ab major**:

Gdim → Ab (or Ab/G)  
Eb = IV  
Bbm = ii  
Dbmaj7 = IV  
Ab/G = I7

---

**5. Mode**

All chords are diatonic to Ab major except Gdim, which is the leading-tone diminished chord of Ab major (from harmonic/melodic minor usage often, but in major keys the vii° is from harmonic minor).  
So the key is **Ab major**, but the Gdim suggests the harmonic major scale (Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb G?) — actually Gdim implies Ab harmonic major: Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb G natural — but Fb = E natural. Wait, check: Gdim = G Bb Db E (E = Fb enharmonic). Yes, so scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb G Ab — that’s Ab harmonic major.

But in jazz/pop, they just treat it as Ab major with a vii°7.

---

**6. Conclusion**

Key: **Ab major**  
Mode: **Ionian (major)** with occasional harmonic major flavor due to Gdim.

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**
    *   **Input:** A sequence of chords: `Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim`
    *   **Task:** Determine the key and mode.

2.  **Initial Analysis & First Impressions:**
    *   The chords are all very "dark" and "tense." I see a lot of diminished chords (`Gdim`), minor chords (`Bbm`), and chords with ambiguous or tense bass notes (`Eb/G`, `Ab/G`, `Dbmaj7/F`).
    *   The `Gdim` chord is repeated constantly. This is a huge clue. A `Gdim` chord is made of the notes G, Bb, Db. These notes are also the 7th, 9th (or 2nd), and 4th of an Ab minor chord (Ab, C, Eb). This is a very common "phrygian dominant" or "Spanish" sound, but it's also a key component of the harmonic minor scale. Let's keep that in mind.
    *   The bass notes are moving around: G, G, G, F, G, G, G, F. The most prominent bass note is G. This suggests G is a very important note, possibly the tonic or a strong pedal point.
    *   Let's list the notes in each chord to see what collection of pitches we're working with.

3.  **Chord-by-Chord Breakdown (Note Inventory):**

    *   `Gdim`: G, Bb, Db
    *   `Eb/G`: G, Eb, G, Bb (This is an Eb major triad with G in the bass. Notes: G, Bb, Eb)
    *   `Bbm/F`: F, Bb, Db (This is a Bb minor triad with F in the bass. Notes: F, Bb, Db)
    *   `Ab/G`: G, Ab, C, Eb (This is an Ab major triad with G in the bass. Notes: G, Ab, C, Eb)
    *   `Dbmaj7/F`: F, Db, F, Ab, C (This is a Db major 7th chord with F in the bass. Notes: F, Ab, C, Db)

4.  **Synthesize the Note Collection:**
    *   Let's gather all the unique notes from all the chords:
        *   G
        *   Ab
        *   Bb
        *   C
        *   Db
        *   Eb
        *   F

    *   So our pitch collection is: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**.

5.  **Compare the Note Collection to Common Scales/Modes:**

    *   **Major Scale?** No, we have both Ab and A natural (implied by the lack of A#), and both Db and D natural (implied by the lack of D#). This isn't a diatonic major or its modes.
    *   **Natural Minor Scale?** Let's try G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Our collection has Ab and Db instead of A and D. Close, but no.
    *   **Harmonic Minor Scale?** Let's try G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#. Nope. We have Ab and Db, not A and D, and no F#.
    *   **Melodic Minor Scale?** G melodic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F#. Definitely not.
    *   **What about modes starting on G?**
        *   G Dorian: G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Nope.
        *   G Phrygian: G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. **This is a very close match!** We have G, Ab, Bb, C, Eb, F. The only note missing is D. But we have Db. So it's not *exactly* G Phrygian.
        *   G Lydian: G, A, B, C#, D, E, F#. Nope.
        *   G Mixolydian: G, A, B, C, D, E, F. Nope.
        *   G Aeolian (Natural Minor): G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Nope.
        *   G Locrian: G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. This is also very close! Let's check the notes: G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. Our collection has a C natural, not a Cb (B). So it's not G Locrian.

6.  **Re-evaluating the "Close Matches" - The b2 and b5 Problem:**

    *   Our collection is **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**.
    *   This looks like a scale with a flattened 2nd (Ab), a flattened 5th (Db), and a minor 3rd (Bb), a perfect 4th (C), a minor 6th (Eb), and a minor 7th (F).
    *   Let's analyze the intervals from the root G:
        *   G to Ab: minor 2nd (b2)
        *   G to Bb: minor 3rd (b3)
        *   G to C: perfect 4th (4)
        *   G to Db: diminished 5th (b5)
        *   G to Eb: minor 6th (b6)
        *   G to F: minor 7th (b7)
    *   This collection of intervals (1, b2, b3, 4, b5, b6, b7) is the **Locrian mode**. Wait, I thought I ruled that out. Let's re-check.
    *   G Locrian is: G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F.
    *   My collection is: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F.
    *   The difference is the C. My collection has a C natural (perfect 4th), while Locrian has a Cb (diminished 4th).
    *   So, it's *not* strictly Locrian. It's a modified Locrian, often called **Locrian Natural 6** or **Locrian #2** (though the latter name is confusing). Let's check that. Locrian Natural 6 would be 1, b2, b3, 4, b5, 6, b7. Our 6th is Eb (b6), so that's not it.
    *   Let's go back to G Phrygian: G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Our collection has a Db instead of a D. So it's a **Phrygian with a flattened 5th**.
    *   This scale is known as the **Phrygian Dominant** scale (or Spanish Phrygian). Let's check the formula: 1, b2, 3, 4, 5, b6, b7. Hmm, that has a major 3rd. Our chord collection has a Bb (minor 3rd). So it's not Phrygian Dominant.

7.  **Let's step back. Maybe the "key" isn't G.** The most common chord is Gdim, and the most common bass note is G. This makes G the strongest candidate for the tonic or tonal center. The entire progression feels like it's "pulling" away from and back to this G-based tension.

8.  **Let's re-examine the chords in the context of G being the tonal center.**

    *   `Gdim`: This is the tonic sound. A very unstable, diminished tonic.
    *   `Eb/G`: This is a bVI chord in the key of G minor. (G minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. The 6th degree is E. The flat 6 is Eb). In G Phrygian, Eb is the b6. This chord fits well with a Phrygian-type feel.
    *   `Bbm/F`: This one is a bit weirder. In G minor, Bb is the III chord. In G Phrygian, Bb is the bIII chord. The F in the bass is the minor 7th of G. So it's like a `bIII/7` chord.
    *   `Ab/G`: This is a bII chord in G Phrygian (Ab is the b2). Putting it over a G bass creates a classic Phrygian cadence feel (`bII/I`). This is a huge signal for Phrygian.
    *   `Dbmaj7/F`: In G minor, Db is not diatonic. In G Phrygian, Db is the b4 (or b5, depending on enharmonic spelling). The F in the bass is again the 7th. So it's a `bIVmaj7/7` or `bVmaj7/7` chord. The presence of Db (b5) is the key differentiator.

9.  **Synthesizing the Harmonic Analysis:**

    *   **Tonal Center:** G. The constant G bass and the Gdim chord firmly establish G as the home base.
    *   **Mode Characteristics:**
        *   The presence of the `Ab/G` chord strongly suggests a Phrygian mode (due to the b2/♭II chord).
        *   The presence of the `Dbmaj7` chord (which contains the note Db) introduces a flattened 5th degree (b5) relative to the G tonic.
        *   The overall harmony is minor (Bb is the 3rd).
    *   **Conclusion:** The tonal center is G, and the mode is a hybrid that combines the characteristics of Phrygian (b2) with a flattened 5th (b5).

10. **Naming the Mode:**

    *   The scale is: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F.
    *   This is known as the **Locrian ♮2** mode (Locrian natural 2) or the **Super Locrian** mode (in jazz theory).
    *   Let's double-check the Super Locrian scale formula. It's the 7th mode of the melodic minor scale. Let's take F melodic minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, E. The 7th mode starting on E would be E, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. That's not our scale.
    *   Let's check Ab melodic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G. The 7th mode starts on G. The notes would be G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. Again, that's G Locrian.
    *   Okay, let's reconsider. What scale is G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F? It's the **Locrian mode with a raised 2nd degree** (C is the 4th, but the 2nd is Ab, which is already flat... wait, no, the 4th is raised).
    *   Let's check the intervals again relative to G Locrian: G, Ab, Bb, **Cb**, Db, Eb, F. Our scale has a **C natural**. So it's G Locrian with a **raised 4th**.
    *   This scale is also known as the **Locrian #6** in some contexts, but that's confusing. Let's stick to the most common and descriptive names. The two main contenders are:
        1.  **Phrygian ♭4** (or Phrygian ♭5, enharmonically). This is probably the most intuitive name. It takes Phrygian (1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7) and lowers the 4th degree. This gives us 1, b2, b3, b4, 5, b6, b7. Our scale is G, Ab, Bb, **Db**, D, Eb, F. This doesn't quite work because we have a C natural (perfect 4th) and a Db (diminished 5th). So the scale contains both a 4 and a b5.
        2.  **Locrian ♮2 (Double-Flat 7?)** Let's re-examine the Locrian mode. G Locrian is the mode built on the 7th degree of Ab Major. Ab Major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. G Locrian: G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F. Our scale is G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. It's Locrian with a **natural 4th**. This is the most accurate description.

11. **Final Polish and Structuring the Answer:**

    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **Key/ Tonal Center: G. Mode: Locrian ♮4 (or a related exotic scale).**
    *   Explain the reasoning step-by-step.
    *   **Step 1: Identify the Tonal Center.** Point out the repeated `Gdim` chord and the prominent G bass note. This establishes G as the "home" note.
    *   **Step 2: List the Pitches.** Break down the chords and list all the unique notes: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F.
    *   **Step 3: Analyze the Intervals.** Compare the collected pitches to the G major scale to see what's been altered.
        *   G (Root)
        *   Ab (b2 - flat 2nd)
        *   Bb (b3 - minor 3rd)
        *   C (4 - perfect 4th)
        *   Db (b5 - flat 5th)
        *   Eb (b6 - flat 6th)
        *   F (b7 - minor 7th)
    *   **Step 4: Identify the Mode.**
        *   Compare this interval pattern (1, b2, b3, 4, b5, b6, b7) to the standard modes.
        *   Show how it's close to G Phrygian (which has a natural 5th, D), but the presence of Db (b5) rules that out.
        *   Show how it's close to G Locrian (which has a diminished 4th, Cb), but the presence of C (perfect 4th) rules that out.
        *   Conclude that it's a hybrid scale. The most accurate name is **Locrian with a natural 4th (Locrian ♮4)**. Explain that this is a very uncommon and unstable sound.
    *   **Step 5: Provide a Harmonic Context.** Briefly explain what the chords are doing functionally in relation to G.
        *   `Gdim` is the unstable tonic.
        *   `Eb/G` is the ♭VI chord.
        *   `Ab/G` is the classic ♭II "Phrygian cadence" chord.
        *   `Dbmaj7/F` and `Bbm/F` introduce the b5 flavor over the G bass pedal.
    *   **Summarize:** Reiterate the final answer and describe the overall sound as tense, dark, and ambiguous, typical of film scores or avant-garde music. Mentioning composers like Danny Elfman or Bartók could be a good contextual touch. This adds depth to the answer.


This is a fascinating and sophisticated chord progression. The key is **Ab Major**, and its character is defined by a powerful **leading-tone pedal point**.

Let's break down why.

### 1. Identifying the Tonal Center: Ab Major

The strongest clues to the key are the two most stable-sounding chords in the progression:

1.  **Gdim**: In the key of Ab Major, the seventh scale degree is G. The chord built on this degree is a diminished chord (G°7: G-Bb-Db-F). Your progression uses the G diminished triad (G-Bb-Db), which is the core of that chord. This is the **vii°** chord of Ab Major, a chord that functions purely as a dominant, creating intense tension that wants to resolve to the tonic, Ab.
2.  **Ab/G**: This is an Ab major triad with a G in the bass. This is an incredibly strong tonic affirmation. The Ab triad is the **I chord** of the key, and placing the leading tone (G) in the bass underneath it creates a classic "Phrygian cadence" or "I 6/4" feeling, where you are on the tonic chord but the bass note is still creating tension, demanding a final resolution to the root (Ab).

The constant back-and-forth between the tension of `Gdim` and the "almost-resolution" of `Ab/G` firmly establishes Ab as the home key.

### 2. The Defining Characteristic: The G Pedal Point

The most important feature of this progression is the bass line. Look at the bass notes:
`G - G - G - G - G - G - F - G - G - G - G - G - G - G - F - G`

The bass note **G is held almost constantly**. This is called a **pedal point** (or pedal tone). Since G is the leading tone of Ab Major, holding it in the bass creates a continuous, unresolved tension throughout the entire piece. The harmony shifts and changes above this static, tense bass note, making the eventual resolution to Ab feel all the more powerful.

### 3. Analysis of the Other Chords in Context

Let's see how the other chords function within this Ab Major framework, all superimposed over the G pedal point.

*   **Gdim**: The tension itself. It's the vii° chord, built directly on the pedal note.
*   **Eb/G**: This is the **IV chord** (Eb Major) of Ab Major, but with the leading tone (G) in the bass. The notes (G-Bb-Eb) create a very tense, suspended harmony over the pedal point.
*   **Dbmaj7/F**: This chord momentarily breaks the pedal point by moving the bass to **F** (the 4th degree of the Ab Major scale). The chord itself, Dbmaj7, is the **bIII** (a chromatic mediant) of Ab Major. This provides a beautiful, colorful, and temporary release from the G-pedal tension before it returns.
*   **Bbm/F**: This is the most chromatic chord. Like the Dbmaj7, it also features the bass note **F**. A Bb minor chord is not diatonic to Ab Major. It can be seen as a borrowed chord (the iv chord of Eb Major) or, more likely, a sophisticated passing chord adding color and voice-leading interest as the harmony moves away from and back to the G pedal.

### Conclusion: Key and Mode

*   **Key:** **Ab Major**
*   **Mode:** **Ionian** (the standard major mode)

While the progression uses chromatic chords that don't all belong to the Ab Major scale, the fundamental tonal gravity is undeniably pulled toward Ab. The use of the G-diminished chord (vii°) and the Ab/G chord (I with leading tone bass) are the primary signposts.

This is a great example of modern, impressionistic, or film-score harmony where a pedal point is used to create a sustained mood of tension and anticipation over a shifting harmonic landscape.

### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Harmony**

I've been intensely analyzing this chord progression. It starts with two Gdim chords, then goes to Eb/G. The second line repeats the Gdim chords, then veers towards Bbm/F, resolving again to Ab/G. I find the Eb/G chord use particularly interesting. I intend to explore its harmonic function further.


**Exploring Harmonic Functions**

I've just finished dissecting the chords, mapping out their notes and potential inversions. Next, I'm identifying the core tonal elements; I see a clear interplay between the Gdim chords and related keys like Eb and Bb. I'm now compiling the aggregate pitch collection, which should illuminate the underlying scale and clarify the overall harmonic landscape.


**Deciphering the Scale**

I've re-examined the aggregate pitch collection and analyzed its intervals, now seeing it as G Locrian. I considered G as a potential tonal center, recognizing the instability of Locrian mode. This leads me to further investigate how the Gdim chords function within this context, specifically in relation to the other chords, to define the movement.


**Reassessing the Cadence**

I've just re-examined the initial chord progression in its entirety, and I'm struck by the ending. The final Gdim chord is intriguing, especially following Dbmaj7/F. The inclusion of the Eb/G and Ab/G chords and their functional roles provide crucial context. I will further consider the possible tonal centers, including G, Ab, and Eb, and examine how the Gdim chord functions in relation to each of those options.


**Deciding on Functionality**

I'm now zeroing in on Ab major as the key center, seeing a clear harmonic function in the progression. The Gdim acts as a vii° leading to the dominant, Eb/G, with Bbm and Dbmaj7 serving as subdominant chords. Finally, Ab/G reinforces the tonic, creating a strong sense of resolution in this harmonic environment.


**Defining the Function**

I've finalized my analysis, concluding the progression is firmly rooted in Ab major. The Gdim functions as a vii° chord, leading to dominant chords, and ultimately resolving to the tonic via the Ab/G. The choice of inversions also contributes to a sense of forward motion.


**Refining the Theory**

I'm now revisiting the chord functions, focusing on how the Gdim, Eb/G, and Ab/G interact to create the tension and release. I've confirmed that the progression strongly implies Ab major, with the Gdim serving as the crucial leading-tone chord. Furthermore, I'm analyzing the significance of the choice of inversions to add a flowing cadence.




The task is to determine the key and mode based on the provided chord progression:

$\text{Gdim} \mid \text{Gdim} \mid \text{Eb/G} \mid \text{Eb/G}$
$\text{Gdim} \mid \text{Gdim} \mid \text{Bbm/F} \mid \text{Ab/G}$
$\text{Gdim} \mid \text{Gdim} \mid \text{Eb/G} \mid \text{Eb/G}$
$\text{Gdim} \mid \text{Gdim} \mid \text{Dbmaj7/F} \mid \text{Gdim}$

### 1. Identify the Pitch Collection

First, we list the notes contained in all the chords:

| Chord | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Gdim | G, Bb, Db |
| Eb/G | Eb, G, Bb |
| Bbm/F | Bb, Db, F |
| Ab/G | Ab, C, Eb, G |
| Dbmaj7/F | Db, F, Ab, C |

The complete aggregate set of unique pitches is: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**.

### 2. Determine the Key and Function

This set of seven notes (G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F) matches the notes of the **Ab Major Scale**.

Now, let's analyze the function of the chords within the key of Ab Major (Ab Ionian: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G):

| Chord | Roman Numeral (Ab Major) | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gdim (G-Bb-Db) | $\text{vii}^{\circ}$ (Leading Tone Triad) | Strong Dominant Function |
| Eb/G (Eb-G-Bb) | $\text{V}$ (Dominant) | Dominant |
| Bbm/F (Bb-Db-F) | $\text{ii}$ (Supertonic) | Subdominant |
| Ab/G (Ab-C-Eb) | $\text{I}$ (Tonic) | Tonic |
| Dbmaj7/F (Db-F-Ab-C) | $\text{IV}^{\text{maj}7}$ (Subdominant) | Subdominant |

The progression uses the core functional harmonies of Ab Major: Tonic (I), Subdominant (ii, IV), and Dominant/Leading Tone ($\text{V}, \text{vii}^{\circ}$). The repeated use of Gdim ($\text{vii}^{\circ}$) establishes a persistent harmonic tension that drives toward resolution supplied by $\text{V}$ (Eb/G) and the tonal chords ($\text{Ab}, \text{Bbm}, \text{Dbmaj7}$).

### Conclusion

The chord progression is highly functional, utilizing chords derived entirely from the Ab Major scale, implying Ab Major as the tonal center.

**Key:** Ab
**Mode:** Ionian (Major)

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

This piece uses the the chord progression:

$$\text{Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Dbmaj7/F - Gdim}$$

To figure out the key and mode, let's analyze the chords and their potential functions:

**Chords Present:**

*   **Gdim** ($\text{G}-\text{B}b-\text{D}b$): G diminished triad.
*   **Eb/G** ($\text{G}-\text{B}b-\text{E}b$): E-flat major triad in first inversion.
*   **Bbm/F** ($\text{F}-\text{B}b-\text{D}b$): B-flat minor triad in second inversion.
*   **Ab/G** ($\text{G}-\text{C}-\text{E}b-\text{A}b$): A-flat major triad with G in the bass (or potentially $\text{Abmaj7}^{5^{4}}$ if we consider the root $\text{A}b$).
*   **Dbmaj7/F** ($\text{F}-\text{A}b-\text{C}-\text{D}b$): D-flat major seventh chord in first inversion.

**Root Analysis (Ignoring Bass Notes for the moment):**

If we look at the core harmonies (the roots of the triads and major 7ths), we have:

$$\text{Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7}$$

These roots (G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db) are all diatonic to the key of **E-flat minor** or **G-flat Major (F-sharp major) / E-flat minor** (relative keys).

*   $\text{Eb}$ minor scale: $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}b, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}b, \text{D}b$.
*   Chords diatonic to $\text{Eb}$ minor (Natural Minor):
    *   $\text{i}$: $\text{Eb}m$
    *   $\text{ii}\text{o}$: $\text{F}dim$
    *   $\text{III}$: $\text{G}b$
    *   $\text{iv}$: $\text{A}bm$
    *   $\text{v}$: $\text{B}bm$
    *   $\text{VI}$: $\text{C}b$
    *   $\text{VII}$: $\text{D}b$ (This is where $\text{Dbmaj7}$ seems related, as it shares $\text{Db}$, $\text{Ab}$, $\text{C}$ which are often available in $\text{Eb}$ harmonic/melodic minor).

Now let's check the chords used against a potential scale derived from the roots:

1.  **G dim**: $\text{G}, \text{B}b, \text{D}b$.
2.  **Eb**: $\text{Eb}, \text{G}, \text{B}b$.
3.  **Bbm**: $\text{B}b, \text{D}b, \text{F}$.
4.  **Ab**: $\text{A}b, \text{C}, \text{E}b$.
5.  **Dbmaj7**: $\text{D}b, \text{F}, \text{A}b, \text{C}$.

The collected notes are: **$\text{G}, \text{B}b, \text{D}b, \text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{A}b, \text{C}$**.

If we order these notes starting from $\text{E}b$:
$$\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$$

This set of notes corresponds perfectly to the **E-flat Dorian Mode**.

*   $\text{Eb}$ Dorian Scale formula: $\text{W}, \text{H}, \text{W}, \text{W}, \text{W}, \text{H}, \text{W}$ ($\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}b \text{(wrong)}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$). *Wait, this is wrong.*
*   Dorian is $\text{i}, \text{ii}, \text{bIII}, \text{IV}, \text{V}, \text{VI}, \text{bVII}$.
*   If $\text{Eb}$ is the root, $\text{bIII}$ should be $\text{G}b$. But the chords contain $\text{G}$ natural (from $\text{Gdim}$ and $\text{Eb}$ triad) and $\text{C}$ natural (from $\text{Ab}$ and $\text{Dbmaj7}$).
*   Let's check the notes again: **$\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$**
    *   Scale intervals from $\text{Eb}$: $\text{R}, \text{W}, \text{W}, \text{H}, \text{W}, \text{W}, \text{H}$
    *   This is the scale structure of the **Harmonic Minor Scale starting on the 4th degree**. This is also known as the **Phrygian Dominant** ($\text{V}^5$ mode of Harmonic minor), or the **Double Harmonic Major** (No, that's wrong).

Let's look at the relation to familiar modes:

*   **E-flat Harmonic Minor:** $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}b, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}b, \text{D}$ (has $\text{D}$ natural, $\text{G}b$, $\text{C}b$) - *Doesn't match.*
*   **E-flat Melody Minor (Ascending):** $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}b, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}$ (has $\text{G}b$, $\text{D}$ natural) - *Doesn't match.*

The actual scale derived from the chords is:
$$\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$$

This scale is the **5th Mode of A-flat Harmonic Minor**.

*   $\text{Ab}$ Harmonic Minor: $\text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}b, \text{D}b, \text{E}b, \text{F}b$ ($\text{G}$ natural).
*   5th Mode (starting on $\text{E}b$): $\text{E}b, \text{F}b, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}b, \text{D}b$.
    *   This also doesn't match the required notes ($\text{F}$ natural, $\text{C}$ natural, $\text{G}$ natural).

Let's stick to the fundamental notes: **$\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$**

### Key and Modal Interpretation

The music is highly centered around the root notes $\text{E}b$ and $\text{G}$ (as every chord uses $\text{G}$ or emphasizes it in the bass, and $\text{E}b$ is a strong root harmony).

**1. Focusing on the G-diminished chord:**
A diminished triad ($\text{Gdim}$) is typically Roman numeral $\text{vii}\text{o}$ in natural minor, or $\text{ii}\text{o}$ in harmonic minor.
If $\text{Gdim}$ is $\text{vii}\text{o}$, the root of the key must be $\text{Ab}$ minor (where $\text{Ab}m$ harmonic minor $\text{vii}\text{o}$ is $\text{Gdim}$).
*   If the key is $\text{Ab}$ minor (Harmonic): $\text{Abm}$, $\text{B}b$ diminished, $\text{Cb}aug$, $\text{D}b$ minor, $\text{E}b$, *$\text{Fm}$*, $\text{Gdim}$.
    *   The chords used are $\text{Gdim}, \text{Eb}, \text{Bbm}, \text{Ab}, \text{Dbmaj7}$.
    *   $\text{Eb}$ is $\text{V}$ (correct).
    *   $\text{Bbm}$ is $\text{ii}$ (wrong, $\text{B}b$ dim is $\text{ii}$).
    *   $\text{Ab}$ is $\text{i}$ (wrong, the chord is $\text{Ab}$ Major).
    *   $\text{Dbmaj7}$ is $\text{IV}$ (wrong, $\text{Db}m$ is $\text{IV}$).
    *   This setup fails.

**2. Focusing on the Eb root:**
The key is *highly likely* centered on $\text{E}b$ because of the frequent $\text{Eb/G}$ chord and the overall collection of flats.

Let's re-examine the scale: $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$.

This scale is derived from:
*   $\text{Eb}$ (I)
*   $\text{F}$ (II)
*   $\text{G}$ (III)
*   $\text{A}b$ (IV)
*   $\text{B}b$ (V)
*   $\text{C}$ (VI)
*   $\text{D}b$ (VII)

This is a specific non-diatonic scale, sometimes called the **Mixolydian-Lydian scale** or **Hungarian Minor**'s second mode, or more commonly:
**The 4th mode of B-flat Harmonic Major** (No, that's not right either).

This scale structure ($\text{R}, \text{W}, \text{W}, \text{H}, \text{W}, \text{W}, \text{H}$) is exactly the **D-flat/C-sharp Lydian Augmented Mode**.
*   $\text{D}b$ Lydian Augmented: $\text{D}b, \text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}, \text{B}b, \text{C}$. (No, $\text{A}$ natural is wrong).

---

### Conclusion on Modality

The presence of $\text{Gdim}$ and $\text{Bbm}$ and $\text{Dbmaj7}$ and $\text{Ab}$ major strongly points towards a modal mixture derived from the flat keys, centered around $\text{E}b$. The characteristic intervals are the raised 3rd ($\text{G}$ natural) and the lowered 7th ($\text{D}b$).

The scale: $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$ is equivalent to the **E-flat $\text{Mixolydian} \text{b}6$ scale** (also known as the **E-flat Ascending Melodic Minor**'s 4th mode, or specifically, the **E-flat Major scale with a $\text{b}7$** (Mixolydian) AND a **$\text{b}3$** (minor/Mixolydian $\text{b}3$) — wait, it has a MAJOR 3rd, G natural).

Let's call the scale by its structure relative to $\text{Eb}$:
$$\text{Eb Major} (\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}) + \text{D}b$$
This is the **E-flat Mixolydian Mode (Dominant)**: $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$.

Let's verify the chords against **Eb Mixolydian** ($\text{B}b$ Major scale starting on $\text{E}b$):
*   $\text{i}$: $\text{Eb}$ (Used: $\text{Eb/G}$)
*   $\text{ii}\text{o}$: $\text{Fdim}$ (Used: $\text{F}$ natural, $\text{A}b, \text{C}b$ - Has $\text{F}, \text{A}b, \text{C}$ in the chords, so $\text{Fm}$ or $\text{Fdim}$?)
*   $\text{iii}m$: $\text{G}m$ (Used: $\text{Gdim}$)
*   $\text{IV}$: $\text{A}b$ (Used: $\text{Ab/G}$)
*   $\text{vm}$: $\text{B}b\text{m}$ (Used: $\text{B}bm/F$)
*   $\text{VI}dim$: $\text{Cdim}$ (Used: $\text{C}$ natural)
*   $\text{VII}$: $\text{D}b$ (Used: $\text{Dbmaj7}$)

The major inconsistency is the **G diminished triad**. In $\text{Eb}$ Mixolydian, the chord built on G should be $\text{G}-\text{B}b-\text{D}b$, which is $\text{G}$ diminished—actually, no, $\text{G}$ diminished is $\text{G}-\text{B}b-\text{D}b$. Wait, $\text{Eb}$ Mixolydian contains $\text{G}, \text{B}b, \text{D}b$. Building a triad on G: $\text{G}$ (root), $\text{B}b$ (b3), $\text{D}b$ (b5). **Therefore, $\text{Gdim}$ IS diatonic to $\text{Eb}$ Mixolydian.**

*   $\text{Gdim}$ is $\text{iii}\text{o}$ in $\text{Eb}$ Mixolydian.
*   $\text{Eb}$ is $\text{I}$
*   $\text{Bbm}$ is $\text{v}$
*   $\text{Ab}$ is $\text{IV}$
*   $\text{Dbmaj7}$ contains the notes $\text{D}b, \text{F}, \text{A}b, \text{C}$. This must be interpreted as a chord borrowed from a nearby mode, or a $\text{VII}$ chord extension. In $\text{Eb}$ Mixolydian, the VII chord is $\text{D}b$ major ($\text{D}b, \text{F}, \text{A}b$). Since $\text{C}$ natural is also collected, the use of $\text{Dbmaj7}$ must imply a momentary shift to **Ab Major** or **Eb Lydian/Dorian** variations for the 'C' note.

However, given that all the cores roots except $\text{Gdim}$ ($\text{Eb}, \text{Ab}, \text{B}b, \text{D}b$) point towards E-flat based modes, and the overall collected scale is $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$:

This scale is technically **E-flat Mixolydian** with the addition of the 6th degree ($\text{C}$ natural) acting melodically, suggesting a strong borrowing from **E-flat Major** (which has $\text{C}$) or **E-flat Dorian** (if it had $\text{G}b$). Since the scale includes $\text{G}$ natural and $\text{C}$ natural, the closest consistent diatonic framework is $\text{E}b$ Mixolydian, which only requires explaining the $\text{C}$ in the $\text{Dbmaj7}$.

In many forms of traditional music where $\text{Gdim}$ and $\text{Eb}$ rule, the most common interpretation is either **Tonic Minor** or **Dorian/Phrygian**.

Given the prominence of $\text{Eb}$ (I chord) and the $\text{Gdim}$ (iii $\to$ leading tone function), alongside $\text{Bbm}$ (v chord), the core harmony is centered around E-flat.

The **KEY** is $\text{E}b$. The **MODE** is defined by the scale derived: $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$.

This scale is the **$\text{E}b$ Mixolydian Mode** ($\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$). $\text{E}b$ Mixolydian uses $\text{G}$ natural (Major 3rd) and $\text{D}b$ (Minor 7th). It contains all the notes of the major chords ($\text{Eb}, \text{Ab}, \text{B}b\text{m}, \text{Db}$ related) and the $\text{Gdim}$. The inclusion of the $\text{C}$ natural (VI degree) is fully diatonic to Mixolydian.

**Final Answer Derivation:**

1.  **Tonic:** $\text{Eb}$ is the clear tonic due to the frequent $\text{Eb/G}$ chord and overall tonal gravity.
2.  **Scale Notes:** $\text{Eb}, \text{F}, \text{G}, \text{A}b, \text{B}b, \text{C}, \text{D}b$.
3.  **Mode:** This scale ($\text{R}, \text{W}, \text{W}, \text{H}, \text{W}, \text{W}, \text{H}$) defines the **Mixolydian Mode**.

**Key and Mode:** **E-flat Mixolydian**
