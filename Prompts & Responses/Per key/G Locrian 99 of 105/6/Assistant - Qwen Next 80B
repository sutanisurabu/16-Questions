---

### Step 1: Analyze the chords

Let’s write out each chord with its root and quality:

| Chord       | Notes (approx.)        | Function/Analysis |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                | G diminished (ii° in A minor?) |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Eb/G        | G Bb Eb                | **Eb major triad with G in bass** → G is the 3rd → So this is **Eb major** in 1st inversion |
| Eb/G        | G Bb Eb                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Bbm/F       | F Aa C#? → Wait, Bb minor = Bb Db F → with F in bass → **F Bb Db** → **F is the 5th of Bb minor** → So this is **Bb minor in 2nd inversion** |
| Ab/G        | G Ab C Eb? → Ab = Ab C Eb → so Ab major triad with G in bass → **G Ab C Eb** → **Ab major triad (Ab C Eb) + G** → That’s **Ab7**? But written as Ab/G → likely **Ab major with G bass** → chord is **Ab/G → G, Ab, C, Eb** → This is a **G7 chord**? But G7 is G B D F — this has Ab, not B. So not G7. Let's think differently. |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Eb/G        | G Bb Eb                |                   |
| Eb/G        | G Bb Eb                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |
| Dbmaj7/F    | F Ab C E               | Db major 7 = Db F Ab C → with F in bass: **F Ab C Db** → this is **Fmaj7#11? No — better: Db major 7 in 2nd inversion → F is the 5th of Db → So: Dbmaj7/F = F (5th), Ab (7th), C (3rd), Db (root) → so chord tones: F, Ab, C, Db → this is an **Fm7 chord**? Wait, Fm7 = F Ab C Eb — here we have Db, not Eb. So not Fm7. We have **F, Ab, C, Db → notes: F, Ab, C, Db → scales?**

Wait — F, Ab, C, Db → let’s rearrange: Db, F, Ab, C → that’s **Db maj7** yes — Db (root), F (3rd), Ab (5th), C (7th). So with F in bass — that’s **Dbmaj7/F**, as written.

So chord is **Db major 7 with F in bass** — perfectly normal inversion.

| Gdim        | G Bb Db                |                   |

---

### Step 2: Look for a tonal center

We see a recurring chord: **Gdim** — appears 8 times — very prominent.

Also **Eb/G** appears 4 times.

And **Dbmaj7/F** appears once, at the end — very important.

Let’s look at what **Gdim** implies.

- Gdim = G Bb Db — these notes are also in the **Bb harmonic minor** scale and ** Eb major** scale? Let’s test.

What scales contain G, Bb, Db?

- **Bb minor** (natural): Bb C Db Eb F Gb A Bb → contains G? No, G is natural — not in Bb natural minor.
- **Bb harmonic minor**: Bb C Db Eb F Gb A → still no G
- **G minor (natural)**: G Ab Bb C D Eb F G → YES! G, Bb, Db are **1, b3, b5** → G **diminished triad** is the **vii°** chord in **A minor** or **C major**.

But we have Eb/G = G Bb Eb — this is **Eb major** in 1st inversion.

Eb major = Eb F G Ab Bb C D — contains F, G, Ab, Bb — so G and Bb are in Eb major.

Gb? Not here. But we have Gdim = G Bb Db — Db is not in Eb major (Eb major has D natural).

Conflict: Eb major = Eb F G Ab Bb C D — so **D natural**. But Gdim has **Db** → which is **not in Eb major**.

So how can we have both Eb major *and* Gdim (which has Db)?

→ **Db is the b5 of G**, so it’s a chromatic note in Eb major.

This suggests **borrowing** or **modal mixture**.

Let’s consider **C minor**.

C minor natural: C D Eb F G Ab Bb

C minor harmonic: C D Eb F G Ab B **C**

C minor melodic: C D Eb F G A B C (ascending)

In **C minor**, the diatonic vii° is B° = B D F — not Gdim.

Gdim is **not diatonic** to C minor.

Let’s try **Eb major**.

Eb major: Eb F G Ab Bb C D

Gdim = G Bb Db — Db is **not** in Eb major (it has D natural).

So Gdim is **borrowed** from somewhere.

What key has G, Bb, and Db?

→ **Bb minor** (harmonic): Bb C Db Eb F Gb A **Bb**

Still no G natural.

Wait — what about **A minor**?

A natural minor: A B C D E F G — G is natural, but Gdim = G Bb Db → has Bb and Db — not in A minor.

The only scale that naturally contains G, Bb, and Db is **G harmonic minor**?

G harmonic minor: G A Bb C D Eb F# G — has Bb, but not Db — has D natural. So no.

Wait — what if we consider **Ab melodic minor** or something else.

Let’s look at **Dbmaj7/F**.

Dbmaj7/F = F Ab C Db

That is: Db (root), F (3rd), Ab (5th), C (7th) — so **Db major 7**

F is the 5th of Db.

So the **tonal center** at the end is **Db major**.

Now — this appears only once, but it’s the **penultimate** chord — a strong cadential signal.

The progression ends on **Gdim** after Dbmaj7/F — and Gdim is the vii° of **Ab major**!

Let’s test:

In **Ab major**: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

G is the **7th scale degree** → **G leading tone**

Gdim = G Bb Db — that’s the **vii° chord** of **Ab major**

Perfect!

So if the progression ends on Gdim — **vii°** — that’s **not a resolution**.

But just before it: **Dbmaj7/F** — which is **Db major 7** — and Db is the **5th** of Ab.

So: Db → Gdim

That’s **V → vii°**? In Ab major, V is **Eb major** or **Eb7**, not Db.

Wait — Db is **bV** in Ab major — a **tritone substitution**?

Let’s think differently.

Let me list all the bass notes of these chords — the lowest note — that’s a clue to harmony and possible root movement.

Bass notes:

1. G (Gdim)

2. G (Gdim)

3. G (Eb/G)

4. G (Eb/G)

5. G (Gdim)

6. G (Gdim)

7. F (Bbm/F)

8. G (Ab/G)

9. G (Gdim)

10. G (Gdim)

11. G (Eb/G)

12. G (Eb/G)

13. G (Gdim)

14. G (Gdim)

15. F (Dbmaj7/F)

16. G (Gdim)

Bass movement:

G G G G G G **F** **G** G G G G G G **F G**

So bass is mostly **G**, with two **F**’s — on chords 7 and 15.

That suggests that **G** is the tonal center! But Gdim is not a stable chord — it’s unstable.

But let’s look at the chord tones:

Try building the **G diminished scale** — but let’s consider this: **Gdim** and **Eb/G** share G, Bb — and Eb/G is **Eb major**, so third is G — which suggests that **G is the 3rd of Eb major**.

This looks very much like **a diminished chord functioning as a chromatic passing chord between Eb and something else**.

Let’s try to re-interpret the chords as voice-leading.

Notice:

- Gdim = G Bb Db

- Eb/G = G Bb Eb → so only the 5th changes: Db → Eb

So moving from Gdim → Eb/G is: Db → Eb (ascending half-step), Bb stays, G stays.

So it’s **G Bb Db → G Bb Eb** — just a **Db → Eb** move — probably a chromatic passing tone.

Then back to Gdim: Eb → Db.

So the harmony is: **Gdim ↔ Eb major**, flipping Db/Eb.

That’s a **common progression** in pop/rock/jazz: using a **diminished chord** as a chromatic approach to a major chord.

Now — after several of those, we get:

**Bbm/F**

Bbm = Bb Db F → with F in bass → **F Bb Db**

That’s the same as **F minor 7th without the 7th?** Or just **Bbm (1st inversion?)** — no, F is the 5th, so this is **Bbm in 2nd inversion**.

F Bb Db — roots: F = 5th, Bb = root, Db = b3

Then **Ab/G**

Ab = Ab C Eb → with G in bass → G Ab C Eb

That’s four notes — G, Ab, C, Eb

What’s that chord? G Ab C Eb = G, Ab, C, Eb

Convert to tones from G:

- G (root)

- Ab = b2

- C = 4

- Eb = b6

So: G b2 4 b6 — unusual.

G Ab C Eb = **Ab major 7 with G in bass?** Ab major 7 is Ab C Eb G → yes! Exactly.

So **Ab/G = Ab maj7 with G in bass** → so it’s **G root, Ab maj7 upper structure** — functionally **Abmaj7/G** — which is called **G7#5b9?** Not exactly.

Abmaj7 = Ab C Eb G — which is a **minor seventh flat five chord?** No — Ab is major 7th.

Actually: **Ab C Eb G** = Ab maj7 — all major 7th chord.

With G in bass → that’s **Ab (maj7)/G** — which is a **G major 7 sharp 11**? No — better to just call it a **suspension or upper structure**.

G Ab C Eb — this has **two consecutive half steps**: G-Ab and C-Eb (minor 3rd), so special.

But more importantly — we now have:

**F Bb Db** ← Bbm/F

**G Ab C Eb** ← Abmaj7/G

Now, Ab is **one half-step above G**.

So G → Ab is a **chromatic ascent** in bass.

This feels like **modal interchange** or **borrowing from parallel mode**.

Now the big one — Dbmaj7/F = F Ab C Db

Which is **Db maj7** with 5th in bass — so the notes: **Db F Ab C**

Compare to Abmaj7: **Ab C Eb G**

Different.

Now, what is the relationship between **Eb**, **Ab**, **Db**?

E to A to D — each a **perfect 4th** down? Or perfect 5th up?

Eb → Ab = P4 up? Eb to Ab = Ab is 5th above Eb? No:

Eb → Ab: Ab is the perfect 4th above Eb (Eb F G Ab → 4 notes)

Ab → Db: Db is the perfect 4th above Ab (Ab Bb C Db)

So: **Eb → Ab → Db** — each step is a **perfect 4th upward** — or **perfect 5th downward**

So: **Eb → Ab → Db** = 3 chords down by 5ths.

But more importantly — these are all **flat keys**.

Eb major = 3 flats

Ab major = 4 flats

Db major = 5 flats

→ So we're going from **Eb (3 flats) → Ab (4) → Db (5)** — getting flatter.

And these are the same as the **vi, ii, V?** of C minor? Let's see.

C minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C → Ab is **vi**, Eb is **bIII**, Db? Not diatonic.

C minor: diatonic chords: i= Cm, ii°= D°, III= Eb, iv= Fm, v= Gm, VI= Ab, VII= Bb

So Eb = III, Ab = VI — both ARE diatonic in **C minor**.

What about Db? Not diatonic. But **bVII** would be Bb.

Db is **bVII in G minor**? G minor: G A Bb C D Eb F# G — diatonic bVII = F? No — Bb.

Db is **bV in F# minor**? Too far.

But we had **Dbmaj7/F** — and F is the 5th of Db — so Db is the **root**.

And just before that, we had **Ab/G** = Ab maj7 with G bass — so **Ab is rooted at G** — meaning G is bass, but harmony is Ab.

This feels like it’s **centered on G**, but **Ab major** is being **borrowed** as a **chromatic mediant**.

G major: G B D — Ab is the **b9**? Too far.

Wait — **C minor** has Eb and Ab — and **Gdim** is the **vii° of Ab major**.

Let’s flip it.

What if the **key is Ab major**?

Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords:

- G is the **leading tone** — vii° = G Bb Db — **exactly our Gdim!**

- Eb is the **V** chord

- Ab is the tonic

- Db is the **IV** chord

Wait — Db is the **IV** of Ab major? Ab Bb C Db — yes, Db is 4th degree.

So:

- **Gdim** = vii°

- **Eb** = V

- **Db** = IV

In **Ab major**, the chords we have:

- Gdim = vii° — very prominent!

- Eb/G = Eb major with G bass — G is the 3rd of Eb — so this is **Eb** in first inversion — so V chord

- Bbm/F = Bb minor? Wait — Bbm = Bb Db F — but in Ab major, Bb is ii, not Bbm — Ab major should have **Bb minor** i.e. **ii chord**! Yes!

Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

So ii chord = Bb minor — yes! So **Bbm/F** = Bb minor in second inversion — ii chord with 5th in bass — very common.

- Ab/G = Ab major with G in bass — that’s **I chord with leading tone in bass** — **Abmaj7/G** — this is **neapolitan counterfeit**? Or more simply, it's **the tonic with raised 7th in bass?** Not quite — G is not a chord tone in Ab major chord — chord is Ab C Eb — adding G makes it **Abmaj7**.

But in Ab major, the 7th is G — so Ab maj7 is the **tonic seventh chord**.

So **Ab/G = I6/5** — tonic in first inversion? Wait — tonic chord Abmaj7 has chord tones: Ab C Eb G — so if bass is G, it’s a **7th chord in 3rd inversion**.

So — we have:

Chord sequence matched to Ab major:

| Chord       | Ab Major Function | Notes            |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Eb/G        | V (1st inv)       | G Bb Eb — G=3rd  |
| Eb/G        | V                 | G Bb Eb          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Bbm/F       | ii (2nd inv)      | F Bb Db — F=5th  |
| Ab/G        | I (3rd inv/maj7)  | G Ab C Eb — G=7th|
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Eb/G        | V                 | G Bb Eb          |
| Eb/G        | V                 | G Bb Eb          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |
| Dbmaj7/F    | IV (2nd inv)      | F Ab C Db — F=5th|
| Gdim        | vii°              | G Bb Db          |

### Conclusion:

All chords naturally fit into the **key of Ab major**:

- Gdim: vii° — leading tone chord — very common in major keys
- Eb: V chord
- Bbm: ii chord
- Ab: I chord (as Abmaj7)
- Db: IV chord (Dbmaj7)

The use of **inversions** (like Eb/G, Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F) is common voice-leading to keep bass smooth, and often used in pop/rock/jazz progressions.

The **Chromatic movement**: Gdim ↔ Eb (Db ⇄ Eb) is **chromatic passing** between the vii° and V.

The cadence: Dbmaj7/F → Gdim → this is **IV → vii°** — which is a **deceptive resolution**? Not quite — usually vii° resolves to I.

Here, it ends on vii° — **unresolved** — possibly leaving tension.

But in terms of tonality — **everything fits perfectly in Ab major**.

> ✅ **Key: Ab major**  
> ✅ **Mode: Major** (Ionian mode)

---

### Bonus: Why does it feel ambiguous?

Because Gdim is **so active** and **prominent**, it distracts the ear — sounding like “center” — but it’s a **leading tone chord**, which inherently creates tension to resolve to tonic (Ab). The tonic appears explicitly as **Ab/G** (I chord).

Also, the final “Dbmaj7/F → Gdim” is unusual — IV → vii° is rare — normally it’s vii° → I.

But since it’s the **last chord**, it ends on unresolved tension — perhaps for stylistic/emotional effect — like a “question mark” ending.

But harmony-wise: **it's all in Ab major**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (Major)**
