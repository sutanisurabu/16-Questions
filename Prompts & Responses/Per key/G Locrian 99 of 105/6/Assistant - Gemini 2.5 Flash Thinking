### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Harmony**

I've been intensely analyzing this chord progression. It starts with two Gdim chords, then goes to Eb/G. The second line repeats the Gdim chords, then veers towards Bbm/F, resolving again to Ab/G. I find the Eb/G chord use particularly interesting. I intend to explore its harmonic function further.


**Exploring Harmonic Functions**

I've just finished dissecting the chords, mapping out their notes and potential inversions. Next, I'm identifying the core tonal elements; I see a clear interplay between the Gdim chords and related keys like Eb and Bb. I'm now compiling the aggregate pitch collection, which should illuminate the underlying scale and clarify the overall harmonic landscape.


**Deciphering the Scale**

I've re-examined the aggregate pitch collection and analyzed its intervals, now seeing it as G Locrian. I considered G as a potential tonal center, recognizing the instability of Locrian mode. This leads me to further investigate how the Gdim chords function within this context, specifically in relation to the other chords, to define the movement.


**Reassessing the Cadence**

I've just re-examined the initial chord progression in its entirety, and I'm struck by the ending. The final Gdim chord is intriguing, especially following Dbmaj7/F. The inclusion of the Eb/G and Ab/G chords and their functional roles provide crucial context. I will further consider the possible tonal centers, including G, Ab, and Eb, and examine how the Gdim chord functions in relation to each of those options.


**Deciding on Functionality**

I'm now zeroing in on Ab major as the key center, seeing a clear harmonic function in the progression. The Gdim acts as a vii° leading to the dominant, Eb/G, with Bbm and Dbmaj7 serving as subdominant chords. Finally, Ab/G reinforces the tonic, creating a strong sense of resolution in this harmonic environment.


**Defining the Function**

I've finalized my analysis, concluding the progression is firmly rooted in Ab major. The Gdim functions as a vii° chord, leading to dominant chords, and ultimately resolving to the tonic via the Ab/G. The choice of inversions also contributes to a sense of forward motion.


**Refining the Theory**

I'm now revisiting the chord functions, focusing on how the Gdim, Eb/G, and Ab/G interact to create the tension and release. I've confirmed that the progression strongly implies Ab major, with the Gdim serving as the crucial leading-tone chord. Furthermore, I'm analyzing the significance of the choice of inversions to add a flowing cadence.




The task is to determine the key and mode based on the provided chord progression:

$\text{Gdim} \mid \text{Gdim} \mid \text{Eb/G} \mid \text{Eb/G}$
$\text{Gdim} \mid \text{Gdim} \mid \text{Bbm/F} \mid \text{Ab/G}$
$\text{Gdim} \mid \text{Gdim} \mid \text{Eb/G} \mid \text{Eb/G}$
$\text{Gdim} \mid \text{Gdim} \mid \text{Dbmaj7/F} \mid \text{Gdim}$

### 1. Identify the Pitch Collection

First, we list the notes contained in all the chords:

| Chord | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Gdim | G, Bb, Db |
| Eb/G | Eb, G, Bb |
| Bbm/F | Bb, Db, F |
| Ab/G | Ab, C, Eb, G |
| Dbmaj7/F | Db, F, Ab, C |

The complete aggregate set of unique pitches is: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**.

### 2. Determine the Key and Function

This set of seven notes (G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F) matches the notes of the **Ab Major Scale**.

Now, let's analyze the function of the chords within the key of Ab Major (Ab Ionian: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G):

| Chord | Roman Numeral (Ab Major) | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gdim (G-Bb-Db) | $\text{vii}^{\circ}$ (Leading Tone Triad) | Strong Dominant Function |
| Eb/G (Eb-G-Bb) | $\text{V}$ (Dominant) | Dominant |
| Bbm/F (Bb-Db-F) | $\text{ii}$ (Supertonic) | Subdominant |
| Ab/G (Ab-C-Eb) | $\text{I}$ (Tonic) | Tonic |
| Dbmaj7/F (Db-F-Ab-C) | $\text{IV}^{\text{maj}7}$ (Subdominant) | Subdominant |

The progression uses the core functional harmonies of Ab Major: Tonic (I), Subdominant (ii, IV), and Dominant/Leading Tone ($\text{V}, \text{vii}^{\circ}$). The repeated use of Gdim ($\text{vii}^{\circ}$) establishes a persistent harmonic tension that drives toward resolution supplied by $\text{V}$ (Eb/G) and the tonal chords ($\text{Ab}, \text{Bbm}, \text{Dbmaj7}$).

### Conclusion

The chord progression is highly functional, utilizing chords derived entirely from the Ab Major scale, implying Ab Major as the tonal center.

**Key:** Ab
**Mode:** Ionian (Major)
