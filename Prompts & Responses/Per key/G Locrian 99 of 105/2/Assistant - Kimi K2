Alright, let's tackle this chord progression to determine the key and mode. Here's the given sequence:

```
Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim
```

### Step 1: List Out the Chords
First, let's list all the chords without repetitions to see the unique ones:

- Gdim
- Eb/G
- Bbm/F
- Ab/G
- Dbmaj7/F

### Step 2: Analyze Each Chord's Notes
Let's break down each chord to see what notes they contain.

1. **Gdim (G diminished triad)**: G - Bb - Db
2. **Eb/G (Eb major with G in the bass)**: Eb - G - Bb (with G as the lowest note)
3. **Bbm/F (Bbm with F in the bass)**: Bb - Db - F (with F as the lowest note)
4. **Ab/G (Ab with G in the bass)**: Ab - C - Eb (with G as the lowest note)
5. **Dbmaj7/F (Db major 7 with F in the bass)**: Db - F - Ab - C (with F as the lowest note)

### Step 3: Identify the Notes Present
From all these chords, the unique notes (ignoring octave or bass positions for now) are:

- G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C

Let's list them in order:

G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

This is exactly the G natural minor scale (G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F), but here we have Ab instead of A, which aligns with G minor. Wait, in G natural minor, the 2nd degree is A, but we have Ab here. That seems off.

Wait a minute, let's list the notes again:

From the chords:
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb
- Bbm/F: Bb, Db, F
- Ab/G: Ab, C, Eb
- Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C

Unique notes: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

This is the G Phrygian mode, which has the notes: G - Ab - Bb - C - D - Eb - F.

But in our chords, we don't have a D natural; the D is Db in Gdim. Wait, Gdim is G - Bb - Db, which is the diminished triad based on G. In G Phrygian, the 5th degree is D natural, but here we have Db, which is the diminished 5th from G.

Hmm, this seems conflicting because Phrygian has a perfect 5th (D natural), but our Gdim has a diminished 5th (Db).

Let me think differently: maybe the key is based on the root movements or the tonal center.

### Step 4: Look for the Tonal Center
The chord that appears most frequently is Gdim. This might suggest that G is the tonal center, even though it's a diminished chord, which is unstable.

But in traditional harmony, diminished chords are often passing or leading tone chords, not tonic chords. However, in modern or modal contexts, we might treat G as the center.

Given the notes G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, this is the G Phrygian mode with a lowered 5th (Db instead of D). But Phrygian doesn't have a lowered 5th; it has a perfect 5th.

This seems more like G Locrian mode, which has:

G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F

Yes, Locrian is the 7th mode of the major scale, built on the 7th degree. For G Locrian, the parent major scale would be Ab major:

Ab major: Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G

So G Locrian is: G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F

This matches our collected notes perfectly.

### Step 5: Verify with Chords
Let's see if the chords fit G Locrian:

- Gdim: G - Bb - Db → This is the diminished triad built on the tonic in Locrian (1 - b3 - b5), which is characteristic.
- Eb/G: Eb - G - Bb → This is Eb major, but in Locrian, Eb is the b6, and this is a major chord on the b6, which is common.
- Bbm/F: Bb - Db - F → Bb is the b2 in G Locrian, and this is a minor chord on the b2.
- Ab/G: Ab - C - Eb → Ab is the b1 (or the root of the parent major), but in G Locrian, Ab is the b2, but here it's more like Ab major with G in bass, which is a bit unusual but can be seen as a passing or color chord.
- Dbmaj7/F: Db - F - Ab - C → Db is the b4 in G Locrian, and this is a major 7 chord on the b4.

While some chords are extensions or inversions, the core scale is G Locrian based on the notes.

### Step 6: Check for Alternative Interpretations
Could this be another key or mode?

- G natural minor: Would have A natural, not Ab, and D natural, not Db.
- G Phrygian: Would have D natural, not Db.
- G harmonic minor: Would have A natural and D natural.
- G melodic minor: Would have A natural and D natural ascending.

None of these fit because they all require a perfect 5th (D natural), but we have Db consistently.

Thus, G Locrian is the only mode that fits all the notes present.

### Step 7: Confirm the Key Signature
G Locrian is the 7th mode of Ab major. Ab major has 4 flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), so G Locrian shares this key signature, starting on G.

### Final Determination
After carefully analyzing the notes and chord structures, the progression is based on:

**Key: G Locrian**
