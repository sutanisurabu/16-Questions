### Reasoning

**Defining the Parameters**

I've started mapping out the key goals: clearly, it's about pinpointing the key and mode of the provided chord sequence. The chord progression itself is complex, with frequent diminished chords and slash chords. I will approach this by breaking down each chord and its potential function within the sequence.


**Evaluating Chord Functions**

I'm now focusing on the chord functions within the proposed Ab major key. Examining how each chord relates to the tonic and other degrees of the scale is underway. I've noted that the frequent `Gdim` could indeed function as a leading tone chord to the `Ab`, a `vii°` resolving to the tonic. I'm also looking into how the slash chords fit into the larger harmonic picture.


**Confirming the Tonic**

I'm now zeroing in on confirming Ab major as the key. I'm noting the strong presence of the V and IV chords alongside the frequent Gdim, which strengthens the tonal pull to Ab. The `Ab/G` seems to be a key element too, offering a clear resolution point and further support.




Based on a harmonic analysis of the chord progression, the key is **Ab Major**.

Here is a breakdown of why:

### Chord Analysis in the Key of Ab Major

The Ab Major scale has the following notes: **Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G**.

Let's analyze each chord in the progression as it functions within Ab Major:

*   **Gdim (G - Bb - Db):** This is the **vii°** chord (the leading-tone diminished triad). Its root, G, is the 7th degree of the Ab major scale. This chord creates strong tension that naturally wants to resolve up to the tonic, Ab. The frequent use of Gdim in this progression constantly points back to Ab as the tonal center.

*   **Eb/G (Eb - G - Bb, with G in the bass):** This is the **V** chord (the dominant, Eb Major) in its second inversion (V⁶/₄). The dominant chord is the second most important chord in establishing a key, as it strongly pulls towards the tonic (I).

*   **Bbm/F (Bb - Db - F, with F in the bass):** This is the **ii** chord (the supertonic, Bb minor) in its first inversion (ii⁶). This is a standard subdominant chord that often leads to the dominant (V) or tonic (I).

*   **Ab/G (Ab - C - Eb, with G in the bass):** This is the **I** chord (the tonic, Ab Major) with the leading tone (G) in the bass. This creates a specific kind of tension—you hear the tonic chord, but the bass note makes you feel it's not fully resolved and wants to move.

*   **Dbmaj7/F (Db - F - Ab - C, with F in the bass):** This is the **IVmaj7** chord (the subdominant, Db Major 7th) in its first inversion. This is another very common and strong chord in the key of Ab Major.

### Summary of the Harmonic Function

1.  **Tonic is Ab:** Every chord in the progression fits perfectly within the key of Ab Major.
2.  **Leading-Tone Function:** The progression is dominated by the **Gdim (vii°)** chord, which consistently creates tension that points directly to an **Ab (I)** resolution.
3.  **Dominant Presence:** The use of the **Eb (V)** chord further solidifies Ab Major as the key.
4.  **Pedal Tone:** The recurring **G** in the bass (`Gdim`, `Eb/G`, `Ab/G`) acts as a pedal point, anchoring the harmony and emphasizing the `vii-I` (leading tone to tonic) relationship that is central to this progression.

Therefore, the key and mode are unambiguously **Ab Major**.
