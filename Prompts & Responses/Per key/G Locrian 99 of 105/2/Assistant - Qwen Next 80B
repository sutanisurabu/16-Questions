This sequence of chords:

> **Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**

…is rich in chromaticism and diminished harmony, and **does not clearly establish a single diatonic key or mode** in the traditional sense. However, we can analyze it to determine the **most likely tonal center**, **harmonic function**, and **modal context**.

---

### Step 1: List the chords with root and bass note

Let’s re-express each chord clearly, noting **chord quality** and **bass note**:

1. **Gdim** → G° = G–B♭–D♭  
2. **Gdim**  
3. **Eb/G** → Eb major triad (E♭–G–B♭) with **G in bass** → So: G–E♭–G–B♭ → **G7♭5?** Wait — this is a **first inversion Eb major** — so it’s **Eb maj/G**  
4. **Eb/G**  
5. **Gdim**  
6. **Gdim**  
7. **Bbm/F** → B♭m = B♭–D♭–F, bass F → **F–B♭–D♭** → **F minor 7♭5?** Or **B♭m7/F**? This is **F as bass** over B♭m → **F–B♭–D♭** = **F half-diminished (Fm7♭5)** — *but root is B♭, bass is F*  
8. **Ab/G** → A♭ major triad (A♭–C–E♭), bass G → **G–A♭–C–E♭** → This is **A♭ major with G bass** → **G7♭9?** Or **A♭/G** = a **slash chord**: A♭ major over G → common in jazz as *A♭7#9* or **A♭ with G bass** = **G dominant with A♭** → likely functions as **G7♭5♭9** (violation of normal harmony, but common in chromatic voice leading)  
9. **Gdim**  
10. **Gdim**  
11. **Eb/G**  
12. **Eb/G**  
13. **Gdim**  
14. **Gdim**  
15. **Dbmaj7/F** → Db major 7th = D♭–F–A♭–C, bass F → **F–D♭–F–A♭–C** → This is **F as bass**, so **DbMaj7/F** = **F sustained under DbMaj7** → **F is the 3rd of DbMaj7**, so this is **DbMaj7 in 2nd inversion**, but the bass is **F**, which is not the root → DbMaj7/F = F is the 3rd of Db, so this chord is **DbMaj7 with 3rd in bass**  
16. **Gdim**

### Step 2: Look for patterns or tonic candidates

The most frequent chord is **Gdim** — appears **8 times**.

Also, **Eb/G** appears 4 times.

**Dbmaj7/F** appears once, and it’s a *major 7th chord* — perhaps the **only consonant, stable chord** in the whole progression. That’s significant.

Let’s look at **Dbmaj7/F**:

- **DbMaj7 = D♭–F–A♭–C**
- Bass is **F** → So we have: **F–D♭–F–A♭–C**

This is **F as the 3rd of DbMaj7** → he chord is a **Db major 7th chord with the 3rd in the bass** — very common in jazz to smooth out voice leading or create a lush, suspended quality.

**DbMaj7** is the **tonic** function here? Possibly.

Let’s see: If Db is the tonic, then what’s the key? **Db major** → key signature: 5 flats.

Let’s check if other chords in the progression can relate to Db major or its relative minor (Bbm):

- **Gdim** → G° = G–B♭–D♭ → This is **D♭ minor 7♭5**? Wait: D♭ minor 7♭5 is **D♭–F♭–A♭–C♭** → not matching.

But wait: **G–B♭–D♭** = **Gdim** → This is the **same as B♭ diminished (B♭°)**? No, root is G.

Actually, **Gdim = G–B♭–D♭** = **third inversion of D♭m7♭5?**

Wait — let’s think differently.

### Step 3: Gdim as vii° of Ab major?

- In **Ab major**: vii° = G° → **G–B♭–D♭** → YES!

So **Gdim = vii°7 of Ab major**

In **Ab major** chord scale:
- I: Ab
- II: Bm
- III: Cm
- IV: Db
- V: Eb
- VI: Fm
- VII: G°

So **Gdim** is **vii° of Ab major**

Now look at the other chord: **Eb/G** — Eb major with G bass.

- Eb major = Eb–G–Bb → G is the **3rd** of Eb → so **Eb/G** = Eb major 1st inversion.

In Ab major, **Eb is the V chord** → **Eb = V of Ab**

So **Eb(G)** = V in 1st inversion — very strong dominant function!

Then we have **Bbm/F** → B♭ minor with F bass → B♭m = VI in Ab major → F is the 5th of B♭m → so this is **B♭m in 2nd inversion** → VI chord, very common in pop/rock.

**Ab/G** → Ab major with G bass → Ab = I of Ab major → G is a half-step below → so **I with 7th in bass?** Ab with G bass = G–Ab–C–Eb → this is **G7♭9** if we think of it as a tritone substitution for C7? But in context of Ab major, **this is the tonic chord with a chromatic bass descent from A to G** → very common in rock/pop for dramatic effect (think “Somebody That I Used to Know” resolution).

Then **DbMaj7/F** → Db is **IV** in Ab major!

So **DbMaj7** = IV chord in Ab major.

And **DbMaj7/F** = 4th chord with 3rd in bass — lush, commonly used.

So LET’S MAP EVERYTHING TO **AFLAT MAJOR**:

| Chord | Function in Ab Major | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Gdim | vii° | G–B♭–D♭ |
| Eb/G | V (1st inv) | Eb–G–Bb / G in bass |
| Bbm/F | VI (2nd inv) | B♭–D♭–F / F in bass |
| Ab/G | I (with chromatic bass) | Ab–C–Eb / G in bass → vague, but resolves to Ab |
| DbMaj7/F | IV (2nd inv) | Db–F–Ab–C / F in bass — note F = 3rd of Db → so this is DbMaj7 in 2nd inversion |

And Gdim repeats as vii° — which leads to V (Eb), and DbMaj7 = IV → IV–vi–ii–V is not the pattern, but **IV–V–vi–i** is common in pop.

Wait — let’s look at the **overall progression**:

We see:  
**vii° – (vii°) – V – (V) – vii° – (vii°) – VI – I (with tritone bass) – vii° – (vii°) – V – (V) – vii° – (vii°) – IV – vii°**

That’s **extremely repetitive**, and it **builds tension with Gdim** and releases with **Eb/V**, then **Bbm/VI**, then **Ab/I**, then **Db/IV**.

The **I–IV–V–vi** circle is split up — but the **tonic here is clearly Ab major**.

The **most stable chord** in the progression is actually **Ab/G** — even though it has G bass, that’s a passing chromatic tone — the harmonic function is still **I (Ab major)**.

**DbMaj7/F** is built on IV, and its glittering major 7th quality gives it a momentary tonal warmth, but **it doesn’t override Ab as the tonic**.

### Step 4: Does this suggest a mode?

This is **Ab MAJOR (Ionian mode)**.

The chords used are diatonic to Ab major:  
- I: Ab  
- IV: Db  
- V: Eb  
- VI: Bbm  
- vii°: Gdim

**All chords are from Ab major!**

- Gdim → vii°7 = diatonic  
- Eb/G → V/1st inv → diatonic  
- Bbm/F → VI/2nd inv → diatonic  
- Ab/G → I with chromatic bass (non-diatonic bass note, but chord is diatonic)  
- DbMaj7/F → IV with non-root bass, but chord is diatonic

So: **All chords are derived from Ab major scale → key is Ab major.**

The **G in the bass** of Ab major is **non-diatonic** — G is the leading tone of Ab — so it's **used for chromatic voice leading**, not a new mode.

And **DbMaj7/F** is just a refinement of IV — common in modern pop/jazz to add color.

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: A♭ Major**  
> **Mode: Ionian**

**Explanation**:  
The entire chord progression is built from diatonic chords of **A♭ major**, with the **G diminished chord** functioning as the leading-tone chord (vii°). The presence of **Eb/G (V)**, **Bbm/F (VI)**, **Ab/G (I)**, and **DbMaj7/F (IV)** all confirm the tonal center of A♭. The chromatic bass notes (like G under Ab or Eb) are for voice-leading color, not modal change. The final DbMaj7/F is a colorful IV chord, reinforcing the home key of Ab major as the tonic.

✅ **Key: A♭ Major**  
✅ **Mode: Ionian**
