### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or in minor keys, so I should look for clues about the key.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Bbm/F

- Ab/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Dbmaj7/F

- Gdim

Notice that some chords have slashes, like Eb/G and Bbm/F and Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F. These are slash chords, meaning the chord is played with a different bass note. For example, Eb/G means an Eb major chord with a G in the bass.

Similarly, Bbm/F means Bbm chord with F in the bass, Ab/G means Ab chord with G in the bass, and Dbmaj7/F means Dbmaj7 chord with F in the bass.

Now, to find the key, I should look at the root notes and the bass notes to see if there's a pattern.

Let me consider the chords without the bass notes for a moment. So, the chords are: Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7.

Gdim is a diminished chord. Typically, a diminished chord is built on the seventh degree of a harmonic minor scale or as a leading tone chord. But let's see the other chords.

Eb major, Bbm minor, Ab major, Dbmaj7.

Dbmaj7 is Db major seventh.

Now, let's think about possible keys. Eb major key has chords: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim.

But here we have Bbm, which is Bb minor, but in Eb major, Bb is major, not minor. So probably not Eb major.

What about C minor? C minor key has chords: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb. But we have Bbm, which is not in C minor; Bb is major in C minor.

Bbm is B flat minor, which is not in the natural minor of any common key directly.

Perhaps it's in a key with flats.

Let me list the roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db.

G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. Notice that these are all flat keys. Eb, Bb, Ab, Db are all flat notes.

G is also G, but in flat keys, G might be natural or flat? In keys with flats, G could be natural or flat depending on the key.

Let's consider the key of Ab major. Ab major has chords: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.

Oh! Look at that: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.

In Ab major, we have Bbm, Db, Eb, and Gdim. That matches our chords: we have Bbm, Ab, Eb, and Gdim. And we also have Dbmaj7, which is essentially Db with a major seventh, so Db chord in Ab major is major, so Dbmaj7 fits.

In Ab major, the Db chord is major, so Dbmaj7 is just a variation.

So, in Ab major, the chords are:

- I: Ab

- ii: Bbm

- iii: Cm

- IV: Db

- V: Eb

- vi: Fm

- vii°: Gdim

Now, looking at our progression: we have Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, and Db (as Dbmaj7).

So, Gdim is vii°, Eb is V, Bbm is ii, Ab is I, and Db is IV.

That seems to fit perfectly.

But let's confirm the slash chords. We have Eb/G, which is Eb major with G in the bass. In Ab major, Eb is the V chord, and G is the third of Eb, but putting G in the bass might create a different inversion. Similarly, Bbm/F: Bbm is ii, and F is the fifth of Bbm, so it's in first inversion? Bbm chord is Bb-Db-F, so with F in bass, it's first inversion.

Ab/G: Ab chord with G in bass. Ab chord is Ab-C-Eb, so with G in bass, that's not a standard inversion because G is not in the Ab major chord? Ab major chord has Ab, C, Eb. G is not part of it, so Ab/G is like an Ab chord with a G added in the bass, which might be a passing note or something.

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C, so with F in bass, it's first inversion, since F is the third.

Now, the progression has multiple Gdim chords, which are vii° in Ab major.

Let's see the sequence: it starts with Gdim, then Eb/G, then Gdim, then Bbm/F, Ab/G, then Gdim, then Eb/G, then Gdim, then Dbmaj7/F, and ends with Gdim.

In terms of Roman numerals in Ab major:

- Gdim = vii°

- Eb/G = V with G in bass? But G is not the root, so it's V in first inversion? Eb/G would be V chord with third in bass, so that's V6 in inversion notation.

In classical terms, Eb/G is V6 in Ab major.

Similarly, Bbm/F is ii6, since Bbm is ii and with F in bass, it's first inversion.

Ab/G is I with something in bass? Ab/G means Ab chord with G bass, but G is not in the chord, so it's not a standard inversion. It might be a passing chord or a different function.

Ab/G could be seen as a dominant preparation or something. In Ab major, G is the leading tone, so having G in bass under Ab chord might create tension.

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F is IV6 with major seventh, so IV6 maj7.

Now, the key seems to be Ab major.

But the user asked for key and mode. Mode usually means if it's major or minor, but in this case, it's clearly major based on the chords.

But let's double-check if there's any minor mode. Ab major is the key, so mode is major.

But sometimes people refer to modes like Dorian, etc., but here the chords fit Ab major perfectly.

We have Bbm which is minor, and in Ab major, ii is minor, so that's fine.

Also, the diminished chord Gdim is on the leading tone, which is typical in major keys.

So, I think key is Ab major.

But let's see the first chord is Gdim, and it repeats, and ends with Gdim, so it might be emphasizing the leading tone, but the tonic is Ab.

In the progression, we have Ab chord, so tonic is established.

So, key: Ab major.

Mode: major.

But just to be thorough, let's consider the notes involved.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Gdim chord: G, Bb, Db, which are all in Ab major scale? Gdim is G, Bb, Db, and since Ab major has Bb, Db, G, yes, all notes are in Ab major. Gdim is vii° chord.

Eb chord: Eb, G, Bb — all in Ab major.

Bbm chord: Bb, Db, F — all in Ab major.

Ab chord: Ab, C, Eb — all in Ab major.

Db chord: Db, F, Ab — all in Ab major, and Dbmaj7 adds C, which is also in Ab major.

So, all chords are diatonic to Ab major.

The slash chords don't change the diatonic nature; they just alter the bass.

So, definitely, key is Ab major.

Therefore, key: Ab major, mode: major.

But since mode is major, we don't need to specify mode separately if we say key is Ab major.

Sometimes people say "key of Ab major" which implies major mode.

So, I think that's it.

The chord progression provided is diatonic to the key of Ab major. The chords correspond to the following Roman numerals in Ab major:

- Gdim = vii° (leading tone diminished chord)
- Eb/G = V6 (dominant chord in first inversion)
- Bbm/F = ii6 (supertonic chord in first inversion)
- Ab/G = I with added bass note (tonic chord with the leading tone in the bass, creating tension)
- Dbmaj7/F = IV6 maj7 (subdominant chord in first inversion with major seventh)

The progression emphasizes the leading tone diminished chord (Gdim) and resolves to the tonic (Ab) and subdominant (Db) areas, confirming Ab major as the key. The mode is major, as all chords are derived from the Ab major scale (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G).

**Key:** Ab major  
**Mode:** Major
