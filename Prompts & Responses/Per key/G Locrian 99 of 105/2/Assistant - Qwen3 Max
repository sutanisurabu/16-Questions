To analyze the key and mode of this chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Look for recurring chords and tonal centers

- **Gdim** appears very frequently (8 times) – possibly a central chord or pedal.
- **Eb/G** appears 4 times – an Eb major chord with G in the bass (i.e., **first inversion** of Eb major).
- **Bbm/F**: Bb minor with F in the bass → F is the 5th of Bb minor.
- **Ab/G**: Ab major with G in the bass – this is essentially a **G7♭9** (or G7alt) without the root: Ab/G = G–Ab–C–Eb → G–♭9–3–♭7 → **G7♭9**, a dominant chord.
- **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭ major 7 with F in the bass → F is the 3rd of D♭ major → **first inversion** of D♭maj7.

So we’re seeing chords built from **Eb**, **Bb**, **Ab**, **Db**, and **G**.

---

### Step 2: Consider relationships between chords

Let’s list the root notes (ignoring inversions for functional analysis):

- Gdim → G–B♭–D♭ (or F♭) – diminished triad (symmetrical)
- Eb – tonic candidate?
- Bbm – relative minor of Db major
- Ab – subdominant of Eb? Or V of Db?
- Db – potential tonic?

Notice that **Eb, Ab, Bb, Db** all belong to the **key of Eb minor** or **Db major**.

Let’s test **Eb minor** (natural minor):  
**Eb natural minor scale**: Eb – F – Gb – Ab – Bb – Cb – Db

Chords in Eb natural minor:
- i: Eb minor
- ii°: Fdim
- ♭III: Gb major
- iv: Ab minor
- v: Bb minor
- ♭VI: Cb major (enharmonic to B major)
- ♭VII: Db major

But we have **Eb major**, not Eb minor, and **Dbmaj7**, **Ab major**, **Bb minor** – this better fits **Db major**.

**Db major scale**: Db – Eb – F – Gb – Ab – Bb – C

Chords:
- I: Db major
- ii: Eb minor
- iii: F minor
- IV: Gb major
- V: Ab major
- vi: Bb minor
- vii°: Cdim

But we have:
- **Eb/G** → Eb major (not minor) → not in Db major.
- **Bbm** → yes (vi)
- **Ab** → yes (V)
- **Dbmaj7** → yes (I)
- **Gdim** → G is not in Db major (Gb is). Gdim = G–Bb–Db → this is **enharmonic to Ab7♭9** or it functions as a rootless dominant.

Wait – Gdim (G–Bb–Db) is **the same notes as Bb° (Bb–Db–Fb)** and **Db°**, due to symmetry. But **G is not in Db major**; however, **Gdim can be seen as a passing chord or a secondary leading tone chord**.

Alternatively, consider **G as a dominant function**.

Look at **Ab/G** → as noted, this is G in the bass with Ab major chord: G–Ab–C–Eb. This strongly implies **G7♭9**, which would resolve to **C** – but we don’t have C. However, **G7 can also be the tritone substitute of C7**, which is the **V of F**, but that doesn't help.

Another angle: **All the major/minor chords fit within the key of Eb minor (harmonic or melodic)**?

**Eb harmonic minor**: Eb – F – Gb – Ab – Bb – Cb – D

Chords include:
- V: B major (not Bb minor)
- III+: Gb augmented
- VI: Cb major

But we have **Ab major**, which is ♭VII in Eb minor – common in minor keys.

But again, **Eb/G is Eb major**, which is **♭VI in G minor**, or **I in Eb major**.

Wait – what if the **tonic is G**?

Try **G harmonic minor**: G – A – Bb – C – D – Eb – F#

Chords:
- i: G minor
- ii°: A°
- III+: Bb+
- iv: C minor
- V: D major (or D7)
- VI: Eb major ← yes!
- vii°: F#°

So **Eb major** is the **♭VI** in G minor.

Also, **Bbm** is the **iv** in G minor.

**Ab major** is not diatonic to G minor, but **Ab = ♭VII**, very common in minor keys (modal mixture from natural minor or Phrygian influence).

**Dbmaj7** – Db is **♭II** in C, but in G minor, **Db = ?** G to Db is a tritone – so **Db = augmented fourth/diminished fifth** → not diatonic.

However, **Db = enharmonic to C#**, which is the **leading tone** in D, not helpful.

But note: **Gdim** is the **vii°** of **Ab major** (G–Bb–Db = vii° in Ab).

And **Eb/G** = Eb major with G bass – G is the **third** of Eb, but also the **root of Gdim**.

Hold on – consider **Gdim as vii° of Ab**, and **Ab appears as Ab/G** (implying G in bass with Ab chord) – that’s a classic **dominant function leading to Db**.

Indeed:

- **Gdim → Ab → Db** is a standard progression: vii°7 – I in **Db major**.

But we don’t have a clear Ab **major triad**, only **Ab/G**, which still contains Ab–C–Eb → Ab major.

And **Dbmaj7** appears once.

Also, **Bbm/F** = Bb minor / F → F is the 5th → root position Bbm.

In **Db major**, Bbm is **vi**, Ab is **V**, Eb is **ii** – but **Eb should be minor** in Db major, yet we have **Eb major**.

So **Eb major** is **not diatonic to Db major**.

But **Eb major** = **♭III** in **C minor**, or **V of Ab**, or **I in Eb major**.

Alternate idea: **The key is Eb major**?

**Eb major scale**: Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb – C – D

Chords:
- I: Eb
- ii: Fm
- iii: Gm
- IV: Ab
- V: Bb
- vi: Cm
- vii°: D°

But we have:
- **Gdim** – G–Bb–Db → not in Eb major (G minor would be iii, but this is diminished – has Db instead of D natural)
- **Bbm** – Bb minor – but V in Eb is **Bb major**, not minor.
- **Dbmaj7** – Db is **♭VI**, used in minor keys, not typical in Eb major.
- **Ab/G** – Ab major over G = G7♭9 → dominant of C, not in Eb.

So **Eb major doesn’t fit**.

---

### Step 3: Consider modal or non-functional harmony

This progression features:
- Repeated **Gdim** pedal
- Alternation with **Eb/G** (Eb major in first inversion)
- Occasional modal chords: **Bbm**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7**

Notice that **Gdim**, **Eb**, **Bbm**, **Ab**, **Db** all share notes from the **G half-whole diminished scale** or **symmetrical diminished**?

**G half-whole diminished scale**: G – Ab – Bb – B – Db – D – Eb – E – (G)

This scale contains:
- Gdim (G–Bb–Db)
- Ab major (Ab–C–Eb)
- Bb minor (Bb–Db–F)
- Db major (Db–F–Ab)
- Eb major? Eb–G–Bb → G is in the scale? Yes, G is the root. Bb is in. But **G is natural**, and in the half-whole diminished starting on G, the third is **Bb**, but **Eb major requires G natural and Bb** – yes, both are in the scale.

Wait: G half-whole: G–Ab–Bb–B–Db–D–Eb–E

Notes: G, Ab, Bb, B, Db, D, Eb, E

Eb major = Eb–G–Bb → all present.

Bb minor = Bb–Db–F → **F is not in the scale** → problem.

But maybe it's **G whole-half diminished** (used over G°7):

G whole-half: G–A–Bb–C–Db–Eb–E–F#

Contains G, Bb, Db → Gdim  
Eb = Eb–G–Bb → yes  
Ab = Ab–C–Eb → **Ab not in scale** (A natural is, not Ab) → no.

So diminished scale doesn’t fully explain.

---

### Step 4: Consider **tritone substitution and chromatic mediants**

Notice **Dbmaj7** is a **tritone away from G** – **G and Db are tritone apart**.

Also, **Gdim** can resolve to **Db** as a **leading tone chord**: G° = vii° of Ab, but **G° also shares notes with Db°**, and can be used to approach Db.

Moreover, **Ab/G = G7♭9**, which is the **tritone substitution of C7**, but more importantly, **G7 is the V of C**, but **G7♭9 can also resolve to C minor**.

But we have **Dbmaj7**, which is **a semitone above C** – this is a **Phrygian cadence** or **Neapolitan relationship**.

Alternatively, think of **Db as the tonic**, and **G as the #IV**, which is unusual.

But another powerful observation:

> The chords **Gdim – Eb/G** can be seen as **G°7 – Eb/G**, and **G°7 is the same as E°7, C°7, and A♭°7** due to symmetry. But more importantly, **G°7 can resolve to Ab major** (as vii°–I), and **Ab is the V of Db**.

So: **G° → Ab → Db** = **vii° – V – I in Db major**

We do have:
- Gdim (×)
- Ab/G (which is Ab major with G bass – still Ab major)
- Dbmaj7

Even though **Eb/G** is not in Db major, **Eb is the ii chord but should be minor** – however, **major II** is sometimes used as a **secondary subdominant** or **modal mixture**.

But wait: **Eb major** is the **Neapolitan chord (♭II)** in **D minor**, not helpful.

However, in **jazz/pop harmony**, it’s common to use **chromatic mediants** – Eb and Db are a **minor second apart**, and both relate to Gdim.

In fact, **Gdim (G–Bb–Db)** contains:
- The **root of G**
- The **3rd of Eb** (G is the 3rd of Eb)
- The **root of Db**

So **Gdim connects Eb and Db**.

This suggests the harmony is **centered around G as a pedal or axis**, with **modal interchange between Eb major, Bb minor, Ab, and Db major**.

This is characteristic of **C minor** or **G Phrygian**?

Try **G Phrygian**: G – Ab – Bb – C – D – Eb – F

Chords:
- i: G minor
- ♭II: Ab major ← yes
- ♭III: Bb major – but we have Bb **minor**
- iv: C minor
- v: D minor
- ♭VI: Eb major ← yes!
- ♭VII: F major

But we have **Bb minor**, not Bb major – Bb minor would be **ii°** in G Phrygian? No.

However, **Bb minor** can be borrowed from **G natural minor** (Aeolian): G – A – Bb – C – D – Eb – F

G Aeolian:
- i: Gm
- ii°: A°
- ♭III: Bb major – again, we have **Bb minor**

So Bb minor doesn’t fit.

But **Bb minor** is **iv in F minor**, or **vi in Db major**.

Given that **Dbmaj7** appears as a resolution point (even if brief), and **Ab/G** implies a dominant of Db, and **Gdim** is vii° of Ab (V of Db), the most plausible **tonal center is Db major**.

The **Eb major chord** is then a **borrowed chord** – perhaps from **Db Mixolydian** (which has Eb as ii, but still minor), or more likely, it's a **modal mixture from Db minor** (i.e., **Db minor has Eb°, not Eb major**).

Alternatively, **Eb major** is the **V of Ab**, so **Eb → Ab → Db** is a **circle of fifths**: V–I in Ab, then Ab is V of Db.

So: **Eb (V/Ab) → Ab (V/Db) → Db (I)**

That fits!

- **Eb major** = V of Ab
- **Ab** = V of Db
- **Db** = I

And **Gdim** = vii° of Ab, so it can substitute for **Eb** (since vii° and V are functionally similar).

Thus, the progression is **centered in Db major**, using dominant preparations (secondary dominants and leading-tone chords) to tonicize the dominant (Ab) and the tonic (Db).

**Bb minor** is the **vi chord** in Db major – fits.

So despite the repetition of Gdim and Eb/G, the functional analysis points to **Db major**.

---

### Final Answer:

**Key: D♭ major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

The progression uses secondary dominants (Eb = V/Ab), leading-tone chords (Gdim = vii°/Ab), and diatonic chords (Bbm = vi, Ab = V, Db = I) within the key of **D♭ major**. The frequent Gdim acts as a chromatic passing or dominant-function chord resolving to Ab or Eb, reinforcing the tonal center of Db.
