### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm trying to determine the key and mode from the chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim."

It features repeated Gdim chords and several slash chords, indicating different bass notes. The bass sequence primarily alternates between G and F, suggesting a pedal point centered on G, with occasional movement to F. Overall, I’m noting a pattern that could shape the tonal center.**Identifying key center**

I'm considering whether the key center is G, but then I notice that the chord Eb/G introduces a compound chord with an E-flat major triad over G. The notes form a quartal-ish sound, containing G, B-flat, and E-flat—this setup feels like it could imply G minor with a missing D. 

As I analyze more, G-Bb-Db could be a G diminished triad, while Eb/G oscillates between Gdim and Eb, leading me to suspect a neighboring note with the additional slash chord Ab/G.**Identifying the pitch collection**

I'm analyzing the chords and their notes. Bbm/F has F in the bass along with Bb and Db, giving the notes F, Bb, and Db. In comparison, Gdim features G, Bb, Db, while Eb/G includes G, Bb, and Eb. 

If I list the distinct notes from these chords, I find G, Bb, Db, Eb, Ab, C, and F. This creates a 7-note collection: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, and Bb. Notably, this matches the C Phrygian scale.**Determining the tonal center**

The pitch collection I'm working with is C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Now I'm wondering about the tonal center. The bass is predominantly G, which acts like the 5th degree of C. While there’s a G pedal, typical C Phrygian structures often use a C tonic. 

It’s also possible to consider the Ab major scale, which shares the same notes. However, the modality suggests C Phrygian might be the best fit since the chord structure revolves around G. So, I’m exploring which mode aligns with G as the center.**Identifying G Locrian mode**

I've determined the notes G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, and F correspond to G Locrian, derived from Ab major. With G as the tonal center, it functions as a pedal point. The Gdim chord aligns with the Locrian tonic, reinforcing this mode. 

In examining diatonic chords, I notice they fit Ab major but emphasize G. While calling it C Phrygian is also an option, the Gdim characteristics confirm the stronger presence of G Locrian. 

So, the final conclusion is: the key is Ab major, with the mode being G Locrian.

G Locrian (derived from Ab major)

- Pitch set used: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb = Ab major scale
- Center: The persistent G pedal and recurring Gdim (G–Bb–Db) point to G as tonic, whose diatonic triad is diminished in Locrian.
- Chord roles (relative to G Locrian):
  - Gdim = i°
  - Eb/G = bVI/G
  - Ab/G = bII/G
  - Bbm/F = bIII over 5
  - Dbmaj7/F = bVmaj7 over 5

So the harmony is the Ab major collection, but the modal center is G: G Locrian.
