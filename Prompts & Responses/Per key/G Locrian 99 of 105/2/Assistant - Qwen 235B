Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

Chord sequence:
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

### Step 1: Understanding the Chords

- **Gdim** = Gâ€“Bbâ€“Db (diminished triad)
- **Eb/G** = Ebâ€“Gâ€“Bb with G in the bass (first inversion of Eb major)
- **Bbm/F** = Bbâ€“Dbâ€“F with F in the bass (first inversion of Bb minor)
- **Ab/G** = Abâ€“Câ€“Eb with G in the bass (inversion of Ab major)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = Dbâ€“Fâ€“Abâ€“C with F in the bass (first inversion of Db major 7)

Note: All these chords use notes from the **C minor** or **Eb major** key (they are relative: C minor is the relative minor of Eb major).

Letâ€™s look at the notes involved:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb
- Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db
- Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb (chord is Ab major, but G in bass makes a sort of G7sus or Gm7â™­5? Not necessarily functional)
- Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Db

All notes belong to the **C natural minor** (C, D, Eâ™­, F, G, Aâ™­, Bâ™­) or **Eâ™­ major** scale.

So, key candidates: **C minor** or **Eâ™­ major**

### Step 2: Harmonic Function

But **Gdim** is not a diatonic chord in C minor â€” letâ€™s check:

In **C natural minor (Aeolian)**:
- i: Cm
- iiÂ°: Ddim
- III: Eâ™­
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm (not Gdim)
- VI: Aâ™­
- VII: Bâ™­

So **Gdim** is **not** the v chord in C natural minor â€” the v chord is **G minor**.

But in **C harmonic minor**, we raise the 7th (Bâ™­ â†’ B natural), which allows a **G major** or **G7** chord (dominant) to create a stronger pull to C minor. But here we have **Gdim**, which is Gâ€“Bbâ€“Db.

Wait: Gâ€“Bbâ€“Db â€” thatâ€™s actually the **viiÂ°** chord in **Aâ™­ major** or **F minor**.

Hold on. Let's reconsider.

Wait: Gdim = Gâ€“Bâ™­â€“Dâ™­  
Thatâ€™s the **viiÂ°** chord in **Aâ™­ major**:
- Aâ™­ major: Aâ™­, Bâ™­, C, Dâ™­, Eâ™­, F, G
- The viiÂ° chord in Aâ™­ is **Gdim**

Similarly, in **F minor** (natural), the viiÂ° is also **Gdim**

Letâ€™s check all chords in **Aâ™­ major**:

| Chord       | Function in Aâ™­ major |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Gdim        | viiÂ° (common leading tone diminished) |
| Eb/G        | I6 (Eb is the V chord in Aâ™­? No â€” wait) |

Wait â€” Eb is the **IV** chord in Aâ™­ major.

Hold on:
- Aâ™­ major: Aâ™­, Bâ™­, C, Dâ™­, Eâ™­, F, G
- Eb = Eâ™­â€“Gâ€“Bâ™­ â†’ Thatâ€™s the **IV** chord
- Bbm/F = Bâ™­â€“Dâ™­â€“F â†’ thatâ€™s **iiÂ°**, but minor? Wait: Bb minor is not diatonic to Aâ™­ major â€” Aâ™­ major has Bâ™­ minor? No, in Aâ™­ major, the ii chord is **Bâ™­ minor** â€” yes, it is: Bbâ€“Dbâ€“F â†’ Bbm

So Bbm = **iiÂ°**? No: in major keys, the ii chord is **minor**, not diminished. Wait: Bbâ€“Dbâ€“F â†’ intervals: Bbâ€“Db = minor third, Dbâ€“F = major third â†’ so itâ€™s a **minor triad**, so **ii** (minor), not diminished.

But we write **Bbm/F** â€” thatâ€™s just first inversion of Bbm.

But in **Aâ™­ major**, **Bbm** is the **ii** chord.

Now: **Ab/G** â€” Ab major with G in bass. Ab = Abâ€“Câ€“Eb. So Ab is **I**, but chord with G in bass? G is the 7th of Ab â€” so Ab/G is like Ab with a G in bass, which is not standard unless itâ€™s Ab7 â€” but it's Ab major triad. So it's Abmaj6? Not really.

Ab/G could function as a **chromatic passing chord**, maybe.

Then **Dbmaj7/F** â€” Dbmaj7 is Dâ™­â€“Fâ€“Aâ™­â€“C. Thatâ€™s the **IV** chord in Aâ™­? No â€” in Aâ™­:
- I: Ab
- ii: Bbm
- iii: Cm
- IV: Db
- V: Eb
- VI: Fm
- VII: Gdim

Ah! So **Db major** is the **IV** chord in Aâ™­ major! Perfect.
- Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7

And **Dbmaj2** or **Dbmaj7/F** is just first inversion.

So now let's map to **Aâ™­ major**:

- **Gdim** = viiÂ° (very common leading tone chord, resolves to I)
- **Eb/G** = V6 (Eb is V in Aâ™­, first inversion)
- **Bbm/F** = ii (ii chord, first inversion)
- **Ab/G** = I6 (I chord, first inversion â€” Ab with G in bass)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = IVmaj7 (IV chord, first inversion)

So the chords all fit in **Aâ™­ major**!

Letâ€™s reassign:

```
Gdim   = viiÂ°
Eb/G   = V6
Bbm/F  = ii
Ab/G   = I6
Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7
```

Now letâ€™s rewrite the progression with Roman numerals in Aâ™­ major:

```
viiÂ°   viiÂ°   V6    V6
viiÂ°   viiÂ°   ii    I6
viiÂ°   viiÂ°   V6    V6
viiÂ°   viiÂ°   IVmaj7 viiÂ°
```

Interesting! The **viiÂ°** (Gdim) is being used as a substitute for **V** or to lead to I.

But we also see **V (Eb)** appearing, which is the true dominant.

The progression uses **viiÂ° â†’ V â†’ I** type motions, common in tonal harmony.

Also notable: **Dbmaj7/F** (IVmaj7) leads back to Gdim â€” thatâ€™s IVâ€“viiÂ°, which is a plagal movement, but not standard.

However, considering all chords fit neatly in **Aâ™­ major** and the tonal center feels like **Aâ™­** (especially with Ab/G as I6), the key is likely **Aâ™­ major**.

### Step 3: Is There Modal Flavor?

The progression uses primarily diatonic chords from **Aâ™­ major** (C minor's relative major), with only standard inversions and the normal viiÂ° chord.

There is no modal mixture (e.g., flattened VII in major, or sharp IV, etc.) that would suggest a mode like Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.

The use of **Gdim** (viiÂ°) is typical in **major** key harmony.

Also, the presence of **V (Eb)** and **I (Ab)** strongly suggests **tonic-dominant motion**, not modal ambiguity.

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: Aâ™­ major  
- **Mode**: Ionian (major)

Even though the progression starts and ends on Gdim (viiÂ°), the chord **Ab/G** appears and functions as **I6**, and the overall harmonic context centers around **Aâ™­**.

Additionally, **Eb/G (V)** and **Db (IV)** confirm the key.

ðŸ‘‰ Final Answer:  
**Key: Aâ™­ major**  
**Mode: Ionian**
