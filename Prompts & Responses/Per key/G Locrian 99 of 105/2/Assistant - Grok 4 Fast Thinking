### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Determined Key: **Ab Major**
- **Scale/Chords in Key**: Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G (Ionian mode). Diatonic chords include:
  - I: Ab major
  - ii: Bb minor
  - iii: C minor
  - IV: Db major
  - V: Eb major
  - vi: F minor
  - vii°: G diminished
- **Why This Key?**
  - All chords in the progression (Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F) are diatonic to Ab major:
    - Gdim = vii° (common leading-tone chord resolving toward I/Ab).
    - Eb/G = VI (Eb major in first inversion; the G bass reinforces the leading tone).
    - Bbm/F = ii (Bb minor with F as the 5th in the bass—functions as a passing or pre-dominant chord).
    - Ab/G = I (Ab major with G bass, creating tension as a "dominant" feel via the G leading tone).
    - Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 (Db major 7th with F as the 3rd in the bass, providing subdominant color).
  - The progression is highly repetitive and centers on G in the bass (the leading tone/7th scale degree), creating strong pull toward Ab as the tonic. This is a classic setup for resolution to Ab major (e.g., Gdim or Eb/G → Ab).
  - No chromatic notes or alterations outside Ab major's palette; everything fits without accidentals.
  - The explicit use of Ab major (as Ab/G) and Eb major (VI, but functioning as V in some contexts) strongly implies Ab as tonic, rather than a relative minor.

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major)**
- **Why Ionian?**
  - The chords emphasize major triads (Ab, Eb, Db) and the natural minor ii (Bbm), with no flattened 3rd, 6th, or 7th on the tonic to suggest minor modes (e.g., Aeolian/natural minor or Dorian).
  - Gdim acts as a leading-tone diminished chord (raised 7th), which is characteristic of major keys resolving to I, not the lowered 7th typical in harmonic/phrygian minor.
  - Overall harmonic function: Pre-dominant (IV, ii) → Dominant/Leading-Tone (Gdim, Eb/G with G bass) → Tonic (Ab/G). This is pure major-key syntax, with no modal mixture or borrowing from parallel minor.
  - Relative minor (F Aeolian) is possible theoretically (shares the same chords), but the explicit Ab major chord and G-leading-tone emphasis tilt it firmly toward major/Ionian. An F-minor reading would feel forced without F-minor resolution or minor tonic emphasis.

#### Progression Breakdown and Function
- **Bass Line**: Mostly static on G (leading tone), with brief shifts to F (6th scale degree, adding subdominant flavor). This creates a hypnotic, tense vamp likely resolving to Ab.
  - Gdim (vii°) → Eb/G (VI⁶, leading via G) → Bbm/F (ii⁶₅) → Ab/G (I⁶) → Dbmaj7/F (IV⁶) → Gdim (back to vii°).
- **Style/Context**: This has a jazz/R&B feel (e.g., diminished vamps, inverted chords, maj7). It could loop indefinitely or resolve to Ab. Reminiscent of standards like "Autumn Leaves" (in relative keys) or modern ballads using leading-tone ostinatos.
- **Potential Resolution**: The final Gdim screams for an Ab major arrival. If this is part of a larger piece, confirm by checking if it lands on Ab.

If you provide more context (e.g., melody, full song, or resolution), I can refine this further!
