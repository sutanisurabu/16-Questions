**Analyzing chords for key and mode**

I need to figure out the key and mode for the chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

First, I'll break down the chords—Gdim suggests a fully diminished triad, while Eb/G, Bbm/F, and Ab/G represent different triads with specific bass notes. The pattern repeats with Gdim leading into Eb and follows with Bbm/F and Ab/G. Then it closes with Dbmaj7/F, so I'm focusing on finding the overall key and mode.**Collecting pitch classes**

I’m collecting pitch classes from the chord progression. From Gdim, I get G, Bb, and Db. For Eb/G, I have Eb, G, and Bb. In Bbm/F, the pitches are Bb, Db, and F. Then from Ab/G, I gather Ab, C, Eb, plus the G bass, which could suggest a nonchord tone or a chromatic note. Lastly, from Dbmaj7/F, I have Db, F, Ab, and C with F bass.

So, compiling these, I end up with the set {G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C}. This collection forms a lot of familiar notes, but wait—I notice we’re missing D, and this is pointing toward C natural minor or Aeolian scale. I realize the major notes align with C natural minor but confirm A and B are absent. All checks out!**Exploring the role of Db**

I’m looking at the note Db and its relevance. In C natural minor, Db serves as the flat 2 (Neapolitan), while in Eb major, it's the flattened sixth scale degree. The Eb major scale contains D natural, meaning Db conflicts with it. However, Db also doesn’t appear in the natural C minor scale, which consists of C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

But I noted Db from Gdim, Bbm/F, and Dbmaj7. This suggests a key where Db is diatonic, leading me to check Ab major. The Ab major scale includes all necessary pitches: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, and G. So, it fits nicely!**Confirming the key as Ab major**

I’ve identified the pitch-class set {G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C}, which matches the Ab major scale (Ionian). So, the key is indeed Ab major!

Next, I’ll check how the progression aligns with Ab major. Gdim serves as the vii° diminished triad, built on the leading tone, G-natural. That fits perfectly! 

Then there's Eb/G, which is the V chord in first inversion—Eb major fits in the progression well. Lastly, Bbm/F suggests the ii chord (supertonic) and looks like it’s in second inversion, since F is the fifth in the bass. Everything checks out!**Summarizing key and mode**

I’ve determined that Ab/G functions as a nonchord bass, while also acting like I over the leading tone bass. It's more of a passing tone rather than a standard diatonic movement. The progression generally fits within the Ab major diatonic set. I conclude that the key is Ab major and the mode is Ionian.

For a succinct answer, I could say: Key: Ab major, Mode: Ionian. Additionally, I can label the functional roles of the chords: Gdim = vii°, Eb/G = V6, Bbm/F = ii6/4, and Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/3.

Key: Ab major
Mode: Ionian

Why: All chords are diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6/4
- Ab/G ≈ I over leading-tone bass (passing sonority)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/3
