Let’s analyze what we have.  

**Chord sequence:**
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F  Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

### Step 1. Identify chord tones

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db  
- **Eb/G** = Eb–G–Bb  
- **Bbm/F** = Bb–Db–F  
- **Ab/G** = Ab–C–Eb–G  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C

### Step 2. Look for the scale relationships

These notes come from mostly **Db major / Bb minor family**:

Db major scale: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C  
Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab  

The relevant chord components are all found within Db major / Bb minor **except perhaps the Ab/G**, which adds a G natural (giving a Lydian flavor: Db Lydian = notes of Ab major => Ab Bb C Db Eb F G).  

So the presence of **G natural** repeatedly (in Eb/G, Gdim itself, and Ab/G) points toward **Db Lydian** or its relative **Ab Ionian** (same notes).

### Step 3. Potential tonal centers

- **Gdim** (G–Bb–Db) has two tendency tones (Bb–Db) that resolve nicely into **Db major** or **Bb minor**.  
- The motion **Gdim ➝ Eb/G** makes sense as vii°/Db ➝ I6 in **Db**.
- **Eb/G** is the first inversion of the VI chord in **G minor**, but that would not fit Bbm and Dbmaj7 later.  
- **Bbm** and **Dbmaj7** both belong to **Db major** (ii and I, respectively).

Given that **Dbmaj7** appears toward the end and everything seems to gravitate around Db‑type sonorities, **Db** is our tonic.

### Step 4. Determine the mode

We also see the frequent use of **G natural**, which is the raised 6th in **Db** (Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab–Bb–C normally, but here we get a G♮ instead of Gb). That indicates **Lydian** mode on Db (Db Lydian has G♮ as #4).

So:  
**Db Lydian** includes Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C.  
All main chords (Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7) fit there.

✅ **Answer:**

**Key center:** Db  
**Mode:** Lydian (Db Lydian)

**In other words:** The progression sits in *Db Lydian*, with Db as tonic.
