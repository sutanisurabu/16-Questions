Let’s break this down step by step.

## **1. Identify the chords**

The progression is:

```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F  Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

- **Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ (F♭ enharmonic to E) — fully diminished 7th chord.
- **Eb/G** = G Eb G B♭ (Eb major triad over G bass) → Eb major 1st inversion.
- **Bbm/F** = F B♭ D (B♭ minor triad over F bass) → B♭ minor 1st inversion.
- **Ab/G** = G Ab C Eb (Ab major triad over G bass) → Ab major 2nd inversion.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F Db F Ab C (Dbmaj7 chord with F in bass) → Dbmaj7 1st inversion.

## **2. Look for functional relationships**

**Gdim7** is a common-tone diminished chord or passing diminished chord.  
In terms of function, Gdim7 = B♭dim7 = D♭dim7 = F♭(E)dim7 — it’s symmetric.

Let’s see where each resolves:

- **Gdim → Eb/G**  
Gdim = G B♭ D♭ F♭(E)  
Eb = E♭ G B♭  
Gdim and Eb share G and B♭, so Gdim acts like a common-tone diminished of Eb.

- **Gdim → Bbm/F**  
Gdim to Bbm: Gdim = G B♭ D♭ E; Bbm = B♭ D♭ F — shares B♭ and D♭, moves E → F (half step).  
So Gdim here is like vii°7 of B♭m (harmonic minor? B♭ harmonic minor: A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F♭ G? No, E natural is in Gdim, so maybe B♭ melodic minor? Actually B♭ harmonic minor has A♭ and E♭, not E natural. So Gdim is not diatonic to B♭ minor.)

Actually: Gdim7 = G B♭ D♭ E  
B♭ harmonic minor = B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ — no E natural.  
So Gdim7 is not from B♭ harmonic minor.  
But Gdim7 = B♭ D♭ E G — enharmonically, that’s the same as B♭ D♭ F♭(E) A♭? Wait, no — Gdim7 = G B♭ D♭ F♭(E) — yes, F♭ = E.  
So it’s the same as E dim7 = E G B♭ D♭.  
So it’s vii°7 of F minor (F harmonic minor: E dim7).  
But here it goes to B♭m — not Fm. So maybe it’s a common-tone diminished of B♭m? Possibly.

## **3. Try to find a tonal center**

Look at the bass line:  
G G Eb Eb G G F G G G Eb Eb G G F G

Bass emphasizes G and F, with Eb.

The progression ends on **Dbmaj7/F → Gdim**.  
Dbmaj7 = D♭ F A♭ C.  
That’s IVmaj7 in A♭ major.  
But Gdim doesn’t fit A♭ major diatonically — Gdim has G B♭ D♭ E — in A♭ major, G is ♭7, B♭ is 2, D♭ is 4, E is ♯5 — not in A♭ major scale.  
But Gdim could be a secondary leading-tone chord to A♭ (vii°7 of A♭).

## **4. Check key possibilities**

Let’s test **E♭ major**:  
Eb = I  
Bbm = v  
Ab = IV  
Gdim = ? — not diatonic.  
Dbmaj7 = ♭VIImaj7 — not in Eb major (Dbmaj7 in Eb would be C♭maj7, no).  
So not Eb major.

Test **A♭ major**:  
Eb = V  
Bbm = ii  
Ab = I  
Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7 — yes, fits.  
Gdim = ? — not in Ab major but could be chromatic diminished.

So likely **key of A♭ major**.

## **5. Mode**

If the tonal center is A♭, and all chords fit A♭ major except Gdim (which is a common diminished chord for voice leading), then the mode is **A♭ Ionian (major)**.

---

## **6. Functional analysis in A♭ major**

- Gdim → Eb/G: Gdim is common-tone diminished of Eb (V).  
- Gdim → Bbm/F: Gdim is common-tone diminished of Bbm (ii).  
- Gdim → Ab/G: Gdim is common-tone diminished of Ab (I).  
- Dbmaj7/F → Gdim: Dbmaj7 is IVmaj7, Gdim is leading to ? Possibly back to Ab, but here it ends on Gdim — maybe it’s a final deceptive cadence IV → vii° (no resolution).

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{Ab\ major}
\]
Key: **A♭ major**, mode: **Ionian**.
