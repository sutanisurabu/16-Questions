Based on the chord progression provided:

**Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Dbmaj7/F - Gdim**

We can analyze the harmonic movement:

1.  **High Frequency of Gdim:** The chord that appears most prominently is **G diminished (G-Bb-Db)**. This chord often functions as a secondary dominant (like vii°/ii, vii°/iii, etc.) or a passing chord, but its overwhelming presence suggests it might be defining the tonic or operating in a heavily chromatic or non-functional environment.
2.  **Focus Chords:** The resolution or momentary stability tends to be around the chords containing the pitch class $E\flat$/$D\sharp$, such as $E\flat/G$ and $D\flat maj7/F$.
    *   $E\flat/G$ is an inversion of $E\flat$ major ($E\flat-G-B\flat$).
    *   $D\flat maj7/F$ is an inversion of $D\flat$ major ($D\flat-F-A\flat-C$).
    *   $B\flat m/F$ ($B\flat-D\flat-F$) is the tonic minor chord relative to the $D\flat$ and $E\flat$ areas (it is the subdominant minor of $F$ major or ii of $A\flat$).
3.  **Core Pitch Analysis:**
    *   The **Gdim** (G-Bb-Db) heavily implies a pull towards $A\flat$ or $F$. (G diminished is vii° of $A\flat$ or $ii^{\circ}$ of $F$ harmonic minor).
    *   The key stabilizing chords are centered around $D\flat$, $E\flat$, and $B\flat$.
    *   The most common common tone shared by the major-based chords ($E\flat$, $D\flat$, $B\flat m$) is $D\flat/C\sharp$.

**Hypothesis 1: $A\flat$ Major or $F$ Minor**
Gdim is the $vii^{\circ}$ of $A\flat$ (or $i^{\circ}$ of $A\flat$ harmonic minor).
*   In $A\flat$ major: $E\flat/G$ is $V/iii$ ($\approx V/V$). $D\flat maj7/F$ is $IV$. $B\flat m/F$ is $ii$. This progression makes $A\flat$ plausible, but the constant return to the Gdim (a chromatic chord) suggests something more unstable.

**Hypothesis 2: $D\flat$ Major**
*   $D\flat maj7/F$ is $I$.
*   $Gdim$ is not diatonic.
*   $E\flat/G$ is $ii/V$ (functionally V of $\text{Ab}$).
*   $B\flat m/F$ is $vi$.
This makes $D\flat$ feel like a temporary arrival point, but the overall structure is not classically derived from $D\flat$.

**The Role of the Diminished Chord:**
In many Romantic or highly chromatic pieces (such as those by Schubert, Chopin, or Russian composers often associated with music analysis of this type), a prominent diminished chord (like Gdim) is often treated as the chord built on the **leading tone** of the prevailing key, even if the resolutions are not always perfect.

If Gdim (G-Bb-Db) is $vii^{\circ}$:
*   It resolves to $A\flat$. (Key: $A\flat$ Major/Minor)
*   It resolves to $C\flat$. (Key: $C\flat$ Major/Minor)
*   It resolves to $E\flat\flat$. (Key: $E\flat\flat$ Major/Minor)

Given that the progression heavily utilizes $E\flat$ and $D\flat$ (chords $V$ and $IV$ of $A\flat$), **$A\flat$ major** is the most functionally sound key center.

The mode is generally **Major**, derived from the usage of $E\flat$ major ($V$) and $D\flat$ major ($IV$).

### Conclusion

The primary harmonic axis is dictated by the relationship between the diminished chord (Gdim) and the stable chords ($D\flat$, $E\flat$). The G diminished chord is the universally recognized leading-tone diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone (G) of **$A\flat$ Major.**

The progression strongly suggests a prolonged dominant function (or dominant preparation) in the key of *A-flat*.

**Key and Mode:** **A-flat Major**

*(Note: Although the progression might not perfectly cadence on $A\flat$, the consistent use of the dominant function (Gdim and $E\flat/G$) and the subdominant ($D\flat maj7/F$) strongly points to $A\flat$ as the tonal center.)*
