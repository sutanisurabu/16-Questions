**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to figure out the key and mode from a chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

There are many G diminished chords and slash chords like Eb/G and Ab/G, with bass notes often being G or F. When breaking it down, I see that the most common chords are Gdim, Eb major, Bbm, and Ab major, all contributing to a central tonal focus around G and F.**Identifying scale and key center**

I’m looking at a scale or key that includes pitches from the chord progression. The notes I see are G, Bb, Db (from Gdim), Eb, and those in the slash chords. When I put them together, I have {G, Bb, Db, Eb, Ab, C, F}. This gives me seven distinct notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, and Bb, which matches the C Phrygian mode. So, it looks like the key center is C with a Phrygian mode. But does it imply C as the tonic?**Analyzing bass and tonic chords**

While observing the bass notes, I note that G and F are more prominent rather than C. The chord Eb/G suggests a C minor 6, but its function isn't typical for C minor. Still, this leads me to see a collection that fits C Phrygian well. If that’s the case, the tonic chords would align as follows: i = Cm, bII = Db, bIII = Eb, etc. The fifth chord is indeed diminished, confirming my thoughts on how these chords interact!**Clarifying chord inversions**

All the observed chords seem to fit together nicely. Gdim is the v° chord, and Eb/G, which is an Eb major triad with G in the bass, represents bIII in first inversion, since it shows G as the lowest note. Ab/G serves as bVI, while Bbm/F functions as bVII minor in second inversion, placing F in the bass. Lastly, Dbmaj7/F is bIImaj7 in first inversion, also showing F as the bass note. Everything lines up well!**Determining key and mode**

I've analyzed the chords: Gdim (v°), Eb/G (bIII6), Bbm/F (bVII 6/4), and Ab/G (bVI). While these fit into C Phrygian, they also suggest a connection to Ab major. The progression revolves around dominant preparation, with G in the bass often indicating a leading tone. I see two interpretations: tonic C for C Phrygian or Ab major with functional chords like ii, IVmaj7, and V6. Given the key signature of Ab major, I'd conclude to provide both interpretations for clarity. The pitch collection matches C Phrygian as well.**Finalizing key and mode analysis**

The harmony seems to fit neatly within Gdim (v° in C Phrygian or vii° in Ab) and others like Eb/G (bIII6 in C Phrygian or V6 in Ab). The progression centers around G, which leads me to suggest Ab major is the likely key instead of C Phrygian. While the mode asks for a singular focus, I’d state: "Key signature: Ab major; Mode: C Phrygian," acknowledging both perspectives. Ultimately, I conclude with: "C Phrygian, diatonic to Ab major."

C Phrygian (parent key: Ab major). The pitch collection is C–Db–Eb–F–G–Ab–Bb, and all chords are diatonic to Ab major/C Phrygian.
