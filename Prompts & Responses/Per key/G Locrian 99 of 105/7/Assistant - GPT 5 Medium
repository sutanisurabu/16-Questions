### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to analyze the given chord progression, which consists of various chords like Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, and others. The first step is determining the key and mode, as well as parsing the chords. 

I notice an interesting alternation between Gdim and Eb/G, where their pitch sets share some tones but differ by a semitone. G and Bb are consistent, while the third tone toggles between Db and Eb. This creates a unique flavor in the progression!**Exploring pitch collection**

I’m noticing a motion between Db and Eb while holding G and Bb. This could suggest we're in an Eb key context. When I gather the pitch collection across all the chords, I see that G and Bb appear frequently. Other tones include Db, Eb, F, Ab, and C. There’s no D natural, E natural, or A natural, which gives us a set of notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

It fits the C natural minor scale, suggesting we might be in C minor, especially with chords like Eb major and Gdim!**Clarifying triad relationships**

I’m considering that in C minor, Gdim functions as the leading-tone triad to Ab. But actually, the leading tone to Ab should be G natural since Ab major features it. In C minor, the triads are constructed as follows: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, and Bb. 

Gdim isn’t diatonic because it includes Db, which I mistakenly thought was part of C natural minor, but C minor actually features D natural instead! My pitch collection included Db, which is where my confusion lies.**Identifying modal context**

I’m realizing that the chord progression isn’t C natural minor; it’s actually likely C Phrygian, which consists of C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, and Bb—matching perfectly with what I saw! In C Phrygian, the triads include Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, and Gdim, confirming Gdim as v° in this context.

Eb/G serves as the bIII in first inversion, while Bbm/F is the bVII minor in first inversion. Now for Ab/G: it’s not exactly diatonic since G isn’t part of the Ab major triad, but it feels like a passing note, creating an interesting sound.**Determining key and mode**

I’m diving into the chord structure. It seems that Abmaj7 over G includes G natural, which fits in C Phrygian since it has that note. This gives us an Abmaj7/G slash chord, showing an interesting relationship with C Phrygian scale degrees. I notice that Abmaj7 and Dbmaj7 effortlessly fit into C Phrygian, which makes them diatonic. 

But I also consider whether the piece could be in Ab major. As I analyze the back-and-forth between chords, I realize it’s plausible that both interpretations could work, depending on the tonic context. Ultimately, the presence of G in the bass clues me into a leading-tone pedal leading towards Ab major!**Determining key and mode**

I'm analyzing the progression to see how these chords function. Eb/G serves as a V6 chord, while Gdim acts as a leading tone diminished chord in Ab major, enriching the tonal structure around it. 

Given the harmonic functions—Gdim as vii°, Bbm as ii, Eb as V, and Dbmaj7 as IVmaj7—it seems clear that the key is Ab major, with Ionian as the mode. While C Phrygian could be another interpretation, the presence of Bbm suggests Ab major is more plausible. 

So, I'll state:
- Key: Ab major
- Mode: Ionian

All chords are diatonic to Ab major, with G acting as a leading-tone pedal!

Ab major (Ionian)

Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G = I (with leading-tone bass, effectively Abmaj7/G)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/6

The frequent G bass is a leading-tone (7) pedal. Equivalently, the same pitch set is C Phrygian, but the functional reading points to Ab Ionian.
