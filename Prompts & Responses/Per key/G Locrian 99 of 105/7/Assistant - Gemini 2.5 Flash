The chord progression is:

$$ \text{Gdim} - \text{Gdim} - \text{Eb/G} - \text{Eb/G} - \text{Gdim} - \text{Gdim} - \text{Bbm/F} - \text{Ab/G} - \text{Gdim} - \text{Gdim} - \text{Eb/G} - \text{Eb/G} - \text{Gdim} - \text{Gdim} - \text{Dbmaj7/F} - \text{Gdim} $$

To determine the key and mode, let's analyze the constituent chords and look for common tonal centers or characteristic progressions.

### Chord Analysis

1.  **Gdim:** (G - Bb - Db) - Functions as an altered $\text{V}$ (like $\text{VII}^{\circ}$) or a $\text{VII}^{\circ}$ chord if the root is raised (e.g., $\text{F}^{\sharp}\text{dim}$ in G minor, or $\text{G}^{\circ}$ in $\text{Ab}$ minor/major).
2.  **Eb/G:** (G - Bb - Eb) - An inversion of $\text{Eb}$ major.
3.  **Bbm/F:** (F - Bb - Db) - An inversion of $\text{Bb}$ minor.
4.  **Ab/G:** (G - C - Eb - Ab) - A complex sound, likely an $\text{Ab}$ major triad over a $\text{G}$ bass. If simplified, $\text{Ab}$ major.
5.  **Dbmaj7/F:** (F - Ab - C - Db) - An inversion of $\text{Db}$ major $7$, often serving as the $\text{IV}$ in $\text{Ab}$ major/minor.

### Identifying Potential Tonal Centers

Let's list all notes present: G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C.

The notes used are: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F.
This scale is characteristic of **Ab Harmonic Minor** (Ab, Bb, Cb [replaced by B], Db, Eb, Fb [replaced by E], G) or **G Phrygian Dominant** (G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F) or **G Locrian** (G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F).

Given the consistent chords, let's test major/minor keys where these chords make sense:

#### 1. Ab Major / F Minor

*   **Ab Major Key (Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G):**
    *   $\text{Gdim}$ (G - Bb - Db) - This is $\text{VII}^{\circ}$. Very common.
    *   $\text{Eb/G}$ - $\text{V}$ chord, stable.
    *   $\text{Bbm/F}$ - $\text{II}$ minor chord.
    *   $\text{Ab/G}$ - $\text{I}$ chord over the $\text{VII}$ scale degree bass.
    *   $\text{Dbmaj7/F}$ - $\text{IV}$ major 7 chord.
    *   **Conclusion:** All chords fit perfectly within Ab Major, and the prominent use of $\text{Gdim}$ strongly reinforces Ab as the goal, often leading back to the tonic.

#### 2. G Minor (G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F)

*   **G Harm. Minor:** (G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F#) - Does not fit Db, Eb, Ab.
*   **G Natural Minor:** (G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F) - Does not fit Db (the tritone root).

#### 3. Eb Major (Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D)

*   $\text{Eb/G}$ ($\text{I}$ inversion) - Fits.
*   $\text{Gdim}$ ($\text{III}^{\circ}$ in Ab major harmony) - Does not fit Ab, V degree is Bb, $\text{VII}^{\circ}$ is D. G dim is alien.
*   $\text{Bbm}$ ($\text{VIm}$ in Db Major) - Alien.
*   $\text{Dbmaj7}$ ($\text{VI}$) - Alien.

### Determining the Key and Mode

The progression is structurally defined by the strong relationship between the dominant function chord ($\text{Gdim}$ or $\text{Eb/G}$) and the tonic function in **Ab Major**.

*   The root movement from $\text{G}$ (the strong tendency tone) back to $\text{Eb}$ or resolving eventually to $\text{Ab}$ is the core harmonic motion.
*   The overwhelming presence of diatonic $\text{Ab}$ major chords ($\text{Eb}$, $\text{Bbm}$, $\text{Dbmaj7}$) confirms this key center.
*   The frequent use of $\text{Gdim}$ (the $\text{VII}^{\circ}$ chord in $\text{Ab}$ major) strengthens the resolution to $\text{Ab}$.

While the progression doesn't end on Ab, the harmonic environment is clearly centered around **Ab Major**. The repetition of $\text{Gdim}$ creates a sense of continuous tension and propulsion toward the tonic, even if the progression keeps returning to the unstable dominant area.

### Final Answer

**Key:** Ab (A-flat)
**Mode:** Major

(The progression is strongly diatonic to Ab Major, utilizing the $\text{VII}^{\circ}$ chord for intensity.)
