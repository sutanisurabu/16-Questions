Let’s break this down step by step.  

---

**1. List the chords with their implied roots and qualities**

- **Gdim** = G diminished triad (G B♭ D♭) — symmetrical, so could be G° or E♭° or B° etc.  
- **E♭/G** = E♭ major triad with G in bass (E♭ G B♭) — so E♭ major chord.  
- **B♭m/F** = B♭ minor triad with F bass (B♭ D♭ F) — so B♭ minor chord.  
- **A♭/G** = A♭ major triad with G bass (A♭ C E♭) — so A♭ major chord.  
- **D♭maj7/F** = D♭ major 7th with F bass (D♭ F A♭ C) — so D♭maj7 chord.

**2. Look for a tonal center**

The progression is:

Gdim – E♭/G – Gdim – B♭m/F – A♭/G – Gdim – E♭/G – Gdim – D♭maj7/F – Gdim

Notice Gdim is a recurring chord — diminished chords often function as passing chords or leading-tone chords.  
Gdim = G B♭ D♭ = same as B♭°7 without the 7th? Actually Gdim triad = G B♭ D♭ = enharmonically same notes as B♭ D♭ F♭(E) — but here it’s just the triad, so it’s symmetrical diminished.

---

**3. Try fitting into a key**

Let’s see the other chords:  
E♭ major (E♭ G B♭)  
B♭ minor (B♭ D♭ F)  
A♭ major (A♭ C E♭)  
D♭maj7 (D♭ F A♭ C)  

These are all diatonic to **E♭ major** except B♭ minor.  
E♭ major scale: E♭ F G A♭ B♭ C D  
Diatonic chords:  
I=E♭, ii=Fm, iii=Gm, IV=A♭, V=B♭, vi=Cm, vii°=Ddim.

B♭ minor has D♭ (C#) — not in E♭ major (which has D natural).  
So B♭ minor suggests a borrowed chord or key change.

---

**4. Check C minor / E♭ major relative**

C natural minor: C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭  
Harmonic minor: C D E♭ F G A♭ B  
Chords in C harmonic minor:  
i=Cm, ii°=Ddim, III+=E♭+, iv=Fm, V=G, VI=A♭, vii°=Bdim.

Gdim is not in C natural minor (G B♭ D♭) — D♭ is not in C minor scale.  
But Gdim = G B♭ D♭ = same as B♭ D♭ F♭(E) — that’s actually the vii°7 of A♭ minor? Let’s check:  
A♭ harmonic minor: A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F♭ G — Gdim fits? No, G is not in A♭ harmonic minor.

---

**5. Try key of D♭ major**

D♭ major scale: D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭ C  
Chords:  
I=D♭, ii=E♭m, iii=Fm, IV=G♭, V=A♭, vi=B♭m, vii°=Cdim.

We have:  
E♭ major (not E♭m) — so not diatonic.  
B♭m is vi in D♭ major — yes.  
A♭ is V in D♭ major — yes.  
D♭maj7 is I — yes.  
Gdim? G B♭ D♭ — G is not in D♭ major (has G♭). So Gdim is the odd one.

---

**6. Function of Gdim**

Gdim = G B♭ D♭.  
In D♭ major, Gdim could be a passing diminished chord between something.  
Gdim → A♭ (V) works: Gdim has D♭ (common tone with D♭ chord) and B♭ (9th of A♭?) — actually Gdim shares B♭ and D♭ with D♭maj7, and G is a chromatic approach to G♭ or A♭.  

Also Gdim = same notes as B♭dim7 without F♭? Actually B♭dim7 = B♭ D♭ F♭ A♭♭(G) — yes, G is in B♭dim7. So Gdim triad is part of B♭dim7, which is vii°7 of C minor.  

But here, Gdim often goes to E♭/G — E♭ major chord.  
Gdim and E♭/G share B♭ and G (G is bass in both). So maybe it’s just a chromatic bass line with G pedal.

---

**7. Bass line**

Bass: G – G – G – F – G – G – G – G – F – G  
So bass is mostly G, with two F’s (under B♭m and D♭maj7).  

So maybe the key is **C minor** with a G pedal?  
In C minor:  
E♭ = III  
B♭m = ? B♭ D♭ F — not in C natural minor, but in C harmonic minor? No, C harmonic minor has B natural.  
B♭ D♭ F = B♭ diminished triad? Wait B♭ D♭ F is B♭ minor — yes.  
B♭ minor in C minor context is rare — maybe it’s a borrowed chord from C Phrygian (B♭m = ♭ii).  

---

**8. Likely key: C minor**  

Chords in C minor:  
Gdim is not diatonic but could be a secondary leading-tone chord of A♭ (Gdim = vii° of A♭).  
E♭ is III in C minor.  
B♭m is borrowed from C Phrygian (♭II chord in first inversion).  
A♭ is VI in C minor.  
D♭maj7 is ♭IImaj7 — Neapolitan chord in first inversion.  

So:  
Gdim (secondary vii° of A♭) → E♭ → Gdim → B♭m (borrowed) → A♭ → Gdim → E♭ → Gdim → D♭maj7 (N) → Gdim.  

This fits: The key is **C minor** (Aeolian or possibly harmonic minor mixture), with heavy use of Gdim as a secondary diminished chord and Neapolitan (D♭maj7).

---

**9. Final answer**

Key: **C minor**  
Mode: **Minor** (Aeolian/Harmonic minor mixture due to D♭maj7 and B♭m borrowed from Phrygian)
