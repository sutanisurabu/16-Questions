### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. 

Hmm, this looks tricky. Let me start by analyzing each chord individually. Gdim is a diminished chord, which is G-Bb-Db. Eb/G is an Eb minor chord with G in the bass, so that's Eb-G-Bb, but since G is bass, it's first inversion. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb minor with F bass, so Bb-Db-F with F as bass. Ab/G is Ab minor with G bass? Wait, Ab minor would be Ab-Cb-Eb, but that's odd. Actually, Ab/G is probably Ab minor with G in bass, but that might not be standard. Let me think.

Wait, Ab minor isn't common. Maybe it's G major? No, Ab/G would be Ab with G bass, so the notes are G, Ab, Cb, Eb? That seems messy. Perhaps it's a slash chord, so the bass note is G, and the chord above is Ab. So Ab major chord with G bass? But Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so Ab major with G bass would be G-Ab-C-Eb. That's an Abmaj7? No, Abmaj7 is Ab-C-Eb-G, but with G in bass, it would be G-Ab-C-Eb, which is actually G minor 7 flat 5? Wait, G minor 7 flat 5 is G-Bb-Db-F, which is different. 

This is confusing. Maybe I should write out all notes. Let's list each chord:

1. Gdim: G-Bb-Db
2. Gdim: same
3. Eb/G: Bass G, so Eb, G, Bb — but with G bass, so the chord is Eb minor? Because Eb minor is Eb-G-Bb, yes. So Eb minor in first inversion (G is bass).
4. Eb/G: same
5. Gdim: G-Bb-Db
6. Gdim: same
7. Bbm/F: Bass F, so Bb minor chord is Bb-Db-F, so with F bass, it's F-Bb-Db — which is F minor? No, Bb minor is Bb-Db-Ab? Wait, no. Bb minor chord is Bb, Db, F. Yes, so Bbm is Bb-Db-F. Therefore Bbm/F is F-Bb-Db, which is F with Bb and Db, so that's a Db major? No, F-Bb-Db is F minor? Wait, F minor is F-Ab-C. That doesn't match. Wait, Bbm chord is Bb-Db-F. So when you put F in bass, it's F, Bb, Db. That's the same as Db major seventh? No, Db major is Db-F-Ab. But Db major with Bb would be Db major seventh, but Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C, which isn't the case here. 

Wait, Bbm/F: Bb minor chord with F as bass. So the notes are F (bass), then Bb, Db. So F, Bb, Db. What chord is that? F-Bb-Db. Bb is the fifth of F, and Db is minor sixth above F. So it's F minor? No, F minor is F-Ab-C. This has Db, which is a minor third above Bb? I'm getting mixed up. Let's think of intervals from bass F. F to Bb is perfect fourth, F to Db is diminished fifth? Because Db is the same as C#, so F to C# is augmented fourth? Wait, F to Db is a minor sixth? Because F to D natural is minor sixth, so Db is minor sixth flat? No. Let's count intervals.

F to Eb would be minor seventh, but Db? F to Db is a minor sixth? Because F to D is minor sixth, Db is minor sixth flat? So minor sixth minus half step? That might be a tritone or something. Let's list the notes: F, Bb, Db. F, Bb, and Db. So the chord has F, Bb, Ab? Wait, no. Db is D flat, which is enharmonic to C#. So F, Bb, C#. That's F, Bb, C#. So F minor major seventh? No. F minor is F-Ab-C. This chord is F-Bb-Db, which is F, Bb, Db. So from F, it's root, perfect fourth, diminished fifth? That's a diminished triad? But F diminished would be F-Ab-Cb (or B), not F-Bb-Db. Wait, F diminished is F-Ab-Cb. But here it's F-Bb-Db. So F, Bb, Db. That's actually the same as Bb half-diminished? F is the fifth of Bb, Bb root, Db is minor third. So Bb half-diminished (Bb-Db-F-Ab?), but with F bass, it's F-Bb-Db, which is Bb half-diminished in second inversion. So Bbm7(b5)/F. But usually, it's written as Bb half-diminished, but the chord symbol might be Bbm7(b5) or Bø7.

But the user wrote Bbm/F, which implies Bb minor chord with F bass. But Bb minor chord is Bb-Db-F, so yes, with F bass, it's F-Bb-Db. So the chord is F, Bb, Db. So the notes are F, Bb, Db. That's a diminished chord? Because F to Db is a diminished fifth (F to G# to A to Bb? No, F to Db is 6 half-steps: F to F# (1), G (2), G# (3), A (4), A# (5), Bb (6), Cb (7), Db? Wait, F to Db is six half steps. F to G is two, G to Ab is 3, etc. Let me count properly.

F to F#: 1
F to G: 2
F to G#: 3
F to A: 4
F to A#: 5
F to Bb: 6
F to B: 7
F to C: 8
F to Db: 6? Wait, Db is the same as C#. F to C# is six half steps. Yes. So F to C# is augmented fourth, which is also a tritone. And F to Bb is perfect fourth? Wait, F to Bb is 5 half steps? Let's see:

F to F#: 1
F to G: 2
F to G#: 3
F to A: 4
F to Bb: 5. Yes, so perfect fourth.

F to Db (C#): since Db is 6 half steps above F. So F to C# is an augmented fourth. So the notes F, Bb, C# (Db). So F-Bb-C#. But Bb to C# is major third? Bb to D is major third, but C# is Bb to D minus a half step? So Bb to C# is major second? No. Bb to C is minor second, then C to C# is half step, so Bb to C# is minor third? Wait, Bb to C# is: Bb to B (1), B to C (2), C to C# (3). So three half steps, which is minor third. So F, Bb, C# — the intervals from F: root, fourth, and augmented fourth? That doesn't make sense. Let's see the distances between the pitches.

F to Bb: perfect fourth (5 semitones)
F to Db: 6 semitones (tritone)
Bb to Db: 3 semitones (minor third)
So the chord is F, Bb, Db — which forms a diminished triad? Because all adjacent intervals are minor thirds: F to Bb is 5 semitones (which is not minor third; minor third is 3). Wait, minor third is 3 semitones. So F to Ab is minor third (3 semitones), but here it's F to Bb which is 5 semitones (perfect fourth), which is not a minor third. So the chord F, Bb, Db has intervals F-Bb (5), Bb-Db (3), Db-F (6? No, from Db to F is 4 semitones: Db to D (1), D to D# (2), D# to E (3), E to F (4), so 4 semitones, which is major third. So the intervals are minor third between Bb-Db, then major third between Db-F (4 semitones), so F to Db is a diminished fifth (6 semitones). So F to Db is diminished fifth, Bb to Db minor third, F to Bb perfect fourth. So the chord is F diminished? No, F diminished is F-Ab-Cb. This is F-Bb-Db. That's actually equivalent to the Bb minor 7 flat 5 chord? Because Bb minor 7 flat 5 is Bb-Db-F-Ab. But here it's F-Bb-Db, so missing the Ab, so Bb half-diminished in second inversion? Yes.

But maybe it's better to think of it as a Bbm7(b5)/F. But perhaps the key context will help. Let's look at the whole progression.

The chords are:

Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim

First, Gdim is G-Bb-Db. Eb/G is Eb/G — so Eb minor chord with G bass, which is G, Eb, Bb. Since Eb minor chord is Eb-G-Bb, so the notes are G (bass), Eb, Bb. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb minor chord with F bass — Bb minor is Bb-Db-F, so F (bass), Bb, Db. Ab/G is Ab minor chord with G bass? But Ab minor would be Ab-Cb-Eb, which is unusual. Alternatively, maybe Ab major with G bass? Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so with G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb. That's G minor seventh flat five? Because G minor seventh flat five is G-Bb-Db-F, but here it's G, Ab, C, Eb. Wait, G to Ab is minor second, Ab to C is major third, C to Eb minor third. So the chord is G, Ab, C, Eb. That would be a G diminished? No, G diminished is G-Bb-Db. This has Ab instead of Bb. So G, Ab, C, Eb — the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. Let's see interval. From G, Ab is minor second, C is major sixth? Not standard. Alternatively, this chord could be Ab minor with G bass. So Ab minor chord (Ab-Cb-Eb), but the bass is G. So the notes would be G, Ab, Cb, Eb. But Cb is same as B. So G, Ab, B, Eb. That's G, Ab, B, Eb. Which is G, Ab, B, Eb. So Ab is minor second above G, B is major third above G, Eb is minor sixth above G. So this chord has G, Ab (minor second), B (major third), Eb (minor sixth). That's a bit unusual. Maybe it's a Db major? Db major is Db-F-Ab. But with G bass: G, Db, F, Ab. So G, Ab, Db, F. Which is the same notes as F-Ab-Db-G. So F, G, Ab, Db. That's a Db major with F, G? That might be part of a Db major scale. Wait, Db major scale is Db-Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb-C. Hmm, but this chord is G, Ab, Db, F. G is not in Db major, since Db major has Gb. If Ab is present, G is not in the scale. So maybe this isn't in Db major.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at the entire progression and see what key it might be in. Let's list all the notes used. Let's take each chord and find the notes.

Starting with Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb (since Eb minor chord with G bass — the chord is Eb minor, so notes Eb, G, Bb. With G bass, it's still those notes)

Bbm/F: Bb minor chord is Bb, Db, F — with F bass, so notes F, Bb, Db

Ab/G: If Ab minor with G bass, but Ab minor would be Ab, Cb, Eb. But Cb is B. So Ab, B, Eb. With G bass: G, Ab, B, Eb. Alternatively, if it's Ab major: Ab, C, Eb. With G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb. So G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: Db major seventh is Db, F, Ab, C. With F bass: F, Db, Ab, C. But Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. So with F bass, notes are F, Db, Ab, C.

So going through all the chords, let's list all notes:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db (three notes)
- Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb (three)
- Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db
- Ab/G: Let's assume Ab major with G bass: G, Ab, C, Eb
- Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C — with F bass, still those notes.

So compiling all unique notes:

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: adds Eb (already have G, Bb; Eb is new)

Bbm/F: adds F (Bb, Db already there)

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb. So Ab and C are new.

Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C — all already listed: Db, F, Ab, C.

So all notes present: G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C.

Let's list all the pitches: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, that's seven notes. Let's see which scale they fit into.

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Let's write them in order.

From low to high: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, but standard scales. Let's check what scale this is.

For example, the C minor scale. C natural minor would be C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! C minor harmonic or melodic might change, but C natural minor has exactly those notes. C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, but in the chord progression, do we have a D? Let's check. In the chords listed: Gdim (G, Bb, Db), Eb/G (Eb, G, Bb), Bbm/F (F, Bb, Db), Ab/G (G, Ab, C, Eb), Dbmaj7/F (Db, F, Ab, C). So the notes present are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. There's no D natural. So in the chord list, are there any D notes? Let's check:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db (Db not D natural)

Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb

Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb — no D

Dbmaj7/F: Db, Eb? No, Db, F, Ab, C — Db is D flat, F is F, Ab, C. So no D natural. So all the notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Which is exactly C natural minor, except that C natural minor has D natural. Wait, C natural minor (Aeolian) is C D Eb F G Ab Bb. But here, there's no D natural — there's Db instead of D. So the scale would have Db instead of D. So that's different.

Wait, C natural minor has D natural. But here, we have Db instead of D. So let's list the notes we have: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. That's like C Phrygian mode? Let's see:

C Phrygian: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb. Yes! Exactly. Because Phrygian mode of the major scale would have a minor second. Let's check. The Phrygian mode is mode 3 of the major scale. But C Phrygian would be C Db Eb F G Ab Bb. Let's confirm.

If you take the major scale starting on Eb: Eb major scale is Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. Then Phrygian mode of Eb major would start on C: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! Because Phrygian is mode 3, starting on the third degree. So the scale of Eb major: Eb (1), F (2), G (3), Ab (4), Bb (5), C (6), D (7). So mode starting on G would be G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F (G Phrygian, mode 5 of Eb major). Wait, maybe I messed up.

Actually, to get C Phrygian, it's the mode of Ab major. Let's see: Ab major scale is Ab Bb C Db Eb F G. Then if you start on C: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb — yes! So the notes of Ab major scale starting on C is C Phrygian. Yes. So if the key is Ab major, then C Phrygian would be the mode. But usually, we refer to the key center.

Alternatively, the scale C Phrygian has the notes C Db Eb F G Ab Bb. Exactly matching what we have in the chords. The chords use C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So no D natural, no E natural.

Now, let's check the chords in context. Let's see the progression:

Gdim — which is C Phrygian chord? Gdim — G as root: in C Phrygian, what is G?

C Phrygian notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So the diatonic chords:

I: Cm (C Eb G)

ii°: Db dim? Wait, Db diminished? Let's see.

Actually, diatonic seventh chords in C Phrygian:

Chord I: Cm7 (C Eb G Bb)

Chord ii°: Dbdim7 (Db F Ab C)

But wait, let's list the triads:

I: C - Eb - G → C minor

ii°: Db - F - Ab → Db diminished

III: Eb minor? Eb - G - Bb? Wait Eb, G, Bb is Eb minor.

IV: F minor? F - Ab - C → yes, F minor

V: G diminished? G - Bb - Db? Yes, Gdim

vi°: Ab diminished? Ab - Cb - Eb? No, in Phrygian, Ab minor? Let's see.

Wait C Phrygian notes:

Root: C

2nd: Db

3rd: Eb

4th: F

5th: G

6th: Ab

7th: Bb

So triads built on each:

C: C-Eb-G → minor

Db: Db-F-Ab → diminished

Eb: Eb-G-Bb → minor? Eb-G-Bb is Eb minor? Wait, Eb to G is major third? No, Eb to G is minor third. Yes, Eb minor chord.

F: F-Ab-C → minor

G: G-Bb-Db → diminished

Ab: Ab-C-Eb → Ab minor? Ab to C is minor third (Ab to Bb is minor second, Bb to C is major second, so Ab-C is minor third). Yes, so Ab minor.

Bb: Bb-Db-F → Bb minor? Bb-Db-F is a triad. Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third, so it's Bb minor.

But in the progression given, we have Gdim, which is G diminished — that's the V chord in C Phrygian. Then Eb/G — Eb minor in first inversion, so Ib in C Phrygian. Eb/G would be Ab minor in root? No, Eb minor chord with G in bass.

Wait, let's check the chords again. The progression has:

Gdim (which is the fifth degree diminished chord in C Phrygian)

Eb/G — that's Eb minor chord with G bass, so Ebmin chord.

Bbm/F — Bb minor chord with F bass. Bb minor chord is diatonic in C Phrygian (Bb minor)

Ab/G — Ab minor with G bass. Ab minor is diatonic.

Dbmaj7/F — Db major 7th with F bass. But in C Phrygian, Db would be ii° diminished chord, not major 7. Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C — which in C Phrygian: the notes Db, F, Ab, C. Which fits. But the chord is Db major 7th? No, Db major 7th would be Db, F, Ab, C. But in C Phrygian, Db is the second degree. So chord on second degree: Db dim7 (Db F Ab C) is a diminished seventh chord. But Dbmaj7 would be Db major triad plus major seventh: Db F Ab C — yes, that's exactly a Db major seventh chord. But in C Phrygian scale, the second chord should be a diminished seventh, not major seventh. Because diatonic chord on second degree of C Phrygian: starting from Db, the notes are Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. So triad: Db, Eb, F — no, diatonic triad on Db would be Db, F, Ab. Because the scale has Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. So notes for Db triad: Db (root), Eb (2nd), F (3rd). Wait, no. Building triads on each note.

For C Phrygian: notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Triad on C: C-Eb-G → Cmin

on Db: Db-F-Ab → Db diminished triad (minor third up to F: Db to F is minor third? Db to Eb is half step, Eb to F is whole step → total Db to F is minor third? No: Db to D is 1, D to D# 2, D# to E 3... no, better count semitones. Db to Db: 0. Db to D: 1 semitone. Db to D#: 2. Db to E: 3. Db to F: 4 semitones (Db-D-D#-E-F), which is major third. Wait, Db to F: Db, D, D#, E, F — that's four semitones. So major third. So triad Db (root), F (major third), Ab (minor fifth? Ab is Db to Ab: Db to Eb 1, Eb to F 2, F to Gb 3, Gb to Ab 4? No better way: Db to Ab is 6 semitones (Db to D 1, D# 2, E 3, F 4, F# 5, G 6? Db to Ab: Db-C# is 1, D 2, D# 3, E 4, F 5, F# 6, G 7, G# 8, A 9? I'm confused. Semitone count.

Db to D: 1

D to D#: 2 → better count directly from Db:

Db to C#: 1

C# to C: 2? No, standard semitones from Db:

Db = 1

D = 2

D# = 3

E = 4

F = 5

F# = 6

G = 7

G# = 8

A = 9

Ab = 10? Wait, Db to Ab: Db is D flat, which is equal to C#. So from C# to Ab: C# is 1, D 2, D# 3, E 4, F 5, F# 6, G 7, G# 8, A 9, Ab 10? No, in semitones above C:

C: 0

Db:1

D:2

Eb:3

E:4

F:5

F#:6

G:7

Ab:8

A:9

Bb:10

B:11

So Db is 1, Ab is 8. So distance from Db to Ab is 8-1=7 semitones — perfect fifth. Because Db to Ab is perfect fifth. Because Db to G is perfect fifth? No, Db to Ab is perfect fifth? Db up to Ab: Db to Eb is minor second, Eb to F is major second, F to Gb (Ab?) — no. Wait, Db to Ab: from Db, up 7 semitones: Db, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, Ab — yes, 7 semitones, which is a perfect fifth. So Db to Ab is perfect fifth. And Db to F is Db to F: Db, D, D#, E, F — 4 semitones (major third). So triad D flat: root Db, major third F, perfect fifth Ab. But that's Db major triad? Because Db, F, Ab. Yes, Db major triad. Oh! Wait, so in C Phrygian scale, the triad on Db is Db, F, Ab — which is Db major triad. But earlier I thought it was diminished. That was my mistake.

Wait, no. The diatonic triads:

For mode C Phrygian (C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb)

Triad on each degree:

1. C: C-Eb-G → Cm (minor)

2. Db: Db-F-Ab → Db major triad (because Db-F is major third, F-Ab minor third, but Db-Ab is perfect fifth. So Db major triad.)

Wait, Db major triad is Db-F-Ab, yes.

Then Eb: Eb-G-Bb → Eb minor triad? Eb-G-Bb: Eb to G is minor third (Eb to F is 1, F to G is 2 → total Eb to G is 3 semitones), yes, so minor third. G to Bb is minor third. So Eb minor triad.

F: F-Ab-C → F minor triad (F-Ab minor third, Ab-C minor third)

G: G-Bb-Db → G minor triad? Wait, G to Bb is minor third. Bb to Db is minor third. So G diminished triad.

Ab: Ab-C-Eb → Ab minor triad (Ab to C minor third; C to Eb minor third)

Bb: Bb-Db-F → Bb major triad? Bb to Db minor third, Db to F major third → so Bb minor? Wait Bb to Db is minor third (two whole steps? No, Bb to B is half step, B to C is whole, C to Db? No, Bb to Db is Bb to C is whole step, C to Db half step → total 3 semitones, minor third. Then Db to F is major third (4 semitones). So Bb to Db minor third, Db to F major third → Bb minor triad? Wait, Bb minor triad would be Bb-Db-F, yes. So that's Bb minor.

So diatonic triads in C Phrygian:

I: Cm

II: Db major

III: Eb minor

IV: Fm

V: G dim

VI: Ab minor

VII: Bb major

Wait, VII degree: Bb, its triad: Bb-Db-F. Which is Bb minor. So VIIm.

So that's how it is.

Looking back at the chord progression:

Gdim (Vdim chord)

Eb/G: Eb minor chord in first inversion (so III chord)

Bbm/F: Bb minor chord with F bass — but the chord symbol is Bbm/F, which is Bb minor triad with F bass. But Bb minor is VII chord. So VII chord.

Ab/G: Ab minor with G bass — VI chord, so Ab minor with G bass.

Dbmaj7/F: Db major seventh with F bass. Db major triad plus C (Bb?), no. Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. So Db major seventh chord. And in C Phrygian, II chord is Db major triad, but for seventh chord: Dbmaj7 would be Db-F-Ab-C. In C Phrygian, the diatonic seventh chord on II would be Dbmaj7? Let's see:

Chord on Db (II): notes are Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. So seventh chord: root Db, third F, fifth Ab, seventh C → yes, that's Db major seventh. Yes! Because Db - F (major third), F - Ab (minor third), Ab - C (major third). So Db-F-Ab-C is Db major seventh. Exactly. So that works.

So let's map the chords:

Gdim – Vdim (G diminished seventh would be G,Bb,Db,F — but here it's just Gdim, so probably just diminished triad)

Eb/G – Eb minor (III chord) in first inversion (since bass is G, the third of Eb minor)

Bbm/F – Bb minor (VII chord) with F bass — F is fifth of Bb minor, so second inversion

Ab/G – Ab minor (VI chord) with G bass — G is root of Gdim, but in Ab minor, the root is Ab. Wait, Ab minor triad is Ab-C-Eb. With G bass — so G, Ab, C, Eb. So G is the seventh of Ab minor? No, Ab minor diatonic seventh chord would be Ab C Eb Bb. But with G bass, it's G-Ab-C-Eb. So G is minor seventh above Ab (Ab to G is minor seventh). So it's Ab minor seventh chord with G bass — meaning Abm7/G. Which matches.

Dbmaj7/F – Dbmaj7 chord in first inversion (bass F), since Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C, so F bass means it's in first inversion.

Now, the progression seems to fit C Phrygian well. Let's see the chords as:

Gdim (Vdim)

Eb/G (III chord)

Bbm/F (VII chord)

Ab/G (VI chord)

Dbmaj7/F (II chord)

Wait, yes. So the Roman numerals for C Phrygian:

i: Cm — not used in this chord progression? Wait, in the progression given, do we see Cm anywhere? Let's check.

Looking at the chord progression: all the chords are Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F. Do we have Cm? Not in the listed chord progression. Hmm. Wait, Cm isn't present. The chords are mostly on the other degrees. But the scale of C Phrygian does have the Cm as i, but maybe the progression is emphasizing other chords.

Another thought: Could it be in Ab major? Because if Ab major is the key, then scale is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Wait, but that's similar to C Phrygian but starting on Ab. So Ab major scale contains the same notes as C Phrygian. So yes, the same notes. So it's either Ab major, but C Phrygian is the mode. But usually, we might say the key is in C Phrygian mode, or the tonal center is C.

But let's check: if C is the tonic, then C Phrygian. If Ab is tonic, then Ab major. Which one makes more sense for the chord progression?

Let's look at the resolution. Where does the progression resolve? Not clear from the given, but typically we look at cadences. For example, in Ab major, the dominant would be Eb7, but in the chord progression, there's Bbm/F which might point to Bb minor as VII, not major. But let's see.

In Ab major, the diatonic chords:

I: Ab

II: Bb dim

III: Cm

IV: Db major

V: Eb major

VI: Fm

VII: Gm

But in our chord progression:

Gdim — which would be VII dim? Not matching Ab major's VII which is Gm.

Wait, but chord progression has Gdim. In Ab major scale, the seventh chord would be G diminished seventh? No, Ab major diatonic seventh chords:

I: Abmaj7

II: Bbmin7(b5)

III: Cm7

IV: Dbmaj7

V: Eb7

VI: Fm7

VII: Gm7

So G minor seventh, not diminished. So that doesn't fit. So if the key were Ab major, the Gdim chord doesn't fit. But in C Phrygian, G is Vdim, which fits.

Also, looking at Dbmaj7 — which in Ab major scale is the IV chord. And Dbmaj7 would be the fourth degree. But in C Phrygian, Dbmaj7 is the II chord.

In the progression, there's also Eb/G — which would be iii chord in Ab major, since Ab major has Cm (III), Eb is the fifth? No. In Ab major:

III: Cm chord (C-Eb-G)

So Eb would be the minor third of C minor? So Eb/G might be Cm first inversion. But the chord Eb/G would be Eb (root), G (third), Bb (fifth), so Eb minor triad. In Ab major scale, Eb minor is not diatonic. Ab major has Eb major? No. Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So Eb is flat sixth? No. The note Eb is just the sixth degree? Ab major: Ab (1), Bb (2), C (3), Db (4), Eb (5), F (6), G (7). Wait, no: Ab major seventh scale is written as Ab Bb C Db Eb F G. So yes, Eb is the fifth degree. So the chord on Eb is Eb major (Eb-G-Bb), since in Ab major, the fifth chord is Eb major.

But in the progression, we have Eb minor? Because Eb/G — Eb minor chord. But in Ab major scale, Eb is part of Eb major, not minor. So if someone uses Eb minor in Ab major key, that would be a borrowed chord? But then Bbm/F — Bb minor. In Ab major scale, the second chord is Bb diminished.

This is getting messy. Let's reconsider.

If we consider C Phrygian as the key center, then the tonic is C. The chords that would be expected: Cm i, but it's not present. However, the progression contains Gdim Vdim, Eb minor III, Bb minor VII, Ab minor VI, Db major II. So perhaps C is the tonic even though Cm isn't explicitly played. It's common for modal progressions to emphasize other chords but still imply the tonic.

Alternatively, look for a possible tonic. Sometimes the last chord or the chord that feels stable. The progression ends with Gdim. Not sure.

Wait, but let's see the Dbmaj7/F chord. Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. If F is in bass, so notes F, Db, Ab, C. Now, if we consider the entire scale: C Phrygian has those notes. If we consider Db as tonic, but Db major's scale would have different notes, like D natural or C#? Not matching.

Another approach: the chords have Gdim, Bbm/F. Wait, in the key of C minor, but natural minor has D natural. But here no D, only Db. So C Phrygian seems likely.

Let's also consider the use of Dbmajor seventh. In C Phrygian, the chord on II is Dbmaj7, that matches. In Eb major? Not sure.

Wait, another scale possibility: C Locrian? But Locrian is rare. C Locrian: C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb — different; has Gb instead of G. But in our progression, the Gdim chord has G as root, which in Locrian would be diatonic. But Locrian has Gb. So no.

Back to C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes, matches all notes. And the chords in the progression fit.

Let's write the Roman numerals:

Gdim – Vdim

Eb/G – III (Eb minor chord), bass third (G)

Bbm/F – VIIm (Bb minor chord), bass fifth (F)

Ab/G – VIm, bass seventh (G? Well, Ab minor has a minor seventh Bb, but in Abm7 chord, the bass is G — which is minor seventh. So Abm7/G, so the seventh is G.

Dbmaj7/F – IIm (Dbmaj7), bass third (F)

So yes, this all fits within C Phrygian mode. The tonic C isn't directly played but is implied as the key center. In modal music, often the tonic isn't necessarily the first chord played.

Alternatively, another possibility: the progression is in F minor? But F minor has Ab and C, but also D natural in natural minor? No, F natural minor is F G Ab Bb C Db Eb. So scale: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb. But our chord progression has Gdim — which would be G-Bb-Db. In F minor scale, G is the second degree. But Gdim chord would be the II chord of F natural minor? But that's not standard. F minor's II chord is G diminished (if minor chord). Wait, F natural minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb. Triad on G: G-Bb-Db — yes, G diminished. So could it be F Phrygian or F minor?

Wait, if F natural minor (Aeolian), it has D natural? No: F natural minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb. So all the flats. Db and Eb. But our chord progression contains C natural. Yes. So F minor contains C natural. But in the chord progression, we have notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Which is F natural minor scale. F natural minor is F G Ab Bb C Db Eb. So yes, the notes match exactly. Wait, F natural minor consists of F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. Wait, no: F minor natural: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. Yes. That includes all the notes present in the chord progression. Let's check:

- C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb — wait, but in F natural minor scale, it should have Bb? Yes, F minor natural: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb. So Bb is present. Wait, but Eb is also present. Wait, F scale: F (1), G (2), Ab (3), Bb (4), C (5), Db (6), Eb (7). Yes. So Bb is fourth degree. Now, in F minor, the seventh degree is Eb. The scale notes are: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb. So yes: all of our chord notes fit into F natural minor (Aeolian mode).

But then in F minor, how do the chords work?

Fm natural scale:

i: Fm

ii°: Gdim

III: Ab major

IV: Bbm

v: Cm

VI: Db major

VII: Ebmaj7

Wait, diatonic triads:

i: Fm (F Ab C)

ii°: Gdim (G Bb Db)

III: Ab major (Ab C Eb)

IV: Bbm (Bb Db F)

v: Cm (C Eb G)

VI: Db major (Db F Ab)

VII: Eb major (Eb G Bb)

Yes. Now looking at chord progression:

Gdim — ii° (second degree)

Eb/G — Eb major chord with G bass. Eb major is VII chord in F minor.

Bbm/F — Bbm (IV chord) with F bass (since Bbm is Bb-Db-F, so F bass is fifth)

Ab/G — Ab major chord (III chord) with G bass? Ab major is Ab C Eb, so G as bass would be G Ab C Eb. Which is Ab major with added ninth? Not sure.

Dbmaj7/F — Db major seventh? Db is VI chord, maj7 would be Db-F-Ab-C. But in F minor, VI chord is Db major triad. Dbmaj7 is a possibility, though typically VI in minor is minor seventh.

Wait, but in the F minor scale chord progression:

The Gdim is ii°.

Eb/G: Eb major is VII chord. Eb major in F minor is VII. Eb/G would be Eb major with G in bass — notes Bb, Eb, G. Or Eb root: Eb G Bb. So bass G → G is fifth of Eb major. Eb major in first inversion? No, Eb major triad with G bass: G, Eb, Bb. Which is Eb major in second inversion.

Bbm/F: Bb minor chord — IV chord. F bass means fifth in bass (Bbm triad is Bb-Db-F), so F is fifth.

Ab/G: Ab major triad with G bass — Ab is III chord. Ab major: Ab C Eb. With G bass → G, Ab, C, Eb. So Ab major with added ninth? Or Ab major ninth chord? Not standard.

But let's check the Roman numerals in F minor.

i: Fm — not present in chord progression

Gdim: ii° (yes)

Eb/G: Eb major (VII) with fifth in bass (G)

Bbm/F: IV chord in first inversion (F bass)

Ab/G: III chord with seventh? Not sure. Ab major with G bass, which is not standard. But in Ab major's scale, G is seventh, but in F minor, Ab is III.

Dbmaj7/F: Db (VI) major seventh. Db major seventh would be Db-F-Ab-C. In F minor, VI chord is Db major triad, but maj7 might be a bit outside. But F minor scale has Ab and C, so Dbmaj7 could be a possibility.

But does it fit better in F minor or C Phrygian?

Let's compare.

In F minor (Aeolian), the tonic is F. But the chord progression doesn't have Fm. However, sometimes it can. In C Phrygian, the tonic C. Let's check the final chord is Gdim, which in C Phrygian is the fifth (Vdim), which can lead to tonic, but Gdim to Cm would be V-i cadence.

In F minor, Gdim would be ii°, which often leads to v or i.

Looking at Dbmaj7/F: Db major seventh with F bass. Dbmaj7 includes Ab and C. Now, if we consider the Dbmaj7 chord as VI chord in F minor, then Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C — yes, that's exactly VI7 in F minor? Wait, VI in minor is usually Db minor seventh: Db-F-Ab-Cb (which is B), but Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C, which is a major seventh chord. In natural minor, the sixth degree is a minor triad, but it can be major seventh if using harmonic minor. But F harmonic minor would have Eb, but E natural instead of Eb. Wait, F harmonic minor is F G Ab Bb C Db E. So no Eb, E natural. So Dbmaj7 would be unusual in F minor.

In C Phrygian, the chord on VI is Ab minor. But Dbmaj7 — which is II chord. The II chord in C Phrygian is Db major seventh. So Dbmaj7 is diatonic. And the VII chord is Bb minor. Bb minor chord is present.

Now, comparing the scale notes:

F natural minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb

C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb — same notes. Just different starting point.

So these are the same notes, different modes. So either both are valid, depending on the tonic. Which note is the tonic?

Let's see: if we consider where the music resolves. But we don't have the full melody, just chords. However, in the progression, there is a Dbmaj7 — which is II chord in C Phrygian, VI chord in F minor. But in C Phrygian, tonic is C. The chord progression starts with Gdim. Gdim in C Phrygian is V chord, which usually resolves to i, i.e., Cm. But if the progression doesn't have Cm, but if Dbmaj7 is present, which is a very strong chord in Phrygian mode — the II chord. In Phrygian mode, II chord is major, which is a typical characteristic.

Let's see the chord progression:

Gdim (V)

Eb/G (VII? In F minor it's VII, in C Phrygian VII is Bb minor. But Eb major chord — in C Phrygian, Eb is third degree, which would be minor chord. Wait, no. In C Phrygian, the III chord is Eb minor. So Eb/G is Eb minor, which would be III chord.

In F minor: Eb major is VII chord.

So which makes sense? Let's see the notes. If we take the chord progression: there's Gdim, which is often used in Phrygian cadences.

Another clue: Dbmaj7/F. Dbmaj7 chord has a major seventh interval from Db to C. C is a major seventh. In C Phrygian, the tonic is C. So Dbmaj7 chord contains the tonic note C. That's a strong indicator that C might be the tonic. Because the maj7 chord to the second degree containing the tonic.

In C Phrygian, the II chord (Db maj7) has C as the major seventh. That creates a Dbmaj7 chord, which can be seen as a cadence to C.

Whereas in F minor, the VI chord Dbmaj7 would also include C as the major seventh? Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. C is the major seventh. But in F natural minor, that note C is the fifth degree. So the Dbmaj7 chord's C would be fifth of Db. But it doesn't directly point to F.

But in modal music, having the seventh of the II chord being the tonic note can be significant. Like if you have Dbmaj7, then the major seventh is C, which would be tonic if in C Phrygian.

Also, another thing: the presence of Ab/G. If Ab is the VI chord in C Phrygian (Ab minor), and the bass is G, which is the seventh tone of Ab minor chord (since Ab minor 7 is Ab C Eb Bb — no, the minor 7 is Bb. So the minor seventh is Bb. But G is the ninth above Ab. So in reality, Ab/G would be Ab minor with added ninth? Not standard.

Wait, but if the scale is C Phrygian, Ab minor chord would be diatonic, and in Ab minor, it's Ab C Eb Bb. But if the bass is G, then notes G Ab C Eb — which is Ab minor with added G (minor ninth). But that's not standard.

Alternatively, if the key is C Phrygian, then the chord Ab/G could be the iv chord? No.

This is still confusing. Let's see the chord progression again:

Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim

Let's look for cadences. For example, Dbmaj7/F followed by Gdim? Dbmaj7 to Gdim doesn't seem like a normal cadence. Alternatively, maybe the Gdim resolves to Cm, which isn't there, but it's the tonic.

Another idea: the presence of Gdim, which is often used as a diminished chord that is part of a minor ii-V-i. But in Cm, the ii-V-i would be Ddim-G7-Cm. But here it's Gdim, which is V° in some contexts.

But in Phrygian mode, it's common to have the ii chord as major, like Dbmaj7.

Let's see a typical Phrygian mode progression: often the II chord is major and important. For example, in Dm Phrygian (C major scale), but that's different.

Wait, let's consider that this chord progression might be in C Phrygian. Because all of the chords fit exactly into C Phrygian as diatonic chords.

In C Phrygian:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db → Vdim chord

- Eb/G: Eb minor triad (III chord), with G bass → which is the third of Eb minor chord

- Bbm/F: Bb minor (VII chord), F bass (fifth)

- Ab/G: Ab minor (VI chord), G bass — Ab minor 7th chord would be Ab C Eb Bb, so G would be the ninth? But perhaps it's Ab minor with added G, though it's not standard

- Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 (II chord), with F bass → chord in first inversion

- Yes, all chords fit in C Phrygian diatonically. Even Ab/G — if we consider it as Ab minor chord with the bass G, which is the seventh of Bb minor (VII chord), but perhaps it's a passing note or something.

Alternatively, Ab could be the VI chord, and G is the minor seventh if we consider Ab7 chord, but Ab7 would be Ab C Eb Db. Not matching.

But in any case, all the chords are built from the C Phrygian scale. The presence of Db major seventh is a strong marker for Phrygian mode, since in major scales the II chord is minor in both Ionian and Aeolian, but in Phrygian, the II is major.

For example, in Aeolian (natural minor), the II chord is diminished. In Phrygian, the II is major. In our case, the Db chord is major seventh — which would not fit in Aeolian (F minor's II chord would be Gdim), whereas in C Phrygian, II chord is Dbmaj7.

Yes! That's a key point.

In F natural minor (Aeolian), the second degree is G, which form the triad Gdim. So the ii chord is diminished.

But in the chord progression, we have Dbmaj7 chord, which would be the II chord in C Phrygian (major seventh). If the key were F minor, the II chord would be Gdim, but we don't have that as a major seventh chord.

Since the progression includes Dbmaj7 (II chord), which is a major seventh chord, and in F natural minor the II chord is diminished (Gdim), whereas in C Phrygian the II chord is major, that suggests C Phrygian is the mode.

Therefore, the key center is C and the mode is Phrygian.

Wait, but the chord Dbmaj7 is present, which would be diatonic in C Phrygian as II chord. Yes. Whereas if the key were something else, this chord wouldn't fit.

Moreover, the presence of a minor seventh (from Bb) but also the flat second (Db).

So, to confirm:

- Tonic note C

- Scale: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb

- Mode: Phrygian

Yes, this seems to fit.

Another way: the characteristic note of Phrygian mode is the minor second (b2), which is Db in this case. And in the chords, we see Db prominently (as part of Gdim, Dbmaj7). So yes.

So conclusion: key is C Phrygian.

But usually, we say the key is C Phrygian, or the key is C minor Phrygian mode. Sometimes simplified to C Phrygian.

The tonic is C.

Let me double-check all chords in this context.

- Gdim: V° – G Bb Db

- Eb/G: III chord (Eb minor), bass G (third of chord)

- Bbm/F: VII chord (Bb minor), bass F (fifth)

- Ab/G: VI chord (Ab minor), bass G — wait, Ab minor chord is Ab C Eb. If bass is G, then G-Ab-C-Eb. That note G is the diminished third? Or is it a 9th? In Ab minor, adding G would be a minor ninth interval above Ab. But actually, the seventh of Ab minor would be Gb, but here it's G natural. Not diatonic. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, Ab minor diatonic is Ab C Eb. The seventh would be Bb (minor seventh). So Abm7 would be Ab C Eb Bb. But the chord is Ab/G — with G bass. So G-Ab-C-Eb. In C Phrygian, what's the note G? It's the fifth in the scale. The chord Ab/G would actually contain notes: G (bass), Ab (b2), C (b6), Eb (b3). So from Ab's perspective, G is the minor seventh below Ab? Because Ab to G is minor seventh. Yes: Ab to G is minor seventh. So the chord Abmin7 with G bass would be the same as Abmin7 in third inversion. Because Abmin7 chord is Ab C Eb Bb — wait, no. Wait, Ab minor seventh chord: Ab root, minor third C, perfect fifth Eb, minor seventh Gb. But in C Phrygian scale, the minor seventh would be Gb, but we have G natural. So this is a problem.

Ah! This is the issue. In C Phrygian scale, all the notes are natural (except Db etc.). The chord Abm7 would require Ab, C, Eb, Gb (not G natural). Because Gb is the minor seventh above Ab. But our chord lists have G natural, not Gb.

So Ab/G chord: notes G, Ab, C, Eb. But the G natural is not in the Abm7 chord because Ab minor seventh should be Gb. So actually, the presence of G natural suggests that G is natural, not Gb.

But in C Phrygian, the scale has G natural. So Ab minor chord in C Phrygian is Ab C Eb — which has Ab minor triad, which is diatonic. The seventh note would vary, but the triad itself is Ab C Eb. So if the chord is Ab minor triad with G in bass — G is the root of Gdim, but it's also the fifth of something? Wait, G is the fifth note of C Phrygian.

But in Ab minor triad, the notes are Ab, C, Eb. Adding G bass: G-Ab-C-Eb. So this chord includes an additional tone G. Which is not part of the Ab triad, but does it fit in the scale? Yes, because C Phrygian contains G. So technically, it's a chord with Ab minor triad plus G — which would be Ab minor with added ninth or flattened supertonic or something.

But the problem is that in Ab minor (as a triad), there's no G natural. But if you have Ab minor with extra G, it's Abmin9, but that would be Ab C Eb G — but G is the ninth, yes. Wait, G is a minor second above Ab. Ab to G is minor second. So actually, the chord G-Ab-C-Eb has Ab as root, but with a minor second above it. So it's Ab minor minor ninth (Abmin9). But usually, the minor ninth chord has the minor ninth above root. So yes, Abmin9: Ab C Eb G — but G is actually Db enharmonically? No, G natural is 9th above Ab.

But in the context of C Phrygian, it's all diatonic.

However, another thing: the chord Ab/G would be a G bass chord. So the bass is G, then Ab. So the chord could be interpreted as G with Ab in it — G minor or something. But G minor is G Bb D. Here we have G, Ab, C, Eb. Not matching.

Perhaps we should consider that Ab/G is actually a G diminished chord variant? Gdim is G Bb Db. Not quite.

Wait, maybe Ab/G is a typo? Or perhaps it's meant to be Ab major instead of Ab minor. Because if it's Ab major, then Ab major triad is Ab C Eb. Then with G bass, notes G-Ab-C-Eb. Which could be Abmaj7/G — but Abmaj7 is Ab C Eb G. Yes! Ab major seventh with G bass. But in C Phrygian scale, what is Ab major seventh? Ab is b6 of C. So the chord Abmaj7 would be Ab C Eb G. Which are all in C Phrygian.

Yes! So if Ab/G is Abmaj7 with G bass — which is common in Phrygian mode.

So let's check:

Abmaj7: Ab C Eb G

With G bass: G Ab C Eb — yes, exactly.

And in C Phrygian, this is the VI chord (sixth degree) in major seventh? Wait, no. The diatonic seventh chord on Ab in C Phrygian:

C Phrygian scale: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb

So Ab root: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Triad on Ab: Ab, C, Eb → Ab minor

Seventh chord on Ab: Ab C Eb G — which is Ab minor seventh (Abm7), because G is minor seventh above Ab.

But in Abm7, it's Ab C Eb G. Yes, standard.

But in C Phrygian, it's a diatonic minor seventh chord.

But the chord name Ab/G typically means Ab minor with G bass. But if it's Abm7 in second inversion (since bass G, which is minor seventh of Ab).

Yes: Abm7 chord is Ab C Eb G. First inversion would be C as bass, second inversion Eb bass, third inversion G bass. So Abm7/G is Abm7 with G bass.

Yes! That makes sense. So Abm7 chord, third inversion (G in bass).

So in C Phrygian scale, all chords fit diatonically.

- Gdim (V°)

- Eb/G — Eb minor (III) in first inversion (G bass is third of Eb minor chord)

- Bbm/F — Bb minor (VII) chord in second inversion (F bass is fifth)

- Ab/G — Ab minor seventh (VI) chord in third inversion (G bass is minor seventh)

- Dbmaj7/F — Db major seventh (II) chord in first inversion (F bass)

- All these chords are diatonic in C Phrygian.

Yes, this works perfectly.

So the key center is C for the Phrygian mode.

Therefore, the key is C Phrygian.

Now, to answer the user: Determine key and mode.

The mode is Phrygian, key is C. So "C Phrygian" or "C Phrygian mode".

Sometimes people say the "key" as the tonal center, so C with Phrygian mode.

Yes.

Another way to check: if this progression were in F minor (Aeolian), would it fit? Let's see.

F natural minor scale: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Chords:

Gdim (ii° diatonic)

Eb chord: Eb is VII degree, which would be Eb major — but Eb major chord in F minor would be Eb G Bb — which is correct. Eb/G would be that chord with G bass. So Eb major chord in second inversion.

Bbm: IV chord — yes.

Ab: III major chord — in F minor, yes.

Dbmaj7: Db major seventh. In F minor scale, the VI chord is Db major triad, but Dbmaj7 would require C natural which is present. So Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C. Yes. But in F natural minor, the VI chord is minor (Dbm), because F minor's natural minor scale hasDb note as flattened sixth. So VI chord in Aeolian is minor. But Dbmaj7 would not be diatonic for F Aeolian — only Db minor seventh or Db minor triad.

But in our chord progression, it's Dbmaj7 — so major seventh, which would not be diatonic for F minor. Whereas in C Phrygian, the II chord Dbmaj7 is diatonic.

Yes, this confirms that F minor wouldn't fit because of the Dbmaj7 chord. Because in natural minor (Aeolian), the VI chord is minor. So Db minor chord, not major. Therefore, the key is C Phrygian.

So the answer should be C Phrygian mode.

The given chord progression is:

**Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**

### 🔍 **Analysis of Chords and Scale**

Let's examine the notes present in the progression:

- **Gdim**: G, Bb, Db  
- **Eb/G**: G, Eb, Bb (Eb minor chord in first inversion)  
- **Bbm/F**: F, Bb, Db (Bb minor chord with F in bass)  
- **Ab/G**: G, Ab, C, Eb (Ab minor seventh chord in third inversion)  
- **Dbmaj7/F**: F, Db, Ab, C (Db major seventh chord in first inversion)  

Collecting all unique pitch classes:  
**C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**

This is a **7-note scale**:  
**C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**

---

### 🎵 **Mode Identification**

This scale matches exactly the **C Phrygian mode**:

- **C** is the tonic
- **Db** is the flattened second (characteristic of Phrygian mode)
- **Eb** is flattened third
- **F** is perfect fourth
- **G** is perfect fifth
- **Ab** is flattened sixth
- **Bb** is flattened seventh

This aligns precisely with the **Phrygian mode** (mode 3 of a major scale), where:
- The **flattened second** (Db) is the defining feature
- All other intervals match the standard Phrygian pattern

---

### ✅ **Why Not Other Modes?**

- **F Natural Minor (Aeolian)**:  
  F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb — *same notes as C Phrygian*, but **F is the tonic**. In F Aeolian:
  - VI chord would be Db **minor**, not **major seventh** (Dbmaj7)
  - The progression contains **Dbmaj7**, which is **not diatonic** in F Aeolian
  - Therefore, **not F minor**

- **C Minor (Natural/Aeolian)**:  
  C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb — contains **D natural**, which is **not in the progression**

- **C Locrian**:  
  C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb — contains **Gb**, not **G natural**, which appears in the chords

- **Other Modes**:  
  None match the specific **flattened second (Db)** and the full set of notes present. Only **C Phrygian** contains all the chords diatonically.

---

### 📌 **Why C Phrygian Fits Perfectly**

| Chord         | Diatonic Function in C Phrygian | Notes          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Gdim          | V°                               | G, Bb, Db      |
| Eb/G          | III (Eb minor first inversion)   | G, Eb, Bb      |
| Bbm/F         | VII (Bb minor second inversion)  | F, Bb, Db      |
| Ab/G          | VI (Abm7 third inversion)        | G, Ab, C, Eb   |
| Dbmaj7/F      | II (Dbmaj7 first inversion)      | F, Db, Ab, C   |

All chords fit perfectly within the **C Phrygian scale**. The **Dbmaj7** chord is especially telling — **Phrygian mode uniquely has a major II chord**, which is **not possible in Aeolian or Natural Minor**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

> **Key: C**  
> **Mode: Phrygian**  
>  
> **Full Answer:** **C Phrygian**

This is a classic Phrygian mode progression, with the **flattened second (Db)** as the defining characteristic. The chords all resolve within the diatonic structure of **C Phrygian**, with **C** as the tonal center.
