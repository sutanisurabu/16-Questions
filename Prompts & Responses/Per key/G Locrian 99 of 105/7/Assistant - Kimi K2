**Key and Mode Analysis:**

1. **Chord Breakdown**  
   - **Gdim** (G–Bb–Db) – viio in A♭ major, iio in F minor.  
   - **Eb/G** (Eb–G–Bb) – I6 in E♭ major, VI in G minor.  
   - **Bbm/F** (F–Bb–Db) – iv6 in F minor, subdominant function.  
   - **Ab/G** (G–Ab–C–Eb) – V13sus in E♭ major, deceptive in A♭.  
   - **Dbmaj7/F** (F–Ab–C–Db-F) – IV6/9 in A♭ major, Gr+6 in F minor.  

2. **Tonality Clues**  
   - **Gdim** repeatedly resolves to **Eb/G** (tonic in E♭ major).  
   - **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F** emphasize **F** as a pedal tone, anchoring F minor.  
   - **Ab/G** (V13sus) suggests an unresolved dominant tension, a hallmark of **Phrygian mode** (♭2).  

3. **Modal Resolution**  
   - The **G♭** (enharmonic of F#) in **Gdim** conflicts with E♭ major’s diatonic G♮.  
   - **F Phrygian** (F–G♭–A♭–B♭–C–D♭–E♭) accommodates both G♭ (♭2) and the Bbm/D♭maj7 cadence.  

**Conclusion:**  
The progression is in **F Phrygian**, leveraging the **G♭ (♭2)** and **E♭ (♭7)** to create tension against the **F tonic**.
