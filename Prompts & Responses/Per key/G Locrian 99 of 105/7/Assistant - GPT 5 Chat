Let's look carefully at the chord progression:

**Progression:**
```
Gdim   Gdim   Eb/G   Eb/G  
Gdim   Gdim   Bbm/F  Ab/G  
Gdim   Gdim   Eb/G   Eb/G  
Gdim   Gdim   Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their notes

**Gdim:** G–Bb–Db  
**Eb/G:** Eb–G–Bb  
**Bbm/F:** Bb–Db–F  
**Ab/G:** Ab–C–Eb–G  
**Dbmaj7/F:** Db–F–Ab–C

---

### Step 2: Look for key centers

Let’s see what notes appear overall:
> G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

That’s a **Db major scale** (Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C) except for **Gb**, which does not appear.  
So the tonality is **around Db major** or its relative minor **Bb minor**, but with some chromaticism.

---

### Step 3: Functional tendencies

- **Eb/G → Gdim** is a common bass motion: roots move a **major 3rd apart** (Eb → G). Gdim often acts as a **leading-tone diminished** chord resolving to **Ab** or **Bb minor**.

  In **Db major**, Gdim is **vii°/Ab** (the leading-tone diminished of Ab, which is the V of Db).

  So Gdim → Eb/G fits as part of **secondary dominant** or **chromatic pre-dominant** motion toward Ab harmony.

- **Bbm/F** is **vi** (relative minor chord) or ii of Ab.

- **Ab/G** (Abmaj7 over G) is a ♭VIImaj7ish flavor, possibly a passing chord.

- **Dbmaj7/F** is clearly the **I** chord in Db major.

---

### Step 4: Bass motion observation
The bass line:  
G – G – G – F – G – G – F – G (roughly interchanging F and G roots).  
That often occurs in slow, chromatic inner bass movements (common in late-Romantic or jazz-influenced harmony).

---

### Step 5: Tentative conclusion

Given that:
- Dbmaj7 appears as the **final** stable chord
- Ab chords appear as a **dominant-type** target
- Gdim strongly functions as **vii°7/V** or as diminished link to Ab or Bb minor
- Bbm and Eb chords (ii and V) fit the **Db major family**
  
The piece’s harmonic language fits best in **Db major**, possibly with modal mixture or minor inflections.

---

✅ **Final Answer:**
- **Key:** Db major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major), with chromatic/secondary diminished chords (especially G° functioning as vii°/V or embellishing the dominant area).

**Summary of Functions (approximate):**
| Chord     | Function in Db major |
|------------|----------------------|
| Gdim       | vii°/V or passing diminished |
| Eb/G       | V/V (Eb = V of Ab)  |
| Bbm/F      | ii6                 |
| Ab/G       | V7/♭VII or passing dominant |
| Dbmaj7/F   | I6                  |
