**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords often function as passing chords or leading tones, so I should look for the overall tonal center.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

1. Gdim

2. Gdim

3. Eb/G

4. Eb/G

5. Gdim

6. Gdim

7. Bbm/F

8. Ab/G

9. Gdim

10. Gdim

11. Eb/G

12. Eb/G

13. Gdim

14. Gdim

15. Dbmaj7/F

16. Gdim

Now, Eb/G is an Eb major chord with a G in the bass, so it's still an Eb major chord. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb minor with F in the bass, so it's Bb minor. Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass, and Dbmaj7/F is Db major 7th with F in the bass.

Gdim is G diminished, which could be a half-diminished or fully diminished, but since it's written as Gdim, I'll assume it's a fully diminished seventh chord unless specified otherwise.

To find the key, I should look at the chords that seem like they might be tonic or dominant. The progression ends on Gdim, which is unusual because diminished chords are rarely tonic; they usually resolve to something else. But here, it ends on Gdim, so maybe Gdim is functioning as a leading tone chord to something, but it doesn't resolve.

Perhaps Gdim is being used as a common-tone diminished chord or something. Let me think about the key based on the other chords.

I see Eb major, Bb minor, Ab major, Db major. These are all flats, so probably a key with flats.

Eb major has three flats: Bb, Eb, Ab. But we have Bbm, which is minor, and Ab major, and Db major which has five flats? Db major has five flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb.

But we have Gdim, which has notes G, Bb, Db, E? Wait, fully diminished seventh chord on G: G, Bb, Db, E? Actually, diminished seventh chords are symmetric, so Gdim7 would be G, Bb, Db, E. But in chord symbols, Gdim might imply G, Bb, Db, Fb? No, typically Gdim means diminished triad, but in context, it might be implying diminished seventh.

In jazz and popular music, "dim" often means diminished seventh, so I'll assume Gdim is G diminished seventh: G, Bb, Db, Fb (which is E).

But Fb is enharmonic to E, so notes: G, Bb, Db, E.

Now, Eb/G is Eb, G, Bb – so notes Eb, G, Bb.

Bbm/F is Bb, Db, F – so notes Bb, Db, F.

Ab/G is Ab, C, Eb with G bass, so notes Ab, C, Eb, G? But the chord is Ab major with G bass, so the pitches are G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F is Db, F, Ab, C with F bass, so notes F, Db, F, Ab, C? Actually, Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C, and with F bass, it's the same notes but F in bass.

Now, let's look at the progression for common tones or resolutions.

Notice that Gdim appears very frequently, and it's often followed by Eb/G or other chords. Also, Eb/G has G in bass, same as Gdim, so perhaps there is a common bass note G.

In many places, the bass is G, since Gdim has G bass, Eb/G has G bass, Ab/G has G bass, and Dbmaj7/F has F bass, but others have G bass.

Let's list the bass notes:

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Bbm/F: bass F

- Ab/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Dbmaj7/F: bass F

- Gdim: bass G

So, the bass is mostly G, with two F bass points.

Now, since the bass is consistently G, perhaps the key is centered around G, but Gdim is diminished, so it might be that G is the root, but diminished chords are unstable.

Perhaps Gdim is acting as a dominant function chord. In traditional harmony, a diminished chord often functions as a leading tone chord. For example, in C major, the leading tone diminished chord is Bdim, which resolves to C.

But here we have Gdim, so if Gdim is the leading tone, it should resolve to Ab, since G is the leading tone to Ab.

Let's check if there are resolutions to Ab. We have Ab/G chord, which is Ab major with G bass, so that might be a resolution where G is the bass but Ab is the chord, so G could be resolving to Ab, but since G is in bass, it might not resolve directly.

In Ab/G, the chord is Ab major, so the root is Ab, but bass is G, so it's like a first inversion or something, but Ab major in first inversion would be Ab/C, but here it's Ab/G, which is not a standard inversion; Ab major with G bass would imply Ab major with added G or something? Let's see the notes: Ab, C, Eb, and G in bass. So it's Ab major with a major seventh? Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb, and if you add G, that's Abmaj7? But Abmaj7 has G, so Ab/G could be interpreted as Abmaj7 with G in bass, which is the same as Abmaj7 in first inversion? Abmaj7 first inversion would be C/Ab, but here it's Ab/G, meaning bass G, so it's like Abmaj7 with bass G, which is not standard.

In chord symbols, Ab/G means Ab chord with G in bass, so the pitches are G, Ab, C, Eb. This could be seen as an Ab major chord with a suspended G or something, but G is the major seventh of Ab, so it is essentially Abmaj7 with the seventh in the bass. So Ab/G is equivalent to Abmaj7/G.

Similarly, Eb/G is Eb major with G bass, which is Eb major with G, so Eb, G, Bb – that's Eb major triad, and G is the third, so it's Eb major in first inversion? Eb major first inversion is G, Bb, Eb, so yes, Eb/G is Eb major in first inversion.

Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb minor with F bass, which is Bb minor in first inversion? Bb minor triad is Bb, Db, F, so first inversion is Db, F, Bb, but with F bass, it's F, Bb, Db, so yes, first inversion.

Dbmaj7/F is Db major seventh with F bass, which is Db maj7 in first inversion? Db maj7 is Db, F, Ab, C, so first inversion would be F, Ab, C, Db, so with F bass, it's first inversion.

So, now we have:

- Gdim: diminished chord on G

- Eb/G: Eb major first inversion

- Bbm/F: Bb minor first inversion

- Ab/G: Ab major with G bass, which is Abmaj7 chord since G is the major seventh

- Dbmaj7/F: Db maj7 first inversion

Now, let's consider the key based on these chords.

Eb major, Bb minor, Ab major, Db major. These are all related to Eb major or C minor, etc.

Eb major has chords: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim.

But here we have Bbm, which is the v chord in Eb major? In Eb major, v is Bb minor? No, in major key, v is minor, so in Eb major, v is Bb minor, yes. And IV is Ab major, and V is Bb major, but here it's Bb minor, so if it's Bbm, it might be from Eb minor or something.

Perhaps it's in C minor? C minor has Eb as III, Ab as VI, Bb as VII, etc.

But let's list the chords in terms of scale degrees.

First, notice that Gdim is recurring. Gdim notes are G, Bb, Db, E (Fb). E natural? In flat keys, E natural is not common, but in diminished chords, it can be.

If Gdim is a diminished chord, it could be from several keys.

For example, in Ab major, the leading tone chord is Gdim, which resolves to Ab. And we have Ab/G chord, which is like Abmaj7, so that could be a resolution to Ab.

Similarly, in B major? No, flats suggest flat keys.

In Ab major, the chords are: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.

So we have Bbm, Db (Dbmaj7), Eb, and Gdim. So all these chords are in Ab major scale.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab.

Chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii Gdim.

In the progression, we have Bbm, Dbmaj7 (which is IV), Eb, and Gdim.

And we have Ab/G, which is Imaj7 with seventh in bass, so still I chord.

And we have Eb/G, which is V chord in first inversion.

And Bbm/F, which is ii chord in first inversion.

And Dbmaj7/F, which is IV chord in first inversion.

And Gdim, which is vii chord.

So, essentially, all chords are from Ab major scale.

But let's confirm the Gdim. In Ab major, vii chord is G diminished, which is G, Bb, Db, Fb? But in Ab major, the seventh note is G, and diminished seventh chord would be G, Bb, Db, E? No, in major scale, the seventh chord on leading tone is half-diminished, not fully diminished.

In major scale, the vii chord is half-diminished: minor seventh flat five.

But in the chord symbol, "dim" usually means fully diminished, but in context, it might be half-diminished.

In Ab major, the leading tone chord should be G-Bb-Db-F, which is G half-diminished, written as Gm7b5.

But here it's written as Gdim, which typically means fully diminished, so G-Bb-Db-E.

But in Ab major, the seventh note is G, and if we have a fully diminished chord, it would require E natural, but Ab major has E flat? No, Ab major scale has no E, it has F and G, so the notes are Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So the leading tone chord from natural scale would be G, Bb, Db, F – which is half-diminished.

If it's fully diminished, it would have E natural, which is not in the key.

So, if Gdim is fully diminished, it might not be from Ab major.

But let's see the other chords. Eb major chord has E natural? No, Eb major has Eb, G, Bb – so G natural, which is in Ab major? Ab major has G natural, yes.

But fully diminished Gdim has E natural, which is not in Ab major.

So, perhaps it's not Ab major.

Maybe it's in a minor key.

Consider Ab minor? But Ab minor would have Gb, etc.

Another thought: perhaps Gdim is not a diatonic chord but a secondary dominant or something.

Let's look at the progression sequence.

The progression has Gdim moving to Eb/G several times. Eb/G is Eb major first inversion.

If Gdim is G-Bb-Db-E, and Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, so they share G and Bb, and Db moves to Eb? Db to Eb is a half step, and E to Eb? E to Eb is a half step down, so it could be a resolution.

In fact, a fully diminished chord can resolve to a major chord a half step above the root. For example, Gdim resolving to Ab major. But here, Gdim resolves to Eb major? Eb is a minor third above G? G to Eb is a major sixth below, but in terms of root, if Gdim resolves to Ab, but here it's going to Eb.

Gdim can resolve to any chord that has a note a half step from one of the notes. Gdim has G, Bb, Db, E. E can resolve to F or Eb, Bb to A or B, Db to C or D, G to F# or G#.

So, resolving to Eb major: Eb has Eb, G, Bb. So E resolves to Eb, which is a half step down, and Db resolves to? Db to Eb is half step up? But Db to Eb is whole step? Db to Eb is a whole step, but in diminished resolution, often notes resolve by half step.

In this case, E to Eb is half step, but Db to Eb is whole step, which is not typical. Db to C would be half step, but Eb has C? No, Eb major has Eb, G, Bb, no C.

So, from Gdim to Eb: notes G to G? same, Bb to Bb same, Db to ? no Db in Eb, E to Eb? but E to Eb is half step, but E is not in Eb chord? Eb chord has Eb, G, Bb, so E is not a chord tone, so E would resolve to Eb, but Eb is the root, so it might work if E is heard as a passing tone.

But let's see the actual resolution in context.

Perhaps Gdim is acting as a common-tone diminished chord for Eb? Common-tone diminished chords often have the same note as the tonic, so if Eb is the tonic, then Gdim has G, which is the third of Eb, so it could be a common-tone diminished chord based on the third.

Similarly, in other places.

Now, we have Bbm/F and Ab/G.

Bbm/F is Bb minor first inversion, and Ab/G is Ab major with G bass.

If we consider Ab as tonic, then Bbm is ii, Ab is I, and Gdim is vii.

But again, Gdim fully diminished has E natural, which is not in Ab major.

So, perhaps the key is Eb major? Let's see.

In Eb major, chords are: I Eb, ii Fm, iii Gm, IV Ab, V Bb, vi Cm, vii Ddim.

But we have Bbm, which is not in Eb major; Bbm would be flat ii or something. And we have Ab, which is IV, and Db, which is not in Eb major; Db would be flat VII? And Gdim, which is not in Eb major.

So not Eb major.

Another idea: perhaps the key is Db major.

Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db.

Chords: I Db, ii Ebm, iii Fm, IV Gb, V Ab, vi Bbm, vii Cdim.

So we have Dbmaj7, which is I, Bbm, which is vi, Ab, which is V, and Eb, which is II? Eb is not II, II would be Ebm, but we have Eb major, which is not diatonic to Db major; in Db major, II is Ebm, not Eb major.

So Eb major is not in Db major.

We have Eb major chords, so probably not Db major.

Perhaps it's in C minor? C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C.

Chords: i Cm, ii° Ddim, III Eb, iv Fm, v Gm, VI Ab, VII Bb.

So we have Eb which is III, Ab which is VI, Bbm? But Bbm is not in C minor; Bb is major, so Bbm would be flat VI? No, in C minor, VI is Ab major, and VII is Bb major, so Bbm is not diatonic.

We have Bbm, which is minor, so it might be from another mode.

Another thought: perhaps the Gdim is not a root position diminished chord but functioning as an altered dominant.

Let's list all the chord roots without inversions. So the actual chords are: Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm, Ab, Gdim, Gdim, Eb, Eb, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7, Gdim.

So the sequence: Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Bbm, Ab, Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Dbmaj7, Gdim.

Now, from this, we see Gdim frequently, and it alternates with Eb, and then Bbm and Ab, and then Dbmaj7.

Eb, Ab, Db are all major chords that are a fourth apart? Eb to Ab is fourth, Ab to Db is fourth, so Eb, Ab, Db are like IV, I, V in some key? But Eb is IV of what? If Ab is I, then Eb is V? No, in Ab major, Eb is V, not IV.

If Ab is I, then Eb is V, and Db is IV? But in major key, IV is major, but Db is not IV of Ab; IV of Ab is Db, yes! In Ab major, IV is Db major.

So in Ab major, I Ab, IV Db, V Eb.

And we have Bbm, which is ii in Ab major.

And Gdim, which should be vii in Ab major, but as half-diminished.

But in the progression, we have Gdim as fully diminished, so perhaps it is used as a passing chord or as a secondary diminished.

But let's see the resolution: Gdim to Eb. In Ab major, Gdim should resolve to Ab, but here it resolves to Eb, which is V, so it might be that Gdim is acting as a leading tone to Ab, but resolving to Eb instead? Or perhaps Gdim is a common-tone diminished for Eb.

Another idea: perhaps the Gdim is actually a dominant function chord for Ab, but when it goes to Eb, it might be a deceptive resolution or something.

But let's look at the bass: the bass is almost always G, except when it goes to F for Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F.

So, with bass G, and chords changing, it might be that G is a pedal point or sustained note.

So, over a G pedal, we have various chords: Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7.

Now, what key has a G pedal? But G is not necessarily the tonic.

If we consider the chords over G bass, we can think of the harmony relative to G.

But let's list the chords above G bass:

- Gdim: has G, Bb, Db, E

- Eb/G: has G, Eb, G, Bb? But since bass is G, the chord is Eb major, so notes G, Eb, G, Bb? Actually, the chord tones are Eb, G, Bb, so with bass G, it's G, Eb, G, Bb? But typically, the bass note is part of the chord, so it's fine.

- Bbm/F: but bass is F, so when bass is F, chord is Bbm, so notes F, Bb, Db

- Ab/G: bass G, chord Ab, so notes G, Ab, C, Eb

- Dbmaj7/F: bass F, chord Dbmaj7, so notes F, Db, F, Ab, C? Actually, Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C, so with bass F, it's F, Db, F, Ab, C.

So, when bass is G, the chords are Gdim, Eb, Ab, and when bass is F, chords are Bbm and Dbmaj7.

Now, let's see the overall tonal center. The progression ends on Gdim, so perhaps G is the tonic? But diminished chord as tonic is rare.

Perhaps it's in G minor or something, but Gdim has E natural, which is not in G minor.

Another thought: perhaps the mode is diminished or something, but that's unlikely.

Let's consider the possibility that Gdim is actually a misreading, and it's supposed to be G half-diminished, i.e., Gm7b5.

If Gdim is Gm7b5, then it would be G, Bb, Db, F, which is the vii chord in Ab major.

Then all chords would be diatonic to Ab major: I Ab, ii Bbm, IV Db, V Eb, vii Gm7b5.

And we have Eb/G which is V in first inversion, Bbm/F which is ii in first inversion, Ab/G which is I with seventh in bass, so Imaj7, and Dbmaj7/F which is IVmaj7 in first inversion.

So, this makes sense in Ab major.

But why is it written as Gdim instead of Gm7b5? In some notations, "dim" might be used for half-diminished, but typically "dim" means fully diminished, and half-diminished is "m7b5".

However, in context, it might be that the composer intended half-diminished.

Moreover, in the chord progression, we have Ab/G, which is Abmaj7, and if Gdim is Gm7b5, then the G in the bass is common, and the chord tones include F, which resolves to Eb in Ab chord or something.

Let's see the voice leading.

If Gdim is Gm7b5, notes G, Bb, Db, F.

Then when it goes to Eb/G, notes G, Eb, G, Bb? So from Gm7b5 to Eb: G to G, Bb to Bb, Db to ? no Db, F to Eb? F to Eb is half step down, which is good resolution. Db might move to Bb or something.

Similarly, when Gm7b5 goes to Ab/G, notes G, Ab, C, Eb. So from Gm7b5: G to G, Bb to C? Bb to C is whole step, but could be, Db to Eb? whole step, F to Eb? half step down. So some resolutions are stepwise.

When Gm7b5 goes to Bbm/F, but bass changes to F, so from Gm7b5 to Bbm/F: notes G, Bb, Db, F to F, Bb, Db. So G to F? half step down, Bb to Bb, Db to Db, F to F? so all notes resolve smoothly except G moves to F.

Similarly, when Gm7b5 goes to Dbmaj7/F: notes G, Bb, Db, F to F, Db, F, Ab, C? So G to F, Bb to Ab? half step down, Db to Db, F to F. So smooth voice leading.

And when Gm7b5 goes to itself or to Eb, it also works.

So, if Gdim is actually Gm7b5, then the key is Ab major, and all chords are diatonic.

Moreover, the progression ends on Gm7b5, which is the leading tone chord, and it might resolve to Ab, but it doesn't, so it could be a deceptive ending or something, but in context, it might be acceptable.

Perhaps in the sequence, the Gm7b5 is acting as a predominant or something.

But in Ab major, the vii chord should resolve to I, but here it often goes to V (Eb), which is a common resolution for vii chord in minor keys or in some contexts.

In major keys, vii°6 often resolves to I6, but it can resolve to V sometimes.

So, I think this is plausible.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

But what about the mode? It's major mode.

So, key: Ab major.

But let's confirm the first chord: Gdim. If it's Gm7b5, then it's correct.

In the chord symbols, it's written as Gdim, which might be a shorthand for half-diminished in some contexts, or perhaps it's a mistake.

But in many pop and jazz scores, "dim" can sometimes mean half-diminished, though it's not standard.

To be precise, if it's half-diminished, it should be written as Gm7b5, but since it's written as Gdim, we have to go with that.

However, given the context, I think it's safe to assume it's half-diminished.

Another point: in the progression, we have Bbm/F, which is Bb minor, and in Ab major, ii is Bb minor, so that fits.

And Dbmaj7 is IV maj7, which is common.

So, I'll go with Ab major.

Thus, the key is Ab major, and the mode is major.

The chord progression primarily consists of chords diatonic to Ab major, with Gdim functioning as the leading tone chord (vii°7, which is half-diminished in practice, often notated as Gm7♭5 in jazz and pop contexts). The frequent use of Eb/G (V chord in first inversion), Bbm/F (ii chord in first inversion), Ab/G (I chord with major seventh, equivalent to Abmaj7/G), and Dbmaj7/F (IV chord in first inversion) supports Ab as the tonal center. The bass note G acts as a pedal point throughout much of the progression, reinforcing the voice leading and resolutions characteristic of Ab major.

**Key:** Ab major  
**Mode:** Major
