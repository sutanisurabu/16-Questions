To analyze the key and mode of the given chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G –  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: List all unique chords

- **Gdim** (G° = G–B♭–D♭)
- **Eb/G** (E♭ major with G in the bass = G–B♭–E♭)
- **Bbm/F** (B♭ minor with F in the bass = F–B♭–D♭)
- **Ab/G** (A♭ major with G in the bass = G–C–E♭–A♭) → essentially a G bass under A♭ major = **G7♭9** (or G half-diminished flavor, but more likely a **tritone substitution** or **dominant with altered bass**)
- **Dbmaj7/F** (D♭ major 7 with F in the bass = F–A♭–C–D♭)

So the chords involve notes from **E♭ minor** or **G diminished** (which is symmetrical).

---

### Step 2: Examine the diminished chord

Gdim = G–B♭–D♭  
This is part of the **G°7** (fully diminished seventh): G–B♭–D♭–E

But note: G°7 is **enharmonically equivalent** to:

- B♭°7 (B♭–D♭–E–G)
- D♭°7 (D♭–E–G–B♭)
- E°7 (E–G–B♭–D♭)

This is a **fully diminished seventh chord**, which is **symmetrical every minor third**.

These chords function **as a dominant substitute** in minor keys.

In particular, **G°7** is the **vii°7 of A♭ minor** (since A♭ harmonic minor has G as the leading tone).

But also: **G°7** is the **vii°7 of A♭ major**, but A♭ major doesn’t naturally contain D♭ (wait—it does: A♭ major = A♭ B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G – yes!). But the diminished chord built on G in A♭ major is **G°7?** Actually, in A♭ major, the vii chord is **G°7**: G–B♭–D♭–F♭. But F♭ = E, so yes: G°7 = G–B♭–D♭–E. So it fits A♭ major **harmonically**.

However, we also have **Dbmaj7**—a major 7 chord on D♭.

D♭ major = D♭–F–A♭–C  
→ Chord appears as **Dbmaj7/F**

This suggests **D♭ major** as a tonal center **or** as a **IV chord in A♭ major** (since A♭ major’s IV is D♭).

Also, **Eb** appears as a major chord (Eb/G), which is the **V chord in A♭ major** (E♭ major = V of A♭).

Similarly, **Bbm** is the **ii chord in A♭ major**.

And **Ab/G** is **A♭ major over G**, which is essentially a **G bass under A♭** → this is a **V7/V** or a **dominant pedal**, but more commonly in jazz/pop, this is a **backdoor cadence** or a **tritone bass movement**.

Wait: Ab/G = G in bass, A♭ major above → notes: G–C–E♭–A♭ → this is actually a **G7♭9 without the root?** Not exactly—it's more like a **polychord** or a **slash chord** implying **G as a passing tone**.

But the presence of:

- Eb (V of Ab)
- Bbm (ii of Ab)
- Dbmaj7 (IV of Ab)
- Gdim (vii° of Ab)

**Strongly suggests A♭ major** as the key.

Let’s map to **A♭ major**:

- I = A♭
- ii = B♭m
- IV = D♭
- V = E♭
- vii° = G°

Yes! All chords in the progression are diatonic to **A♭ major** (or its modes).

- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V (first inversion)
- Bbm/F = ii (second inversion)
- Ab/G = I over leading tone (common in cadences—creates strong pull to tonic)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 (first inversion)

So **key = A♭ major**

But the progression **never resolves clearly to A♭**—it ends on **Gdim**, which is **vii°**, creating tension.

Despite that, the **collection of chords** fits **A♭ major**.

### Step 3: Consider mode

Since all chords are diatonic to A♭ major (which is the **Ionian mode**), and there’s no consistent use of notes outside that (e.g., no G natural in a minor context, no modal mixture like ♭6 or ♭7), the mode is likely **Ionian (major)**.

However, note that **Gdim** is used extensively—almost as a pedal or ostinato. This could imply a **diminished scale** or **symmetrical harmony**, but the surrounding chords (Eb, Bbm, Dbmaj7) are clearly from A♭ major.

Thus, the **tonal center** is **A♭**, and the **mode is Ionian (major)**.

### Final Answer:

**Key: A♭ major**  
**Mode: Ionian**
