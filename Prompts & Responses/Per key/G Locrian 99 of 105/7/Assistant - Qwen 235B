Let's analyze the chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### **Given Chord Progression:**

```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

Let’s first identify the **specific chords** and their **bass notes** (since slash chords are used).

---

### **1. Chord Identification**

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db (diminished triad, root G)
- **Eb/G** = Eb–G–Bb with **G in bass** → first inversion of Eb major
- **Bbm/F** = Bb–Db–F with **F in bass** → second inversion of Bb minor
- **Ab/G** = Ab–C–Eb with **G in bass** → Ab major with G in bass → this creates a **G7(sus4)** or **G7** sound (G–Ab–C–Eb ≈ G7b9sus or altered), but more likely used as a **bVII over dominant bass**, or chromatic voice-leading
- **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–Cb (wait: Cb = B) → Db–F–Ab–B → actually **Dbmaj7** (F is the major 3rd), and **F in bass**, so first inversion of Dbmaj7

But here’s something interesting: **Gdim**, **Eb/G**, **Bbm/F**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F** — all of these chords contain tones that relate closely to **G** and **Bb**.

Let’s write out the notes:

---

### **2. Notes in Each Chord**

- **Gdim**: G, Bb, Db  
- **Eb/G**: G, Eb, Bb → so G (bass), Eb, Bb  
- **Bbm/F**: F, Bb, Db → F, Bb, Db  
- **Ab/G**: G, Ab, C, Eb → G, Ab, C, Eb  
- **Dbmaj7/F**: F, Db, F, Ab, C → F, Db, Ab, C

So all the chords contain notes from the **Bb major** or **G minor** scales.

Let’s list all unique pitch classes used:

- G
- Bb
- Db
- Eb
- F
- Ab
- C

Convert to enharmonics for clarity:

- G
- A# (Bb)
- C# (Db)
- D# (Eb)
- F
- G# (Ab)
- C

So we have: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

Now sort the notes: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

That’s:  
**G – Ab – Bb – C – Db – Eb – F**

Now, does this match a known scale?

Try to rearrange from **Bb**:

**Bb – C – Db – Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb**

That’s:  
**Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab**

These are the notes of the **Bb natural minor** scale (which is the **Aeolian mode** of Db major), but let's check:

Wait — **Bb natural minor** is: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

But we have **G natural**, not **Gb**.

Ah! So we have **G**, not **Gb**.

So the scale is:

**Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab**

That’s: **Bb C Db Eb F G Ab**

Compare to **modes of Bb:**

Is this a mode of **F melodic minor**?

Try **F melodic minor**: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, E

No D or E — we have **Db**, not D.

Wait — let’s try **Eb harmonic minor**:

Eb harmonic minor: **Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, D → Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, B (Cb), D**

No — we have **G natural**, not **Gb**, and no D.

Wait — our notes:  
**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

That’s **7 notes**.

Let’s try arranging from **G**:

**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

That’s a **G scale** with:

- G
- Ab (b2)
- Bb (b3)
- C (4)
- Db (b5)
- Eb (b6)
- F (b7)

So: **G Ab Bb C Db Eb F**

That’s the **G diminished scale (half-whole)** — but that’s octatonic (8 notes). We’re missing one.

We don’t have **B natural** or **D natural**.

Wait — perhaps it's not a standard major mode. Let’s look at **function**.

---

### **3. Harmonic Analysis**

Let’s look at the chords again:

- **Gdim** appears frequently — this is a **common tone diminished chord**.
- Often, **Gdim** functions as a **common-tone diminished chord** (ct°) resolving to **G minor or major**, but here it’s followed by **Eb/G**.
- **Eb/G** is a first inversion **Eb major** — Eb major is **III** in **C minor**, but we don’t see C minor here.
- **Bbm/F** is **iv** in **F minor**, but again — not sure.
- **Dbmaj7/F** is a surprising chord — **Dbmaj7** is diatonic to **Eb major** (IV), or **Bb minor** (bVI), etc.

But here’s a key observation:

**Gdim – Eb/G – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Dbmaj7/F**

Let’s see intervallic movement from bass:

Bass line:
- G (Gdim)
- G (Gdim)
- G (Eb/G)
- G (Eb/G)
- G (Gdim)
- G (Gdim)
- F (Bbm/F)
- G (Ab/G) ← wait, **Ab/G** has **G** in bass
- G (Gdim)
- G (Gdim)
- G (Eb/G)
- G (Eb/G)
- G (Gdim)
- G (Gdim)
- F (Dbmaj7/F)
- G (Gdim)

So bass is mostly **G**, then moves to **F**, back to **G**.

So we’re **tonicizing G**, and the F bass is a brief departure.

Now look at **Ab/G** — chord is Ab major over G bass → **G–Ab–C–Eb**

That’s **G7sus(b9)** or **G7 alt** — very close to a **dominant 7th chord** with alterations.

Similarly, **Dbmaj7/F** = **F–Ab–C–Db** — if we think of **G** as tonic, Db is b5, Ab is b3, C is 4th, so not clearly functional, unless...

Wait — **Dbmaj7** is enharmonically related to **C#maj7**, but doesn't help.

But here’s a better idea:

Could **Dbmaj7/F** be functioning as a **Neapolitan chord**?

Yes! In **G minor**, the **Neapolitan chord** is **Ab major** (bII), usually in first inversion: **Ab/C** or **Ab with C in bass**.

But here we have **Dbmaj7/F** — that’s **Db, F, Ab, C**, so actually **Dbmaj7 in first inversion (F in bass)**

But **Dbmaj7** is **not the Neapolitan** — **Ab major** is the Neapolitan of G.

Wait — unless this is **in G minor**, and **Dbmaj7** is the **bVIImaj7** — in G minor, the bVII chord is **F major**, but **F7** is common.

**Db** is **bV** in G minor — not typically major 7th.

This is not fitting.

Let’s try another approach.

---

### **4. Look for Tonal Center**

The chord **Gdim** appears 8 times — very frequently.

Diminished chords are often **passing** or **common-tone** chords.

But here, **Gdim** is recurring and seems structural.

But **Gdim** is symmetric = stacks of minor 3rds: G–Bb–Db–Fb (E)

It can resolve to chords that share two notes.

Gdim shares 2 notes with:

- **A major** (A–C#–E) — no, C# not in our chords
- **Bb major** (Bb–D–F) — D not present
- **C minor** (C–Eb–G) → shares G and Bb — yes
- **Eb major** (Eb–G–Bb) → shares G, Bb — yes
- **G minor** → shares G, Bb
- **B diminished** — no
- **Db major** → Db–F–Ab — shares Db and Bb? Bb not in Db major

Wait — **Gdim** and **Eb/G** share **G** and **Bb** — very strong.

So **Gdim** can act as a **common-tone diminished chord** (**ct°7**) with **Eb major**, meaning it **decorates or embellishes Eb/G**, but in this case, Gdim comes **before** Eb/G, repeatedly.

So perhaps **Eb/G** is the tonal center? But the bass is still G.

Wait — chord progression:

**Gdim → Eb/G**

This is a very common **common-tone diminished chord** (ct°7) resolving to a major chord a **minor third apart**.

Gdim to Eb: both share **G** and **Bb**, and the **Db** in Gdim resolves down to **C** (not there) or up to **D**? But chord is Eb — contains **Eb**.

Actually, **Db → Eb** is a **half-step up** — so **Db in Gdim → Eb in Eb chord** = strong resolution.

So **Gdim → Eb** = **ct°7 (on G) → Eb** = very strong **common-tone resolution**, where G and Bb are common, and Db moves to Eb.

So **Eb major** is being emphasized.

But then later we have **Bbm/F**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F**

Let’s see:

- **Eb → Bb minor** → possible — V–i in Bb minor?
- **Bb minor → Ab major** → iv–III in Bb minor? Possible
- **Ab → Dbmaj7** → Ab to Db is **V–I** in **Db major**?

Ab is **V** of **Db** — yes!

So **Ab → Dbmaj7** is **V–I in Db major**

But then **Dbmaj7/F → Gdim** — Db to G is tritone; Gdim is not related directly.

But **F** is the bass — **F** to **G** (bass) is step up.

Alternatively, are we in **G**-centered harmony with chromatic mediants?

Let’s try this:

Suppose the **tonic** is **G minor**.

Then:

- **Gdim** = **vii°** of Ab major — no
- In **G minor**, **Gdim** is **i°**, possible but rare as a tonic chord
- **Eb major** = **VI** of G minor — yes! VI in G minor is **Eb major**
- **Bbm/F** = **ii** in G minor — ii is **Am** — no, Bb minor is **iii**, not diatonic
— G natural minor: **G Ab Bb C D Eb F G** → so chords:
  - i: Gm
  - ii°: Adim
  - III: Bb
  - iv: Cm
  - v: Dm
  - VI: Eb
  - VII: F

Ah! So in **G natural minor**, the **VI chord is Eb major**, and **VII is F major**

We have:

- **Eb/G** = **VI** in first inversion
- **F** in bass with Bbm: **Bbm/F** → Bb minor is **III**, but in G minor, **III is Bb major**, not minor. So Bb minor is **not diatonic** to G minor.

So **Bbm** suggests **modal mixture**.

But **Ab/G** — Ab major is **bVII** in G minor — yes! bVII is common in minor keys.

Ab is bVII of G — often used, e.g., in rock: i–bVII–bVI–V

And **Dbmaj7** — **Db** is **bVI** in G minor — and bVI is major in harmonic or melodic minor? In G harmonic minor: F#, not Db.

No — **Db is bVI**, which is **not** in any form of G minor.

G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F#

No Db.

So **Db** is not in G minor.

So that doesn’t work.

---

### **Try: C minor**

Let’s try key of **C minor**.

C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb

Chords:

- i: Cm
- ii°: Ddim
- III: Eb
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm
- VI: Ab
- VII: Bb

Our chords:

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db → G is **V** in C minor, but **Gdim** is **v°**, not the dominant — dominant in minor is usually **G major** (harmonic minor)
- But if using natural minor, v is minor, not diminished. Gdim is not in C natural minor.

But **Gdim** could be a **common-tone diminished chord** for **Eb** or **G**.

In C minor, **Eb major** is **III** — which we have as **Eb/G**

So **Eb/G** = III in first inversion

**Bbm/F** = Bb minor — but in C minor, VII is **Bb major**, not minor.

Again, Bbm is not diatonic.

**Ab/G** = Ab major — that’s **VI** in C minor

**Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C → Db is **bII** in C minor = **Neapolitan chord**!

And **Neapolitan chord** is typically in **first inversion**, **Db/F** — which is exactly what we have: **Dbmaj7/F**

Yes! In **C minor**, the **Neapolitan** is **Db major**, and commonly used as **Db/F**, i.e., first inversion.

So **Dbmaj7/F** is an **expanded Neapolitan chord** (with the maj7 added for color)

Then what about **Gdim**?

In **C minor**, if we raise the 7th (harmonic minor), we get **G major** or **G7** — the **V chord**

But here we have **Gdim**, not G major.

But **Gdim** shares notes with **G7**: G, B, D, F — but Gdim is G, Bb, Db

Not the same.

However, **Gdim** can be a **common-tone diminished chord** (ct°) for **Eb** (III)

Since **Gdim** and **Eb** share **G** and **Bb**, and **Db → Eb** resolves up, it's a common way to embellish the **III chord**.

So the progression makes sense in **C minor**:

- **Gdim – Eb/G** = ornamentation of **III**
- **Bbm/F** = but in C minor, **Bb** is **VII**, which is **major**, not minor. We have **Bbm**, so maybe modal mixture?
- Wait — **F** is also the bass — so chord on F: **Bbm/F** is **F–Bb–Db**, so **F minor 6th?** Not quite.

Alternatively, in **C minor**, **Bb major** is diatonic, but **Bb minor** is not — so this might be a chromatic alteration.

But let’s see the full sequence:

In **C minor**:

1. **Gdim → Eb/G** — common-tone dim to III
2. **Gdim → Bbm/F** — not standard
3. **Bbm/F → Ab/G** — Bbm to Ab — Ab is **VI**, Bbm is not diatonic
4. **Ab/G → Dbmaj7/F** — Ab to Db is **V–I in Db**, or **bVI–bII** in C? No
   But **Db/F** = **bII6** in C minor — Neapolitan
   So **Ab → Db/F** is not a standard progression in C minor

But earlier: **Ab** is **VI**, **Db** is **bII** — no direct functional link.

But wait — the **Ab/G** chord: Ab–C–Eb with G in bass.

Ab–C–Eb is **Ab major**, G in bass.

Intervals from G: G–Ab (m2), G–C (P4), G–Eb (m6)

This is unusual.

But G to Ab is a semitone — could be a **passing bass tone**

Perhaps the **bass is moving: G → F**, and chords are changing above.

But let’s consider **harmonic rhythm**:

The progression feels like it **repeats**, with variations.

Another idea: **Modal: Bb Dorian?**

Bb Dorian: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab

Notes: **Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab**

Compare to our chord tones: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F — **exactly the same notes!**

Yes!

**Bb Dorian** = Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab

Our notes: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F → all present.

So this scale is **identical** to **Bb Dorian**.

Now check if the chords fit in **Bb Dorian**:

- **Gdim**: G–Bb–Db → G is the **7th degree** in Bb Dorian
  - vii° chord in Dorian? Dorian has i, ii, bIII, IV, v, vi°, VII
  - For Bb Dorian: i = Bbm, ii = Cm, bIII = Db, IV = Eb, v = Fm, vi° = Gdim, VII = Ab
- Yes! **Gdim = vi°**
- **Eb/G** = Eb major with G in bass → **IV chord**, first inversion → **IV6**
- **Bbm/F** = Bb minor with F in bass → **i chord**, second inversion → **i6/4**
- **Ab/G** = Ab major with G in bass → **bVII chord**, third inversion? Or just **bVII** with G in bass = seventh in bass
  - In Bb Dorian, **bVII = Ab** (major)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C → **bIII chord** in Bb Dorian: bIII = Db major — yes!
  - And **F in bass** = first inversion → **bIII6**

So let's map:

- **Gdim** = **vi°**
- **Eb/G** = **IV6**
- **Bbm/F** = **i6/4**
- **Ab/G** = **bVII** with 7th in bass (G is 13th of Ab)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = **bIII6** (with added 7)

**All these chords are diatonic to Bb Dorian!**

Yes! **Bb Dorian** has:
- i: Bbm
- ii: Cm
- bIII: Db
- IV: Eb
- v: Fm
- vi°: Gdim
- bVII: Ab

So:
- Gdim = vi°
- Eb/G = IV6
- Bbm/F = i6/4
- Ab/G = bVII (with G in bass)
- Dbmaj7/F = bIII6 (with C as 7th)

Everything fits!

The progression emphasizes **G** in the bass, but the **harmonic center** is **Bb**, with **Bbm/F** clearly establishing **Bb minor** as tonic.

The use of **dorian mode** is confirmed by the **major IV chord (Eb)** and **major bVII (Ab)** and **major bIII (Db)** — characteristic of Dorian.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: Bb**  
**Mode: Dorian**

So the progression is in **Bb Dorian**.

This makes all chords diatonic and explains the modal color (raised 6th compared to natural minor).

---

### 🎵 Summary:

- **Tonic chord**: Bbm (implied, especially in "Bbm/F")
- **Dorian characteristics**: Major IV (Eb), major bVII (Ab), major bIII (Db)
- **All chords fit** in Bb Dorian scale
- **Bass emphasis on G** is for voice-leading and color, not tonal center

> **Key and mode: Bb Dorian** ✅
