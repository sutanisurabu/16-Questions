This chord progression:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

is highly chromatic and uses a lot of diminished and altered chords, but we can analyze its harmonic logic and find the **most likely key and mode**.

---

### Step 1: List the chords with their roots and bass notes

| Chord         | Root | Bass | Function |
|---------------|------|------|----------|
| Gdim          | G    | G    | viio7 or diminished tonic |
| Gdim          | G    | G    | — |
| Eb/G          | Eb   | G    | Eb minor 7 flat 5? Or inverted half-diminished? |
| Eb/G          | Eb   | G    | — |
| Gdim          | G    | G    | — |
| Gdim          | G    | G    | — |
| Bbm/F         | Bb   | F    | Bb minor with F in bass → F is 5th of Bb |
| Ab/G          | Ab   | G    | Ab major with G in bass → G is b7 of Ab |
| Gdim          | G    | G    | — |
| Gdim          | G    | G    | — |
| Eb/G          | Eb   | G    | — |
| Eb/G          | Eb   | G    | — |
| Gdim          | G    | G    | — |
| Gdim          | G    | G    | — |
| Dbmaj7/F      | Db   | F    | Db major 7 with F in bass → F is major 3rd of Db |
| Gdim          | G    | G    | — |

---

### Step 2: Identify common tones and relationships

Notice that **Gdim** appears very frequently — it's the “anchor” chord. The bass note is almost always **G**, even when the chord changes.

Let’s look at the **bass line**:

> **G – G – G – G – G – G – F – G – G – G – G – G – G – G – F – G**

So bass is mostly **G**, with occasional **F**.

That suggests the **tonal center is G**, even though the chords aren’t diatonic to G major/minor.

Let’s examine the **chords over G bass**:

1. **Gdim** → G, Bb, Db (viio° of A minor, or tritone substitution)
2. **Eb/G** → G, Bb, Db → wait, this is the **same notes as Gdim!**
   - Eb/G = G, Bb, Eb → Actually, **G, Bb, Eb**
   - That’s **not** Gdim! Gdim is G, Bb, Db

Ah! Here's the **critical mistake** in casual reading.

Let’s write out **actual notes** of each chord:

---

### Step 3: Write out the actual chord tones

| Chord         | Notes (from root)          | Actual Notes (with bass)        |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Gdim          | G–Bb–Db                    | G–Bb–Db                         |
| Gdim          | G–Bb–Db                    | G–Bb–Db                         |
| Eb/G          | Eb–Gb–Bb → bass G          | G–Eb–Gb–Bb? Wait — **Eb/G is an Eb diminished triad with G in bass?** |
|               |                            | → Actually: **G–Eb–Gb**?        |
|               |                            | But **Eb dim = Eb–Gb–Bb** → placing G in bass ≠ G in chord |
| **Wait**: Is Eb/G even possible? | | |

Let’s resolve this.

An **Eb/G** chord implies: **Eb major or minor triad with G in the bass**.

- **Eb major triad**: Eb–G–Bb → so Eb/G = G–Eb–Bb → that's **G, Eb, Bb**
- **Eb minor triad**: Eb–Gb–Bb → Eb/G = G–Gb–Bb → **G, Gb, Bb**
- **Eb diminished triad** (Eb°): Eb–Gb–Bbb → not likely

So most likely, **Eb/G = G–Eb–Bb** — that’s **G minor 6 / Eb major 6** — also called **Gm6**, since **G–Bb–Eb = Gm6**.

Wait — G–Bb–Eb = **G minor 6** (Gm6). That’s a standard chord.

But earlier we had **Gdim = G–Bb–Db**

So now we have two different chords both with G bass:

- **Gdim = G–Bb–Db**
- **Eb/G = G–Eb–Bb = Gm6**

So let’s list **actual sets**:

### Full chord tones analysis:

| Chord         | Notes                     | Quality                     |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                 | G diminished triad          |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                 | —                           |
| Eb/G          | G, Bb, Eb                 | G minor 6 (Gm6)             |
| Eb/G          | G, Bb, Eb                 | —                           |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                 | —                           |
| Gdim          | G, Bb, Db                 | —                           |
| Bbm/F         | F, Bb, D                  | F major triad?              |
|               | Bbm = Bb–Db–F → bass F → F, Bb, Db | So **F, Bb, Db = F half-diminished 7th? F–A–C–Eb?** No — Bbm is Bb–Db–F → bass F: F, Bb, Db → that’s **F–Bb–Db = F diminished triad!** |
| Ab/G          | Ab, C, Eb → bass G → G, Ab, C, Eb | G, Ab, C, Eb = **G7b9?** Or Ab7 with G bass → **Ab7/G = G–Bb–Db–F → but we have Ab,C,Eb** |
Wait — Ab major chord: Ab–C–Eb. Bass G: **G, Ab, C, Eb**

That’s **G, Ab, C, Eb** → this is **G7b9 (without 5th)**? Or **G altered**?

- G7 = G–B–D–F
- This is G–Ab–C–Eb → so no B, no D → **not a 7th chord**.
Actually, G–Ab–C–Eb = **G half-diminished 7th with b9?** No — half-dim is G–Bb–Db–F.

This chord is **G–Ab–C–Eb** → intervals: root, b9, 3rd, b5? That’s **G7b9 with no 5th and no 7th?** Doesn’t make sense.

Better interpretation: **Ab maj7 with G bass** → that’s **Abmaj7/G** = **G, Ab, C, Eb** — yes: Abmaj7 = Ab–C–Eb–G → so **G is the 7th**! So this is **Ab major 7th in third inversion**.

So: **Abmaj7/G = G, Ab, C, Eb**

Similarly, **Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, Db → bass F → F, Ab, C, Db = **F minor 7b5?** No — Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C → bass F = **F, Ab, Db, C**

Which is **F, Ab, C, Db** — that’s actually **Dbmaj7/F → F is the 3rd of Db**, so this is just a Db major 7 chord with 3rd in bass.

Let’s reclassify everything with **correct spelling**:

| Chord         | Actual Notes              | Harmonic Function                    |
|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Gdim          | G–Bb–Db                   | viio° / tonic substitute             |
| Gdim          | G–Bb–Db                   | —                                    |
| **Eb/G**      | G–Bb–Eb                   | **Gm6** (G minor 6)                  |
| **Eb/G**      | G–Bb–Eb                   | —                                    |
| Gdim          | G–Bb–Db                   | —                                    |
| Gdim          | G–Bb–Db                   | —                                    |
| **Bbm/F**     | F–Bb–Db                   | **Fdim** (F diminished triad → F–Ab–Cb? Wait) — **Bbm = Bb–Db–F → bass F = F, Bb, Db** → F–Bb–Db = **F diminished / half-diminished?** → F–Ab–Cb? No — Bb–Db–F = **F diminished triad is F–Ab–Cb**, which is **not** this. |

Wait — **Bb minor triad = Bb–Db–F** → so bass F → notes: F, Bb, Db

- F to Bb = perfect 4th
- F to Db = diminished 5th

→ So **F–Bb–Db = F diminished triad**? But F diminished triad = F–Ab–Cb (Cb = B)

But **Db ≠ Ab** → so **F–Bb–Db is not a diatonic diminished triad**

But — **F–Bb–Db = F7b5** (F–A–C–Eb is F7, so F–Bb–Db is just triad version — but it’s actually the **tritone substitution** for **C7**!)

Let’s think in terms of **voice leading** and **chromatic motion**.

---

### Step 4: Look for key implications — what key could make this make sense?

We see repeated use of **Gdim** and **Gm6**, alternating.

Also: **Bbm/F = F, Bb, Db** → this is **F diminished**? No — let’s map it to **Db maj7**, because Db is the root of a key.

Look at this progression:

→ **Gdim → Gdim → Gm6 → Gm6 → Gdim → Gdim → Bbm/F → Ab/G → Gdim → Gdim → Gm6 → Gm6 → Gdim → Gdim → Dbmaj7/F → Gdim**

Now notice:

- **Bbm/F** → bass F, chord = Bbm → **F is the 5th of Bb**
- **Ab/G** → bass G, chord = Ab → G is the 7th of Ab → **Ab7?**
- **Dbmaj7/F** → bass F, chord = Dbmaj7 → F is the 3rd of Db

Wait — here’s the key insight:

Look at the **chords with F bass**:

- **Bbm/F = F–Bb–Db**
- **Dbmaj7/F = F–Ab–C–Db**

Note the **overlap of Db and F**.

Now look at **Ab/G = G–Ab–C–Eb**

And **Gdim = G–Bb–Db**

Now — what scale includes: G, Bb, Db, Eb, Ab, C, F?

That’s a **whole tone scale**? Or **octatonic (diminished)**?

Let’s consider: **G harmonic minor**? G–A–B–C–D–Eb–F# → doesn’t fit.

**G melodic minor**? G–A–B–C–D–E–F# → no.

But what if the root is **Db**?

Let’s try **Db major**:

- Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab–Bb–C

Now check the chords:

- **Gdim**: G–Bb–Db → G is the **#5** of Db? Not in scale. But Db is in the chord!
- **Gm6**: G–Bb–Eb → G, Bb, Eb — Eb is in Db major scale. Bb is in scale. G is not.
- **Bbm**: Bb–Db–F — all in Db major! Yes!
- **Ab/G**: Ab–C–Eb–G — Ab, C, Eb are in Db major. G? Not in Db major.
- **Dbmaj7**: Db–F–Ab–C — that’s **exactly Db major scale**!

So Db major scale = **Db–Eb–F–Gb–Ab–Bb–C**

Now look at each chord in context of Db major:

- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db → G is **outside** (Db major has Gb, not G)
- **Gm6** = G–Bb–Eb → G outside
- **Bbm/F** = Bb–Db–F → this is **ii°7 in Db major?** Bbm is chord iv? Db major: chords are:
  - I: Db
  - ii: Ebm
  - iii: Fm
  - IV: Gb
  - V: Ab
  - vi: Bbm
  - vii°: C°

So **Bbm** is **vi** in Db major → YES!

And **F** is the 5th of Bb? But we have **Bbm/F** = bass F → F is the **3rd** of Db.

Wait — **Bbm triad = Bb–Db–F** → F is the 5th? No — F is the **major 3rd** of Db? Wait, Bbm triad is root Bb, root 3rd Db, 5th F → so F is the **5th**.

So **Bbm/F** = **vi triad with 5th in bass** → common in classical.

Similarly, **Dbmaj7/F** = F–Ab–C–Db → F is the **3rd** of Db → so it’s **I7 in 3rd inversion** → very smooth!

Now the **Ab/G**: Ab–C–Eb–G → **Ab major 7th**? But in Db major, Ab is the **V chord** → Ab major = V

Ab major 7th = Ab–C–Eb–G → yes, which is **V7** if we think of G as the 7th — but Ab7 = Ab–C–Eb–Gb → this has **G natural**, not Gb!

G natural, not Gb — so **Abmaj7**, not Ab7.

Abmaj7 = Ab–C–Eb–G — but in **Db major**, Ab chord is naturally **Ab major** → so **Abmaj7** is a major 7th chord built on V → that’s **modal mixture** or **borrowed**.

But G natural is **not in Db major** — Db major has **Gb**, not G.

So **G natural** is **outside** — meaning **chromatic passing** or **modal interchange**.

So perhaps this is **not in Db major**, but **Db Lydian?** or **Db Dorian?**

Wait — **G natural** is the **leading tone to Ab**? Ab is V — so G to Ab is **leading tone to V** — that suggests **G is leading to Ab** — so **key maybe Ab?**

Let’s try **Ab major**:

Ab major: Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G

Oh! **G is the 7th of Ab!** So:

- **Ab/G** = Abmaj7 in 3rd inversion — that’s normal in Ab major!

Now check if other chords fit in Ab major:

- **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C → but in Ab major: Db is the **IV chord** → Db major is **not diatonic**! Ab major: IV is Db minor! So **Db major** is borrowed.

But **Ab major** has: G natural — which is in Ab major scale!

So now:

**Ab major scale**: Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G

Now check chords:

- **Gdim = G–Bb–Db** → G (7th of Ab), Bb (2nd), Db (4th) → G–Bb–Db = **G half-diminished 7th without 5th**? Actually, **G–Bb–Db–F** would be Gm7b5, which is **viio7 in Ab major** — yes!

In Ab major: viio7 = G–Bb–Db–F → so **Gdim** (without the F) is **the top 3 notes of viio7** — a common substitution.

- **Gm6 = G–Bb–Eb** → G, Bb, Eb → Eb is the 5th in Ab major — but here Eb is major 3rd of C? Not directly.

Wait — **G–Bb–Eb = G minor 6th** → in Ab major: the chord **Fm** is diatonic (vi), **Bbm7** is vii7 — but Gm6 is **not diatonic**.

Gm6 would require C natural and Eb natural — in Ab major, Eb is **Eb**, C is **C**, G is G → so yes, Gm6 is **G–Bb–C–Eb?** No — Gm6 is **G–Bb–D–Eb?** No — **G minor 6 = G–Bb–D–E?** No!

Standard minor 6: **Root–minor3rd–perfect5th–major6th**

→ **Gm6 = G–Bb–D–E**

But earlier we thought Eb/G = G–Bb–Eb → but that’s G–Bb–Eb — **no D!**

So **G–Bb–Eb** = **G diminished minor 6?** Not standard.

Actually:

- **G–Bb–Eb** = **G half-diminished 5th with added 6th?** G–Bb–Eb is **Gm7b5 without 7th?** It’s a **G° triad with Eb?** Bb and Eb are a tritone — plus G.

It’s actually **G°/Eb** — but **Eb/G** is just inversion of **G° with Eb?**

Wait — **G–Bb–Eb** is **not a standard chord**. Let’s calculate intervals:

- G–Bb: minor 3rd
- Bb–Eb: perfect 4th
- G–Eb: diminished 6th

So this is a **G diminished triad with Eb instead of Db**? G–Bb–Db is dim, but G–Bb–Eb is G–Bb–**#4** (since Eb = #4 over G).

So **G–Bb–Eb = G°#5?** G–Bb–E natural would be G°#5, Eb is **double flat**? No — Eb = enharmonic to **D#**.

Wait — **G–Bb–D#** would be G°#5.

But **Eb = D#** → so **G–Bb–Eb = G°#5** → **G half-diminished with #5?** That’s not standard, but it’s **G altered**.

This is getting too messy.

---

### Better path: **Look at the bass line motion**

Bass: G – G – G – G – G – G – F – G – G – G – G – G – G – G – F – G

So: **G is tonic**, **F is chromatic passing tone**

Now — **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C → **F is 3rd of Db**

**Bbm/F** = Bb–Db–F → **F is 5th of Bb**

Both chords **share F in bass** — but what’s the **resolution?**

From **Bbm/F → Ab/G**: Ab is a half-step above G → so **F → G** bass movement — very common.

Then **Ab/G → Gdim** — so **Ab → G** — down a half step.

So **Ab–G motion** — so perhaps **Gb** is a passing tone?

What if the key is **G minor**? But then we have **Dbmaj7** — which has C natural — G minor has F# and C#.

C natural is **not** in G minor.

Wait — **G dorian**? G–A–Bb–C–D–E–F — has **C natural, F natural**!

Check if **G Dorian** works.

**G Dorian**: G–A–Bb–C–D–E–F

Now, let's map the chords:

1. **Gdim**: G–Bb–Db — Db is **not in G Dorian** (has Bb, F, C — no Db)
2. **Gm6**: G–Bb–Eb — Eb? Should be E natural — no Eb.

So doesn’t fit.

Wait — what **scale contains G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, Db, C, Ab**? That’s too many.

**Octatonic (diminished) scale?** — alternating whole and half steps.

There are two octatonic scales:

- Half-whole: starting on G → G–Ab–Bb–B–C#–D–E–F#

- Whole-half: G–A–Bb–C–C#–E–F–G#

We have notes: G, Bb, Db, Eb, Ab, F, C, Db — so: **G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C**

That’s **G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C** — that’s **7 of 8 notes**.

What scale has: G, Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, F, C? That’s mostly **Half-Whole diminished**:  
G–Ab–Bb–B–C#–D–E–F# → doesn't match.

Try **Whole-Half diminished starting on Bb**:

Bb–C–Db–D–Eb–F–Gb–G

Now compare our notes: **G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C**

From this scale: Bb–C–Db–D–Eb–F–Gb–G

Contains: **Bb, Db, Eb, F, G, C** — that’s 6 of our notes.

Missing **Ab** — has **Gb**, not Ab.

So not perfect.

But — what if the key is **Db major**, and we’re **borrowing** from **G dorian** or **G harmonic minor**?

Actually, here is the **most likely and elegant analysis**:

---

## ✅ Final Answer:

### **Key: Db Major**
### **Mode: Mixolydian flavor with chromatic passing tones (tonal center G, but functional center Db)**

Wait — but we keep returning to **Gdim**, and the bass hovers on G.

The **only chord that is diatonic and tonally strong is Dbmaj7** — and the progression **ends** on it.

Also, **Dbmaj7/F** is **I7 in 3rd inversion** — a smooth, resolved sound.

And **Bbm/F** is **vi triad with 5th in bass** — very common in classical progressions.

So the **functional key is Db major**, even though the **tonic feel is ambiguous**.

The **Gdim** and **Gm6** are **chromatic passing chords** that act as **applied dominants or upper neighbors** to Ab and Db.

Specifically:

- **Gdim = viio7 of Ab (Gb is the 7th in Gm7b5, but written as Gdim)** — so **Gdim is viio7/Ab** → **secondary leading tone to V**
- **Ab/G = Abmaj7** → V chord of Db major? But Ab is the **V chord** in Db major → it's **diatonic**.
- But **Abmaj7** has **G natural**, which is the **major 7th of Ab**, whereas **Ab7** would have Gb — so it’s **Ab major 7**, not dominant 7.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = **I7 with 3rd in bass** → final resolution!

So the entire progression may be interpreted as:

> **Chromatic approach to V-I**, where:
> - **Gdim** = viio° of **Ab** (leading to V)
> - **Ab/G** = Vmaj7 (not V7, due to color)
> - **Dbmaj7/F** = **I7** — tonic resolution

**This is not a traditional key** — but **Db major is the tonal center**.

The progression is **tonal**, but uses chromatic passing chords to reach **I**.

The **Gdim** and **Gm6** chords are essentially **embellishments** around the **Ab–Db** cadence.

---

## ✅ Most accurate conclusion:

> **Key: Db Major**  
> **Mode: Major (Ionian)** — with heavy chromaticism, using **secondary leading tones** (Gdim → V) and **tonal center shifting** to G for tension  
> The progression is a **chromatic approach to a V–I cadence in Db major**, with **G** acting as a **chromatic passing tone** or **secondary dominant root** leading to Ab (V), then resolving to Db (I).

### The **strongest cadence is Abmaj7 → Dbmaj7**, which is **Vmaj7 → Imaj7** — an **authentic cadence** with added color.

So, even though Gdim is prominent, it's **not the tonic** — it's a **chromatic neighbor**.

---

## 💎 Final Answer:

> **Key: Db Major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (Major)**  
>  
> **Analysis**: The progression is a chromatic embellishment around the cadence **Abmaj7 → Dbmaj7** (Vmaj7 → Imaj7). The Gdim and Eb/G (Gm6) chords function as secondary chromatic passing chords, creating tension and motion toward the V–I resolution. The tonic is Db, and the mode is major. This is an example of extended chromaticism in a tonal context, typical of film music, jazz ballads, or romantic-era chromatic harmony.

It’s **not** in G minor, nor is it G tonal — Db is the resolution point.
