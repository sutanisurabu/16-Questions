This chord progression is **Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**.

To determine the key and mode, let's analyze the chords, focusing on the quality (major, minor, diminished) and any shared or altered notes.

### Chord Analysis

| Chord | Notes | Typical Function in Major/Minor |
|---|---|---|
| **Gdim** | G - Bb - Db | Diminished triad (vii° in minor/harmonic major) |
| **Eb/G** | G - Bb - Eb | Eb major in first inversion (III in C minor, bVI in G minor) |
| **Bbm/F** | F - Bb - Db | Bb minor in first inversion (ii in Ab major, iv in F minor) |
| **Ab/G** | G - Ab - C | Ab Major diad/triad over G (bII or bIII related, complex) |
| **Dbmaj7/F** | F - Ab - C - Eb | Db Major 7th in third inversion (bVIIM7 in Eb minor, bVIM7 in F minor) |

### Analyzing the Shared Pitch Collections

The notes present across most of the chords are: **G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C**.

Let's look at the prevalent intervals:

1.  **G Diminished:** G - Bb - Db is everywhere. This is a strong indicator of a diminished or minor key center focused around D, G, or B (C harmonic minor often uses Gdim as vii°).
2.  **Eb Major Triad:** G - Bb - Eb is repeated frequently (Eb/G).
3.  **Bb Minor Triad:** Bb - Db - F is present (Bbm/F).
4.  **Db Major 7th:** Db - F - Ab - C (Dbmaj7/F).

These collection of notes (**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**) perfectly match the **F Harmonic Minor** scale.

*   F Harmonic Minor: F - G - Ab - Bb - C - **Db** - **E** (Wait, there is no E natural in the chords, but there is an Eb).

Let's re-evaluate based on the exact notes **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**. This collection is the **F Phrygian Dominant** (or **Ab Harmonic Minor** starting on F, or **Db Lydian b2** starting on F).

*   **F Phrygian Dominant** (5th mode of Ab Harmonic Minor): F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb. **(Matches perfectly!)**

### Determining the Key Center

The progression is dominated by **Gdim** and chords derived from **Eb Major** (Gdim shares two notes with Eb major: G and Bb).

1.  The frequent appearance and resolution of **Gdim** (vii° chord) usually points to the root of the major/minor key being a half step above or a whole step below the G.
    *   If Gdim is vii°, the key is **Ab minor** (Ab - Bb - Cb - Db - Eb - Fb - G) - This key matches the notes well, but the key center is usually the root of the progression.
2.  **Dbmaj7/F** and **Eb/G** are strong chords that usually function as subdominant or tonic substitutes. This suggests a tonal center built on F, Eb, or Ab.

If we analyze the root movement and common practice:

*   The progression begins and ends on **Gdim**.
*   The overall harmonic collection is **F Phrygian Dominant**.
*   In this mode, the tonic is **F**.
    *   **Gdim** is the ii° chord (G - Bb - Db).
    *   **Eb/G** is the bVII chord (Eb - G - Bb).
    *   **Bbm/F** is the iv chord (Bb - Db - F).
    *   **Dbmaj7/F** is the bVI M7 chord (Db - F - Ab - C).

The progression strongly cycles around the diminished harmony built on G and related minor/flat chords, all of which function clearly within the **F Phrygian Dominant** mode.

### Conclusion

The notes used throughout the progression define the **F Phrygian Dominant** scale (F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb).

While the progression doesn't start or end on an F chord, the usage of ii° (Gdim), bVII (Eb), iv (Bbm), and bVI (Dbmaj7) confirms that **F** is the modal center.

**Key and Mode:**

*   **Key Center:** **F**
*   **Mode:** **Phrygian Dominant** (or Spanish Phrygian)
