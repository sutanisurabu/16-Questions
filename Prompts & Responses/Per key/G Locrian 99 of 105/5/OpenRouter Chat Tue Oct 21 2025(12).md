### Reasoning

**Interpreting chord progression**

I need to interpret the chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

I suspect it might be in Eb minor based on the chords used. I've noted repeated G diminished chords and others like Eb/G and Bbm/F, which indicate inversions with specific bass notes. For instance, Eb/G suggests a first inversion of the Eb major chord, while Ab/G could function as a tritone-type neighbor in a Lydian context.**Analyzing Ab major chord**

I'm realizing that the Ab major triad with a G bass likely represents an Abmaj7 chord but without the C. Given that the Ab major scale includes G as the major seventh, it could also be interpreted as a polychord or even a G7sus4(b9). 

The interval between G and Ab is a minor second, while the notes Ab, C, and Eb suggest a G7(b9, sus4, b13) sound. This gives it a typical V7alt sus character in the key of C minor, and there's a lot of movement around Eb, Db, and Bb minor to consider. The Gdim chord makes me think it's a fully diminished triad too!**Clarifying chord functions**

I realize the diminished triad G-Bb-Db serves as the leading-tone diminished triad to Ab. In the context of Ab major, Gdim is the vii° chord. Now, if we look at Eb/G, I initially thought it might be the tonic, but it's actually the dominant in this key. Eb is the V chord in Ab major, and with G in the bass, Eb/G becomes the V6 chord, putting the leading tone in the bass. That definitely makes sense!**Examining chord functions**

In Ab major, Bbm/F serves as the ii6 chord, since the ii chord is Bb minor. Now, for Ab/G, I see it's the Ab major chord with G in the bass, which is effectively Imaj7 in third inversion without the C. The Abmaj7 chord consists of Ab, C, Eb, and G, and putting G in the bass gives it that third inversion feel. Even though the slash chord doesn't include the C, it still evokes that Imaj7 sound nicely. This creates a smooth bass line moving from Bbm/F to Gdim!**Determining key and mode**

In analyzing the chord sequence, I note that Bbm/F functions as the ii6 in Ab major, while Eb/G acts as the V6. Overall, the progression alternates between G and F, suggesting an Ab major tonal center. The use of Gdim as the leading-tone diminished chord (vii°) helps establish this, primarily resolving to Eb/G. 

Although F natural minor could be a candidate, the presence of Eb/G as the V chord in Ab major emphasizes the key of Ab major (Ionian mode) more clearly, restricting Gdim's function as ii° in that context.**Analyzing key and mode**

In this complex progression, Bbm is ii in Ab major, while Eb major fails the diatonic test for other keys. The presence of G natural indicates we’re likely in Ab major, as Gdim fits the leading tone role (vii°). However, despite Gdim's presence, the Eb/G chord emphasizes Ab major's dominant (V6). The inclusion of Dbmaj7 requires C natural, further pointing to Ab major. 

Thus, the key is Ab major with the Ionian mode, given that all chords revolve around it. While Gdim and Eb/G appear frequently, overall functionality supports an Ab major interpretation.**Determining key and mode**

The user is asking to determine the key and mode based on the diatonic chords provided. While Gdim appears frequently, indicating a possible G Locrian center, typical functional tonality revolves around Eb (the dominant) resolving to Ab (the tonic). Analyzing the notes reveals they align with the Ab major scale, meaning the key is likely Ab major (Ionian). The functions of the chords support this interpretation. 

Thus, I conclude that the key is Ab major, and the mode is Ionian.

Ab major (Ionian).

All chords are diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G ≈ Imaj7/7 (incomplete)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/3

So the parent key is Ab major; mode is Ionian.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing musical key and modes**

I'm looking into the key and modes, noting the Ionian (major) mode, possibly in Ab major. I want to check if any accidentals appear in Ab major. Some chords, like Gdim, Eb/G, and Bbm/F, are diatonic. The bass note G acts as a leading tone, maintaining diatonic integrity. I also see that Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F fit within the key but Gdim reappears. I'm considering the relative mode of F minor too, as it includes diminished chords.**Exploring F natural minor chords**

In F natural minor, I see that the ii° chord is indeed a G fully diminished triad, comprised of G–B♭–D♭. The Eb major chord serves as the VII in this key, which is diatonic in the Aeolian mode. Eb/G appears as the first inversion. I recognize that Ab/G serves as bIII over the leading tone and is diatonically fitting. Dbmaj7/F is VImaj7, while Gdim functions as ii°. But Gdim seems to lead more towards Ab instead of F, so I want to explore the functional motion here.**Examining chord progressions in Ab major**

In Ab major, the Eb chord serves as the V, and I realize that toggling between vii° and V is a common way to prolong the dominant. Here, they share tones: V (Eb-G-Bb) and vii° (G-Bb-Db) have G and Bb in common, which leads to an interesting alternation of Gdim and Eb/G. The progression flows through Bbm/F, Ab/G, and returns to the dominant area, culminating in Dbmaj7/F and Gdim. The last Gdim might not resolve, suggesting the music could continue. In F minor, Eb/G serves as VII6, interacting with ii°, which might indicate a subdominant area.**Assessing chord functions in F minor and Eb major**

I see that G and Bb are shared between the keys, similar to previous observations. In F minor, this may create a mixture between the subdominant ii° and flat VII, but that’s not typical toggling. The dominant chord, C or C7, is nowhere in sight. Given that Eb and Gdim show up instead, which don't typically indicate standard dominant prolongation, it feels more aligned with Ab major. I also wonder if this could fit in Eb major, but Gdim wouldn't be diatonic there either, making that key unlikely.**Determining key and mode**

It looks like the key is A♭ major, specifically in the Ionian mode. The prominent bass note G acts as the leading tone to A♭. The chord structure supports this conclusion: V6 (Eb/G), vii° (Gdim), IV6 (Dbmaj7/F), and ii6/4 (Bbm/F), alongside the neighboring I/G. Since the user wants to determine the key and mode, I should keep it concise, stating that it's A♭ major. I could briefly mention its relationship to F natural minor, but I should prioritize clarity with the key being established.

A♭ major (Ionian).

Reason: Gdim is the diatonic leading‑tone triad (vii°) in A♭ major, Eb/G is V6, B♭m/F is ii6/4, A♭/G is I over 7, and D♭maj7/F is IV6. The frequent alternation between Gdim and Eb/G is a typical vii°–V dominant prolongation in A♭ major.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequence**

I have a sequence of chords: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

First, I need to determine the key and mode. It seems like there's a line cliché or passing chords with a static G in the bass. The slash chords indicate bass notes, with Eb/G showing an Eb major triad over G in the bass. 

I’ll analyze the chords and their note structure to better understand this progression. Gdim is a diminished triad, often leading to Ab.**Determining the key**

Looking at Gdim built on G suggests the key might be Ab. In Ab major, the leading tone is G, and the vii° triad is supposed to be G° with notes G, B♭, and Db. It feels off because in my calculations, I mistakenly included B natural, which doesn't belong in the scale. 

The correct notes for a diatonic vii° chord in Ab major would include B♭ instead of B natural. I'll need to clarify that Gdim could lead into Ab, but it doesn't fit the diatonic framework as I initially thought.**Clarifying vii° chords**

I've figured out that the formula for a vii° chord in a major key is the leading tone plus a minor third and diminished fifth. In Ab major, the leading tone is G, with the third being B♭ and the fifth being D♭, which makes up the G diminished triad (G-B♭-D♭). 

So, Gdim is diatonic to Ab major and also F minor, where it serves as vii° in Ab and ii° in F minor. In the harmonic minor of F, Gdim still fits.**Exploring Eb/G chord**

Now that I consider both keys, I see Eb/G as Eb major over G bass, which gives me the notes G, B♭, and E♭. I realize that Eb major triad is E♭, G, B♭, and with G in the bass, this is simply the first inversion of Eb major. 

This means that Eb/G is diatonic to Ab major as the V6 chord. In F minor, Eb major acts as the VII chord in natural minor, and Eb/G fits there as well, with G natural being diatonic to the F minor scale.**Determining key and mode**

I analyzed the chords and found that Eb/G supports Ab major, functioning as V6, while also being VII6 in F natural minor. The Bbm/F chord acts as ii6/4 in Ab major and iv6/4 in F minor. The Ab/G serves as a**Determining key and mode**

Let’s analyze the scale: F Dorian has a D natural, but that’s absent here, only using D♭. That aligns with F Aeolian instead. The presence of Eb/G, functioning as bVII in F minor, usually leads to progressions seen in minor keys. However, without an i chord or a V (C), it doesn’t complete a cadence. So, the key is Ab major (Ionian). 

The repeated Gdim as vii° reinforces that. The diatonic chords confirm Ab major, so my final answer is: Ab major (Ionian).

Ab major (Ionian).

Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major: Gdim = vii°, Eb/G = V6, Bbm/F = ii6/4, Ab/G = I over leading-tone bass (passing), Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/6. The pitch set is exactly the Ab major scale. While also diatonic to F natural minor (relative), the functional mix (ii–V–IV–vii°) points to Ab major as the tonal center.

### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Determined Key: A♭ Major
- **Rationale**: 
  - The progression is diatonic to A♭ major (scale degrees: A♭-B♭-C-D♭-E♭-F-G).
  - Core functions:
    - Gdim = vii° (leading tone diminished triad, built on G-B♭-D♭; common for tension/resolution).
    - E♭/G = V₆ (E♭ major triad in first inversion; E♭ is the dominant).
    - B♭m/F = ii₆₅ (B♭ minor triad in second inversion; B♭m is the supertonic).
    - A♭/G = I₆₄ (A♭ major triad in second inversion; establishes the tonic).
    - D♭maj7/F = IV₆ (D♭ major seventh triad; D♭ is the subdominant; /F places it in third inversion, emphasizing the sixth scale degree F).
  - The repetitive structure (Gdim → E♭/G → Gdim patterns) creates a looping tension-release around the dominant (E♭) and leading tone (Gdim), resolving periodically to the tonic (A♭/G). The D♭maj7/F adds subdominant color before returning to Gdim, but stays within A♭ major harmony.
  - No chromatic alterations or borrowed chords suggest a shift to a parallel minor or other key. All notes fit A♭ major without accidentals.

- **Chord-Scale Mapping**:
  | Chord       | Function in A♭ Major | Notes (with bass) |
  |-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
  | Gdim       | vii°                | G-B♭-D♭          |
  | E♭/G       | V₆                  | E♭-G-B♭ (bass: G)|
  | B♭m/F      | ii₆₅                | B♭-D♭-F (bass: F)|
  | A♭/G       | I₆₄                 | A♭-C-E♭ (bass: G)|
  | D♭maj7/F   | IV₆                 | D♭-F-A♭-C♭ (bass: F) |

#### Mode: Major (Ionian)
- **Rationale**: 
  - The presence of the major tonic (A♭/G) and major dominant (E♭) confirms the major mode. No minor v or flattened submediant suggests a shift to Aeolian (minor).
  - The overall tonality is bright and consonant, with diminished chords providing classical tension rather than modal ambiguity.
  - If this were A♭ minor, we'd expect chords like Fm (v), Cdim (vii°), or E♭m (III), but those aren't present—E♭ is major (V in major, ♭VII in minor).

#### Additional Notes
- **Progression Style**: This resembles a jazz or classical "backcycling" or pedal-point pattern (heavy use of G bass for inversion and continuity), often seen in standards or etudes. It could imply a melody outlining A♭ major (e.g., emphasizing A♭-E♭-B♭-D♭).
- **Potential Interpretation**: If performed, it might sound like a vamp in A♭ major, with G as a common pedal tone linking phrases.
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - G Phrygian ♭4? Unlikely—too unstable and lacks G minor resolution.
  - E♭ major? Doesn't fit Gdim or D♭maj7 cleanly.
  - A♭ minor? Chords like E♭ (major instead of ♭VII) and A♭ (major tonic) contradict it.

If you provide more context (e.g., melody, tempo, or full song), I can refine this!

### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Progression**

I've just begun unpacking the user's chord progression. Initially, I'm breaking down the request: a provided sequence of chords. My next move is to methodically identify each chord's component. Then, the real fun begins: understanding the harmonic function and relationships. This will lead to a comprehensive analysis.


**Identifying Chord Notes**

I've moved past simple chord breakdown. My current focus is aggregating all distinct notes present within the entire progression. This list will be the foundation for determining a tonal center. From here, I can examine note frequency and relationships.


**Refining Key Detection**

The tonal center investigation is progressing. I've successfully identified two potential keys: Ab major and F minor. Now I'm considering the chords' functions within each key to definitively pinpoint the most probable "key." The bass notes will be essential in making this determination.


**Assessing Key Signatures**

Now I'm looking at the chord functions within potential keys. The Ab major analysis appears strong, but the unusual bass movement demands careful assessment. I'm noting the vii° to V relationship frequently. The Eb Mixolydian also seems likely, with a starting point of Eb. I need more investigation of those bass notes.


**Evaluating Ab's Dominance**

The analysis confirms Ab major as the primary key. However, the presence of Eb/G as a V chord raises a question: is this a standard progression, or does the bass provide alternate harmonic directions? I'm now examining the bassline's behavior to confirm.


**Refining the Theory**

I'm now prioritizing the chord's functional roles within each potential key. Considering Ab major, the presence of the `Eb/G` (V chord) strengthens its case, providing the tension-resolution cadence, with Gdim (vii°) emphasizing the pull. The bass notes' movements now require a more precise examination.


**Determining Tonal Center**

I'm now prioritizing the chord's functional roles within each potential key. Considering Ab major, the presence of the Eb/G (V chord) strengthens its case, providing the tension-resolution cadence, with Gdim (vii°) emphasizing the pull. The bass notes' movements now require a more precise examination. I'm noting the consistent harmonic movement.

I'm now prioritizing the chord's functional roles within each potential key. Considering Ab major, the presence of the Eb/G (V chord) strengthens its case, providing the tension-resolution cadence, with Gdim (vii°) emphasizing the pull. The bass notes' movements now require a more precise examination. I'm noting the consistent harmonic movement. My next step will be to confirm which of the chords is dominant, subdominant, or tonic.




Excellent question. This is a very interesting progression with a lot of tension and release. Let's break it down.

### The Answer

**Key:** **Ab Major**
**Mode:** **Major (Ionian)**

---

### Detailed Analysis

To determine the key, we'll follow three steps:
1.  Identify the notes in each chord.
2.  Find the parent scale that contains all (or most) of these notes.
3.  Analyze the function of the chords within that scale to find the tonal center (the "home" chord).

**1. Chord Voicings and Notes**

*   **Gdim:** G - Bb - Db
*   **Eb/G:** Eb Major triad (Eb - G - Bb) with G in the bass.
*   **Bbm/F:** Bb minor triad (Bb - Db - F) with F in the bass.
*   **Ab/G:** Ab Major triad (Ab - C - Eb) with G in the bass.
*   **Dbmaj7/F:** Db Major 7 chord (Db - F - Ab - C) with F in the bass.

**2. The Note Collection (Diatonic Set)**

Let's list all the unique notes used across the entire progression:
**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

When we arrange these notes starting from Ab, we get the **Ab Major scale**:
**Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G**

**3. Functional Harmony (Why it's Ab Major)**

This is the most important step. We need to see how the chords behave within the key of Ab Major. We do this using Roman Numeral Analysis.

In the key of Ab Major:
*   I = Ab Major
*   ii = Bb minor
*   iii = C minor
*   IV = Db Major
*   V = Eb Major
*   vi = F minor
*   vii° = G diminished (Gdim)

Now let's apply this to your progression:

*   **Gdim** is the **vii°** chord. The leading-tone diminished chord creates maximum tension and has a very strong pull to resolve up to the tonic (I), which is Ab. The progression constantly circles back to this Gdim, reinforcing its function as the setup for a resolution to Ab.

*   **Eb/G** is the **V** chord (the dominant) in first inversion. The V chord is the second most important chord in a key and its primary job is to lead back to the tonic (I).

*   **Bbm/F** is the **ii** chord (the supertonic) in second inversion. The `ii` chord is a "pre-dominant" chord, often used to set up the V chord.

*   **Ab/G** is literally the **I** chord (the tonic, Ab) over the leading tone (G). This is a moment of arrival, even with the tense G in the bass.

*   **Dbmaj7/F** is the **IV** chord (the subdominant) in first inversion. The IV chord is another primary chord in the key.

**Conclusion**

The progression is built almost entirely from the primary functional chords of **Ab Major**: the tonic (**I** - Ab), the subdominant (**IV** - Dbmaj7), the dominant (**V** - Eb), and the leading-tone (**vii°** - Gdim).

The constant repetition of the **Gdim (vii°)** and the presence of the **Eb (V)** chord create a powerful sense of suspense that is always pointing towards **Ab** as the resolution and tonal center. The progression ending on `Gdim` leaves the listener hanging, expecting an Ab chord that never comes, which is a common and effective compositional device.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chord symbols: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode for this progression.

Hmm, diminished chords can be tricky because they often serve as passing or leading tones rather than defining a key. But let me look at the pattern here. It seems like there's a lot of repetition - Gdim appears very frequently, and then Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F show up periodically. 

First, I should identify what notes are in these chords. Gdim is G-Bb-Db, which is also the vii° chord in Ab major. Eb/G would be Eb-G-Bb (first inversion G minor? No wait, Eb major with G in bass is actually emphasizing the third - that's Eb major triad). Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb major with F in bass, Ab/G is Ab major with G in bass, and Dbmaj7/F is Db major 7th with F in bass.

I notice most chords are built on G, F, Eb, Db - all flats. This is heavily suggesting a flat key center. Let me consider Ab major since Gdim is vii° there. But why would we have Eb/G? In Ab major, V would be Eb major, and Eb/G is just first inversion. Similarly, Bb would be the IV chord in Ab major.

Looking at the sequence: it keeps circling around Gdim, which acts as a dominant leading to Ab (since Gdim to Ab is a classic resolution). But we never actually get the Ab chord - instead we get Eb/G and Ab/G. Ab/G is specifically Ab major with G in the bass, which is actually creating a G-Ab bass movement.

Ah! This feels like a circle of fifths or chromatic bass line progression. Let me map the bass notes: G (from Gdim and Eb/G), then F (from Bbm/F), then G again (Ab/G), then F again (Dbmaj7/F)... wait no:

Gdim has bass G
Eb/G has bass G
Bbm/F has bass F
Ab/G has bass G
Dbmaj7/F has bass F

So the bass alternates between G and F? That's interesting. G to F is a whole step down. But then Dbmaj7/F is Db major 7th chord with F in bass.

I should consider the Ab harmonic context more carefully. In Ab major:
- Gdim is vii°
- Eb is V
- Bb would be IV
- Ab is I
- Db would be bVII? No, Db is IV in Gb major but that doesn't fit...

Wait, Db major is actually the IV chord in Ab major? No: Ab scale is Ab Bb C Db Eb F G. So IV is Db major? Yes! Db is the fourth note. So Dbmaj7 would be IVmaj7 in Ab major.

But we have Dbmaj7/F, which is Db major 7th with F in bass - that's just first inversion.

Now Eb/G: in Ab major, Eb is V, so Eb major with G (the third) in bass is standard first inversion.

Bbm/F: Bb is IV in Ab major? Wait no - in Ab major: I=Ab, ii=Bbm, iii=Cm, IV=Db, V=Eb, vi=Fm, vii°=Gdim. So actual IV is Db major, not Bb. Bb would be... wait Bb is ii in Ab? No:

Ab major scale: Ab (1), Bb (2), C (3), Db (4), Eb (5), F (6), G (7)

So:
- Bb is ii (Bb minor chord, not major)
- Eb is V (major)
- Db is IV (major)

But in the progression we have Bbm/F - that's Bb minor chord with F in bass? But chord symbol says "Bbm/F" which confirms minor. Earlier I assumed Bb major but the "m" makes it minor.

Important correction: "Bbm/F" means Bb minor chord with F in the bass. Similarly "Ab/G" is Ab major with G bass since no "m".

So chords with notes:
- Gdim: G Bb Db
- Eb/G: Eb G Bb (Eb major)
- Bbm/F: F Ab Bb (Bb minor triad)
- Ab/G: G Ab C Eb? Wait Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so Ab/G would be G Ab C Eb (G in bass)
- Dbmaj7/F: F Ab C Db (Db major 7th: Db-F-Ab-C)

Now let's see the harmonic function in Ab major context:
- Gdim: vii°
- Eb: V
- Bbm: ii (minor, which is diatonic)
- Ab: I
- Dbmaj7: IVmaj7 (diatonic)

All these chords are diatonic to Ab major! Even the inversions:
- Eb/G is V6 (first inversion V)
- Bbm/F is ii6 (first inversion ii)
- Ab/G is I6 (first inversion I)
- Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7 first inversion

The constant Gdim is acting as a dominant approaching Ab (as vii°7 is often used as dominant substitute). The progression seems to be circling around the tonic Ab with lots of inversions creating stepwise bass motion.

Bass line extraction:
Gdim: G
Eb/G: G
Bbm/F: F
Ab/G: G
Gdim: G
etc.

So bass alternates G and F - specifically G for Gdim and Eb chords, F for Bbm and Db chords. Creating a G-F-G-F... bass pattern that's very chromatic and smooth.

Given all chords fit perfectly in Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb = V
- Bbm = ii
- Ab = I
- Dbmaj7 = IV

And the progression has I (Ab), IV (Db), V (Eb), ii (Bbm) all present - these are primary chords of Ab major. The constant Gdim is just decorative dominant function.

Therefore key is clearly Ab major. Mode is Ionian (major scale), not a mode like Dorian or Mixolydian since all chords are major/minor as in natural major scale.

User might be confused by the diminished chords, but in context they're just leading tones. The progression is harmonically simple once you see the inversions - it's basically a I-IV-V-ii progression with lots of passing diminished chords and inverted chords for bass movement.

Final determination: Key of Ab major, Ionian mode.

Based on the chord progression you provided (**Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**), I've analyzed it step by step to determine the key and mode. Here's the conclusion:

### **Key: Ab Major (A♭)**  
### **Mode: Ionian (Major Scale)**  

---

### **Why Ab Major? A Step-by-Step Breakdown**
1. **All chords are diatonic to Ab Major**:  
   Every chord in your progression fits perfectly within the **Ab Major scale** (A♭ B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G). Here's how each chord relates to Ab Major:
   - **Gdim** (G-B♭-D♭) = **vii°** (diatonic diminished chord, acting as a dominant leading tone).
   - **Eb/G** (E♭-G-B♭) = **V⁶** (first inversion of the V chord, E♭ major).
   - **Bbm/F** (F-A♭-B♭) = **ii⁶** (first inversion of the ii chord, B♭ minor).
   - **Ab/G** (G-A♭-C-E♭) = **I⁶** (first inversion of the I chord, A♭ major).
   - **Dbmaj7/F** (F-A♭-C-D♭) = **IVmaj7⁶** (first inversion of the IV chord, D♭ major 7th).

   | Chord | Notes | Function in Ab Major | Diatonic? |
   |-------|-------|----------------------|-----------|
   | Gdim | G, B♭, D♭ | vii° (leading tone chord) | ✅ Yes |
   | Eb/G | E♭, G, B♭ | V⁶ (inversion of E♭ major) | ✅ Yes |
   | Bbm/F | F, A♭, B♭ | ii⁶ (inversion of B♭ minor) | ✅ Yes |
   | Ab/G | G, A♭, C, E♭ | I⁶ (inversion of A♭ major) | ✅ Yes |
   | Dbmaj7/F | F, A♭, C, D♭ | IVmaj7⁶ (inversion of D♭ major 7th) | ✅ Yes |

2. **Harmonic Function**:  
   - The progression revolves around the **tonic (I = A♭)** and its common diatonic chords (ii, IV, V).  
   - **Gdim** is used repeatedly as a **passing chord** or **dominant substitute** for V (E♭). In Ab Major, Gdim (vii°) is a natural dominant chord that resolves to I (A♭).  
   - **Inversions (e.g., Eb/G, Bbm/F)** create smooth **bass motion**:  
     - Bass alternates between **G** (from Gdim, Eb/G, Ab/G) and **F** (from Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F), forming a **chromatic bass descent** (G → F → E♭...). This is a common voice-leading technique in major keys but doesn't change the key center.  
   - No chords outside Ab Major appear (e.g., no sharps, no non-diatonic alterations).

3. **Why Not a Different Key or Mode?**  
   - **Not a minor key**: The progression centers on A♭ major (I chord = A♭), not A♭ minor. B♭m (ii) is minor, but this is standard in major keys (e.g., "Let It Be" in C Major uses Dm).  
   - **Not a mode (e.g., Dorian, Mixolydian)**:  
     - All chords align perfectly with the **Ionian mode (natural major scale)**. No characteristic modal chords (e.g., no ♭VII in Mixolydian, no major IV in Dorian) are present.  
     - Dbmaj7 is the **IV chord** (diatonic in Ionian), not a borrowed chord.  
   - **Not Cb Major or other enharmonics**: Ab Major is simpler (4 flats) vs. Cb Major (7 flats). Music theory favors Ab here.  
   - **Diminished chords ≠ key change**: Gdim is functional (vii° of Ab), not a key-defining chord like in diminished scales.

---

### **How the Progression Works in Ab Major**
- **Tonal Center**: The progression constantly pulls toward **Ab** (e.g., Gdim → Ab/G, Eb → Ab).  
- **Typical Major-Key Traits**:  
  - Strong I-IV-V-ii harmonic movement (heard in Ab/G → Dbmaj7 → Eb → Bbm).  
  - Inversions create melodic bass lines (G-F-G-F), common in classical/pop (e.g., Beatles' "Something").  
- **Diminished Chords as Flavor**: Gdim acts as a "filler" dominant (vii°), common in jazz and film scores to add tension without leaving the key.

- **Heavy use of Gdim**: 10/14 chords are Gdim, which can sound "unresolved" since diminished chords lead strongly to a tonic. Here, it’s **resolving to Ab** (e.g., Gdim → Ab/G), but the resolution is delayed for effect.  
- **Inversions mask root movement**: Eb/G (V⁶) and Ab/G (I⁶) share the same bass note (G), making the V-I resolution less obvious. But the **chord qualities** (E♭ major → A♭ major) confirm the key.  
- **Bass motion (G-F-G-F)**: This chromatic bass line might suggest modal mixture, but it’s just voice-leading in Ab Major.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
This is a **diatonic Ab Major progression** with embellishments (inversions, passing chords). It uses classic major-key harmony:  
- **I (Ab)**, **ii (Bbm)**, **IV (Dbmaj7)**, **V (Eb)**, and **vii° (Gdim)**.  
- **No mode shift**—it’s squarely in **Ionian mode** (the standard major scale).  

If you play the **Ab Major scale (A♭ B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G)** over this, all notes will fit perfectly. For example:  
- Gdim = G-B♭-D♭ (from Ab scale)  
- Dbmaj7 = D♭-F-A♭-C (from Ab scale)  

No need to overcomplicate it—the key signature is **4 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭)**. ✅

Let's analyze the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their tones

Let’s break down each chord:

- **Gdim (G diminished)** = G – Bb – Db  
- **Eb/G** = G – Bb – Eb (first inversion of Eb major)  
- **Bbm/F** = F – Bb – Db (first inversion of Bb minor)  
- **Ab/G** = G – Ab – C (Ab major with G in bass — unusual, but possible)  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F – Ab – C – Eb (Db major 7th with F in bass)

---

### Step 2: Note repeating patterns and bass movement

The progression is highly repetitive, starting and ending on **Gdim**, and **Gdim** appears throughout.

Bass line (lowest notes):
- G – G (Gdim)
- G – G (Eb/G)
- G – G (Gdim)
- F (Bbm/F)
- G (Ab/G)
- G – G (Gdim)
- G – G (Eb/G)
- G – G (Gdim)
- F (Dbmaj7/F)
- G (Gdim)

So the bass is mostly **G**, with two exceptions: **F** under Bbm and Dbmaj7.

But notice: both **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F** have **F** in the bass — suggesting a momentary shift.

Also observe:
- **Eb/G**, **Bbm/F**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F** — all relate to **Eb major** or **Bb minor**.

List of chords in root terms:
- Gdim (G–Bb–Db)
- Eb/G (G–Bb–Eb)
- Bbm/F (F–Bb–Db)
- Ab/G (G–Ab–C–Eb? Wait — Ab/G is Ab major over G bass: G–Ab–C–Eb)
- Dbmaj7/F (F–Ab–C–Eb)

Wait — **Dbmaj7** is **Db–F–Ab–C**, so **Dbmaj7/F** is **F–Ab–C–Db** — not Eb. So earlier thought was wrong.

**Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, **Db**, not Eb.

So chord tones are: F – Ab – C – Db

That’s important.

So:
- **Gdim** = G, Bb, Db
- **Eb/G** = G, Bb, Eb
- **Bbm/F** = F, Bb, Db
- **Ab/G** = G, Ab, C, Eb
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, Db

Now collect all the pitch classes used:

- G
- Ab (G#)
- A? — not present
- Bb
- C
- Db
- D? — not present
- Eb
- F

So pitches: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

Now order them: **Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G**

That's the **Ab major scale**:
- Ab (1), Bb (2), C (3), Db (4), Eb (5), F (6), G (7)

Yes! All notes are in **Ab major**.

But wait: we have a **Gdim**, which includes G, Bb, Db — all in Ab major.

But Gdim = G–Bb–Db — this is **viio** chord in Ab major.

But also, **Ab/G** is Ab major with G in bass — that's a common decoration (e.g., passing chord).

**Eb/G** = G–Bb–Eb — that's a G in the bass, but chord is Eb major — Eb/G is the **I6** (first inversion of tonic) in **Eb major**, or **V6** in Ab major.

Hold on.

Let’s consider **Ab major**:

- I: Ab
- ii: Bbm
- iii: Cm
- IV: Db
- V: Eb
- vi: Fm
- vii°: G°

Now look at the chords:

- **Gdim** = **vii° chord** in Ab major ✅
- **Eb/G** = G in bass, chord is Eb — this is **V6** (first inversion of V) in Ab major ✅
- **Bbm/F** = F in bass, chord is Bbm — this is **ii6** in Ab major ✅
- **Ab/G** = G in bass, chord is Ab — this is **I6** in Ab major ✅
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F in bass, chord is Dbmaj7 — that's **IVmaj7** with 3rd in bass — IV6 in Ab major ✅

So **all chords are diatonic to Ab major**!

Let’s reframe:

- Gdim = **vii°**
- Eb/G = **V6**
- Bbm/F = **ii6**
- Ab/G = **I6**
- Dbmaj7/F = **IV6 (or IVmaj7/F)**

So the progression:
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G  
Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim

Is essentially:
vii° – vii° – V6 – V6  
vii° – vii° – ii6 – I6  
vii° – vii° – V6 – V6  
vii° – vii° – IV6 – vii°

This makes strong sense in **Ab major**.

The **Gdim** (vii°) acts as a leading-tone chord pulling toward Ab (tonic). It's used extensively for tension and chromatic bass motion (G in bass moving down to F, then back).

Also note the bass line:
G – G – G – G  
G – G – F – G  
G – G – G – G  
G – G – F – G

The **F** appears only under Bbm and Dbmaj7 — both of which are chords with F as third (Bbm = Bb–Db–F, Dbmaj7 = Db–F–Ab–C), so F in bass is natural.

Then Ab/G reasserts G in bass.

Finally, Dbmaj7/F → Gdim suggests a IV – vii° motion, which is not a strong cadence, but in modal or chromatic contexts it can work.

But most importantly: **all chords are diatonic to Ab major**.

So what about mode?

Well, if all the chords are from the **Ab major scale (ionian mode)**, and the tonic is **Ab** (reinforced by Ab/G, ii–V–I-like motion: Bbm → Eb → Ab), then this is most likely in **Ab major (Ionian mode)**.

But is Ab the tonic?

Let’s check:

- The chord **Ab/G** appears — though brief, it's the only time the tonic triad (Ab) appears.
- We have **V (Eb)** clearly established with Eb/G.
- We have **ii (Bbm)**, **IV (Db)** — all point to Ab as tonic.

But the progression starts and ends on **Gdim**, which is unstable. That might be a red herring — it’s using Gdim as a pedal or passing chord, not as tonic.

Also, **Gdim** is symmetrical and often used as a passing chord.

But the harmonic movement from Bbm/F to Ab/G, and earlier Eb/G pulling to Ab, suggests Ab is the tonal center.

Moreover, **Dbmaj7/F** (IVmaj7) is more characteristic of major keys than minor — Ab natural minor would have Db **minor**, not major.

Wait! Important point:

- In **Ab minor** (natural minor), the iv chord would be **Dbm**, but here we have **Dbmaj7**, which implies **major IV**, which only occurs in **major keys**, or in harmonic minor contexts, but even then it would be a chromatic chord.

So **Dbmaj7** confirms this is not Ab minor. The IV chord being major confirms **Ab major**.

Also, the **Eb/G** chord is **Eb major**, not minor — in Ab minor, V would be **Eb minor**, unless raised (harmonic minor), but then it would have **D natural**, not Db.

But we have **Gdim**, which includes **Db**, not D natural — so no leading tone to Ab. In fact, the leading tone in Ab major is **G**, but the chord Gdim is used instead of a full **G major** or **Bdim/G** (as in harmonic minor), which would be needed for a strong cadence.

Still, the presence of **Eb major (V)** and **Db major (IV)** and **Ab major (I)** — all major — confirms this is in **Ab major**.

So despite starting and ending on Gdim, the harmonic context points to **Ab major** as the key.

---

### Final Answer:

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian**

Even though Gdim is used pervasively, it functions as the **vii° chord** in Ab major, and all chords are diatonic to Ab major. The presence of major IV (Dbmaj7) and major V (Eb) confirms the key is major.

🎵 **Conclusion: The key is Ab major, in the Ionian mode.**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Hmm, let's see.

First, I need to analyze the chords. Let me list them out clearly. The progression is: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim. 

Wait, some of these chords have slashes, like Eb/G and Bbm/F. The slash indicates the bass note. So Eb/G means an E-flat diminished chord with G as the bass note. But typically, a diminished chord has the root as the bass, but here the bass is specified. Similarly, Bbm/F is a B-flat minor chord with F in the bass. Ab/G is A-flat major with G bass? Wait, Ab is A-flat major? No, Ab is A-flat, but when it says Ab/G, that would be A-flat major chord with G as the bass. Wait, but A-flat major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So Ab/G would be G in the bass, so the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait, no. A chord with a slash means the bass note is the one after the slash. So Ab/G means the chord is Ab major, but with G as the bass note. But that would be a bit odd because typically the bass note would be part of the chord. Let's check: Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So if the bass is G, then the notes are G (bass), Ab, C, Eb. So that's a G minor 7th flat 5? Wait, G, Ab, C, Eb. Let's see: G to Ab is a minor 2nd, which is a semitone. Ab to C is a minor 3rd? Wait, Ab to C is a major 3rd. C to Eb is a minor 3rd. So G, Ab, C, Eb. Let's see the intervals: from G to Ab is minor second, G to C is perfect fourth, G to Eb is minor sixth. Wait, maybe it's better to think of the chord as Ab major with G in the bass, but that would be a ninth chord? No. Wait, Ab major chord with G bass would have the notes G, Ab, C, Eb. But that's actually a Gm7b5 chord, which is G-Bb (but wait, Ab is Bbb? No. Let's do the notes properly.

G as the bass note. The chord symbol is Ab/G. So the chord is an Ab major triad (Ab, C, Eb) with G in the bass. So the pitches are G (bass), Ab, C, Eb. Let's list them as notes. G, Ab, C, Eb. Let's see: G to Ab is a half step, which is a minor second. Ab to C: from Ab to A is a half step, A to C is a major third, so Ab to C is a minor third (since Ab to C is three half steps: Ab to A is 1, A to Bb is 2, Bb to C is 3; wait, no. Wait, Ab to C: Ab, A, Bb, B, C. So that's four semitones. Wait, Ab to A is 1, A to Bb is 2, Bb to B is 3, B to C is 4. Yes, so Ab to C is 4 semitones, which is a major third. Wait, but usually a minor third is 3 semitones. So Ab to C is a major third (4 semitones). Then G to C is a perfect fourth (5 semitones), G to Eb is a minor sixth (8 semitones). So the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. Let's see what chord that is. G is the root. The interval from G to Ab is minor second, G to C is perfect fourth, G to Eb is minor sixth. But that doesn't form a standard chord. Alternatively, maybe Ab/G is a second inversion of a chord. Wait, Ab major chord in second inversion would be C, Eb, Ab, but with G bass? No, second inversion Ab major would have Eb as the bass. So Ab/G is not a standard inversion. Alternatively, maybe it's a chord that includes G as the bass and Ab triad above, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the slash chord is indicating the bass note, regardless of the chord's quality. So Ab/G means the bass is G, and the chord above is Ab major. So the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. But that's actually a Gm7b5 chord? Let's see: G minor 7 flat 5 would be G, Bb, Db, F. Wait, but in this case we have G, Ab, C, Eb. Ab is equivalent to G#, which is not part of Gm7b5. Wait, Gm7b5 is G, Bb, Db, F. So that's G, Bb, Db, F. But the Ab here would be G#, so that's different. Wait, perhaps it's better to list all the pitches.

Let's take each chord one by one.

First chord: Gdim. That's G diminished, which is G, Bb, Db. So roots: G, Bb, Db.

Second chord: same.

Eb/G: Eb diminished chord with G bass? Wait, no. Eb/G would be Eb diminished chord with G in the bass. But a diminished triad has root, minor third, diminished fifth. Eb diminished is Eb, Gb, Bbb. Wait, but Bbb is A. Hmm. Wait, standard notation for dim chords: Gdim is G, Bb, Db. So Ebdim would be Eb, Gb, Bbb (which is A). But the chord symbol Eb/G would mean Eb diminished chord with G in the bass. So the bass is G, and the chord is Eb, Gb, Bbb. So pitches would be G (bass), Eb, Gb, Bbb. Wait, but Eb/G would have G as the bass note. So the chord is Eb diminished triad (Eb, Gb, Bbb), with G as the lowest note. But that would have G as bass, then Eb, Gb, Bbb. Wait, G is above Eb? Wait, no. If Eb is the root of the chord and G is the bass, that might be a different inversion. But G is actually the minor third of Eb? Wait, Eb to G is a major third. Wait, Eb is root, G is a major third above. But in a diminished chord, the minor third above the root would be Gb. So Eb diminished triad has Eb, Gb, Bbb. So Ebdim chord is Eb, Gb, Bbb. So if we have Eb/G, the bass is G, but the chord is Eb diminished. That would mean that G is the highest note? Not sure. Wait, perhaps the notation is that G is the bass note, so the chord is structured with G at the bottom, then the other notes of Ebdim above. So Ebdim triad is Eb, Gb, Bbb. But with G as bass, the notes would be G, Eb, Gb, Bbb? That seems messy. Maybe better to think of the bass note first. For Eb/G, the bass is G, then the chord above is Eb. But how? Wait, perhaps the slash chord here is indicating that the bass note is G, and the chord is Eb diminished. So the notes would be G (bass), then Eb, Gb, Bbb. But that's four notes. Alternatively, maybe it's a different chord. Alternatively, maybe Eb/G is actually a chord where Eb is the root, but the bass is G. Wait, but Eb/G usually means the chord is Eb, with G in the bass. So the chord is Eb major or Eb minor? But no, the slash indicates the bass note. So if it's just "Eb/G", it's Eb chord with G bass. But the user wrote "Eb/G" in the progression. Wait, but the user says "Eb/G" which would be an E-flat chord with G as bass. But E-flat major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So Eb major with G in the bass? Wait, normally Eb major chord has Eb as root, then G as the thirds. So in root position: Eb, G, Bb. First inversion: G, Bb, Eb. Second inversion: Bb, Eb, G. So if it's "Eb/G", that usually means Eb major in first inversion, where the bass is G, so the chord notes are G, Bb, Eb. So perhaps when someone writes Eb/G, it's implying Eb major with G in the bass. Similarly, Bbm/F: B-flat minor chord with F in the bass. Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So in root position Bb, Db, F. First inversion: Db, F, Bb. Second inversion: F, Bb, Db. So Bbm/F would be Bbm chord in second inversion, with F in the bass. So the notes would be F, Bb, Db.

Similarly, Ab/G: Ab major chord with G bass. Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So in root position Ab, C, Eb. First inversion: C, Eb, Ab. Second inversion: Eb, Ab, C. But if it's Ab/G, the bass is G. So the chord would be G, Ab, C, Eb? That includes G as bass, then the Ab triad above. But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps Ab/G is a typo or a different chord. Alternatively, maybe the slash is indicating the bass note regardless of the chord's structure. So for Ab/G, the bass is G, and the chord is Ab major. So pitches: G, Ab, C, Eb. But that's an unusual chord. Alternatively, perhaps Ab/G is intended to be a G diminished chord with Ab as a note? Not sure.

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th chord with F bass. Db major 7th is Db, F, Ab, C. So in root position. First inversion: F, Ab, C, Db. Second inversion: Ab, C, Db, F. Third inversion: C, Db, F, Ab. So Dbmaj7/F would be first inversion of Dbmaj7, with F as bass. So the notes are F, Ab, C, Db.

But let's re-examine the user's input: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim". So let's parse each part.

First two chords: Gdim, Gdim.

Then Eb/G, Eb/G.

Then Gdim, Gdim.

Then Bbm/F, Ab/G.

Then Gdim, Gdim.

Then Eb/G, Eb/G.

Then Gdim, Gdim.

Then Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

Okay. Let's look at each chord's notes.

Gdim: G, Bb, Db.

Eb/G: If Eb/G means Eb major chord with G bass, then Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So with G bass: G, Bb, Eb (first inversion). So notes: G, Bb, Eb.

Similarly, Bbm/F: Bb minor chord with F bass. Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So second inversion: F, Bb, Db.

Ab/G: Ab major chord with G bass. Ab has notes Ab, C, Eb. So if bass is G, then notes would be G, Ab, C, Eb. But Ab major chord in root position has no G. So this would be an Ab major chord with G added as bass? But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe G minor chord? Wait, sometimes slash notation can be confusing. If it's "Ab/G", that usually means the chord is Ab, and G is bass. So the pitches are G (bass), Ab, C, Eb. But that would be four notes. Alternatively, maybe it's a G minor 7th flat 5 chord or something. Let's see: G, Bb, Db, F for Gm7b5. But Ab is not Bb, but G is the bass. Wait, the notes G, Ab, C, Eb: G to Ab is minor second. G to C is perfect fourth. G to Eb is minor sixth. That's a bit strange. Alternatively, think of the chord as C minor 7th with Ab as the bass? Not sure. Wait, maybe it's better to list all the notes in the progression and see if they fit a particular key.

Alternatively, maybe the Eb/G is actually an E-flat diminished chord with G bass. Wait, Ebdim is Eb, Gb, Bbb (which is A). So if bass is G, then the notes would be G, Eb, Gb, A. But that seems messy. Alternatively, maybe the user intended Ebm/G? But he wrote "Eb/G". Hmm.

Another thought: Maybe the slashes indicate bass note. So when it's written as Eb/G, that's Eb major triad (Eb, G, Bb) with G in the bass. So the bass note is G, and the upper structure is Eb major triad. So the chord is G (bass), then Eb, G, Bb. Wait, but that's redundant because G is in the chord. So Eb major in first inversion is G, Bb, Eb. So yes, the notes would be G (bass), Bb, Eb. So Eb/G = G, Bb, Eb. Which is the same as a G minor 7th chord? Wait, G minor 7th is G, Bb, D, F. But here it's G, Bb, Eb. That's actually a G minor 7th without the D and F? Wait, no. Wait, Eb is a major third above C. Hmm, G, Bb, Eb. Let's see the intervals: G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Eb is perfect fourth. Alternatively, Eb to G is a major third. Wait, Eb to G is a major third (Eb to F is half step, F to G is whole, so Eb to G is minor third? Wait, no. Eb to E natural is half step, E to F is half, F to G is whole step. So Eb to G is three half steps? Wait, Eb, E, F, G: that's 4 semitones. Yes. Eb to E: 1, E to F: 2, F to G: 3. No, Eb to E is one semitone, E to F is another, F to G is two more? Wait, no. Semitone count: Eb to E is 1 (half step), E to F is 1 (half step), F to G is 2 (whole step). Wait, no. Semitones: from Eb to E is half step (1), E to F is half step (2), F to G is whole step (but in semitones, F to G is +2 semitones). So total from Eb to G: 1 (Eb-E) + 1 (E-F) + 2 (F-G)? Wait, no. Wait, in semitones: Eb to E is 1, E to F is 1, F to G is 2 steps? No, each semitone is one step. F to G is two semitones (F to F# is 1, F# to G is 2). So yes, Eb to G is Eb -> E (1), E -> F (2), F -> F# (3), F# -> G (4). So Eb to G is four semitones, which is a major third. Wait, yes. Because from Eb: Eb, E, F, F#, G. So yes, four semitones. So Eb to G is a major third. So Eb major triad is Eb, G, Bb. So Eb major chord, with G in the bass. But G is the third of Eb major chord. So first inversion: G, Bb, Eb (the third in bass).

So Eb/G: notes G, Bb, Eb.

Similarly, Bbm/F: Bb minor chord F in bass. Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So F in bass would be F, Bb, Db (second inversion).

Ab/G: Ab major chord with G bass. Ab is Ab, C, Eb. So notes G (bass), Ab, C, Eb. But Ab major chord doesn't include G. So this would be a chord with G as bass, then Ab, C, Eb. So the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th chord with F bass. Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So first inversion: F, Ab, C, Db.

Now, let's list all the chord tones present in the progression.

Starting with Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Then Gdim again: same.

Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb

Then again Eb/G: same.

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Gdim again: same.

Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Gdim again.

Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb

Eb/G again.

Gdim, Gdim.

Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Db

Gdim: G, Bb, Db.

Now let's collect all the notes used in this progression:

From Gdim: G, Bb, Db

From Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb (so adds Eb)

From Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db

From Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb

From Dbmaj7/F: F, Ab, C, Db

So compiling all notes present:

G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C.

So let's see: G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C. Let's list them in terms of scale degrees.

Let's see if these notes form a specific key. Let's list the pitches: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, C, Db (which is C#), Eb (D#), F, G, Ab (G#), Bb.

Wait, that seems like a bit of a mess. Let's write them in order from lowest to highest, considering chromatic.

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, so C, Db (C#), but written as Db is equivalent to C#. Wait, but in terms of scale, let's see:

From C to Bb:

C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C. Hmm.

Wait, our notes are C, Db (C#), Eb (D#?), wait no. Db is D-flat, which is same as C#. Eb is E-flat. Ab is A-flat. Bb is B-flat.

So the notes present: C, Db (C#), Eb, F, G, Ab (G#), Bb.

Wait, no: Db is D flat, which is enharmonic to C#. Eb is E flat. So let's list the notes as written: C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭.

So in order: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

That's seven notes. What key could this be?

Let's see: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

That's all the white keys plus Db, Eb, Ab, Bb. Wait, in standard Western scale, this seems a bit unusual. Let's see. In major scales, C major has no flats or sharps. If we have all the notes, but with Db, Eb, Ab, Bb. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a mode of something. Let's think of the key signature. Let's see the notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So the pitches include Db, Eb, Ab, Bb, which suggests flat keys.

But let's check possible keys.

Suppose the key is Db major. Db major scale: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. But in our case, we have G instead of Gb. So Db major has Gb, but our note list has G. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab. Here we have all those notes except D. Our present notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So missing D natural, but we have Db instead. So not Bb major.

C minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb? Wait, C natural minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! That's exactly it. C natural minor scale has notes C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. But wait, our chord progression has notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, no: C natural minor scale has a D natural, not Db. So C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So the notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. But in our current note list, we have Db, not D. So unless there's a typo.

Wait, our present notes are: from all the chords, we have C, Db (D flat), Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Compared to C natural minor, which has D natural instead of Db. So close but Db instead of D natural. So that suggests maybe it's C Phrygian mode? Because Phrygian has a flattened second. Let's see.

C Phrygian mode: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes! That's exactly the scale. Because Phrygian mode starts on the third degree of the major scale, but C Phrygian would be mode of Ab major. Let's check:

Major scale of Ab Major: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So if we take that scale and start on C, the mode would be C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes. Exactly the notes we have here. Let's verify:

Ab major: notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

C Phrygian: starting from C: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes. So the notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Now, looking at our chord progression, the notes present all fit into this scale. So the key could be C Phrygian mode.

But let's confirm by checking what the tonic is in this progression. In a mode, the tonic is the starting note of the scale. So in C Phrygian, C is the tonic.

But let's see if the progression centers around C. Let's check the chords:

We have Gdim. G diminished (G, Bb, Db) which in C Phrygian: G is the fifth degree. Diminished chord built on fifth of Phrygian mode.

But also, Bbm/F: Bb minor. In C Phrygian, Bb is the minor seventh. Bbm chord (Bb, Db, F) which is the vii chord.

Ab/G: Ab major chord with G bass. Ab is the sixth degree in C Phrygian. Ab major chord (Ab, C, Eb), which is the vi chord.

Dbmaj7/F: Db major seventh chord (Db, F, Ab, C), but with F bass. Db is the second degree of C Phrygian. Dbmaj7 would be the ii chord in C Phrygian. But let's see.

Wait, in C Phrygian mode, the diatonic chords would be:

C: Cm7 (since it's a minor scale), but depending on mode.

Let's list all diatonic chords in C Phrygian:

1. C minor 7: C, Eb, G, Bb

2. Db major 7: Db, F, Ab, C

3. Eb minor 7: Eb, Gb, Bb, Db

Wait, but in our progression we have Eb/G, which is Eb major triad? Or maybe not. Wait, let's get the chords in C Phrygian mode.

C is tonic.

Phrygian mode notes: C (tonic), Db (2nd), Eb (3rd), F (4th), G (5th), Ab (6th), Bb (7th).

Diatonic triads:

1. C: C, Eb, G → Cm

2. Db: Db, F, Ab → Db major

3. Eb: Eb, Gb, Bb → Ebdim

4. F: F, Ab, C → F minor

5. G: G, Bb, Db → Gdim

6. Ab: Ab, C, Eb → Ab major

7. Bb: Bb, Db, F → Bbm

Yes, that's right. So in C Phrygian mode, the diatonic triads are:

i: Cm

ii°: Dbdim? Wait no:

Wait, let's get it correct:

1. C: C, Eb, G → C minor

2. Db: Db, F, Ab → Db major

3. Eb: Eb, Gb, Bb → Eb diminished

4. F: F, Ab, C → F minor

5. G: G, Bb, Db → G diminished

6. Ab: Ab, C, Eb → Ab major

7. Bb: Bb, Db, F → Bb minor

Wait, but in C Phrygian, the seventh degree is Bb, so the chord on Bb is Bb, Db, F, which is Bb minor.

So looking at our chord progression:

Gdim – yes, that's the vdim chord (5th degree).

Eb/G: Eb/G could be Eb root with G bass. But in our analysis, the diatonic chord on Eb is diminished. But Ebdim chord has Eb, Gb, Bb. If Eb/G is Eb diminished with G bass? But that would not be a diatonic chord. Wait, but in the notes we have Eb, Gb? Wait no. Wait in our chord progression above, the Eb/G: the notes G, Bb, Eb. Wait, Eb/G in the chords here, but according to the chord analysis, if Eb/G is Eb major triad in first inversion (G bass), that's not diatonic. Because in C Phrygian, Eb's diatonic chord is diminished: Eb, Gb, Bb. But Eb major would be Eb, G, Bb. G is natural. But in C Phrygian, the third of Eb is Gb, so the diatonic chord is diminished. However, in our chord progression, when they have "Eb/G", if it's Eb/G meaning Eb major with G bass, then G is natural. But in C Phrygian, the G is natural (5th degree), so Eb major triad would have G natural (Eb to G is major third), which in the key of C Phrygian, that's possible, but the diatonic chord on Eb would be Ebdim. So maybe the chords used are a mix of diatonic and chromatic.

Wait, but looking back: when we listed the chord tones, we have from Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb. Which is Eb major chord (Eb, G, Bb). But in C Phrygian scale, the notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, Eb to G is a major third (Eb, F, G), which in the scale Eb to G is two whole steps: Eb-F-G. Yes, so Eb, G natural. So Eb major chord is composed of Eb, G, Bb – all of which are in the C Phrygian scale. Yes, because Eb, G, Bb are all present: Eb is 3rd, G is 5th, Bb is 7th.

Similarly, Ab major is Ab, C, Eb – those are all in the scale. Bbm is Bb, Db, F. Bb, Db (which is in scale), F. Yes.

Dbmaj7: Db, F, Ab, C – all in the scale. And Gdim is G, Bb, Db – which is in the scale, and it's a diminished chord (Gdim: G, Bb, Db – G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third).

So this makes sense. So the key center seems to be C, and it's in Phrygian mode.

Let's check the chords in the progression:

Gdim – chord on G, which is the 5th degree.

Eb/G – Eb major chord, which with G bass (so first inversion), which is the 3rd degree chord.

Bbm/F – Bbm chord in second inversion (F bass), which is 7th degree.

Ab/G – Ab major chord with G bass. Ab is 6th degree. Ab major chord: Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F – Dbmaj7 chord in first inversion (F is bass), Db is 2nd degree.

So the progression uses chords from C Phrygian mode.

Now, what's the tonic? The tonic would be C. Let's see if there's a resolution or emphasis on C. The chord Dbmaj7 includes C (as the major 7th), and Ab major has C in it. Also, Gdim has G, Bb, Db, which doesn't have C. But looking at the progression:

The progression has a lot of Gdim and Ab major, etc. Let's see the final chord: Gdim, but also Dbmaj7/F before that. Dbmaj7 includes C (as the seventh), so the Dbmaj7 chord would tend to resolve to C. Since Dbmaj7/F has F bass, but Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So the C is present in the chord. So if we have Dbmaj7/F going to Gdim, but maybe the Gdim is the dominant chord? Wait, in C Phrygian, the V chord is Gdim, which is actually diminished. The diatonic V chord in minor modes is usually diminished, but in natural minor, the V chord is minor. Wait, C natural minor's V chord is G minor. But in Phrygian mode, the V chord is diminished. So in C Phrygian, V is Gdim.

So a cadence from Vdim (Gdim) to i (Cm) would make sense. However, in this progression, the very end chord is Gdim, but before that is Dbmaj7/F. Dbmaj7 is ii chord (second degree), and then Gdim is V. So maybe it's ii-V cadence? But in Phrygian, ii is Dbmaj7, V is Gdim. So if it went Dbmaj7/F to Gdim, that could be a cadence. But the progression ends on Gdim. Hmm.

But regardless of cadences, the overall key seems to be C Phrygian.

Another way to check: look for the tonic note. Does C appear in any prominent chord? Let's see:

- Gdim has G, Bb, Db – no C.

Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb – no C.

Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db – no C.

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb – yes! Ab major chord has C as the third. So C is present in Ab major chord.

Also, Dbmaj7/F has C in it (Db, F, Ab, C). So C is in that chord.

So in the Ab major chord (vi chord), the C is present. Similarly, the Dbmaj7 chord also includes C.

But the tonic C minor chord isn't explicitly present here. Wait, but the chords used don't include a C minor chord explicitly. Let's check:

In the chord list above: Gdim, Eb/G (which is Eb major), Bbm/F (Bbm), Ab/G (Ab major), Dbmaj7. So there's no Cm chord. Hmm. How can that be?

But in the C Phrygian scale, the diatonic i chord is Cm. But maybe it's not being used here. Or perhaps it's implied. Alternatively, maybe C is the tonic but the progression uses other chords.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Ab major? But in Ab major scale, the notes would be Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. Which is the same as C Phrygian mode but starting on Ab. So same notes, different tonic.

But depending on how the progression resolves. If the progression resolves to Ab, then it's Ab major. But let's see the chords.

If key is Ab major, then the diatonic chords:

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Chords:

i: Ab

ii: Bbdim

iii: Cm

iv: Db

v: Eb

vi: Fm

vii: Gdim

Wait, in Ab major, the vii chord is Gdim.

Now, looking at the chords in the progression:

Gdim is vii chord.

Eb/G: Eb major chord. In Ab major, Eb is the 5th degree, but Eb major chord in Ab major context would be Eb, G, Bb. But diatonic Eb chord in Ab Major is Eb minor? Wait, no. Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So scale degrees:

1: Ab

2: Bb

3: C

4: Db

5: Eb

6: F

7: G

Chords:

i: Ab major

ii: Bb minor

iii: C minor

iv: Db major

v: Eb minor

vi: F minor

vii: G diminished

So in Ab major, the 5th chord is Eb minor, but our chord has Eb major (from Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb). Which would be a major chord on Eb, which is not diatonic in Ab major. Because in Ab major scale, Eb is part of the scale, but the diatonic chord on Eb is Eb minor (Eb, Gb, Bb). Eb major would be Eb, G, Bb – G natural. But in the Ab major scale, the G is natural (7th degree), so Eb to G is a major third? Let's check: Eb to G: Eb, F, G – which is a major third. Yes. But in Ab major scale, the chord on Eb would be Eb minor (since Eb, Gb, Bb). Because Eb is the 5th degree, and in major scale, the v chord is minor. So yes, diatonic v chord is minor. But Eb major would be a borrowed chord. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Ab major is the key here. Let's see the presence of Gdim chord. Gdim is the vii chord in Ab major. Also, the Ab chord itself (tonic) is not present in the progression as far as I can see. The chords present are Gdim, Eb/G (Eb major), Bbm (but in Ab major, Bbm would be ii chord), Ab/G chord (Ab major chord with G bass), etc.

Wait, Ab/G chord: which would be Ab major with G bass. If the key is Ab major, then Ab is the tonic, so Ab major chord is i. But playing it with G bass... So the chord would be Ab major in second inversion? Or third inversion? No. Ab major (Ab, C, Eb) with G bass – so G, Ab, C, Eb. Which includes G, which is dominant of Ab. So maybe a G pedal note? Not sure.

Alternatively, Bbm/F: Bb minor over F. In Ab major, Bbm is ii chord. Fm is vi chord. Yes. In Ab major scale, the vi is F minor. So Bbm/F would be ii chord in first inversion? (Bb minor chord with F bass). Bbm is Bb, Db, F. So F is the fifth. Second inversion would be F, Bb, Db.

Yes, so Bbm/F is Bbm second inversion. In Ab major, that's ii chord in second inversion.

Dbmaj7/F: Db major seventh chord. In Ab major scale, Db is iv chord. Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C. Which is diatonic. Because in Ab major, iv chord is Db major. Db major seventh would be Db, F, Ab, C. Yes, that fits.

Then Ab/G: Ab major chord with G bass. If the key is Ab major, then Ab is tonic. But chord with G bass would be Ab/G – which would not be a standard way to write it. But if it's Ab major chord with G as the lowest note, that's a bit odd. However, it might be part of a bass line.

Gdim chords are diatonic vii chord in Ab major.

Eb/G: Eb major chord with G bass. In Ab major, Eb is the v chord. But in Ab major, v chord is Eb minor (Eb, Gb, Bb), but Eb major would be Eb, G, Bb. However, in Ab major scale, G is natural (7th degree), so Eb to G is major third. But diatonic v chord in Ab major is Eb minor, so Eb major would be a borrowed chord or chromatic.

Wait, but C Phrygian is the same notes as Ab major scale. So if the tonic is C, then it's Phrygian, if the tonic is Ab, then it's major. How to figure out which one?

In terms of chord progression, what's the tonic chord? Which chord feels like home? Let's see the progression:

Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim

If it ends on Gdim, but the progression seems to have Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F. Maybe the Ab chord is tonic. Let's think.

If Ab is the tonic, then the chords:

Gdim = vii

Eb/G: Eb major, which in Ab major, v chord should be minor, but maybe it's a major chord.

Bbm/F: ii chord.

Ab/G: Ab tonic chord with G bass – but that's not typical. However, if in context, maybe the bass is moving around.

Alternatively, C Phrygian: C is tonic. Let's see:

C Phrygian diatonic chords:

i: Cm

ii: Dbmaj7

iii: Edim

iv: Fm

v: Gdim

vi: Abmaj

vii: Bbm

Yes. So in this scale, the vi chord is Ab major. The progression has Ab/G, which is Ab major chord, so maybe that's vi chord. And Gdim is v chord. But tonic i chord (Cm) is missing. However, in Phrygian mode, it's not uncommon to have chords that don't explicitly include the tonic.

But another way: in the notes present, C appears in Ab major chord (Ab major has C, which is the third). Also, in Dbmaj7 chord (Db, F, Ab, C). So C is definitely present. If we consider that C is the tonic, even if not directly played as a root, it might still be the center.

But the Ab chord is present as Ab major. If in C Phrygian, Ab is the vi chord. In Ab major, Ab is tonic.

How to determine?

In the context of a song, if the progression is centered around Ab, then Ab chords would be tonic. Let's see the chord progression:

It has Ab/G. If the Ab chord is the tonic, but played with G in the bass, which might be part of a bass line. Also, there's Gdim which is the vii chord in Ab major. Then Bbm is ii chord. Dbmaj7 would be iv chord. So the progression would have ii, iv, vii chords. But also Eb/G – Eb major chord. In Ab major, Eb major chord would be v chord but major. But in Ab major, the v chord is normally Ebm. So Eb major would be a borrowed chord from minor or something.

Alternatively, if it's in C Phrygian, then the chords are vi (Ab), v (Gdim), ii (Dbmaj7), etc. Let's see if there's a pattern where Ab chord is used as a tonal center. For example, Ab major chords: in the progression, Ab/G appears. If the Ab chord is the tonic in a different mode.

Another approach: look for the chord on the tonic. In common practice, often the tonic chord appears at the beginning or end. Looking at the progression: it starts with Gdim and ends with Gdim. But also, there's a Dbmaj7/F followed by Gdim. Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 chord with F bass. The Dbmaj7 chord contains C (as the major seventh note), so that's a strong tendency to resolve to C. But Gdim also contains Bb and Db; Gdim to C minor would be a cadence.

But if the progression ends on Gdim, it's not resolving to tonic. Unless the actual tonic is not played. Maybe the tonic is implied.

Alternatively, the key is C Phrygian because the mode is characterized by b2 and b6, but here we have Db (b2), Ab (b6), Bb (b7), so that fits C Phrygian.

Let's confirm the scale degrees:

C Phrygian:

1. C

2. Db (b2)

3. Eb (b3)

4. F (4)

5. G (5)

6. Ab (b6)

7. Bb (b7)

Yes. So in the chord progression, all the notes fall within this scale. The chords used also fit into this scale:

- Gdim: V degree

- Eb/G: Eb major (but Eb is the ii degree? No. Wait in C Phrygian, iii degree is Edim. Wait, no:

C Phrygian chords:

1. Cm7

2. Dbmaj7

3. Ebdim7 (but Eb minor triad would be Eb, Gb, Bb, but diatonic chord is diminished)

4. Fm7

5. Gm7b5 (diminished)

6. Abmaj7

7. Bbm7

Wait, but in our case, chords like Eb major – but in C Phrygian, the iii chord is Ebdim (which is Ebdim), but they have Eb/G. If Eb/G is Eb major, but diatonic iii chord is diminished. So that would be non-diatonic. Wait, but earlier I thought Eb major is diatonic. Wait, in C Phrygian scale: the notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Eb is the third note. To build a triad on Eb: Eb, G, Bb. Because Eb to G: Eb to F (half step), F to G (whole step) → two steps = major third. Then G to Bb is minor third. So triad Eb, G, Bb → Eb major. But wait, Eb to G is major third, yes. Eb to G is three semitones? No: Eb to E is one, E to F is two, F to G is three semitones. Yes, major third. So Eb major triad has Eb, G, Bb. All of which are within C Phrygian scale. So the iii chord is actually the Eb major triad. Wait, but in a major scale, the iii chord is minor. But in the Phrygian mode, since it's a mode of the major scale, the chords differ.

Wait, C Phrygian is mode of Ab major. So the diatonic chords would be same as Ab major scale, but starting on C. So the chords are:

As per the Ab major scale:

Ab (i), Bb (ii), Cm (iii), Db (IV), Ebm (v), Fm (vi), Gdim (vii)

But when transposed to starting on C for the mode:

C (i), Db (ii), Ebm (iii), F (IV?), wait no. Wait modes rearrange based on the scale.

Let's do this properly. If the parent major scale is Ab major, then:

Scale degrees of Ab major:

1. Ab

2. Bb

3. C

4. Db

5. Eb

6. F

7. G

Now, if we take the scale starting on C (third degree of Ab major), it's C Phrygian. The chord qualities:

C (root), then the intervals above:

C to Db: minor second

C to Eb: minor third

C to F: perfect fourth

C to G: perfect fifth

C to Ab: minor sixth

C to Bb: minor seventh

So the chord on C (i): minor triad.

On Db (ii): Db, F, Ab – which is Db major chord

On Eb (iii): Eb, Gb, Bb – which is diminished

But wait, in the Ab major scale, the notes for Eb: Eb is scale degree 5. The chord on Eb should be Eb minor (Eb, Gb, Bb). But if we're in Phrygian mode starting on C, the chord on Eb is diatonic minor third? Wait, no. The third degree of the C Phrygian scale is Eb. Building a triad on Eb: Eb, G, Bb? No. In the C Phrygian scale, the notes between Eb and next note: Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db. Wait:

Eb to F is whole step

F to G whole

G to Ab half

Ab to Bb whole

Bb to C whole

C to Db half

Db to Eb whole.

So to build triad on Eb: Eb, F, G? No. Triad is root, third, fifth. Eb to G: Eb, F, G – which is major third. Then Eb to Bb is fifth. So Eb major triad? But in the scale: Eb, G is a major third, yes. Then Eb to G is major third (4 semitones), G to Bb is minor third. So Eb major triad: Eb, G, Bb.

But in the diatonic sense for the parent Ab major scale, the chord on Eb is Eb minor (Eb, Gb, Bb). Because in Ab major scale, the 5th degree chord is minor: Eb, Gb, Bb. But Gb is not in the C Phrygian scale. Wait, C Phrygian has G natural, not Gb. So there's a conflict here.

Wait, no. If the parent scale is Ab major (notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G), there is no Gb; it's G natural. But the diatonic triad on Eb in Ab major would be Eb, Gb, Bb? No. Wait, in Ab major scale, Eb is the 5th degree. The notes for the scale are: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So the seventh note is G natural. So the interval from Eb to G: Eb, F, G → G natural. So Eb to G is a major third (since Eb to G is four semitones). Therefore, the diatonic triad on Eb in Ab major scale is Eb major (Eb, G, Bb). Because Eb to G is major third, G to Bb is minor third (total minor triad? Wait, no. Eb major chord: root, major third, perfect fifth. A major triad has root, major third, perfect fifth. So Eb to G is major third (yes), G to Bb is minor third. So Eb, G, Bb is Eb major chord? No! Wait, Eb to Bb is perfect fifth. Yes. So Eb major triad: Eb, G, Bb. Yes. Because Eb to G is major third, G to Bb is minor third → perfect fifth from Eb. So yes, Eb major. But wait, in the Ab major scale, the chord built on Eb should be major? Let's check: for example, in C major scale, the diatonic chords: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim. So V chord is major. Yes. In Ab major scale, the V chord is Eb major. Yes. Because all major scales have major V chord. Wait, yes! In any major scale, the fifth degree chord is major. So Ab major: the fifth degree is Eb. Eb major chord. But Eb major in Ab major scale: Eb, G, Bb. Which are all present in Ab major scale. So yes, Ab major scale has Eb major as its V chord.

But then the C Phrygian mode (which uses Ab major scale) would have the same chords as Ab major scale but with different tonal centers.

Back to C Phrygian: the chords built on each degree:

C: C, Eb, G → Cm (since C to Eb is minor third)

Db: Db, F, Ab → Db major

Eb: Eb, G, Bb → Eb major

F: F, Ab, C → F minor

G: G, Bb, Db → G diminished

Ab: Ab, C, Eb → Ab major

Bb: Bb, Db, F → Bb minor

Wait, so in C Phrygian, the ii chord is Db major, iii is Eb major, iv is Fm, v is Gdim, vi is Ab major, vii is Bbm.

In the chord progression:

- Gdim = v chord

- Eb/G – Eb major, which is iii chord (but with G bass; in Eb major, first inversion would be G, Bb, Eb)

- Bbm/F – Bbm is vii chord of C Phrygian. Second inversion (F bass)

- Ab/G – Ab major, the vi chord

- Dbmaj7/F – Db major seventh chord. Db is ii chord. With F bass – Dbmaj7 in first inversion would be F, Ab, C, Db

So all the chords in the progression fit into C Phrygian mode. Even though there are no Cm chords explicitly used, the tonic could still be C. In many modal progressions, the tonic chord doesn't always appear; sometimes other chords hint at the tonal center.

Another clue: in the Dbmaj7 chord, which contains C as the major seventh. This often creates a strong pull to C, as major seventh chords tend to resolve to tonic. For example, a Dbmaj7 often resolves to C minor or C major.

But in our case, Dbmaj7/F resolves to Gdim. But Gdim could be the v chord, and then maybe Cm would be next, but the progression is cut off. If it were to continue, maybe Dbmaj7 would resolve to C, but the chord here ends on Gdim.

However, considering the presence of C in several chords (C appears in Ab major chord, Dbmaj7 chord, etc.), and the overall scale matches C Phrygian, this is likely the key.

But to confirm, let's see the other scale possibilities. Is there a minor key that includes all notes?

C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. But our chords have Db (C#), not D natural. So C natural minor has D natural, but our progression has Db. So not natural minor.

C Dorian mode: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. Has A natural instead of Ab. But our progression has Ab, so no. Dorian has raised sixth.

C Phrygian has flattened second, which is Db, and flattened sixth (Ab), which matches.

C Aeolian (natural minor) has D and A natural. Not matching.

So C Phrygian is the only fit.

Another check: the notes used are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb – that's seven distinct notes. This is exactly the C Phrygian scale. So the scale is C Phrygian.

Therefore, the key is C Phrygian mode.

But just to make sure. Let's look for the tonic. If this was written as in a song, what would resolve it? If the chords were Cm, that would be clear. But since it's not present, but other chords like Ab (vi), which is common in Phrygian progressions. Also, the fact that the b2 is present, which is a hallmark of Phrygian mode.

Yes, the characteristic note for the Phrygian mode is flattened second, which is Db here. And since the entire progression is using those notes, it's C Phrygian.

The chord progression **Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim** resolves to the key of **C Phrygian mode**.

---

### **Key Identification: C Phrygian**
- **Scale (C Phrygian):**  
  **C Db Eb F G Ab Bb**  
  - This mode is characterized by the **flattened 2nd (Db)** and **flattened 6th (Ab)**, which are present throughout the progression.
  - All chord tones in the progression fit within this scale (no outside notes).

### **Chord Analysis (Diatonic to C Phrygian)**
| Chord           | Diatonic Degree (C Phrygian) | Notes (Chord Structure)       | Comments |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| **Gdim**        | **v** (diminished)           | G, Bb, Db                     | Standard diminished 5th chord in Phrygian. |
| **Eb/G**        | **iii** (major chord)        | G, Bb, Eb (E♭ major 1st inversion) | Eb major triad (Eb, G, Bb), which is diatonic to the scale. |
| **Bbm/F**       | **vii** (minor chord)        | F, Bb, Db (Bb minor 2nd inversion) | Bb minor (Bb, Db, F), diatonic. |
| **Ab/G**        | **vi** (major chord)         | G, Ab, C, Eb (Ab major with G bass) | Ab major (Ab, C, Eb), diatonic. |
| **Dbmaj7/F**    | **ii** (major 7th chord)     | F, Ab, C, Db (Dbmaj7 1st inversion) | Db major 7th (Db, F, Ab, C), diatonic. |

---

### **Why C Phrygian?**
1. **Characteristic Notes:**  
   - The **Db (♭2)** and **Ab (♭6)** are defining features of the Phrygian mode and are consistently present.  
   - The scale includes all the chords used: Gdim (v), Eb major (iii), Ab major (vi), Dbmaj7 (ii), etc.

2. **Lack of Tonic Chord (Cm):**  
   - While the **C minor chord (i)** is not explicitly played, the tonic (C) is implied through:  
     - The note **C** appearing in **Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)** and **Dbmaj7 (Db, F, Ab, C)**.  
     - The **Dbmaj7** chord (ii) strongly pulls to **C** (major 7th resolution to tonic is common in modal progressions).  
     - The **Gdim (v)** chord naturally resolves to **C minor**, typical in Phrygian cadences.

3. **No Conflict with Other Keys:**  
   - **Ab Major** (same notes but tonic on Ab) is less likely because all progression resolves toward **C** (not Ab).  
     - In Ab major, the **v chord would be Eb major**, but the progression emphasizes **Ab = vi** (not tonic).  
   - Other minor modes (e.g., natural minor, Dorian) would require **D natural** or **A natural**, which are absent here.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key:** **C Phrygian mode**  
- **Tonic:** **C** (implied through scale structure and chord tendencies)  
- **Character:** The flattened 2nd (Db) gives the progression a dark, tense, and exotic flavor typical of Phrygian.  
- **Progression Flow:**  
  - Starts with **Gdim (v)** and **Eb/G (iii)**, creating instability.  
  - **Ab/G (vi)** and **Dbmaj7/F (ii)** establish a modal harmonic flow.  
  - Ends with **Gdim (v)**, leaving the resolution to **C minor (i)** unresolved (but strongly implied).  

This is a clear example of a **modal progression centered around C** in the **Phrygian mode**.

To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

### Step 1: Analyze the chords

Let’s list and interpret each chord:

| Chord        | Interpretation                 | Notes (root + intervals)         |
|--------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Gdim         | G diminished triad            | G - Bb - Db                      |
| Eb/G         | Eb major chord with G in bass | G - Bb - Db (same as Gdim!)      |
| Bbm/F        | Bb minor with F in bass       | F - Ab - Bb                      |
| Ab/G         | Ab major with G in bass       | G - Ab - C                       |
| Dbmaj7/F     | Db major 7 with F in bass     | F - Ab - C - Eb (Dbmaj7 = Db F A C? Wait — actually Dbmaj7 = Db F A C? No!) |

Wait — **Dbmaj7** = Db - F - A - C  
So **Dbmaj7/F** = F - Ab - C - Db → That’s actually **Fm7**? Let’s check:

- F (bass)
- Ab (minor 3rd above F)
- C (perfect 5th)
- Db (minor 7th above F? No — Db is a **major 6th** above F, or **minor 7th**?  

Wait: from F to Db is **Eb**, not Db.

**Error here!**

Let’s correct:  
**Dbmaj7** = Db - F - A - C  
So the notes are: Db, F, A, C

Now, Dbmaj7/F = bass F, with notes Db, F, A, C → so the full chord is:  
**F, Ab? No — F is the bass, and above it: Db, A, C**

Wait — **F** is the bass. The other notes are **Db, A, C**

So the full set: **F, Db, A, C**

Now, let’s find the **intervals above F**:

- Db: down a M3? or up? Think in terms of notes above F:
  - F → G → A → B → C → D → Eb → F
  - So Db is **5 semitones below F** → **minor 6th above F**?  
    Actually, from F to Db: F-Eb-D-Db → F to Db = **6 semitones**, so **diminished 6th**? That’s odd.

Let’s re-think:

Better: list all pitches in **Dbmaj7/F**

Chord: Dbmaj7 = Db, F, A, C  
Bass note: F

So the **full sonority** is: **F (bass), Db, A, C**

Let’s sort the notes: **Db, F, A, C**

What key does this belong to?

- Db, F, A, C  
This is a **Db major 7** chord — but the root is Db. Bass is F.

So we’re hearing an **F** in the bass with a **Db major 7** chord above — this creates a **F minor 6 chord**?

Wait:  
F (bass)  
A (M3 above F)  
C (m7 above F)  
Db (m6 above F) — yes: F to Db is **10 semitones = minor 6th**

So: F - A - C - Db = **Fm6** chord?  
Fm6 = F - Ab - C - D → no, that would be **Fm6 = F Ab C D**

We have **F - A - C - Db**

So the chord is: F, A, C, Db

That’s **F7(#5)**? Let’s see:

- F (root)
- A (M3)
- C (P5)
- Db (diminished 7th? or #5?)

Wait: Normally, F7 = F A C Eb  
We have Db instead of Eb → that’s **one semitone lower** → so **C# would be #5**, but we have **Db**, which is **same as C#**

→ **Db = C#**

So: F - A - C - Db = **F7(#5)**?  
F7(#5) = F - A - C# - Eb  
We have: F - A - C - Db → that’s F - A - C - C#? → C and C# at the same time? No — we have **C and Db**, which are **enharmonically different**, but **C and Db are different pitches**.

So if we have **F, A, C, Db** — that’s **F, A, C, Db**

C to Db is a **minor 2nd** — this is a **clash**.

This suggests **Cb or Db** might be intended as enharmonic to **C#**, but written as Db for theoretical reasons.

In many jazz/pop contexts, **Dbmaj7/F** is intended as a **Db major 7 chord in first inversion**, with F as bass — meaning **F is the 3rd of Dbmaj7**, so the chord is still **Dbmaj7**, but **bass is F** — meaning this is **inversion, not a new chord**.

We should treat **Dbmaj7/F** as **Db major 7 chord (Db, F, A, C)** with **F in bass** — same notes, just root position vs inversion.

So maybe we shouldn’t over-analyze the spelling — treat chords as **collections of pitches**, and find a **tonal center**.

Let’s extract **unique pitches** used:

From all chords:

- Gdim = G, Bb, Db  
- Eb/G = G, Bb, Db (same as Gdim)  
- Bbm/F = F, Ab, Bb  
- Ab/G = G, Ab, C  
- Dbmaj7/F = Db, F, A, C

Now list **all unique pitches**:

G, Bb, Db, F, Ab, Bb (again), G, Ab, C, Db, F, A, C

So unique notes:

→ **G, Ab, A, Bb, C, Db, F**

That’s 7 notes: G, Ab, A, Bb, C, Db, F

Wait — **Ab and A** are both present? That’s **enharmonic conflict** — you have **Ab** and **A**, so that’s ♭3 and ♯2? Unusual.

Let’s list **all** pitches mentioned, without doubling:

From chords:

1. Gdim: G, Bb, Db  
2. Eb/G: G, Bb, Db  
3. Bbm/F: F, Ab, Bb  
4. Ab/G: G, Ab, C  
5. Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, A, C

So pitches:  
- G  
- Bb  
- Db  
- F  
- Ab  
- C  
- A ← this is new

A natural! So we have both **A** and **Ab** — that means this is **not diatonic to one key** — it's **chromatic**.

This suggests **modal interchange** or **borrowing** from multiple modes.

But let’s look at **tonal center** — which note feels like "home"?

Notice:  
- **Gdim** appears **8 times** out of 16 chords — that’s 50%!  
- **Eb/G** appears 4 times — which is **same notes as Gdim**  
- **Bbm/F** and **Ab/G** appear twice each  
- **Dbmaj7/F** once  
- Total 16 chords

So **Gdim** is the recurrent chord. The entire progression revolves around **G diminished harmony**.

Now — G diminished is a **symmetric** chord (diminished 7th). It contains:  
G - Bb - Db - E (usually, but here triad is G-Bb-Db)

But **G diminished** is often used as a **leading tone chord** — especially in minor keys.

Let’s think: **Gdim** is the **vii° chord** of **A minor**.

- A natural minor: A B C D E F G → vii° = G Bb D? No — G Bb**B**? Wait:  
In A melodic minor? Let's clarify.

Standard diatonic:

- **A natural minor**: G#dim? No.

Let’s build the **diminished chord on the 7th degree of A minor**:

- A minor scale: A B C D E F G
- 7th degree = G → triad: G B D → G major? No — in harmonic minor we raise 7th → **G#**

So:  
**A harmonic minor**: A B C D E F G# → vii° = G# B D → G#dim

But our chord is **Gdim** = G Bb Db — that’s **not the vii° of Am**.

Wait — Gdim = G Bb Db is the **ii° of F major**?  
F major: F G A Bb C D E → ii° = G Bb D? No — G Bb D is **G half-diminished** (G Bb D F? No, triad is G Bb D).

G Bb D is **G diminished only if the 5th is Db**, not D.

Gdim = G Bb **Db** → so the 5th is **double-flatted**.

So this is **G fully diminished**: G Bb Db

What scale contains G, Bb, Db?

Try: **C harmonic minor**: C D Eb F G Ab B → no G Bb Db.

Try: **F# harmonic minor**: F# G# A B C# D E → no.

Try: **Db major**: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C → Gdim = G Bb Db — C and G are not in Db major.

Wait — **G Bb Db** is the **whole tone scale**? Whole tone has G A B C# D# F — no.

It’s the **half-whole diminished scale**!

The **G half-whole diminished scale** is:

G, Ab, Bb, B, C, D, Eb, F — perfect.

Now, Gdim chord = G, Bb, Db → those are **1st, 3rd, 5th** of G half-whole dim scale.

Also, **Ebdim** and **Gdim** are enharmonically equivalent in diminished 7th tas, because diminished 7th chords are symmetrical: every minor 3rd.

So **Gdim = Bbdim = Dbdim = Ebdim**

So the progression uses **Gdim**, and **Eb/G** — which is just **Gdim in first inversion** — no new info.

Then we get **Bbm/F** = F Ab Bb → so notes: F, Ab, Bb

What key has these?

- F, Ab, Bb = Gb major triad? Gb Bb Db — no.

F, Ab, Bb — that’s **F minor?** F Ab C — we have Bb instead.

**F, Ab, Bb** = Bb is the 5th? No — F to Ab is m3, F to Bb is P4.

Actually — this is **Bb minor triad with F in bass** → so **F - Bb - Ab = Bb minor 1st inversion** → bass is 5th.

But root is Bb.

Then **Ab/G** = G Ab C

That’s **Ab major triad (Ab C Eb)** with G in bass → so it’s **Ab major** with **G in bass**, meaning **G Ab C** — which is **Gb major 9th without 3rd?** Not really.

Wait: **G Ab C** — intervals: G to Ab = m2, G to C = P4. So it's **Gsus4 with Ab** — dissonant.

This sounds like **Bb minor 7th with G bass**? Bb minor 7th = Bb Db F Ab — so we have G Ab C — not matching.

Alternatively — **F Ab Bb** = **Fb major?** No.

Let me try a different approach.

---

### Step 2: Look for key center — focus on final chord: Dbmaj7/F

Final chord: **Dbmaj7/F**  
Then a final **Gdim** — maybe a "resolution".

Dbmaj7 = Db, F, A, C

Gdim = G, Bb, Db

Both chords share **Db**

So **Db** is shared — possible center?

Common cadences in jazz:

- **Gdim → Dbmaj7** — this is a **tritone substitution** relationship?

Gdim is closely related to **D7**, since Gdim = D7b9 without the root (D F# A C → D7b9 = D F# A C E? Wait — D7 = D F# A C, D7b9 = D F# A C E)

Gdim = G Bb Db — which is the **3rd, 5th, 7th of E7**: E7 = E G# B D → so G# = A? No.

Actually, **Gdim is enharmonic to Bdim, Ddim, Fdim** — so it can substitute as **Eb7b9** (since E-7b9 = E G Bb D → no)

Wait — standard tritone sub: The chord that resolves to Db is **G7**, because G is a tritone above Db.

So **G7 → Db** is a strong cadence.

G7 = G B D F#  
Dbmaj7 = Db F A C

Notice: G7 has **B and F#** — Dbmaj7 has **F and A**

B and F# are **tritone**, F and A are **M3**, so not direct.

But we have **Gdim** instead of **G7**

Gdim = G Bb Db — which is **G, Bb, Db** — that’s **D7b9 without the root D**

D7b9 = D F# A C E — but Gdim = G Bb Db

Consider this: **Gdim** = **F#dim** enharmonically? F#dim = F# A C — Gdim = G Bb Db — different.

Wait — **Gdim = G Bb Db** = **Bdim**? Bdim = B D F — no.

Actually, **Gdim7 = G Bb Db E** — we have Gdim triad, not 7th.

Think chromatically: most cadences ending in Dbmaj7 would come from **G7**.

We have **Gdim** → **Dbmaj7** — as if Gdim is replacing G7.

**Gdim** contains: G, Bb, Db — which are **b9, root, and b5** of G7? No.

Actually — **Gdim** = root, ♭3, ♭5  
G7 = G, B, D, F → so Gdim = G, ♭3, ♭5 — missing the 7th.

So perhaps Gdim is acting as a **half-diminished ii** leading to Db?

Wait — in **Db major**, ii chord is **Eb minor 7** = Eb G Bb D

We have nobody Gdim → we have Eb/G — which is G, Bb, Db — same as Gdim

Let’s try this theory:

What if the key is **Db major**?

Db major scale: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C

Now, what chords do we have?

- **Gdim** — G is not in Db major scale → G is major 6th? Db to G is 8 semitones — sharp 6? Not diatonic.

So Ab minor, F minor — header

Wait — let’s try **F minor**?

F minor scale: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

Now:

- Gdim = G Bb Db — G is ♯2, Bb is ♭3? In F minor, Bb is ♭3, Db is ♭6, G is ♯2 — possible

- Eb/G — Eb not in F minor? Eb is ♭7 — F minor has Eb? Yes, F minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb → yes, Eb is ♭7

But Eb/G is G Bb Db — same as Gdim

- Bbm/F — Bb minor chord: Bb Db F — F is bass → in F minor, Bb minor would be iv? F minor has Bb and Db — yes. So Bb minor is **iv chord** in F minor? Yes — F minor harmony: i - iv - V - etc.

Actually: F minor scale:

- i: Fm → F Ab C  
- ii°: Gdim → G Bb D? But we have = G Bb Db — **Db is ♭6**, not D (♮6)

Standard F harmonic minor: F G Ab Bb C Db E → so vii° = E G Bb → Edim

But our Gdim = G Bb Db → Db is ♭6 — in harmonic minor it's ♯7 (E), not Db.

F melodic minor descending: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb — so Db is ♭6, Eb is ♭7.

So **F melodic minor descending** has: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

Now, Gdim = G Bb Db — in this scale: G is ♯2, Bb is ♭3, Db is ♭6 — all present.

Bbm/F = Bb minor = Bb Db F — F is bass → Bb is ♭6, Db is ♭5? Wait, in F melodic minor, Bb minor: pitches Bb, Db, F — yes — Bb is ♭6, Db is ♭5, F is tonic.

So Bb minor is **●iiv** or **●iv** — but scale degree: F=1, G=2, Ab=3, Bb=4, C=5, Db=6, Eb=7

So Bb = 4 → **iv chord**: Bb minor (iv)

Ab/G = Ab major? But Ab is ♭3 — Ab major = Ab C Eb — we have Ab/G = G Ab C — G is 2, Ab is ♭3, C is 5 — so chord: 2 - ♭3 - 5 — that's **not a standard triad**.

But if we think of **Ab major** triad with **G bass**, then we're playing **Ab/C** but with G — it’s a **suspension** — perhaps **Abmaj7 or sus4 with added 9th?**

But notes are G, Ab, C → G is ♭2 of Ab? So it’s a **m2 clash**.

This is odd.

But finally we get **Dbmaj7/F**

In F minor — Db is ♭6, F is tonic.

Dbmaj7 = Db F A C

In F minor scale: we have Db, but not A — A is not in F/melodic minor (F G Ab Bb C Db Eb — no A)

A is **major 3rd** — but F minor has Ab (♭3), not A.

So **A** is an **accidental** — borrowed from major.

Dbmaj7 = Db F A C — A is the **major 3rd**, which is from **F major** — this suggests a **mode mixture** — borrowing from F **major**.

F major: F G A Bb C D E — so Db (♭6) is not in F major.

So we're in a **hybrid**.

---

### Best Interpretation: **F minor** with modal mixture

We are in **F minor**, but borrowing chords from **F major** and **F melodic minor**.

Check frequencies:

- Gdim appears 8x — Gdim is the **ii°** chord in F minor? In natural minor, ii° is G° = G Bb D — but we have G **Bb Db**, so the 5th is Flattened — **G fully diminished = G Bb Db** — this is the **vii°7 of F harmonic minor**, but F harmonic minor has E natural, not Db.

Actually — G Bb Db is **triad based on G**, with ♭3, ♭5 — this is the **half-diminished chord on the 2nd degree** only if the 5th is D (natural) — here it's Db.

So perhaps **Gdim** is acting as a **chromatic passing chord**

But let’s look at the **final cadence**:

Last two chords: **Dbmaj7/F → Gdim**

That sounds like:  
Dbmaj7/F = F - Ab - C - Db (but spelled as Db, F, A, C) → so we hear F, A, C, Db → waits, A natural!

Final chord: Gdim — G Bb Db

So we go from Dbmaj7/F (which includes **A natural**) to Gdim (G Bb Db)

Key change? Or temporary borrowed chord?

But the most plausible key is:

> ### **F minor (F Aeolian)**  
> with borrowings from **F melodic minor** and **F major**, especially the **Dbmaj7/F** implying a deceptively borrowed major mode.

But we have an **A natural** in Dbmaj7/F — that’s the **major 3rd of F major**? No — F major has A natural as major 3rd, yes.

Dbmaj7/F = F A C Db — that’s a **F7(b13)** chord!

F7 = F A C Eb  
We have F A C Db → Db = ♭13th → same as ♭6th → so **F7(b13)**

That’s a standard extension in jazz — F7 with flattened 13th.

But why? And it resolves to Gdim.

F7(b13) → Gdim is a **tritone substitution relationship**?

Tritone: F to B — not G.

G is **half step above F** — so **F7 → Gdim** is a **half-step resolution down** — a chromatic cadence.

This suggests **F minor** — with a **downward chromatic bass line**:

Look at the **bass notes**:

Chord: Bass note

1. Gdim → G  
2. Gdim → G  
3. Eb/G → G  
4. Eb/G → G  
5. Gdim → G  
6. Gdim → G  
7. Bbm/F → **F**  
8. Ab/G → **G**  
9. Gdim → G  
10. Gdim → G  
11. Eb/G → G  
12. Eb/G → G  
13. Gdim → G  
14. Gdim → G  
15. Dbmaj7/F → **F**  
16. Gdim → G

So bass notes: G, G, G, G, G, G, **F**, **G**, G, G, G, G, G, G, **F**, G

So we have **two F’s** — on chord 7 and 15 — on **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F**

And the rest are **G**

So the **tonal center** is **G** — the chord **Gdim** is the foundation

BUT — F is a chromatic bass movement — F to G

This suggests **Gdim** is tonic — **but Gdim is not a tonic chord** — it's dissonant and unstable.

Unless the key is **G minor?**

Let’s try: **G minor**

G melodic minor: G A Bb C D E F#  
But we have many Bb, Db, Ab, F, C, etc.

G natural minor: G A Bb C D Eb F

Now, Gdim = G Bb Db → Db is ♭6 — in G minor, the ♭6 is Eb, not Db.

So Gdim is altered — Db instead of Eb.

So it's **G half-diminished**? G Bb D F — we have G Bb Db — so major 3rd?

Wait — Gdim = G ♭3 ♭5 — so fifth is flattened.

This is **not a scale chord** — it’s **chromatic**.

Most likely answer:

---

### ✅ **Final Answer**

> **Key: G minor**  
> **Mode: G harmonic minor with extensive chromaticism and modal mixture**  
>  
> The progression centers on **G diminished** as the tonic harmony — common in jazz and film music for dramatic effect — even though strictly speaking, diminished chords are not tonic.  
>  
> The use of **Bbm/F** (iv chord) and **Dbmaj7/F** (borrowed from F major, acting as a deceptive resolution or tritone sub) suggests **modal mixture** from **F major** and **F melodic minor**.  
>  
> The recurring **Gdim** and the final **Gdim** after **Dbmaj7/F** imply **G as tonal center**, likely in a **G minor** context, with the **Db** serving as a chromatic alteration of Eb (♭6), pushing toward a sense of tonal ambiguity — characteristic of **modal jazz or neo-Romantic harmony**.

Alternatively, more concisely:

> ### **Key: G minor**  
> ### **Mode: Chromatic/hybrid (G harmonic minor + F major following)**  
>  
> Context: The piece uses **Gdim** as a harmonic anchor with frequent descent to **F (bass)** for subdominant color (Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F), creating a **chromatic bass move: G–F**, facilitating modal mixture between G minor & F major — typical of movie scores and modern jazz.

This is **not strictly diatonic**, but revolves around **G** as the center.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

The chord progression you’ve provided is:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

Let’s analyze this step by step to determine the **key and mode**.

---

### Step 1: Look for tonal center / home chord  
The progression is dominated by **G diminished (Gdim)** chords—appearing **9 times** out of 16. This suggests that **G** is a strong focal point, possibly the tonal center.

However, **diminished chords are symmetrical and unstable**—they don’t strongly imply a key on their own because Gdim = Bbdim = Dbdim = Edim (all the same notes due to symmetry: G–Bb–Db–E). So we need to look at the **other chords** to find context.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the non-diminished chords  
The other chords are:

- **Eb/G** (E♭ major in first inversion → notes: G–B♭–E♭)
- **Bbm/F** (B♭ minor in second inversion → F–B♭–D♭)
- **Ab/G** (A♭ major with G in the bass → G–A♭–C–E♭)
- **Dbmaj7/F** (D♭ major 7 in first inversion → F–A♭–C–D♭)

All these chords **share notes with the key of E♭ minor or G♭ major**, but more tellingly, let’s look at their **note content**:

- Eb = E♭, G, B♭  
- Bbm = B♭, D♭, F  
- Ab = A♭, C, E♭  
- Dbmaj7 = D♭, F, A♭, C  

Collect all unique pitches used:

- **G**, **B♭**, **D♭**, **E♭**, **F**, **A♭**, **C**

That’s **7 notes**:  
**C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭**

This is the **pitch collection of E♭ natural minor** (aka **C♭ major**, enharmonically tricky—but better thought of as **E♭ minor**):

> **E♭ natural minor**: E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭  
Wait—that doesn’t match.

Hold on. Let’s check **G♭ major**:

> G♭ major: G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F

Again, we have **G natural**, not G♭—so that doesn’t fit.

But notice: **we have G natural**, **D♭**, **A♭**, **E♭**, **B♭**, **C**, **F**

That’s actually the key of **E♭ harmonic minor**? Let's see:

- **E♭ harmonic minor**: E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D  
No—still G♭ and C♭.

Alternatively, consider **E♭ melodic minor ascending**: E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D  
Close—but we have **D♭**, not D natural.

So maybe it’s **not E♭ minor**.

---

### Step 3: Consider **G diminished as part of a larger harmonic system**

The G diminished chord (G–B♭–D♭–E) is part of the **octatonic (diminished) scale**, but also commonly appears in **minor keys** as the **vii°7 chord**.

In **A♭ minor**:
- vii°7 = G–B♭–D♭–E → yes! That’s exactly Gdim7.

Let’s test **A♭ minor**:

- A♭ natural minor: A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭ → no match (we have G natural and C natural)

But in **A♭ harmonic minor**:
- A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G → still C♭ and F♭ (we have C and F natural)

So that’s not it.

---

### Step 4: Try **E♭ major**

E♭ major: E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D

We have:  
- E♭ ✅  
- F ✅  
- G ✅  
- A♭ ✅  
- B♭ ✅  
- C ✅  
- **D?** — we have **D♭**, not D natural.

So **D♭ instead of D** suggests **E♭ minor** or a mode with a flat 6 and flat 7.

Wait—what if the tonal center is **G**, and we’re in **G Phrygian** or **G Locrian**?

**G Phrygian** (mode of E♭ major): G, A♭, B♭, C, D, E♭, F  
→ Notes: G, A♭, B♭, C, D, E♭, F  
But we have **D♭**, not D natural → so not Phrygian.

**G Locrian** (mode of A♭ major): G, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F  
→ C♭ = B, but we have **C natural**, not C♭ → so not Locrian.

---

### Step 5: Re-express chords enharmonically

Remember: Gdim = G–B♭–D♭  
But that’s also **E° = E–G–B♭–D♭** (if we add the 7th)

And **E°7** is the **vii°7 of F minor**.

In **F minor**:
- vii°7 = E–G–B♭–D♭ → yes!

So Gdim (as part of E°7) fits in **F minor**.

Now check other chords in **F minor**:

- **Eb/G**: E♭ major = ♭VII chord in F minor → very common
- **Bbm/F**: B♭ minor = iv chord in F minor → yes!
- **Ab/G**: A♭ major over G = A♭/G → A♭ is ♭VI in F minor → also common
- **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭maj7 = ♭II chord in F minor → this is a **Neapolitan** function! Usually N6 = D♭/F in F minor

This is a breakthrough!

### In F minor:
- i = F minor  
- iv = B♭ minor → Bbm/F = iv6/4  
- ♭VI = A♭ major → Ab/G = ♭VI with tonic pedal or passing bass  
- ♭VII = E♭ major → Eb/G = ♭VII6  
- N (Neapolitan) = D♭ major → Dbmaj7/F = N6 with added 7th  
- vii° = E°7 → but we’re seeing Gdim (which is E°7 without the E) → common voicing

And **G** is the **major 2nd** (or ♭II root), but more importantly, **G is the root of the diminished chord built on the 7th scale degree (E)**—but often the **vii° chord** is voiced starting on G (the 3rd of E°7).

So even though Gdim appears often, it’s functioning as **vii°7 (E°7)** in **F minor**, just voiced with G in the bass.

Also, the progression **never resolves to F minor**, but that’s common in modal or coloristic progressions—especially in jazz, film scoring, or impressionist harmony—where the **diminished chord and modal mixture** create tension.

But the **presence of iv (Bbm), ♭VI (Ab), ♭VII (Eb), and Neapolitan (Db)** all strongly point to **F minor**.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: **F minor**  
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**, with frequent use of **harmonic minor** (implied by Gdim = E°7, which requires E♮ in full, but may be omitted), and **modal mixture** (borrowed chords like Neapolitan)

> ✅ **Final Answer**:  
> **Key: F minor**  
> **Mode: Minor (Aeolian/harmonic minor blend)**

The progression is **centered in F minor**, using chromatic and diminished chords typical of minor-key harmony, with Gdim acting as the **vii° chord** (E°7) voiced with G in the bass.

Alright, let's break this down systematically to determine the key and mode of the given chord progression.

### Step 1: List the Chords and Their Notes
First, let's write out the notes in each chord to see what we're working with.

1. **Gdim**: G, Bb, Db
2. **Eb/G**: Eb, G, Bb (with G in the bass)
3. **Bbm/F**: Bb, Db, F (with F in the bass)
4. **Ab/G**: Ab, C, Eb (with G in the bass)
5. **Dbmaj7/F**: Db, F, Ab, C (with F in the bass)

### Step 2: Analyze the Chords for Possible Keys
Now, let's see which keys these chords could belong to. We'll look at the diatonic chords in major and minor keys.

#### Major Keys:
- **C major**: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim
- **Eb major**: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim
- **Ab major**: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim
- **Db major**: Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Ab, Bbm, Cdim

#### Minor Keys:
- **C minor**: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bdim
- **G minor**: Gm, Adim, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, Fdim
- **Bb minor**: Bbm, Cdim, Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Adim
- **Eb minor**: Ebm, Fdim, Gb, Abm, Bbm, Cb, Ddim

Looking at the chords:
- Gdim is in Ab major and Bb minor.
- Eb/G is in Eb major and C minor.
- Bbm/F is in Ab major and Bb minor.
- Ab/G is non-diatonic in most keys (Ab major chord with G bass).
- Dbmaj7/F is in Db major and Bb minor.

The most frequent keys appearing are **Ab major** and **Bb minor**.

### Step 3: Check for Mode (Major vs. Minor)
Now, let's see if it leans more towards major or minor.

- **Ab major**: Chords would be Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.
  - We have Gdim, Bbm, Ab (as Ab/G), Dbmaj7/F. This fits well.
- **Bb minor**: Chords would be Bbm, Cdim, Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Adim.
  - We have Bbm, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim (which is enharmonic to Adim in Bb minor, but Gdim is G,Bb,Db; Adim is A,C,Eb, so not the same), Eb/G.

The Gdim is more native to Ab major than Bb minor (where the vii chord is Adim). Also, Eb/G is the V chord in Ab major, which is very common.

### Step 4: Look at the Bass Movement
The bass line is: G, G, F, G, G, G, F, G.
This doesn't strongly indicate a tonal center, but the chords suggest Ab major is more likely.

### Step 5: Check for Modal Interchange or Borrowed Chords
The Ab/G is a bit unusual. In Ab major, Ab is the I chord, and adding G in the bass makes it I with major 7th in bass (Ab, C, Eb, G), which is like an Abmaj7 in third inversion. This is a bit of a stretch, but plausible.

Alternatively, Ab/G could be seen as a passing chord or a modal interchange, but it's not a standard diatonic chord in Ab major.

### Step 6: Final Determination
Given that:
- Most chords fit diatonically in Ab major (Gdim is vii, Bbm is ii, Dbmaj7 is IV, Eb is V).
- The Ab/G can be interpreted as a coloristic chord or passing chord within Ab major.
- No strong pull towards Bb minor is present (no Fm, no Ebm, etc.).

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

However, the progression has a somewhat ambiguous feel due to the bass movement and the Ab/G chord, but the predominance of Ab major diatonic chords supports this conclusion.

### Final Answer:
**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let’s analyze this chord progression step‑by‑step:

**Progression:**
```
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G 
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim
```

---

### 1. Identify the constituent notes

Let’s list out the notes in each chord:

- **Gdim:** G – Bb – Db  
- **Eb/G:** Eb – G – Bb  
- **Bbm/F:** Bb – Db – F  
- **Ab/G:** Ab – C – Eb – (G in bass)  
- **Dbmaj7/F:** Db – F – Ab – C, (F in bass)

---

### 2. Note relationships

- **Gdim (G–Bb–Db)** is the viio° chord of **Ab** (Ab major scale: Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G).  
- **Eb** is the **V** chord of **Ab**.  
- **Dbmaj7** is the **IVmaj7** chord in Ab major.  
- **Bbm** is the **ii** chord in Ab major.  
- **Ab** itself is the tonic (I).

---

### 3. Observe voice-leading

The bass motion is interesting but can be seen as chromatic embellishment around **G** (the bass of the diminished chord), occasionally dropping to **F** and **G** again.

When we simplify and ignore repeated chords, we have essentially:

**Gdim → Eb → (Bbm → Ab) → Gdim → (Dbmaj7) → Gdim**

These are all closely related chords within **Ab major** (or **Ab Ionian**).

---

### 4. Check for alternative interpretations

Could it be **Eb** major as a key center?  
- Eb would have chords: Eb (I), Fm (ii), Gm (iii), Ab (IV), Bb (V), Cm (vi), Ddim (vii°).  
  → But we have **Gdim**, **Bbm**, **Dbmaj7**, **Ab**, which do *not* fit well in Eb major (especially the Dbmaj7).  
So **Eb** major is less likely.

Could it be **Ab** minor / harmonic / melodic?  
- Gdim within Ab minor would be a leading-tone diminished to Ab, still plausible, but other chords (Eb major and Dbmaj7) imply major mode rather than minor.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Likely key:** **Ab major**
- **Mode:** **Ionian**

**Functional outline:**
```
Gdim  → passing viio°/I
Eb/G  → V (first inversion)
Bbm/F → ii in inversion
Ab/G  → I7sus/G (tonic)
Dbmaj7/F → IVmaj7 in inversion
```

The **Gdim** serves mainly as a leading diminished chord to tonic harmony (I) or as a chromatic connecting chord, but everything centers around **Ab major (Ionian)**.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords often function as passing chords or leading tones, so I should look for the overall tonal center.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G (which is an Eb major chord with a G in the bass)

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Bbm/F (Bbm chord with F in the bass)

- Ab/G (Ab major chord with G in the bass)

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Dbmaj7/F (Dbmaj7 chord with F in the bass)

- Gdim

Now, I see that Gdim appears frequently. Gdim is a diminished chord, which is symmetrical and can be part of several keys. But let's think about what Gdim represents. A diminished chord is often vii° in a key or used as a secondary leading tone chord.

Gdim consists of the notes G, Bb, Db, E. Wait, no, a diminished triad is G, Bb, Db, but since it's written as Gdim, it might be a diminished seventh chord, which would include Fb or E? In standard notation, Gdim7 would be G, Bb, Db, Fb, but Fb is E, so often it's thought of as G, Bb, Db, E. But in chord symbols, Gdim might imply just the triad, but in context, it might be functioning as a full diminished seventh.

In this progression, we have chords like Eb/G, which is Eb major with G bass, so Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So over G bass, it's still an Eb major chord.

Similarly, Bbm/F is Bbm chord with F bass, so Bbm is Bb, Db, F, and with F bass, it's like a first inversion.

Ab/G is Ab major with G bass, so Ab major is Ab, C, Eb, with G bass.

Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 with F bass, so Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C, with F bass.

Now, let's look at the bass notes. From the chords, the bass notes are often G, since Gdim has G bass, Eb/G has G bass, etc. Let's list the bass notes for each chord:

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Bbm/F: bass F

- Ab/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Dbmaj7/F: bass F

- Gdim: bass G

So, the bass is mostly G, with two F bass points. This suggests that G might be an important note, possibly the tonic or dominant.

But Gdim is diminished, so it can't be the tonic in a major or minor key. It might be leading to something.

Let me consider the key based on the chords that aren't diminished. We have Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F.

Eb major, Bbm, Ab major, Dbmaj7.

Eb major is the relative major of C minor, or it could be from Bb major, etc.

Bbm is the subdominant in F minor or something.

Ab major is the subdominant in Eb major, or dominant in Db major, etc.

Dbmaj7 is from Db major or related keys.

Also, all these chords have G in the bass or F in bass, so G is persistent.

Let me think about the function of Gdim. Gdim as a diminished chord can be vii° of Ab minor or something. But let's see the context.

Perhaps Gdim is acting as a common-tone diminished chord or leading to Eb.

Notice that Eb/G is Eb major with G bass, which is similar to having G in the bass, and Eb major has G as its third, so Eb/G is essentially Eb major in first inversion.

Similarly, Ab/G is Ab major with G bass, which is Ab major with a non-chord tone G in bass, so it might be a suspension or something.

In jazz or popular music, such chords are used for voice leading.

Let me write down the chord tones for each chord:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db, E (if diminished seventh) or G, Bb, Db if triad. Since it's written Gdim, it might be triad, but in progressions, it often implies seventh. I'll assume it's a diminished seventh for functionality.

In standard notation, Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, Fb (E), but often written as G°7.

But in chord symbols, Gdim might mean just the triad, but let's see the context. In this case, since we have maj7 chords, it might be that Gdim is full diminished.

From the chords, we have Bbm which is minor, and Dbmaj7, so it's likely that Gdim is G diminished seventh.

So let's assume Gdim = G, Bb, Db, E (E natural, but since Db is there, E natural is fine).

In terms of enharmonics, E natural is the same as Fb, but in context, we'll use E.

Now, Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb — so notes Eb, G, Bb

Bbm/F: Bb, Db, F — so notes Bb, Db, F

Ab/G: Ab, C, Eb — with G bass, so chord tones Ab, C, Eb, but bass G, so overall notes G, Ab, C, Eb? But G is not part of Ab major chord, so it's an added note or suspension.

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C — with F bass, so notes F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, let's see the progression in terms of harmonic movement.

I see that Gdim is repeated, and then Eb/G, which has G in common? Gdim has G, Bb, Db, E and Eb/G has Eb, G, Bb, so they share G and Bb. So from Gdim to Eb/G, the G and Bb are common, and Db moves to Eb? But Db to Eb is a whole step, and E to Eb? E is in Gdim, but in Eb/G, there is no E, so E would resolve to Eb or to F? But in Eb major, E is not a scale tone; Eb major has Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So E natural is not in Eb major scale.

E natural is the leading tone in F major or F minor? E natural is the major seventh of F, but in F minor, the seventh is Eb.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the Gdim is not functioning as a diminished chord in the key, but as a passing chord.

Another thought: in many progressions, diminished chords are used as leading tone chords to the following chord. For example, Gdim often resolves to Ab or A something.

But here, after Gdim, we have Eb/G, which is not Ab.

Let's list the sequence:

Gdim to Eb/G: so Gdim to Eb major.

What is the relationship? Gdim has notes G, Bb, Db, E. Eb major has Eb, G, Bb. So common tones G and Bb, and Db moves to Eb? Db to Eb is ascending, and E moves to Eb? E to Eb is descending half step, which is good for resolution. So E resolves to Eb, and Db resolves to Eb? But Db to Eb is ascending whole step, which is less resolved than descending half step. Typically, in diminished chords, the diminished seventh interval resolves inward, but here E to Eb is half step down, and Db to Eb is whole step up, so not ideal.

Perhaps Gdim is acting as a dominant substitute.

Gdim shares notes with Bb7b9 or something. Bb7 is Bb, D, F, Ab, and Bb7b9 would have Bb, D, F, Ab, Cb? Let's see.

Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E, which is the same as Bbdim7? No, Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G, so yes, Gdim7 is enharmonic to Bbdim7, Dbdim7, and Edim7? Since diminished chords are symmetrical.

Gdim7 = G, Bb, Db, E

Bbdim7 = Bb, Db, E, G — same notes

Dbdim7 = Db, E, G, Bb — same

Edim7 = E, G, Bb, Db — same

So Gdim7 can be from any of these roots.

In terms of resolution, a diminished seventh chord often resolves to a chord a half step above one of its notes. For example, if Gdim7 resolves to Ab, or to A, etc.

But here, it resolves to Eb/G, which is Eb major. Eb is a half step above D? But D is not in Gdim7; Gdim7 has G, Bb, Db, E. Db is a half step below D, but Eb is not D. Eb is a half step above D, but D is not in the chord.

If we consider Gdim7 as vii°7 of Ab minor, it should resolve to Ab minor. But here it resolves to Eb major, which is not Ab minor.

Eb major is the relative major of C minor, so perhaps it's in C minor.

In C minor, the vii°7 is Bdim7, which is B, D, F, Ab, which is not Gdim7.

Gdim7 in C minor would be? C minor harmonic scale has B natural, so vii°7 is Bdim7, which is B, D, F, Ab.

Gdim7 has G, Bb, Db, E. In C minor, G is the dominant, but Gdim7 is not the dominant; G7 is dominant.

Gdim7 could be used as a passing chord in C minor.

Let's look at the other chords: Eb/G is Eb major, which in C minor is the relative major, so III chord. Bbm/F is Bbm, which in C minor is iv chord? C minor has Bb as the submediant? C natural minor has Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, so chords: i Cm, ii° Ddim, III Eb, iv Fm, v Gm, VI Ab, VII Bb. But Bbm is not in C natural minor; Bbm would be bVI in C minor? In C harmonic minor, the chords are i Cm, ii° Ddim, III+ Ebaug, iv Fm, V G, VI Ab, vii° Bdim.

So Bbm is not diatonic to C minor. Bbm would be from C phrygian or something.

Perhaps it's in Eb major.

In Eb major, the chords are I Eb, ii Fm, iii Gm, IV Ab, V Bb, vi Cm, vii° Ddim.

So we have Eb which is I, Bbm which is not diatonic; Bbm would be bvi in Eb major? But Bbm has Bb, Db, F, and Eb major has Bb natural, so Bbm has Db which is not in Eb major scale; Eb major has D natural. So Bbm is borrowed from parallel minor.

Similarly, Ab is IV in Eb major, so Ab/G would be IV with added bass G, which is not diatonic.

Dbmaj7 is not in Eb major; Db is bVII in Eb major, but maj7 would imply major seventh, so Dbmaj7 has Db, F, Ab, C, and Eb major has Db as flat seventh, but C is not in Eb major; Eb major has C natural? Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D, so C natural is there, so if we have Dbmaj7, Db is not in the scale, so it's borrowed.

This seems messy.

Another approach: let's list all the chord roots without inversions. So from the progression, the chords are Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Bbm, Ab, Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Dbmaj7, Gdim.

But with inversions, the bass is mostly G, so perhaps G is the tonal center.

But Gdim is diminished, so if G is tonal center, Gdim would not be the tonic chord.

Perhaps the key is G minor? But Gdim is not the tonic in G minor.

In G minor, the vii°7 is F#dim7, which is F#, A, C, Eb, not Gdim7.

Gdim7 would be from Ab minor or something.

Let's consider the possibility that Gdim is actually functioning as G7b9 without the root? G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab, so if we omit the root G, we have B, D, F, Ab, which is Bdim7, not Gdim7.

Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E, which is different.

Perhaps in this context, Gdim is a substitute for another chord.

Notice that in the progression, we have Eb/G which is Eb with G bass, and Ab/G which is Ab with G bass, so both have G in bass, and Gdim has G in bass, so the bass G is constant, and the chords above are changing. This suggests that G is a pedal point or sustained note.

So the key might be centered on G, but with changing harmonies.

But what mode? If G is the tonic, what chords are used?

The chords over G bass are: Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Ab, Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Dbmaj7, Gdim.

So the harmonies are Eb, Ab, Dbmaj7, and Gdim.

Eb major has notes Eb, G, Bb — over G bass, it's like Eb/G, so the sound is Eb major with G, so from G perspective, it has Eb, G, Bb, which are b6, 1, b3? Let's think in G major or G minor.

If G is tonic, then Eb is b6, which is from G minor, but in G minor, Eb is the minor sixth, so flat sixth.

Ab is b2? Ab is flat second in G.

Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C — over G bass, so notes G, Db, F, Ab, C. In G, Db is b5, F is b7, Ab is b2, C is 4? So it's very chromatic.

Gdim itself has G, Bb, Db, E — so b3, b5, and 6? E is natural 6 in G minor? G harmonic minor has E natural, so in G harmonic minor, the dominant is D7, and vii° is F#dim, but here we have Gdim, which is not diatonic.

Perhaps it's in G harmonic major or something.

Another idea: perhaps the Gdim is actually a misnotation for G7b9 or something, but it's written Gdim, so I'll stick with it.

Let's look at the chord before the end: Dbmaj7/F to Gdim.

Dbmaj7/F has bass F, and notes F, Db, Ab, C. Then to Gdim with bass G.

So from F bass to G bass, and chords Dbmaj7 to Gdim.

Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. Gdim is G, Bb, Db, E.

Common tone Db? Db to Db, F to E? F to E is half step down, Ab to Bb? Ab to Bb is whole step up, C to G? C to G is fifth down.

Not very smooth.

Perhaps Dbmaj7 is acting as a subdominant or something.

Let's consider the key based on the first and last chords. The progression starts with Gdim and ends with Gdim, so it might be that Gdim is the tonic? But diminished chords are unstable and don't function as tonic in traditional harmony. In modern music, it might be possible, but let's see.

Perhaps the key is C minor or Eb major.

Let's try C minor.

In C minor, the chords would be: Gdim - but Gdim is not diatonic. Eb/G is III chord in first inversion? III in C minor is Eb major. Bbm/F - Bbm is bVI chord in C minor? In C natural minor, bVI is Ab, but Bbm is not Ab; Bbm is Bb minor, which would be VII chord in C minor? VII in C natural minor is Bb major, not minor. So Bbm is not diatonic.

Ab/G is bVI chord in C minor? bVI is Ab major, so Ab/G is Ab major with G bass, which is not diatonic bass.

Dbmaj7 is not diatonic to C minor.

So not C minor.

Let's try Eb major.

In Eb major, I = Eb, so Eb/G is I in first inversion. Gdim is not diatonic. Bbm is not diatonic; in Eb major, v is Bb minor? No, V is Bb major, so Bbm is borrowed from parallel minor. Ab is IV chord, so Ab/G is IV with added bass G, which is not diatonic. Dbmaj7 is bVII chord, which is common in rock music, but bVII is Db major, not maj7, but Dbmaj7 implies major seventh, so it's Db major with major seventh, which is not diatonic to Eb major because Eb major has D natural, so Db is flat seventh, and major seventh would be C, but Eb major has C natural, so if Dbmaj7, the C is natural, which is in Eb major, but Db is not, so it's borrowed from Mixolydian or something.

But then Gdim doesn't fit.

Gdim could be used as a passing chord between F and G or something.

In Eb major, the chord between IV and V might use diminished, but Gdim doesn't directly relate.

Another thought: perhaps the Gdim is actually a dominant diminished chord for Ab? But we have Ab/G later, which is Ab with G bass, so perhaps G is the leading tone to Ab? But G is in bass, so it might be that G is a suspension resolving to Ab.

In the progression, after Gdim, we have Eb/G, which doesn't resolve to Ab.

Let's list the chords in order and see the voice leading.

Assume that Gdim is G, Bb, Db, E for simplicity.

Chord 1: Gdim - G, Bb, Db, E

Chord 2: Gdim - same

Chord 3: Eb/G - Eb, G, Bb

So from chord 2 to 3: G stays, Bb stays, Db moves to Eb, E moves to Eb? But E to Eb is half step down, so if E moves to Eb, that's good, but Eb is already in the chord, so it's like E resolves to Eb.

Similarly, Db moves to Eb.

So from Gdim to Eb/G, the notes Db and E both resolve to Eb, so it's like a double leading tone resolution to Eb. But Eb is the root of the chord, so it's resolving to Eb major.

So Gdim is acting as a diminished chord that resolves to Eb major. But what diminished chord resolves to Eb major? Typically, vii°7 of F minor resolves to F minor, or to Eb major? No, vii°7 of F minor is Edim7, which resolves to Fm. But here, Gdim7 resolving to Eb major.

If Gdim7 is considered as Edim7/G, then Edim7 resolves to Fm or F major. But here it resolves to Eb major, which is not F.

Edim7 has notes E, G, Bb, Db, which is the same as Gdim7. So Edim7 should resolve to F. But it resolves to Eb, which is a half step below E? So if Edim7 resolves to Eb, that would be like a deceptive resolution or something.

In some contexts, diminished chords can resolve to chords a half step below.

For example, Edim7 resolving to Ebmajor.

But let's see the other resolutions.

After Eb/G, we have Gdim again, so from Eb/G to Gdim: Eb, G, Bb to G, Bb, Db, E. So G and Bb common, Eb moves to Db? Eb to Db is whole step down, and new note E. So not very resolved.

Then Gdim to Gdim, then to Bbm/F.

Bbm/F is Bb, Db, F. So from Gdim (G,Bb,Db,E) to Bbm/F (F,Bb,Db). So Bb and Db common, G moves to F? G to F is whole step down, and E moves to F? E to F is half step up, so E resolves to F, which is good. And G moves to F, which is also stepwise.

So from Gdim to Bbm/F, the E resolves to F, and G resolves to F, so both upper voices resolve to F, and Bb and Db are common. So this is a good resolution where Gdim acts as a leading chord to Bbm. But Bbm is not a major chord; it's minor, so it's resolving to a minor chord.

Similarly, after Bbm/F, we have Ab/G. Ab/G is Ab, C, Eb with G bass. So from Bbm/F (F,Bb,Db) to Ab/G (G,Ab,C,Eb). So bass from F to G, chord tones from Bb,Db,F to Ab,C,Eb,G. So Bb to Ab? Bb to Ab is whole step down, Db to C is half step down, F to Eb is half step down, and new G in bass. So overall, all voices move down by step except bass moves up. So it's smooth voice leading.

Then Ab/G to Gdim: from Ab/G (G,Ab,C,Eb) to Gdim (G,Bb,Db,E). So G common, Ab moves to Bb? Ab to Bb is whole step up, C moves to Db? C to Db is half step up, Eb moves to E? Eb to E is half step up. So all voices move up by half or whole step, and bass G common. So again, smooth voice leading.

Then Gdim to Eb/G: as before, Db and E to Eb.

Then Gdim to Dbmaj7/F: from Gdim (G,Bb,Db,E) to Dbmaj7/F (F,Db,Ab,C). So bass G to F, chord tones: G to F? G to F is whole step down, Bb to Ab? Bb to Ab is whole step down, Db to Db common, E to C? E to C is minor third down, but E to C is a bit jumpy. Alternatively, E might resolve to F, but F is in the bass, so perhaps E resolves to F in the bass? But in chord tones, E to C is not direct.

In Dbmaj7/F, the notes are F, Db, Ab, C, so from E to C is a third down, which is acceptable, but not as smooth as half step.

Then Dbmaj7/F to Gdim: from F,Db,Ab,C to G,Bb,Db,E. Bass F to G, Db common, Ab to Bb? Ab to Bb whole step up, C to E? C to E major third up, which is not smooth.

So this last transition is less smooth.

But overall, the voice leading is mostly smooth when moving between Gdim and other chords.

Now, from the chords, we have Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7.

If I consider these as primary chords, what key do they suggest?

Eb, Ab, and Db are all flat keys. Eb, Ab, Db are I, IV, and bVII in Eb major, or in Ab major, Eb is V, Ab is I, Db is IV, so in Ab major, we have V, I, IV.

But we have Bbm, which in Ab major is ii chord? In Ab major, chords are I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim.

Oh! Here we have Bbm, which is ii in Ab major, and Eb which is V in Ab major, and Ab which is I, and Db which is IV, and Gdim which is vii° in Ab major.

Gdim is vii° in Ab major? In Ab major, the vii° chord is Gdim, which is G, Bb, Db, and since it's diminished, it should be Gdim7, which is G, Bb, Db, Fb? But in major keys, the vii° is diminished triad, but often used as diminished seventh in harmonic context. In Ab major, the leading tone is G, so vii°7 would be G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is E, so G, Bb, Db, E.

But in Ab major scale, the seventh is G, so for vii°7, it should be G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is not in the scale; Ab major scale has G natural, so the seventh note is G, and for diminished seventh, we need a diminished seventh above G, which is Fb, but Fb is equivalent to E, and E is not in Ab major scale; Ab major has F natural? Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So F natural is there, so if we have Gdim7, it should be G, Bb, Db, F? But G, Bb, Db, F is not a diminished seventh chord; it's a half-diminished chord? G, Bb, Db, F is G half-diminished, which is viiø7 in major keys? In major keys, the vii chord is half-diminished if built on the leading tone.

In major keys, the seventh chord on the leading tone is a half-diminished chord, not fully diminished.

For example, in C major, viiø7 is B, D, F, A.

Similarly, in Ab major, viiø7 should be G, Bb, Db, F.

But in the progression, we have Gdim, which is written as Gdim, which typically means diminished triad, but in context, it might be intended as half-diminished or fully diminished.

But in the chord symbol, Gdim usually means diminished triad, and for half-diminished, it's often written as Gmin7b5 or Gø7.

Here it's written Gdim, so it might be diminished triad, but in the progression, it might be functioning as half-diminished.

But let's see the notes: if Gdim is half-diminished, it would be G, Bb, Db, F.

But in the resolution to Eb/G, if Gdim has F, then F to Eb? F to Eb is half step down, which is good resolution to Eb.

In the resolution to Bbm/F, if Gdim has F, then F is common, so E is not there.

But in my earlier assumption, I had E, but if it's half-diminished, it has F.

Similarly, in Ab major, the viiø7 is G, Bb, Db, F, which resolves to I Ab.

In our progression, we have Gdim resolving to Eb/G, which is not Ab, but Eb is V in Ab major, so viiø7 can resolve to V sometimes.

In classical harmony, viiø7 often resolves to I, but it can resolve to other chords.

In this case, let's assume the key is Ab major.

So in Ab major:

- Gdim: this should be viiø7, so G, Bb, Db, F

- Eb/G: this is V chord in first inversion? V is Eb major, so Eb/G is V6

- Bbm/F: this is ii chord in first inversion? ii is Bbm, so Bbm/F is ii6

- Ab/G: this is I chord with G bass? But G is not in I chord, so it might be I with added seventh or something, but Ab/G has G bass, which is the leading tone, so it could be a dominant function or suspension.

- Dbmaj7/F: this is IV chord with major seventh? IV is Db major, so Dbmaj7 is IVmaj7, which is diatonic in Ab major? In Ab major, IV is Db, and if we add major seventh, it would be C, which is the third of Ab major? Ab major has C, so Dbmaj7 has Db, F, Ab, C, so Ab and C are in scale, but Db and F are in scale, so yes, Dbmaj7 is diatonic to Ab major? Db is the fourth, F is the sixth, Ab is the first, C is the third, so all notes are in Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So Dbmaj7 has Db, F, Ab, C — all in scale? Db is in scale, F is in scale, Ab is tonic, C is in scale. So yes, Dbmaj7 is the IVmaj7 chord in Ab major.

So in Ab major, we have:

- viiø7: Gdim (if we consider it half-diminished)

- V6: Eb/G

- ii6: Bbm/F

- I with bass G: Ab/G — this might be a chord where the bass is the leading tone, so it could be a passing chord or something.

- IVmaj7 in first inversion: Dbmaj7/F

And the progression starts and ends with Gdim, which is viiø7.

In Ab major, viiø7 should resolve to I, but here it often resolves to V6 or other chords.

In the progression, we have Gdim to Eb/G, which is viiø7 to V6, which is common.

Then Gdim to Bbm/F, which is viiø7 to ii6, which is also possible.

Then Ab/G to Gdim, which is I with leading tone bass to viiø7, which is unusual but possible if voice leading.

Then Dbmaj7/F to Gdim, which is IV to vii, which is less common but can be used.

So overall, the key seems to be Ab major.

But what about the mode? Since it's major, mode is Ionian.

But let's confirm the chords.

In the progression, Gdim is written, and if it's half-diminished, it should be Gmin7b5, but it's written Gdim. In some notations, Gdim might imply diminished triad, but in context, it might be intended as half-diminished. Since we have Bbm and Dbmaj7, which are diatonic to Ab major, and Eb is V, it makes sense.

Moreover, the bass G is the leading tone in Ab major, so having G in bass frequently emphasizes the leading tone, which might be creating tension towards Ab.

But in the chord Ab/G, we have Ab chord with G bass, so the G is against Ab chord, which is a dissonance, resolving to Gdim where G is the root.

So in Ab/G, the G might be resolving to G in Gdim, but Gdim has G, so it's like a suspension resolved.

In traditional harmony, Ab/G would be like a V7 chord without the third? Ab/G has notes G, Ab, C, Eb, which is similar to G7b9? G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab? Not exactly.

Ab/G is essentially Ab major with added minor seventh? Ab major with G in bass is like Abmaj7 with G bass, but Abmaj7 is Ab, C, Eb, G, so if we have Ab/G, it is Abmaj7 in first inversion? Abmaj7/G would be Abmaj7 with G bass, but since Abmaj7 has G as the seventh, with G in bass, it would be third inversion? Abmaj7 chords: root position Ab, C, Eb, G; first inversion C, Eb, G, Ab; second inversion Eb, G, Ab, C; third inversion G, Ab, C, Eb. So Ab/G is exactly the third inversion of Abmaj7.

So in Ab major, Imaj7 in third inversion.

Similarly, Eb/G is Eb major with G bass, which is Eb major first inversion, so V6.

Bbm/F is Bbm with F bass, which is ii6.

Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 with F bass, which is IVmaj7 in first inversion? Dbmaj7 root: Db, F, Ab, C; first inversion: F, Ab, C, Db; so Dbmaj7/F is first inversion.

And Gdim is viiø7.

So all chords are diatonic to Ab major except that Gdim is written as dim, but it should be half-diminished.

In chord symbols, sometimes Gdim is used for half-diminished, but technically, Gdim means diminished triad, and Gmin7b5 means half-diminished.

But in this context, it must be half-diminished for it to fit.

Perhaps in this progression, Gdim is played as a triad, but then it would be G, Bb, Db, and without the F, it might still function similarly.

But in the resolution to Bbm/F, if Gdim has no F, then we have E? But if it's triad, it has only G, Bb, Db, so from G,Bb,Db to F,Bb,Db, so G to F, which is fine.

Similarly, to Eb/G, from G,Bb,Db to Eb,G,Bb, so Db to Eb, which is fine.

So even as a triad, it can work.

But in Ab major, the vii chord is Gdim triad, which is diminished triad, so it fits.

So yes, in Ab major, the vii chord is Gdim triad.

And we have Eb which is V, Bbm which is ii, Ab which is I, Db which is IV, and Dbmaj7 which is IVmaj7.

So all chords are from Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

So key: Ab major, mode: Ionian.

But to confirm, the progression starts and ends with vii chord, which is unusual for a tonic, but in modern music, it can be used as a tonic substitute or for ambiguity.

But since we have I chord (Ab/G) and IV and V, it confirms Ab as tonic.

In the progression, Ab/G appears, which is I chord, so tonic is Ab.

So I think this is correct.

The chord progression provided is in the key of **Ab major** (Ionian mode). 

The chords are diatonic to Ab major, with Gdim functioning as the vii° chord (leading tone chord), Eb/G as the V chord in first inversion (V6), Bbm/F as the ii chord in first inversion (ii6), Ab/G as the I chord in third inversion (Imaj7/G), and Dbmaj7/F as the IV chord in first inversion (IVmaj7/F). 

The frequent use of G in the bass emphasizes the leading tone (G) resolving to the tonic (Ab), reinforcing the key center. The progression starts and ends with Gdim, which adds tension but resolves within the context of Ab major.

**Chord Analysis in Ab Major:**
- Gdim: vii° (diminished triad)
- Eb/G: V6 (dominant in first inversion)
- Bbm/F: ii6 (supertonic in first inversion)
- Ab/G: Imaj7/G (tonic major seventh in third inversion)
- Dbmaj7/F: IVmaj7/F (subdominant major seventh in first inversion)

This harmonic movement is characteristic of Ab major, confirming the key and mode.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## 1. List the chords clearly

The progression is:

**Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Eb/G** – **Eb/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Bbm/F** – **Ab/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Eb/G** – **Eb/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Dbmaj7/F** – **Gdim**

---

## 2. Identify chord qualities and possible functions

- **Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ E (fully diminished 7th, symmetric, can be any of Gdim, B♭dim, D♭dim, Edim).
- **Eb/G** = G Eb G B♭ → Eb major triad over G bass. That’s Eb major in 1st inversion.
- **Bbm/F** = F B♭ D → B♭ minor in 1st inversion.
- **Ab/G** = G Ab C Eb → Ab major triad over G bass. This is Ab/G, not a standard diatonic chord in most keys.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F Db F Ab C → Dbmaj7 in 3rd inversion.

---

## 3. Try to find a key from the non-diminished chords

Non-diminished chords: **Eb**, **Bbm**, **Ab**, **Dbmaj7**.

Let’s check possible keys:

- **B♭ minor** (B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭) contains:  
  B♭m, E♭, Ab, D♭maj7? Wait, D♭maj7 in B♭ minor would be D♭ F A♭ C — yes, that’s D♭ major, which is the bVI chord in B♭ minor.  
  So: B♭m, E♭ (IV), Ab (bVII), D♭ (bVI). Yes, all fit B♭ natural minor or B♭ harmonic/melodic minor.

- **E♭ major**? In Eb major: Eb (I), Bbm (vi), Ab (V), but Dbmaj7 is not in Eb major (Db is bVII, but Db major would be Db F Ab — yes, that’s bVII, but Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C — C is not in Eb major scale (C is natural in Eb major? Wait, Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D — yes, C natural! So Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C — Db and C together? That’s a half-step clash. Actually Db is not in Eb major scale (Db is C#), so no, Dbmaj7 is not in Eb major. So Eb major is out.

---

## 4. Check B♭ minor more carefully

B♭ natural minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭.

Chords:
- B♭m = B♭ D♭ F
- E♭ = E♭ G B♭
- A♭ = A♭ C E♭
- D♭maj7 = D♭ F A♭ C — all notes in B♭ natural minor.

Yes, all fit perfectly.

---

## 5. Role of Gdim

Gdim = G B♭ D♭ E = G B♭ C# E. Enharmonically, B♭ = A#; D♭ = C#; E = F♭? No, E is E. Let’s respell for B♭ minor:  
G B♭ D♭ E = G B♭ C# E. In B♭ minor, the notes are: G♭ is in the scale, but G natural is not. So G is raised 7? Actually G natural is in B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ → G natural for harmonic minor. Yes! B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ → no, that’s natural minor. Harmonic minor raises A♭ to A natural. So G is still G♭ in harmonic minor. So G natural is not in B♭ harmonic minor either. So Gdim is an altered chord.

But Gdim7 = G B♭ D♭ E = same as B♭dim7 = B♭ D♭ E G, same as D♭dim7 = D♭ E G B♭, same as Edim7 = E G B♭ D♭.  
In B♭ minor, Edim7 is the vii°7 if we use B♭ harmonic minor (B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A natural). Yes! If A is natural, then E dim7 = E G B♭ D♭ — all notes in B♭ harmonic minor. So Gdim7 is just an inversion of E dim7.

So Gdim = E dim7 in 3rd inversion. E dim7 is vii°7 of F (in B♭ minor, the V chord is F major, and vii°7 of F is E dim7). Yes! So Gdim is functioning as vii°7 / V in B♭ minor.

---

## 6. Check bass movement

Many chords have G in bass: Gdim, Eb/G, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F (F bass), Gdim.  
G pedal point? Possibly.

But functionally: Gdim → Eb (VI) → Gdim → Bbm (i) → Ab/G (bVII with G bass) → Gdim → Eb → Gdim → Dbmaj7 (bVI) → Gdim.

So Gdim is used as a recurring diminished chord, probably always as vii°7 of F (V), but F major itself never appears — it’s a deceptive resolution each time: Gdim goes to Eb (VI) or Bbm (i) or Ab (bVII) or Dbmaj7 (bVI), avoiding the dominant F.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The key is **B♭ minor** (harmonic minor for the dim chord).  
Mode: minor (Aeolian / Harmonic minor mixture).

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{Bb\ minor}
\]

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user has provided a chord progression:
    `Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim`
    They want to know the "key and mode."

2.  **Initial Analysis & First Impressions:**
    *   **Diminished chords everywhere:** `Gdim` is the dominant chord. This is a huge clue. A diminished 7th chord (like Gdim7, which is implied here even if written as Gdim) is highly unstable and strongly wants to resolve. A Gdim7 is made of G, Bb, Db, F. It typically resolves to C minor or C major (or Ab major, its other functional resolution).
    *   **Weird bass notes:** The chords aren't simple triads. `Eb/G`, `Bbm/F`, `Ab/G`, `Dbmaj7/F`. These are slash chords. They suggest a moving bassline, which is a common compositional device. Let's analyze them:
        *   `Eb/G`: This is an Eb major triad (Eb, G, Bb) with G in the bass. It functions as the first inversion of Eb major.
        *   `Bbm/F`: This is a Bb minor triad (Bb, Db, F) with F in the bass. This is the first inversion of Bb minor.
        *   `Ab/G`: This is an Ab major triad (Ab, C, Eb) with G in the bass. This is more unusual. The G is not a chord tone of Ab major. It's a major seventh. So, this is effectively an Abmaj7 chord with the 7th in the bass. It's a very "jazzy" or "impressionistic" sound.
        *   `Dbmaj7/F`: This is a Db major 7th chord (Db, F, Ab, C) with F in the bass. This is the third inversion of a Dbmaj7 chord.

3.  **Synthesize the Chord Information:**
    *   The core chords seem to be: `Gdim`, `Eb`, `Bbm`, `Ab`, `Dbmaj7`.
    *   Let's list the notes in these chords (ignoring inversions for a moment to see the harmonic "palette"):
        *   `Gdim`: G, Bb, Db
        *   `Eb`: Eb, G, Bb
        *   `Bbm`: Bb, Db, F
        *   `Ab`: Ab, C, Eb
        *   `Dbmaj7`: Db, F, Ab, C
    *   Let's collect all the unique notes: G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C.
    *   This collection of notes looks *very* familiar. Let's arrange them in order starting from C:
        C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.
    *   This is the C minor (natural) scale: C, D, **Eb**, F, G, **Ab**, **Bb**.
    *   Wait, where's the D? The chord `Dbmaj7` has a D-flat. The scale has a D-natural. Let's re-examine.
    *   The notes are: C, **Db**, Eb, F, G, **Ab**, Bb.
    *   This is the **C Locrian** scale? No, Locrian is C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb. We have a G natural, not a Gb.
    *   This is the **C Phrygian Dominant** scale? No, that's C, Db, E, F, G, Ab, Bb. We have an Eb, not an E.
    *   This is the **C Harmonic Minor** scale? C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. We have a Bb, not a B natural.
    *   This is the **C Melodic Minor** scale? (Ascending) C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B. Nope.
    *   Let's reconsider the notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. This is the **C Blues Scale** plus a natural 2nd (Db) and a natural 6th (Ab). But that's not a standard "mode." The standard blues scale is C, Eb, F, F#, G, Bb. We have a Db and an Ab instead of an F#.
    *   Let's go back to the most likely candidate: **C Minor (Natural)**. The notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. The only note from the chords that *doesn't* fit is Db. But Db is the enharmonic equivalent of C#. In the context of a minor key, the C# is often used as a leading tone to D. However, here it's just a chord tone (in Dbmaj7).
    *   Let's look at the chords again in the context of C minor.
        *   `Gdim`: This is the vii° chord of C minor (vii°7 is G, Bb, Db, F). This fits *perfectly*. It's the leading tone chord, creating immense tension that wants to resolve to the tonic, Cm.
        *   `Eb/G`: This is the III chord (Eb major) in first inversion. A very common chord in a minor key.
        *   `Bbm/F`: This is the iv chord (Bb minor) in first inversion. Also very common.
        *   `Ab/G`: This is the VI chord (Ab major) with a G in the bass. This G is the leading tone to the tonic C. This acts as a *subdominant* chord that strongly pulls towards the tonic. It's like a `Abmaj7` with a descending bass line G -> F -> Eb -> ... wait no, the bass is G -> G -> G -> F -> G. Let's re-read.
        *   `Dbmaj7/F`: This is the Neapolitan Sixth chord (N6) in C minor. The Neapolitan chord is a major chord built on the flattened second degree of the scale. In C minor, the second degree is D, so the flattened second is Db. So, a Db major chord. The "sixth" part means it's in first inversion (Db/F). `Dbmaj7/F` is an extended version of this, but the function is identical. It's a pre-dominant chord that wants to go to the dominant (G or G7) or the vii° chord (Gdim). This fits *perfectly*.

4.  **Confirm the Key: C Minor**
    *   The evidence is overwhelming:
        1.  The `Gdim` chord is the vii° of C minor. It's the most common and functional diminished chord in the progression.
        2.  The other chords (`III`, `iv`, `VI`, `N6`) are all standard, diatonic or borrowed chords found in the key of C minor.
        3.  The collection of notes (C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb) is almost entirely derived from the C minor scale, with the Db being the key component of the Neapolitan chord, a classic feature of minor key harmony.
        4.  The entire progression feels like it's "floating" or "wandering" but with a strong underlying pull towards a C minor tonic that is never actually stated. This is a common technique in film scores, jazz, and impressionistic music. The tonic is implied, not explicit.

5.  **Determine the Mode:**
    *   The request asks for "key and mode."
    *   The key is **C minor**.
    *   What does "mode" mean here? It could mean:
        *   A mode of the major scale (Dorian, Phrygian, etc.)? No, we've established it's minor-key harmony, not modal harmony. The functional pull of Gdim -> Cm (or the chords that lead to it) is tonal, not modal.
        *   The type of minor scale? Natural, Harmonic, or Melodic?
    *   Let's analyze:
        *   The progression uses chords derived from **natural minor** (iii, iv, VI).
        *   It uses a chord derived from **harmonic minor** (the vii°, Gdim, which comes from the raised 7th, B natural... wait, no it doesn't. Gdim is G, Bb, Db. The vii°7 from harmonic minor would be B°7 (B, D, F, Ab)). Let me correct myself. `Gdim` is the vii°7 from the **natural minor** scale. The V7 chord from harmonic minor would be G7 (G, B, D, F). The progression uses `Gdim`, not `G7`. This reinforces the natural minor connection.
        *   The `Dbmaj7` (Neapolitan) is a chromatic chord, so it doesn't strictly come from one of the three minor scales but is used *within* the context of minor keys.
    *   So, the harmonic language is primarily that of **C Natural Minor**, but with the addition of the chromatic Neapolitan chord (`Dbmaj7`).
    *   Therefore, calling it "C Natural Minor" is the most accurate description. The term "mode" might be slightly misapplied by the user, but if they mean "which minor scale," the answer is natural minor. The overall *feel* is tonal minor, not modal.

6.  **Structure the Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **The key is C Minor.**
    *   Explain *why* in a step-by-step manner.
    *   **Step 1: Identify the Tonal Center.** The `Gdim` chord is the biggest clue. It's the `vii°` chord of C minor. Explain that this chord creates a strong pull towards a C minor tonic that is never played, which is a common compositional technique.
    *   **Step 2: Analyze the Other Chords in the Context of C Minor.** Go through each chord and explain its function.
        *   `Gdim` (vii°7)
        *   `Eb/G` (III, first inversion)
        *   `Bbm/F` (iv, first inversion)
        *   `Ab/G` (VI with a clever bass note that acts as a leading tone)
        *   `Dbmaj7/F` (The Neapolitan Sixth chord, a classic chromatic chord in minor keys)
    *   **Step 3: Address the "Mode" Question.** Explain that the harmony is tonal, not modal. Then, specify which minor scale the harmony is primarily based on. Conclude that it's **C Natural Minor**. Mention that the `Dbmaj7` is a chromatic addition (the Neapolitan) that doesn't alter the fundamental minor key center.
    *   **Provide a Summary/Conclusion:** Reiterate the main points. The progression uses functional chords from C natural minor, plus a classic Neapolitan chord, to create a sense of tension and an unresolved pull towards an implied C minor tonic. The use of inversions creates a descending or "walking" bassline that adds to the atmospheric quality.
    *   **Add a "How it Feels" section:** Describe the sound – atmospheric, tense, unresolved, cinematic, like a question that's never answered. This helps the user connect the theory to the actual sound of the music.

7.  **Final Review:** Read through the explanation. Is it clear? Is it accurate? Does it directly answer the user's question? Yes, it identifies the key (C minor) and clarifies the "mode" part by explaining it's based on natural minor harmony, not a church mode. The explanation is logical and builds from the most obvious clue (`Gdim`) to the more nuanced ones (Neapolitan chord).


This is a fantastic and atmospheric chord progression. Let's break it down.

**The key is C Minor.**

The progression doesn't explicitly play a C minor chord, but every chord is functionally pointing to it as the "home base" or tonic. This is a common technique in film scores and jazz to create a feeling of tension or suspended animation.

Here is the detailed analysis:

### 1. The Primary Clue: The Gdim Chord

The most important clue is the recurring **Gdim** chord. In the key of C minor, the G diminished chord (specifically, G-B♭-D♭) is the **vii°** chord (the leading tone chord). Its primary function is to create intense tension that strongly wants to resolve to the tonic, C minor. By repeating this chord without resolving it, the progression keeps the listener in a state of suspense.

### 2. Analyzing the Chords in the Context of C Minor

Let's look at the other chords and see how they fit within the key of C minor (C-D-E♭-F-G-A♭-B♭).

*   **Gdim (vii°)**: G-B♭-D♭. This is the standard leading-tone chord in C natural minor.
*   **E♭/G (III)**: An E♭ major chord with G in the bass. This is the mediant chord (the III chord) in C minor, a very common and stable-sounding chord within the key.
*   **B♭m/F (iv)**: A B♭ minor chord with F in the bass. This is the subdominant chord (the iv chord) in first inversion. It reinforces the minor tonality.
*   **A♭/G**: An A♭ major chord with G in the bass. This is the submediant chord (the VI chord). The G in the bass is not part of the A♭ chord; it's the leading tone to C. This creates a beautiful, yearning sound that strongly implies a resolution to C minor.
*   **D♭maj7/F**: This is the most telling chord after Gdim. This is a **Neapolitan Sixth chord**.
    *   The **Neapolitan chord** is a major chord built on the flattened second degree of the scale. In C minor, the second degree is D, so the flattened second is D♭. A D♭ major chord is a classic chromatic chord used in minor keys.
    *   The **"sixth"** means it's in first inversion (D♭/F).
    *   The Neapolitan chord is a "pre-dominant" chord, meaning it almost always resolves to a dominant chord (like G or G7) or, in this case, the leading-tone chord (Gdim). Its presence here is a very strong signal that we are in a minor key.

### 3. Determining the "Mode"

The question asks for the key and mode.

*   **Key:** **C Minor**.
*   **Mode:** The harmony here is **tonal**, not modal (like Dorian or Phrygian). The chords have clear functions (leading-tone, subdominant, pre-dominant) that pull towards a tonic.

If "mode" is interpreted as "which type of minor scale," the harmony is drawn almost entirely from **C Natural Minor**, with the addition of the chromatic Neapolitan chord (D♭maj7).

### Summary

| Chord | Function in C Minor | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gdim** | vii° (Leading-tone) | Creates tension, wants to resolve to Cm. |
| **E♭/G** | III (Mediant) | A stable chord within the key. |
| **B♭m/F** | iv (Subdominant) | Reinforces the minor feel. |
| **A♭/G** | VI (Submediant) | The G in the bass acts as a leading tone to C. |
| **D♭maj7/F** | N⁶ (Neapolitan Sixth) | A classic chromatic pre-dominant chord in minor keys. |

**Conclusion:**

The progression is in the key of **C Minor**. It uses functional chords from **C natural minor**, plus the classic **Neapolitan chord**, to create a rich, atmospheric, and unresolved soundscape. The constant use of slash chords gives the progression a descending, "walking" bassline that adds to its cinematic and melancholic quality.

### Reasoning

**Examining Harmonic Context**

I'm now cataloging the chords and their specific qualities, noting Gdim, and Eb/G. I'm taking care to correctly identify each chord's fundamental components before proceeding to the next step.


**Determining Tonal Centers**

I've been analyzing the chord roots and their movements, noting the potential resolutions of the Gdim chord. Now, I am considering Gdim's function, particularly as a leading-tone chord. I'm focusing on the melodic implications and considering the key of Ab minor.


**Evaluating Chord Functionality**

I'm now determining the harmonic function of each chord within the potential tonal context. The Gdim's role as a leading tone chord is further solidified by its frequent appearance. I'm starting to analyze the dominant function of the Eb/G and examining how it supports the Ab minor key center.


**Considering Possible Resolutions**

I'm now focusing on how the chords resolve, particularly the leading-tone pull of the Gdim. I am analyzing the function of Gdim as vii° in Ab minor, and I'm further examining the melodic movement and the resulting harmonic implications. I've re-examined the key signature, to assess the validity of the Gdim and the resulting key signature requirements.


**Determining the Overall Structure**

I'm now going over the implications of Gdim again, and I'm reconsidering Ab minor. The inclusion of Dbmaj7 makes me think I should consider Ab major, too. I've been studying the other chords and their commonality with Ab minor or major. I'm focusing on why Gdim is fully diminished.


**Concluding the Analysis**

I've reached a final conclusion. The harmonic analysis points strongly to Ab major. The Gdim, while seeming at first to suggest Ab minor, is instead a borrowed chord, creating chromatic tension. My focus now is on explaining the borrowed harmony.




The analysis of this chord progression strongly points to $\text{Ab}$ being the tonic center. The use of certain chords, especially the diminished chord, defines the specific mode.

### Chord Analysis and Function (in relation to $\text{Ab}$)

| Chord | Notes | Typical Function in $\text{Ab}$ | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\text{Gdim}$ | G - Bb - Db | $\text{vii}^\circ$ | This is the fully diminished chord built on the leading tone (G). It resolves strongly to $\text{Ab}$. |
| $\text{Eb/G}$ | G - Bb - Eb | $\text{V}$ (Dominant) | $\text{Eb}$ Major is the dominant chord. |
| $\text{Bbm/F}$ | F - Ab - Bb - Db (implied) | $\text{ii}$ (Supertonic) | A common predominant chord in $\text{Ab}$ Major. |
| $\text{Dbmaj7/F}$ | F - Ab - C - Db | $\text{IV}$ (Subdominant) | A common predominant chord in $\text{Ab}$ Major. |

### Determining the Key and Mode

1.  **Tonic Center:** The functional harmony centers around $\text{Ab}$ (the chords resolve to it, and $\text{Eb}$ is the dominant).
2.  **Mode Contenders (Major vs. Minor):**
    *   The presence of $\text{Dbmaj7}$ (Db-F-Ab-**C**) and $\text{Bbm}$ (Bb-Db-F) confirms the use of **Db natural, F natural, and Bb natural**. The $\text{C}$ natural in $\text{Dbmaj7}$ is the crucial deciding factor away from $\text{Ab}$ natural minor (which uses $\text{Cb}$). This strongly indicates the key is $\text{Ab}$ Major, where $\text{Bbm}$ is the $\text{ii}$ and $\text{Dbmaj7}$ is the $\text{IV}$.
    *   In $\text{Ab}$ Major, the diatonic leading tone chord should be $\text{G}$ half-diminished ($\text{G}^ø$: G-Bb-Db-F).
3.  **The Role of Gdim:** The progression uses the fully diminished triad $\text{Gdim}$ (G-Bb-Db). This chord is characteristic of the **Harmonic Minor** scale.
    *   The $\text{Gdim}$ chord is borrowed from $\text{Ab}$ Harmonic Minor (G is the raised 7th scale degree, creating $\text{vii}^\circ$).

### Conclusion

The overall framework $(\text{ii} \rightarrow \text{V} \rightarrow \text{IV} \rightarrow \text{I} \text{ [implied])$ functions primarily within **$\text{Ab}$ Major**. The substitution of the diatonic $\text{vii}^\varnothing$ chord with the fully diminished $\text{vii}^\circ$ provides an intensified dominant function.

**Key and Mode:** **$\text{Ab}$ Major**, utilizing **Borrowed Harmony** ($\text{vii}^\circ$ from $\text{Ab}$ Harmonic Minor).

This chord progression is **Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**.

To determine the key and mode, let's analyze the chords, focusing on the quality (major, minor, diminished) and any shared or altered notes.

### Chord Analysis

| Chord | Notes | Typical Function in Major/Minor |
|---|---|---|
| **Gdim** | G - Bb - Db | Diminished triad (vii° in minor/harmonic major) |
| **Eb/G** | G - Bb - Eb | Eb major in first inversion (III in C minor, bVI in G minor) |
| **Bbm/F** | F - Bb - Db | Bb minor in first inversion (ii in Ab major, iv in F minor) |
| **Ab/G** | G - Ab - C | Ab Major diad/triad over G (bII or bIII related, complex) |
| **Dbmaj7/F** | F - Ab - C - Eb | Db Major 7th in third inversion (bVIIM7 in Eb minor, bVIM7 in F minor) |

### Analyzing the Shared Pitch Collections

The notes present across most of the chords are: **G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C**.

Let's look at the prevalent intervals:

1.  **G Diminished:** G - Bb - Db is everywhere. This is a strong indicator of a diminished or minor key center focused around D, G, or B (C harmonic minor often uses Gdim as vii°).
2.  **Eb Major Triad:** G - Bb - Eb is repeated frequently (Eb/G).
3.  **Bb Minor Triad:** Bb - Db - F is present (Bbm/F).
4.  **Db Major 7th:** Db - F - Ab - C (Dbmaj7/F).

These collection of notes (**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**) perfectly match the **F Harmonic Minor** scale.

*   F Harmonic Minor: F - G - Ab - Bb - C - **Db** - **E** (Wait, there is no E natural in the chords, but there is an Eb).

Let's re-evaluate based on the exact notes **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**. This collection is the **F Phrygian Dominant** (or **Ab Harmonic Minor** starting on F, or **Db Lydian b2** starting on F).

*   **F Phrygian Dominant** (5th mode of Ab Harmonic Minor): F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb. **(Matches perfectly!)**

### Determining the Key Center

The progression is dominated by **Gdim** and chords derived from **Eb Major** (Gdim shares two notes with Eb major: G and Bb).

1.  The frequent appearance and resolution of **Gdim** (vii° chord) usually points to the root of the major/minor key being a half step above or a whole step below the G.
    *   If Gdim is vii°, the key is **Ab minor** (Ab - Bb - Cb - Db - Eb - Fb - G) - This key matches the notes well, but the key center is usually the root of the progression.
2.  **Dbmaj7/F** and **Eb/G** are strong chords that usually function as subdominant or tonic substitutes. This suggests a tonal center built on F, Eb, or Ab.

If we analyze the root movement and common practice:

*   The progression begins and ends on **Gdim**.
*   The overall harmonic collection is **F Phrygian Dominant**.
*   In this mode, the tonic is **F**.
    *   **Gdim** is the ii° chord (G - Bb - Db).
    *   **Eb/G** is the bVII chord (Eb - G - Bb).
    *   **Bbm/F** is the iv chord (Bb - Db - F).
    *   **Dbmaj7/F** is the bVI M7 chord (Db - F - Ab - C).

The progression strongly cycles around the diminished harmony built on G and related minor/flat chords, all of which function clearly within the **F Phrygian Dominant** mode.

### Conclusion

The notes used throughout the progression define the **F Phrygian Dominant** scale (F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb).

While the progression doesn't start or end on an F chord, the usage of ii° (Gdim), bVII (Eb), iv (Bbm), and bVI (Dbmaj7) confirms that **F** is the modal center.

**Key and Mode:**

*   **Key Center:** **F**
*   **Mode:** **Phrygian Dominant** (or Spanish Phrygian)
