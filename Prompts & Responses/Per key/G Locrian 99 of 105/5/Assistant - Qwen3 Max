The chord progression you’ve provided is:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

Let’s analyze this step by step to determine the **key and mode**.

---

### Step 1: Look for tonal center / home chord  
The progression is dominated by **G diminished (Gdim)** chords—appearing **9 times** out of 16. This suggests that **G** is a strong focal point, possibly the tonal center.

However, **diminished chords are symmetrical and unstable**—they don’t strongly imply a key on their own because Gdim = Bbdim = Dbdim = Edim (all the same notes due to symmetry: G–Bb–Db–E). So we need to look at the **other chords** to find context.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the non-diminished chords  
The other chords are:

- **Eb/G** (E♭ major in first inversion → notes: G–B♭–E♭)
- **Bbm/F** (B♭ minor in second inversion → F–B♭–D♭)
- **Ab/G** (A♭ major with G in the bass → G–A♭–C–E♭)
- **Dbmaj7/F** (D♭ major 7 in first inversion → F–A♭–C–D♭)

All these chords **share notes with the key of E♭ minor or G♭ major**, but more tellingly, let’s look at their **note content**:

- Eb = E♭, G, B♭  
- Bbm = B♭, D♭, F  
- Ab = A♭, C, E♭  
- Dbmaj7 = D♭, F, A♭, C  

Collect all unique pitches used:

- **G**, **B♭**, **D♭**, **E♭**, **F**, **A♭**, **C**

That’s **7 notes**:  
**C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭**

This is the **pitch collection of E♭ natural minor** (aka **C♭ major**, enharmonically tricky—but better thought of as **E♭ minor**):

> **E♭ natural minor**: E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭  
Wait—that doesn’t match.

Hold on. Let’s check **G♭ major**:

> G♭ major: G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F

Again, we have **G natural**, not G♭—so that doesn’t fit.

But notice: **we have G natural**, **D♭**, **A♭**, **E♭**, **B♭**, **C**, **F**

That’s actually the key of **E♭ harmonic minor**? Let's see:

- **E♭ harmonic minor**: E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D  
No—still G♭ and C♭.

Alternatively, consider **E♭ melodic minor ascending**: E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D  
Close—but we have **D♭**, not D natural.

So maybe it’s **not E♭ minor**.

---

### Step 3: Consider **G diminished as part of a larger harmonic system**

The G diminished chord (G–B♭–D♭–E) is part of the **octatonic (diminished) scale**, but also commonly appears in **minor keys** as the **vii°7 chord**.

In **A♭ minor**:
- vii°7 = G–B♭–D♭–E → yes! That’s exactly Gdim7.

Let’s test **A♭ minor**:

- A♭ natural minor: A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭ → no match (we have G natural and C natural)

But in **A♭ harmonic minor**:
- A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G → still C♭ and F♭ (we have C and F natural)

So that’s not it.

---

### Step 4: Try **E♭ major**

E♭ major: E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D

We have:  
- E♭ ✅  
- F ✅  
- G ✅  
- A♭ ✅  
- B♭ ✅  
- C ✅  
- **D?** — we have **D♭**, not D natural.

So **D♭ instead of D** suggests **E♭ minor** or a mode with a flat 6 and flat 7.

Wait—what if the tonal center is **G**, and we’re in **G Phrygian** or **G Locrian**?

**G Phrygian** (mode of E♭ major): G, A♭, B♭, C, D, E♭, F  
→ Notes: G, A♭, B♭, C, D, E♭, F  
But we have **D♭**, not D natural → so not Phrygian.

**G Locrian** (mode of A♭ major): G, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F  
→ C♭ = B, but we have **C natural**, not C♭ → so not Locrian.

---

### Step 5: Re-express chords enharmonically

Remember: Gdim = G–B♭–D♭  
But that’s also **E° = E–G–B♭–D♭** (if we add the 7th)

And **E°7** is the **vii°7 of F minor**.

In **F minor**:
- vii°7 = E–G–B♭–D♭ → yes!

So Gdim (as part of E°7) fits in **F minor**.

Now check other chords in **F minor**:

- **Eb/G**: E♭ major = ♭VII chord in F minor → very common
- **Bbm/F**: B♭ minor = iv chord in F minor → yes!
- **Ab/G**: A♭ major over G = A♭/G → A♭ is ♭VI in F minor → also common
- **Dbmaj7/F**: D♭maj7 = ♭II chord in F minor → this is a **Neapolitan** function! Usually N6 = D♭/F in F minor

This is a breakthrough!

### In F minor:
- i = F minor  
- iv = B♭ minor → Bbm/F = iv6/4  
- ♭VI = A♭ major → Ab/G = ♭VI with tonic pedal or passing bass  
- ♭VII = E♭ major → Eb/G = ♭VII6  
- N (Neapolitan) = D♭ major → Dbmaj7/F = N6 with added 7th  
- vii° = E°7 → but we’re seeing Gdim (which is E°7 without the E) → common voicing

And **G** is the **major 2nd** (or ♭II root), but more importantly, **G is the root of the diminished chord built on the 7th scale degree (E)**—but often the **vii° chord** is voiced starting on G (the 3rd of E°7).

So even though Gdim appears often, it’s functioning as **vii°7 (E°7)** in **F minor**, just voiced with G in the bass.

Also, the progression **never resolves to F minor**, but that’s common in modal or coloristic progressions—especially in jazz, film scoring, or impressionist harmony—where the **diminished chord and modal mixture** create tension.

But the **presence of iv (Bbm), ♭VI (Ab), ♭VII (Eb), and Neapolitan (Db)** all strongly point to **F minor**.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: **F minor**  
- **Mode**: **Aeolian (natural minor)**, with frequent use of **harmonic minor** (implied by Gdim = E°7, which requires E♮ in full, but may be omitted), and **modal mixture** (borrowed chords like Neapolitan)

> ✅ **Final Answer**:  
> **Key: F minor**  
> **Mode: Minor (Aeolian/harmonic minor blend)**

The progression is **centered in F minor**, using chromatic and diminished chords typical of minor-key harmony, with Gdim acting as the **vii° chord** (E°7) voiced with G in the bass.
