**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords often function as passing chords or leading tones, so I should look for the overall tonal center.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G (which is an Eb major chord with a G in the bass)

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Bbm/F (Bbm chord with F in the bass)

- Ab/G (Ab major chord with G in the bass)

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Eb/G

- Eb/G

- Gdim

- Gdim

- Dbmaj7/F (Dbmaj7 chord with F in the bass)

- Gdim

Now, I see that Gdim appears frequently. Gdim is a diminished chord, which is symmetrical and can be part of several keys. But let's think about what Gdim represents. A diminished chord is often vii° in a key or used as a secondary leading tone chord.

Gdim consists of the notes G, Bb, Db, E. Wait, no, a diminished triad is G, Bb, Db, but since it's written as Gdim, it might be a diminished seventh chord, which would include Fb or E? In standard notation, Gdim7 would be G, Bb, Db, Fb, but Fb is E, so often it's thought of as G, Bb, Db, E. But in chord symbols, Gdim might imply just the triad, but in context, it might be functioning as a full diminished seventh.

In this progression, we have chords like Eb/G, which is Eb major with G bass, so Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So over G bass, it's still an Eb major chord.

Similarly, Bbm/F is Bbm chord with F bass, so Bbm is Bb, Db, F, and with F bass, it's like a first inversion.

Ab/G is Ab major with G bass, so Ab major is Ab, C, Eb, with G bass.

Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 with F bass, so Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C, with F bass.

Now, let's look at the bass notes. From the chords, the bass notes are often G, since Gdim has G bass, Eb/G has G bass, etc. Let's list the bass notes for each chord:

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Bbm/F: bass F

- Ab/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Eb/G: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Gdim: bass G

- Dbmaj7/F: bass F

- Gdim: bass G

So, the bass is mostly G, with two F bass points. This suggests that G might be an important note, possibly the tonic or dominant.

But Gdim is diminished, so it can't be the tonic in a major or minor key. It might be leading to something.

Let me consider the key based on the chords that aren't diminished. We have Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F.

Eb major, Bbm, Ab major, Dbmaj7.

Eb major is the relative major of C minor, or it could be from Bb major, etc.

Bbm is the subdominant in F minor or something.

Ab major is the subdominant in Eb major, or dominant in Db major, etc.

Dbmaj7 is from Db major or related keys.

Also, all these chords have G in the bass or F in bass, so G is persistent.

Let me think about the function of Gdim. Gdim as a diminished chord can be vii° of Ab minor or something. But let's see the context.

Perhaps Gdim is acting as a common-tone diminished chord or leading to Eb.

Notice that Eb/G is Eb major with G bass, which is similar to having G in the bass, and Eb major has G as its third, so Eb/G is essentially Eb major in first inversion.

Similarly, Ab/G is Ab major with G bass, which is Ab major with a non-chord tone G in bass, so it might be a suspension or something.

In jazz or popular music, such chords are used for voice leading.

Let me write down the chord tones for each chord:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db, E (if diminished seventh) or G, Bb, Db if triad. Since it's written Gdim, it might be triad, but in progressions, it often implies seventh. I'll assume it's a diminished seventh for functionality.

In standard notation, Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, Fb (E), but often written as G°7.

But in chord symbols, Gdim might mean just the triad, but let's see the context. In this case, since we have maj7 chords, it might be that Gdim is full diminished.

From the chords, we have Bbm which is minor, and Dbmaj7, so it's likely that Gdim is G diminished seventh.

So let's assume Gdim = G, Bb, Db, E (E natural, but since Db is there, E natural is fine).

In terms of enharmonics, E natural is the same as Fb, but in context, we'll use E.

Now, Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb — so notes Eb, G, Bb

Bbm/F: Bb, Db, F — so notes Bb, Db, F

Ab/G: Ab, C, Eb — with G bass, so chord tones Ab, C, Eb, but bass G, so overall notes G, Ab, C, Eb? But G is not part of Ab major chord, so it's an added note or suspension.

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C — with F bass, so notes F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, let's see the progression in terms of harmonic movement.

I see that Gdim is repeated, and then Eb/G, which has G in common? Gdim has G, Bb, Db, E and Eb/G has Eb, G, Bb, so they share G and Bb. So from Gdim to Eb/G, the G and Bb are common, and Db moves to Eb? But Db to Eb is a whole step, and E to Eb? E is in Gdim, but in Eb/G, there is no E, so E would resolve to Eb or to F? But in Eb major, E is not a scale tone; Eb major has Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So E natural is not in Eb major scale.

E natural is the leading tone in F major or F minor? E natural is the major seventh of F, but in F minor, the seventh is Eb.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the Gdim is not functioning as a diminished chord in the key, but as a passing chord.

Another thought: in many progressions, diminished chords are used as leading tone chords to the following chord. For example, Gdim often resolves to Ab or A something.

But here, after Gdim, we have Eb/G, which is not Ab.

Let's list the sequence:

Gdim to Eb/G: so Gdim to Eb major.

What is the relationship? Gdim has notes G, Bb, Db, E. Eb major has Eb, G, Bb. So common tones G and Bb, and Db moves to Eb? Db to Eb is ascending, and E moves to Eb? E to Eb is descending half step, which is good for resolution. So E resolves to Eb, and Db resolves to Eb? But Db to Eb is ascending whole step, which is less resolved than descending half step. Typically, in diminished chords, the diminished seventh interval resolves inward, but here E to Eb is half step down, and Db to Eb is whole step up, so not ideal.

Perhaps Gdim is acting as a dominant substitute.

Gdim shares notes with Bb7b9 or something. Bb7 is Bb, D, F, Ab, and Bb7b9 would have Bb, D, F, Ab, Cb? Let's see.

Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E, which is the same as Bbdim7? No, Bbdim7 is Bb, Db, E, G, so yes, Gdim7 is enharmonic to Bbdim7, Dbdim7, and Edim7? Since diminished chords are symmetrical.

Gdim7 = G, Bb, Db, E

Bbdim7 = Bb, Db, E, G — same notes

Dbdim7 = Db, E, G, Bb — same

Edim7 = E, G, Bb, Db — same

So Gdim7 can be from any of these roots.

In terms of resolution, a diminished seventh chord often resolves to a chord a half step above one of its notes. For example, if Gdim7 resolves to Ab, or to A, etc.

But here, it resolves to Eb/G, which is Eb major. Eb is a half step above D? But D is not in Gdim7; Gdim7 has G, Bb, Db, E. Db is a half step below D, but Eb is not D. Eb is a half step above D, but D is not in the chord.

If we consider Gdim7 as vii°7 of Ab minor, it should resolve to Ab minor. But here it resolves to Eb major, which is not Ab minor.

Eb major is the relative major of C minor, so perhaps it's in C minor.

In C minor, the vii°7 is Bdim7, which is B, D, F, Ab, which is not Gdim7.

Gdim7 in C minor would be? C minor harmonic scale has B natural, so vii°7 is Bdim7, which is B, D, F, Ab.

Gdim7 has G, Bb, Db, E. In C minor, G is the dominant, but Gdim7 is not the dominant; G7 is dominant.

Gdim7 could be used as a passing chord in C minor.

Let's look at the other chords: Eb/G is Eb major, which in C minor is the relative major, so III chord. Bbm/F is Bbm, which in C minor is iv chord? C minor has Bb as the submediant? C natural minor has Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, so chords: i Cm, ii° Ddim, III Eb, iv Fm, v Gm, VI Ab, VII Bb. But Bbm is not in C natural minor; Bbm would be bVI in C minor? In C harmonic minor, the chords are i Cm, ii° Ddim, III+ Ebaug, iv Fm, V G, VI Ab, vii° Bdim.

So Bbm is not diatonic to C minor. Bbm would be from C phrygian or something.

Perhaps it's in Eb major.

In Eb major, the chords are I Eb, ii Fm, iii Gm, IV Ab, V Bb, vi Cm, vii° Ddim.

So we have Eb which is I, Bbm which is not diatonic; Bbm would be bvi in Eb major? But Bbm has Bb, Db, F, and Eb major has Bb natural, so Bbm has Db which is not in Eb major scale; Eb major has D natural. So Bbm is borrowed from parallel minor.

Similarly, Ab is IV in Eb major, so Ab/G would be IV with added bass G, which is not diatonic.

Dbmaj7 is not in Eb major; Db is bVII in Eb major, but maj7 would imply major seventh, so Dbmaj7 has Db, F, Ab, C, and Eb major has Db as flat seventh, but C is not in Eb major; Eb major has C natural? Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D, so C natural is there, so if we have Dbmaj7, Db is not in the scale, so it's borrowed.

This seems messy.

Another approach: let's list all the chord roots without inversions. So from the progression, the chords are Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Bbm, Ab, Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Dbmaj7, Gdim.

But with inversions, the bass is mostly G, so perhaps G is the tonal center.

But Gdim is diminished, so if G is tonal center, Gdim would not be the tonic chord.

Perhaps the key is G minor? But Gdim is not the tonic in G minor.

In G minor, the vii°7 is F#dim7, which is F#, A, C, Eb, not Gdim7.

Gdim7 would be from Ab minor or something.

Let's consider the possibility that Gdim is actually functioning as G7b9 without the root? G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab, so if we omit the root G, we have B, D, F, Ab, which is Bdim7, not Gdim7.

Gdim7 is G, Bb, Db, E, which is different.

Perhaps in this context, Gdim is a substitute for another chord.

Notice that in the progression, we have Eb/G which is Eb with G bass, and Ab/G which is Ab with G bass, so both have G in bass, and Gdim has G in bass, so the bass G is constant, and the chords above are changing. This suggests that G is a pedal point or sustained note.

So the key might be centered on G, but with changing harmonies.

But what mode? If G is the tonic, what chords are used?

The chords over G bass are: Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Ab, Gdim, Eb, Gdim, Dbmaj7, Gdim.

So the harmonies are Eb, Ab, Dbmaj7, and Gdim.

Eb major has notes Eb, G, Bb — over G bass, it's like Eb/G, so the sound is Eb major with G, so from G perspective, it has Eb, G, Bb, which are b6, 1, b3? Let's think in G major or G minor.

If G is tonic, then Eb is b6, which is from G minor, but in G minor, Eb is the minor sixth, so flat sixth.

Ab is b2? Ab is flat second in G.

Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C — over G bass, so notes G, Db, F, Ab, C. In G, Db is b5, F is b7, Ab is b2, C is 4? So it's very chromatic.

Gdim itself has G, Bb, Db, E — so b3, b5, and 6? E is natural 6 in G minor? G harmonic minor has E natural, so in G harmonic minor, the dominant is D7, and vii° is F#dim, but here we have Gdim, which is not diatonic.

Perhaps it's in G harmonic major or something.

Another idea: perhaps the Gdim is actually a misnotation for G7b9 or something, but it's written Gdim, so I'll stick with it.

Let's look at the chord before the end: Dbmaj7/F to Gdim.

Dbmaj7/F has bass F, and notes F, Db, Ab, C. Then to Gdim with bass G.

So from F bass to G bass, and chords Dbmaj7 to Gdim.

Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. Gdim is G, Bb, Db, E.

Common tone Db? Db to Db, F to E? F to E is half step down, Ab to Bb? Ab to Bb is whole step up, C to G? C to G is fifth down.

Not very smooth.

Perhaps Dbmaj7 is acting as a subdominant or something.

Let's consider the key based on the first and last chords. The progression starts with Gdim and ends with Gdim, so it might be that Gdim is the tonic? But diminished chords are unstable and don't function as tonic in traditional harmony. In modern music, it might be possible, but let's see.

Perhaps the key is C minor or Eb major.

Let's try C minor.

In C minor, the chords would be: Gdim - but Gdim is not diatonic. Eb/G is III chord in first inversion? III in C minor is Eb major. Bbm/F - Bbm is bVI chord in C minor? In C natural minor, bVI is Ab, but Bbm is not Ab; Bbm is Bb minor, which would be VII chord in C minor? VII in C natural minor is Bb major, not minor. So Bbm is not diatonic.

Ab/G is bVI chord in C minor? bVI is Ab major, so Ab/G is Ab major with G bass, which is not diatonic bass.

Dbmaj7 is not diatonic to C minor.

So not C minor.

Let's try Eb major.

In Eb major, I = Eb, so Eb/G is I in first inversion. Gdim is not diatonic. Bbm is not diatonic; in Eb major, v is Bb minor? No, V is Bb major, so Bbm is borrowed from parallel minor. Ab is IV chord, so Ab/G is IV with added bass G, which is not diatonic. Dbmaj7 is bVII chord, which is common in rock music, but bVII is Db major, not maj7, but Dbmaj7 implies major seventh, so it's Db major with major seventh, which is not diatonic to Eb major because Eb major has D natural, so Db is flat seventh, and major seventh would be C, but Eb major has C natural, so if Dbmaj7, the C is natural, which is in Eb major, but Db is not, so it's borrowed from Mixolydian or something.

But then Gdim doesn't fit.

Gdim could be used as a passing chord between F and G or something.

In Eb major, the chord between IV and V might use diminished, but Gdim doesn't directly relate.

Another thought: perhaps the Gdim is actually a dominant diminished chord for Ab? But we have Ab/G later, which is Ab with G bass, so perhaps G is the leading tone to Ab? But G is in bass, so it might be that G is a suspension resolving to Ab.

In the progression, after Gdim, we have Eb/G, which doesn't resolve to Ab.

Let's list the chords in order and see the voice leading.

Assume that Gdim is G, Bb, Db, E for simplicity.

Chord 1: Gdim - G, Bb, Db, E

Chord 2: Gdim - same

Chord 3: Eb/G - Eb, G, Bb

So from chord 2 to 3: G stays, Bb stays, Db moves to Eb, E moves to Eb? But E to Eb is half step down, so if E moves to Eb, that's good, but Eb is already in the chord, so it's like E resolves to Eb.

Similarly, Db moves to Eb.

So from Gdim to Eb/G, the notes Db and E both resolve to Eb, so it's like a double leading tone resolution to Eb. But Eb is the root of the chord, so it's resolving to Eb major.

So Gdim is acting as a diminished chord that resolves to Eb major. But what diminished chord resolves to Eb major? Typically, vii°7 of F minor resolves to F minor, or to Eb major? No, vii°7 of F minor is Edim7, which resolves to Fm. But here, Gdim7 resolving to Eb major.

If Gdim7 is considered as Edim7/G, then Edim7 resolves to Fm or F major. But here it resolves to Eb major, which is not F.

Edim7 has notes E, G, Bb, Db, which is the same as Gdim7. So Edim7 should resolve to F. But it resolves to Eb, which is a half step below E? So if Edim7 resolves to Eb, that would be like a deceptive resolution or something.

In some contexts, diminished chords can resolve to chords a half step below.

For example, Edim7 resolving to Ebmajor.

But let's see the other resolutions.

After Eb/G, we have Gdim again, so from Eb/G to Gdim: Eb, G, Bb to G, Bb, Db, E. So G and Bb common, Eb moves to Db? Eb to Db is whole step down, and new note E. So not very resolved.

Then Gdim to Gdim, then to Bbm/F.

Bbm/F is Bb, Db, F. So from Gdim (G,Bb,Db,E) to Bbm/F (F,Bb,Db). So Bb and Db common, G moves to F? G to F is whole step down, and E moves to F? E to F is half step up, so E resolves to F, which is good. And G moves to F, which is also stepwise.

So from Gdim to Bbm/F, the E resolves to F, and G resolves to F, so both upper voices resolve to F, and Bb and Db are common. So this is a good resolution where Gdim acts as a leading chord to Bbm. But Bbm is not a major chord; it's minor, so it's resolving to a minor chord.

Similarly, after Bbm/F, we have Ab/G. Ab/G is Ab, C, Eb with G bass. So from Bbm/F (F,Bb,Db) to Ab/G (G,Ab,C,Eb). So bass from F to G, chord tones from Bb,Db,F to Ab,C,Eb,G. So Bb to Ab? Bb to Ab is whole step down, Db to C is half step down, F to Eb is half step down, and new G in bass. So overall, all voices move down by step except bass moves up. So it's smooth voice leading.

Then Ab/G to Gdim: from Ab/G (G,Ab,C,Eb) to Gdim (G,Bb,Db,E). So G common, Ab moves to Bb? Ab to Bb is whole step up, C moves to Db? C to Db is half step up, Eb moves to E? Eb to E is half step up. So all voices move up by half or whole step, and bass G common. So again, smooth voice leading.

Then Gdim to Eb/G: as before, Db and E to Eb.

Then Gdim to Dbmaj7/F: from Gdim (G,Bb,Db,E) to Dbmaj7/F (F,Db,Ab,C). So bass G to F, chord tones: G to F? G to F is whole step down, Bb to Ab? Bb to Ab is whole step down, Db to Db common, E to C? E to C is minor third down, but E to C is a bit jumpy. Alternatively, E might resolve to F, but F is in the bass, so perhaps E resolves to F in the bass? But in chord tones, E to C is not direct.

In Dbmaj7/F, the notes are F, Db, Ab, C, so from E to C is a third down, which is acceptable, but not as smooth as half step.

Then Dbmaj7/F to Gdim: from F,Db,Ab,C to G,Bb,Db,E. Bass F to G, Db common, Ab to Bb? Ab to Bb whole step up, C to E? C to E major third up, which is not smooth.

So this last transition is less smooth.

But overall, the voice leading is mostly smooth when moving between Gdim and other chords.

Now, from the chords, we have Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7.

If I consider these as primary chords, what key do they suggest?

Eb, Ab, and Db are all flat keys. Eb, Ab, Db are I, IV, and bVII in Eb major, or in Ab major, Eb is V, Ab is I, Db is IV, so in Ab major, we have V, I, IV.

But we have Bbm, which in Ab major is ii chord? In Ab major, chords are I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim.

Oh! Here we have Bbm, which is ii in Ab major, and Eb which is V in Ab major, and Ab which is I, and Db which is IV, and Gdim which is vii° in Ab major.

Gdim is vii° in Ab major? In Ab major, the vii° chord is Gdim, which is G, Bb, Db, and since it's diminished, it should be Gdim7, which is G, Bb, Db, Fb? But in major keys, the vii° is diminished triad, but often used as diminished seventh in harmonic context. In Ab major, the leading tone is G, so vii°7 would be G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is E, so G, Bb, Db, E.

But in Ab major scale, the seventh is G, so for vii°7, it should be G, Bb, Db, Fb? But Fb is not in the scale; Ab major scale has G natural, so the seventh note is G, and for diminished seventh, we need a diminished seventh above G, which is Fb, but Fb is equivalent to E, and E is not in Ab major scale; Ab major has F natural? Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So F natural is there, so if we have Gdim7, it should be G, Bb, Db, F? But G, Bb, Db, F is not a diminished seventh chord; it's a half-diminished chord? G, Bb, Db, F is G half-diminished, which is viiø7 in major keys? In major keys, the vii chord is half-diminished if built on the leading tone.

In major keys, the seventh chord on the leading tone is a half-diminished chord, not fully diminished.

For example, in C major, viiø7 is B, D, F, A.

Similarly, in Ab major, viiø7 should be G, Bb, Db, F.

But in the progression, we have Gdim, which is written as Gdim, which typically means diminished triad, but in context, it might be intended as half-diminished or fully diminished.

But in the chord symbol, Gdim usually means diminished triad, and for half-diminished, it's often written as Gmin7b5 or Gø7.

Here it's written Gdim, so it might be diminished triad, but in the progression, it might be functioning as half-diminished.

But let's see the notes: if Gdim is half-diminished, it would be G, Bb, Db, F.

But in the resolution to Eb/G, if Gdim has F, then F to Eb? F to Eb is half step down, which is good resolution to Eb.

In the resolution to Bbm/F, if Gdim has F, then F is common, so E is not there.

But in my earlier assumption, I had E, but if it's half-diminished, it has F.

Similarly, in Ab major, the viiø7 is G, Bb, Db, F, which resolves to I Ab.

In our progression, we have Gdim resolving to Eb/G, which is not Ab, but Eb is V in Ab major, so viiø7 can resolve to V sometimes.

In classical harmony, viiø7 often resolves to I, but it can resolve to other chords.

In this case, let's assume the key is Ab major.

So in Ab major:

- Gdim: this should be viiø7, so G, Bb, Db, F

- Eb/G: this is V chord in first inversion? V is Eb major, so Eb/G is V6

- Bbm/F: this is ii chord in first inversion? ii is Bbm, so Bbm/F is ii6

- Ab/G: this is I chord with G bass? But G is not in I chord, so it might be I with added seventh or something, but Ab/G has G bass, which is the leading tone, so it could be a dominant function or suspension.

- Dbmaj7/F: this is IV chord with major seventh? IV is Db major, so Dbmaj7 is IVmaj7, which is diatonic in Ab major? In Ab major, IV is Db, and if we add major seventh, it would be C, which is the third of Ab major? Ab major has C, so Dbmaj7 has Db, F, Ab, C, so Ab and C are in scale, but Db and F are in scale, so yes, Dbmaj7 is diatonic to Ab major? Db is the fourth, F is the sixth, Ab is the first, C is the third, so all notes are in Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So Dbmaj7 has Db, F, Ab, C — all in scale? Db is in scale, F is in scale, Ab is tonic, C is in scale. So yes, Dbmaj7 is the IVmaj7 chord in Ab major.

So in Ab major, we have:

- viiø7: Gdim (if we consider it half-diminished)

- V6: Eb/G

- ii6: Bbm/F

- I with bass G: Ab/G — this might be a chord where the bass is the leading tone, so it could be a passing chord or something.

- IVmaj7 in first inversion: Dbmaj7/F

And the progression starts and ends with Gdim, which is viiø7.

In Ab major, viiø7 should resolve to I, but here it often resolves to V6 or other chords.

In the progression, we have Gdim to Eb/G, which is viiø7 to V6, which is common.

Then Gdim to Bbm/F, which is viiø7 to ii6, which is also possible.

Then Ab/G to Gdim, which is I with leading tone bass to viiø7, which is unusual but possible if voice leading.

Then Dbmaj7/F to Gdim, which is IV to vii, which is less common but can be used.

So overall, the key seems to be Ab major.

But what about the mode? Since it's major, mode is Ionian.

But let's confirm the chords.

In the progression, Gdim is written, and if it's half-diminished, it should be Gmin7b5, but it's written Gdim. In some notations, Gdim might imply diminished triad, but in context, it might be intended as half-diminished. Since we have Bbm and Dbmaj7, which are diatonic to Ab major, and Eb is V, it makes sense.

Moreover, the bass G is the leading tone in Ab major, so having G in bass frequently emphasizes the leading tone, which might be creating tension towards Ab.

But in the chord Ab/G, we have Ab chord with G bass, so the G is against Ab chord, which is a dissonance, resolving to Gdim where G is the root.

So in Ab/G, the G might be resolving to G in Gdim, but Gdim has G, so it's like a suspension resolved.

In traditional harmony, Ab/G would be like a V7 chord without the third? Ab/G has notes G, Ab, C, Eb, which is similar to G7b9? G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab? Not exactly.

Ab/G is essentially Ab major with added minor seventh? Ab major with G in bass is like Abmaj7 with G bass, but Abmaj7 is Ab, C, Eb, G, so if we have Ab/G, it is Abmaj7 in first inversion? Abmaj7/G would be Abmaj7 with G bass, but since Abmaj7 has G as the seventh, with G in bass, it would be third inversion? Abmaj7 chords: root position Ab, C, Eb, G; first inversion C, Eb, G, Ab; second inversion Eb, G, Ab, C; third inversion G, Ab, C, Eb. So Ab/G is exactly the third inversion of Abmaj7.

So in Ab major, Imaj7 in third inversion.

Similarly, Eb/G is Eb major with G bass, which is Eb major first inversion, so V6.

Bbm/F is Bbm with F bass, which is ii6.

Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 with F bass, which is IVmaj7 in first inversion? Dbmaj7 root: Db, F, Ab, C; first inversion: F, Ab, C, Db; so Dbmaj7/F is first inversion.

And Gdim is viiø7.

So all chords are diatonic to Ab major except that Gdim is written as dim, but it should be half-diminished.

In chord symbols, sometimes Gdim is used for half-diminished, but technically, Gdim means diminished triad, and Gmin7b5 means half-diminished.

But in this context, it must be half-diminished for it to fit.

Perhaps in this progression, Gdim is played as a triad, but then it would be G, Bb, Db, and without the F, it might still function similarly.

But in the resolution to Bbm/F, if Gdim has no F, then we have E? But if it's triad, it has only G, Bb, Db, so from G,Bb,Db to F,Bb,Db, so G to F, which is fine.

Similarly, to Eb/G, from G,Bb,Db to Eb,G,Bb, so Db to Eb, which is fine.

So even as a triad, it can work.

But in Ab major, the vii chord is Gdim triad, which is diminished triad, so it fits.

So yes, in Ab major, the vii chord is Gdim triad.

And we have Eb which is V, Bbm which is ii, Ab which is I, Db which is IV, and Dbmaj7 which is IVmaj7.

So all chords are from Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

So key: Ab major, mode: Ionian.

But to confirm, the progression starts and ends with vii chord, which is unusual for a tonic, but in modern music, it can be used as a tonic substitute or for ambiguity.

But since we have I chord (Ab/G) and IV and V, it confirms Ab as tonic.

In the progression, Ab/G appears, which is I chord, so tonic is Ab.

So I think this is correct.

The chord progression provided is in the key of **Ab major** (Ionian mode). 

The chords are diatonic to Ab major, with Gdim functioning as the vii° chord (leading tone chord), Eb/G as the V chord in first inversion (V6), Bbm/F as the ii chord in first inversion (ii6), Ab/G as the I chord in third inversion (Imaj7/G), and Dbmaj7/F as the IV chord in first inversion (IVmaj7/F). 

The frequent use of G in the bass emphasizes the leading tone (G) resolving to the tonic (Ab), reinforcing the key center. The progression starts and ends with Gdim, which adds tension but resolves within the context of Ab major.

**Chord Analysis in Ab Major:**
- Gdim: vii° (diminished triad)
- Eb/G: V6 (dominant in first inversion)
- Bbm/F: ii6 (supertonic in first inversion)
- Ab/G: Imaj7/G (tonic major seventh in third inversion)
- Dbmaj7/F: IVmaj7/F (subdominant major seventh in first inversion)

This harmonic movement is characteristic of Ab major, confirming the key and mode.
