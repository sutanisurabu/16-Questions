Alright, let's break this down systematically to determine the key and mode of the given chord progression.

### Step 1: List the Chords and Their Notes
First, let's write out the notes in each chord to see what we're working with.

1. **Gdim**: G, Bb, Db
2. **Eb/G**: Eb, G, Bb (with G in the bass)
3. **Bbm/F**: Bb, Db, F (with F in the bass)
4. **Ab/G**: Ab, C, Eb (with G in the bass)
5. **Dbmaj7/F**: Db, F, Ab, C (with F in the bass)

### Step 2: Analyze the Chords for Possible Keys
Now, let's see which keys these chords could belong to. We'll look at the diatonic chords in major and minor keys.

#### Major Keys:
- **C major**: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim
- **Eb major**: Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb, Cm, Ddim
- **Ab major**: Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim
- **Db major**: Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Ab, Bbm, Cdim

#### Minor Keys:
- **C minor**: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bdim
- **G minor**: Gm, Adim, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, Fdim
- **Bb minor**: Bbm, Cdim, Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Adim
- **Eb minor**: Ebm, Fdim, Gb, Abm, Bbm, Cb, Ddim

Looking at the chords:
- Gdim is in Ab major and Bb minor.
- Eb/G is in Eb major and C minor.
- Bbm/F is in Ab major and Bb minor.
- Ab/G is non-diatonic in most keys (Ab major chord with G bass).
- Dbmaj7/F is in Db major and Bb minor.

The most frequent keys appearing are **Ab major** and **Bb minor**.

### Step 3: Check for Mode (Major vs. Minor)
Now, let's see if it leans more towards major or minor.

- **Ab major**: Chords would be Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb, Fm, Gdim.
  - We have Gdim, Bbm, Ab (as Ab/G), Dbmaj7/F. This fits well.
- **Bb minor**: Chords would be Bbm, Cdim, Db, Ebm, Fm, Gb, Adim.
  - We have Bbm, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim (which is enharmonic to Adim in Bb minor, but Gdim is G,Bb,Db; Adim is A,C,Eb, so not the same), Eb/G.

The Gdim is more native to Ab major than Bb minor (where the vii chord is Adim). Also, Eb/G is the V chord in Ab major, which is very common.

### Step 4: Look at the Bass Movement
The bass line is: G, G, F, G, G, G, F, G.
This doesn't strongly indicate a tonal center, but the chords suggest Ab major is more likely.

### Step 5: Check for Modal Interchange or Borrowed Chords
The Ab/G is a bit unusual. In Ab major, Ab is the I chord, and adding G in the bass makes it I with major 7th in bass (Ab, C, Eb, G), which is like an Abmaj7 in third inversion. This is a bit of a stretch, but plausible.

Alternatively, Ab/G could be seen as a passing chord or a modal interchange, but it's not a standard diatonic chord in Ab major.

### Step 6: Final Determination
Given that:
- Most chords fit diatonically in Ab major (Gdim is vii, Bbm is ii, Dbmaj7 is IV, Eb is V).
- The Ab/G can be interpreted as a coloristic chord or passing chord within Ab major.
- No strong pull towards Bb minor is present (no Fm, no Ebm, etc.).

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**

However, the progression has a somewhat ambiguous feel due to the bass movement and the Ab/G chord, but the predominance of Ab major diatonic chords supports this conclusion.

### Final Answer:
**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian (major)**
