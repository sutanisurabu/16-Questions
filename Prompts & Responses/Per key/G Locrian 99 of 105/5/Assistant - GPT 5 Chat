Let’s analyze this chord progression step‑by‑step:

**Progression:**
```
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G 
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim
```

### 1. Identify the constituent notes

Let’s list out the notes in each chord:

- **Gdim:** G – Bb – Db  
- **Eb/G:** Eb – G – Bb  
- **Bbm/F:** Bb – Db – F  
- **Ab/G:** Ab – C – Eb – (G in bass)  
- **Dbmaj7/F:** Db – F – Ab – C, (F in bass)

---

### 2. Note relationships

- **Gdim (G–Bb–Db)** is the viio° chord of **Ab** (Ab major scale: Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G).  
- **Eb** is the **V** chord of **Ab**.  
- **Dbmaj7** is the **IVmaj7** chord in Ab major.  
- **Bbm** is the **ii** chord in Ab major.  
- **Ab** itself is the tonic (I).

### 3. Observe voice-leading

The bass motion is interesting but can be seen as chromatic embellishment around **G** (the bass of the diminished chord), occasionally dropping to **F** and **G** again.

When we simplify and ignore repeated chords, we have essentially:

**Gdim → Eb → (Bbm → Ab) → Gdim → (Dbmaj7) → Gdim**

These are all closely related chords within **Ab major** (or **Ab Ionian**).

### 4. Check for alternative interpretations

Could it be **Eb** major as a key center?  
- Eb would have chords: Eb (I), Fm (ii), Gm (iii), Ab (IV), Bb (V), Cm (vi), Ddim (vii°).  
  → But we have **Gdim**, **Bbm**, **Dbmaj7**, **Ab**, which do *not* fit well in Eb major (especially the Dbmaj7).  
So **Eb** major is less likely.

Could it be **Ab** minor / harmonic / melodic?  
- Gdim within Ab minor would be a leading-tone diminished to Ab, still plausible, but other chords (Eb major and Dbmaj7) imply major mode rather than minor.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Likely key:** **Ab major**
- **Mode:** **Ionian**

**Functional outline:**
```
Gdim  → passing viio°/I
Eb/G  → V (first inversion)
Bbm/F → ii in inversion
Ab/G  → I7sus/G (tonic)
Dbmaj7/F → IVmaj7 in inversion
```

The **Gdim** serves mainly as a leading diminished chord to tonic harmony (I) or as a chromatic connecting chord, but everything centers around **Ab major (Ionian)**.
