### Step 1: Analyze the chords

Let’s list and interpret each chord:

| Chord        | Interpretation                 | Notes (root + intervals)         |
|--------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Gdim         | G diminished triad            | G - Bb - Db                      |
| Eb/G         | Eb major chord with G in bass | G - Bb - Db (same as Gdim!)      |
| Bbm/F        | Bb minor with F in bass       | F - Ab - Bb                      |
| Ab/G         | Ab major with G in bass       | G - Ab - C                       |
| Dbmaj7/F     | Db major 7 with F in bass     | F - Ab - C - Eb (Dbmaj7 = Db F A C? Wait — actually Dbmaj7 = Db F A C? No!) |

Wait — **Dbmaj7** = Db - F - A - C  
So **Dbmaj7/F** = F - Ab - C - Db → That’s actually **Fm7**? Let’s check:

- F (bass)
- Ab (minor 3rd above F)
- C (perfect 5th)
- Db (minor 7th above F? No — Db is a **major 6th** above F, or **minor 7th**?  

Wait: from F to Db is **Eb**, not Db.

**Error here!**

Let’s correct:  
**Dbmaj7** = Db - F - A - C  
So the notes are: Db, F, A, C

Now, Dbmaj7/F = bass F, with notes Db, F, A, C → so the full chord is:  
**F, Ab? No — F is the bass, and above it: Db, A, C**

Wait — **F** is the bass. The other notes are **Db, A, C**

So the full set: **F, Db, A, C**

Now, let’s find the **intervals above F**:

- Db: down a M3? or up? Think in terms of notes above F:
  - F → G → A → B → C → D → Eb → F
  - So Db is **5 semitones below F** → **minor 6th above F**?  
    Actually, from F to Db: F-Eb-D-Db → F to Db = **6 semitones**, so **diminished 6th**? That’s odd.

Let’s re-think:

Better: list all pitches in **Dbmaj7/F**

Chord: Dbmaj7 = Db, F, A, C  
Bass note: F

So the **full sonority** is: **F (bass), Db, A, C**

Let’s sort the notes: **Db, F, A, C**

What key does this belong to?

- Db, F, A, C  
This is a **Db major 7** chord — but the root is Db. Bass is F.

So we’re hearing an **F** in the bass with a **Db major 7** chord above — this creates a **F minor 6 chord**?

Wait:  
F (bass)  
A (M3 above F)  
C (m7 above F)  
Db (m6 above F) — yes: F to Db is **10 semitones = minor 6th**

So: F - A - C - Db = **Fm6** chord?  
Fm6 = F - Ab - C - D → no, that would be **Fm6 = F Ab C D**

We have **F - A - C - Db**

So the chord is: F, A, C, Db

That’s **F7(#5)**? Let’s see:

- F (root)
- A (M3)
- C (P5)
- Db (diminished 7th? or #5?)

Wait: Normally, F7 = F A C Eb  
We have Db instead of Eb → that’s **one semitone lower** → so **C# would be #5**, but we have **Db**, which is **same as C#**

→ **Db = C#**

So: F - A - C - Db = **F7(#5)**?  
F7(#5) = F - A - C# - Eb  
We have: F - A - C - Db → that’s F - A - C - C#? → C and C# at the same time? No — we have **C and Db**, which are **enharmonically different**, but **C and Db are different pitches**.

So if we have **F, A, C, Db** — that’s **F, A, C, Db**

C to Db is a **minor 2nd** — this is a **clash**.

This suggests **Cb or Db** might be intended as enharmonic to **C#**, but written as Db for theoretical reasons.

In many jazz/pop contexts, **Dbmaj7/F** is intended as a **Db major 7 chord in first inversion**, with F as bass — meaning **F is the 3rd of Dbmaj7**, so the chord is still **Dbmaj7**, but **bass is F** — meaning this is **inversion, not a new chord**.

We should treat **Dbmaj7/F** as **Db major 7 chord (Db, F, A, C)** with **F in bass** — same notes, just root position vs inversion.

So maybe we shouldn’t over-analyze the spelling — treat chords as **collections of pitches**, and find a **tonal center**.

Let’s extract **unique pitches** used:

From all chords:

- Gdim = G, Bb, Db  
- Eb/G = G, Bb, Db (same as Gdim)  
- Bbm/F = F, Ab, Bb  
- Ab/G = G, Ab, C  
- Dbmaj7/F = Db, F, A, C

Now list **all unique pitches**:

G, Bb, Db, F, Ab, Bb (again), G, Ab, C, Db, F, A, C

So unique notes:

→ **G, Ab, A, Bb, C, Db, F**

That’s 7 notes: G, Ab, A, Bb, C, Db, F

Wait — **Ab and A** are both present? That’s **enharmonic conflict** — you have **Ab** and **A**, so that’s ♭3 and ♯2? Unusual.

Let’s list **all** pitches mentioned, without doubling:

From chords:

1. Gdim: G, Bb, Db  
2. Eb/G: G, Bb, Db  
3. Bbm/F: F, Ab, Bb  
4. Ab/G: G, Ab, C  
5. Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, A, C

So pitches:  
- G  
- Bb  
- Db  
- F  
- Ab  
- C  
- A ← this is new

A natural! So we have both **A** and **Ab** — that means this is **not diatonic to one key** — it's **chromatic**.

This suggests **modal interchange** or **borrowing** from multiple modes.

But let’s look at **tonal center** — which note feels like "home"?

Notice:  
- **Gdim** appears **8 times** out of 16 chords — that’s 50%!  
- **Eb/G** appears 4 times — which is **same notes as Gdim**  
- **Bbm/F** and **Ab/G** appear twice each  
- **Dbmaj7/F** once  
- Total 16 chords

So **Gdim** is the recurrent chord. The entire progression revolves around **G diminished harmony**.

Now — G diminished is a **symmetric** chord (diminished 7th). It contains:  
G - Bb - Db - E (usually, but here triad is G-Bb-Db)

But **G diminished** is often used as a **leading tone chord** — especially in minor keys.

Let’s think: **Gdim** is the **vii° chord** of **A minor**.

- A natural minor: A B C D E F G → vii° = G Bb D? No — G Bb**B**? Wait:  
In A melodic minor? Let's clarify.

Standard diatonic:

- **A natural minor**: G#dim? No.

Let’s build the **diminished chord on the 7th degree of A minor**:

- A minor scale: A B C D E F G
- 7th degree = G → triad: G B D → G major? No — in harmonic minor we raise 7th → **G#**

So:  
**A harmonic minor**: A B C D E F G# → vii° = G# B D → G#dim

But our chord is **Gdim** = G Bb Db — that’s **not the vii° of Am**.

Wait — Gdim = G Bb Db is the **ii° of F major**?  
F major: F G A Bb C D E → ii° = G Bb D? No — G Bb D is **G half-diminished** (G Bb D F? No, triad is G Bb D).

G Bb D is **G diminished only if the 5th is Db**, not D.

Gdim = G Bb **Db** → so the 5th is **double-flatted**.

So this is **G fully diminished**: G Bb Db

What scale contains G, Bb, Db?

Try: **C harmonic minor**: C D Eb F G Ab B → no G Bb Db.

Try: **F# harmonic minor**: F# G# A B C# D E → no.

Try: **Db major**: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C → Gdim = G Bb Db — C and G are not in Db major.

Wait — **G Bb Db** is the **whole tone scale**? Whole tone has G A B C# D# F — no.

It’s the **half-whole diminished scale**!

The **G half-whole diminished scale** is:

G, Ab, Bb, B, C, D, Eb, F — perfect.

Now, Gdim chord = G, Bb, Db → those are **1st, 3rd, 5th** of G half-whole dim scale.

Also, **Ebdim** and **Gdim** are enharmonically equivalent in diminished 7th tas, because diminished 7th chords are symmetrical: every minor 3rd.

So **Gdim = Bbdim = Dbdim = Ebdim**

So the progression uses **Gdim**, and **Eb/G** — which is just **Gdim in first inversion** — no new info.

Then we get **Bbm/F** = F Ab Bb → so notes: F, Ab, Bb

What key has these?

- F, Ab, Bb = Gb major triad? Gb Bb Db — no.

F, Ab, Bb — that’s **F minor?** F Ab C — we have Bb instead.

**F, Ab, Bb** = Bb is the 5th? No — F to Ab is m3, F to Bb is P4.

Actually — this is **Bb minor triad with F in bass** → so **F - Bb - Ab = Bb minor 1st inversion** → bass is 5th.

But root is Bb.

Then **Ab/G** = G Ab C

That’s **Ab major triad (Ab C Eb)** with G in bass → so it’s **Ab major** with **G in bass**, meaning **G Ab C** — which is **Gb major 9th without 3rd?** Not really.

Wait: **G Ab C** — intervals: G to Ab = m2, G to C = P4. So it's **Gsus4 with Ab** — dissonant.

This sounds like **Bb minor 7th with G bass**? Bb minor 7th = Bb Db F Ab — so we have G Ab C — not matching.

Alternatively — **F Ab Bb** = **Fb major?** No.

Let me try a different approach.

---

### Step 2: Look for key center — focus on final chord: Dbmaj7/F

Final chord: **Dbmaj7/F**  
Then a final **Gdim** — maybe a "resolution".

Dbmaj7 = Db, F, A, C

Gdim = G, Bb, Db

Both chords share **Db**

So **Db** is shared — possible center?

Common cadences in jazz:

- **Gdim → Dbmaj7** — this is a **tritone substitution** relationship?

Gdim is closely related to **D7**, since Gdim = D7b9 without the root (D F# A C → D7b9 = D F# A C E? Wait — D7 = D F# A C, D7b9 = D F# A C E)

Gdim = G Bb Db — which is the **3rd, 5th, 7th of E7**: E7 = E G# B D → so G# = A? No.

Actually, **Gdim is enharmonic to Bdim, Ddim, Fdim** — so it can substitute as **Eb7b9** (since E-7b9 = E G Bb D → no)

Wait — standard tritone sub: The chord that resolves to Db is **G7**, because G is a tritone above Db.

So **G7 → Db** is a strong cadence.

G7 = G B D F#  
Dbmaj7 = Db F A C

Notice: G7 has **B and F#** — Dbmaj7 has **F and A**

B and F# are **tritone**, F and A are **M3**, so not direct.

But we have **Gdim** instead of **G7**

Gdim = G Bb Db — which is **G, Bb, Db** — that’s **D7b9 without the root D**

D7b9 = D F# A C E — but Gdim = G Bb Db

Consider this: **Gdim** = **F#dim** enharmonically? F#dim = F# A C — Gdim = G Bb Db — different.

Wait — **Gdim = G Bb Db** = **Bdim**? Bdim = B D F — no.

Actually, **Gdim7 = G Bb Db E** — we have Gdim triad, not 7th.

Think chromatically: most cadences ending in Dbmaj7 would come from **G7**.

We have **Gdim** → **Dbmaj7** — as if Gdim is replacing G7.

**Gdim** contains: G, Bb, Db — which are **b9, root, and b5** of G7? No.

Actually — **Gdim** = root, ♭3, ♭5  
G7 = G, B, D, F → so Gdim = G, ♭3, ♭5 — missing the 7th.

So perhaps Gdim is acting as a **half-diminished ii** leading to Db?

Wait — in **Db major**, ii chord is **Eb minor 7** = Eb G Bb D

We have nobody Gdim → we have Eb/G — which is G, Bb, Db — same as Gdim

Let’s try this theory:

What if the key is **Db major**?

Db major scale: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C

Now, what chords do we have?

- **Gdim** — G is not in Db major scale → G is major 6th? Db to G is 8 semitones — sharp 6? Not diatonic.

So Ab minor, F minor — header

Wait — let’s try **F minor**?

F minor scale: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

Now:

- Gdim = G Bb Db — G is ♯2, Bb is ♭3? In F minor, Bb is ♭3, Db is ♭6, G is ♯2 — possible

- Eb/G — Eb not in F minor? Eb is ♭7 — F minor has Eb? Yes, F minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb → yes, Eb is ♭7

But Eb/G is G Bb Db — same as Gdim

- Bbm/F — Bb minor chord: Bb Db F — F is bass → in F minor, Bb minor would be iv? F minor has Bb and Db — yes. So Bb minor is **iv chord** in F minor? Yes — F minor harmony: i - iv - V - etc.

Actually: F minor scale:

- i: Fm → F Ab C  
- ii°: Gdim → G Bb D? But we have = G Bb Db — **Db is ♭6**, not D (♮6)

Standard F harmonic minor: F G Ab Bb C Db E → so vii° = E G Bb → Edim

But our Gdim = G Bb Db → Db is ♭6 — in harmonic minor it's ♯7 (E), not Db.

F melodic minor descending: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb — so Db is ♭6, Eb is ♭7.

So **F melodic minor descending** has: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

Now, Gdim = G Bb Db — in this scale: G is ♯2, Bb is ♭3, Db is ♭6 — all present.

Bbm/F = Bb minor = Bb Db F — F is bass → Bb is ♭6, Db is ♭5? Wait, in F melodic minor, Bb minor: pitches Bb, Db, F — yes — Bb is ♭6, Db is ♭5, F is tonic.

So Bb minor is **●iiv** or **●iv** — but scale degree: F=1, G=2, Ab=3, Bb=4, C=5, Db=6, Eb=7

So Bb = 4 → **iv chord**: Bb minor (iv)

Ab/G = Ab major? But Ab is ♭3 — Ab major = Ab C Eb — we have Ab/G = G Ab C — G is 2, Ab is ♭3, C is 5 — so chord: 2 - ♭3 - 5 — that's **not a standard triad**.

But if we think of **Ab major** triad with **G bass**, then we're playing **Ab/C** but with G — it’s a **suspension** — perhaps **Abmaj7 or sus4 with added 9th?**

But notes are G, Ab, C → G is ♭2 of Ab? So it’s a **m2 clash**.

This is odd.

But finally we get **Dbmaj7/F**

In F minor — Db is ♭6, F is tonic.

Dbmaj7 = Db F A C

In F minor scale: we have Db, but not A — A is not in F/melodic minor (F G Ab Bb C Db Eb — no A)

A is **major 3rd** — but F minor has Ab (♭3), not A.

So **A** is an **accidental** — borrowed from major.

Dbmaj7 = Db F A C — A is the **major 3rd**, which is from **F major** — this suggests a **mode mixture** — borrowing from F **major**.

F major: F G A Bb C D E — so Db (♭6) is not in F major.

So we're in a **hybrid**.

---

### Best Interpretation: **F minor** with modal mixture

We are in **F minor**, but borrowing chords from **F major** and **F melodic minor**.

Check frequencies:

- Gdim appears 8x — Gdim is the **ii°** chord in F minor? In natural minor, ii° is G° = G Bb D — but we have G **Bb Db**, so the 5th is Flattened — **G fully diminished = G Bb Db** — this is the **vii°7 of F harmonic minor**, but F harmonic minor has E natural, not Db.

Actually — G Bb Db is **triad based on G**, with ♭3, ♭5 — this is the **half-diminished chord on the 2nd degree** only if the 5th is D (natural) — here it's Db.

So perhaps **Gdim** is acting as a **chromatic passing chord**

But let’s look at the **final cadence**:

Last two chords: **Dbmaj7/F → Gdim**

That sounds like:  
Dbmaj7/F = F - Ab - C - Db (but spelled as Db, F, A, C) → so we hear F, A, C, Db → waits, A natural!

Final chord: Gdim — G Bb Db

So we go from Dbmaj7/F (which includes **A natural**) to Gdim (G Bb Db)

Key change? Or temporary borrowed chord?

But the most plausible key is:

> ### **F minor (F Aeolian)**  
> with borrowings from **F melodic minor** and **F major**, especially the **Dbmaj7/F** implying a deceptively borrowed major mode.

But we have an **A natural** in Dbmaj7/F — that’s the **major 3rd of F major**? No — F major has A natural as major 3rd, yes.

Dbmaj7/F = F A C Db — that’s a **F7(b13)** chord!

F7 = F A C Eb  
We have F A C Db → Db = ♭13th → same as ♭6th → so **F7(b13)**

That’s a standard extension in jazz — F7 with flattened 13th.

But why? And it resolves to Gdim.

F7(b13) → Gdim is a **tritone substitution relationship**?

Tritone: F to B — not G.

G is **half step above F** — so **F7 → Gdim** is a **half-step resolution down** — a chromatic cadence.

This suggests **F minor** — with a **downward chromatic bass line**:

Look at the **bass notes**:

Chord: Bass note

1. Gdim → G  
2. Gdim → G  
3. Eb/G → G  
4. Eb/G → G  
5. Gdim → G  
6. Gdim → G  
7. Bbm/F → **F**  
8. Ab/G → **G**  
9. Gdim → G  
10. Gdim → G  
11. Eb/G → G  
12. Eb/G → G  
13. Gdim → G  
14. Gdim → G  
15. Dbmaj7/F → **F**  
16. Gdim → G

So bass notes: G, G, G, G, G, G, **F**, **G**, G, G, G, G, G, G, **F**, G

So we have **two F’s** — on chord 7 and 15 — on **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F**

And the rest are **G**

So the **tonal center** is **G** — the chord **Gdim** is the foundation

BUT — F is a chromatic bass movement — F to G

This suggests **Gdim** is tonic — **but Gdim is not a tonic chord** — it's dissonant and unstable.

Unless the key is **G minor?**

Let’s try: **G minor**

G melodic minor: G A Bb C D E F#  
But we have many Bb, Db, Ab, F, C, etc.

G natural minor: G A Bb C D Eb F

Now, Gdim = G Bb Db → Db is ♭6 — in G minor, the ♭6 is Eb, not Db.

So Gdim is altered — Db instead of Eb.

So it's **G half-diminished**? G Bb D F — we have G Bb Db — so major 3rd?

Wait — Gdim = G ♭3 ♭5 — so fifth is flattened.

This is **not a scale chord** — it’s **chromatic**.

Most likely answer:

---

### ✅ **Final Answer**

> **Key: G minor**  
> **Mode: G harmonic minor with extensive chromaticism and modal mixture**  
>  
> The progression centers on **G diminished** as the tonic harmony — common in jazz and film music for dramatic effect — even though strictly speaking, diminished chords are not tonic.  
>  
> The use of **Bbm/F** (iv chord) and **Dbmaj7/F** (borrowed from F major, acting as a deceptive resolution or tritone sub) suggests **modal mixture** from **F major** and **F melodic minor**.  
>  
> The recurring **Gdim** and the final **Gdim** after **Dbmaj7/F** imply **G as tonal center**, likely in a **G minor** context, with the **Db** serving as a chromatic alteration of Eb (♭6), pushing toward a sense of tonal ambiguity — characteristic of **modal jazz or neo-Romantic harmony**.

Alternatively, more concisely:

> ### **Key: G minor**  
> ### **Mode: Chromatic/hybrid (G harmonic minor + F major following)**  
>  
> Context: The piece uses **Gdim** as a harmonic anchor with frequent descent to **F (bass)** for subdominant color (Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F), creating a **chromatic bass move: G–F**, facilitating modal mixture between G minor & F major — typical of movie scores and modern jazz.

This is **not strictly diatonic**, but revolves around **G** as the center.
