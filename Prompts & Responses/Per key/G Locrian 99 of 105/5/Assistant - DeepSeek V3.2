Let’s break this down step by step.

## 1. List the chords clearly

The progression is:

**Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Eb/G** – **Eb/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Bbm/F** – **Ab/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Eb/G** – **Eb/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Dbmaj7/F** – **Gdim**

---

## 2. Identify chord qualities and possible functions

- **Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ E (fully diminished 7th, symmetric, can be any of Gdim, B♭dim, D♭dim, Edim).
- **Eb/G** = G Eb G B♭ → Eb major triad over G bass. That’s Eb major in 1st inversion.
- **Bbm/F** = F B♭ D → B♭ minor in 1st inversion.
- **Ab/G** = G Ab C Eb → Ab major triad over G bass. This is Ab/G, not a standard diatonic chord in most keys.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F Db F Ab C → Dbmaj7 in 3rd inversion.

---

## 3. Try to find a key from the non-diminished chords

Non-diminished chords: **Eb**, **Bbm**, **Ab**, **Dbmaj7**.

Let’s check possible keys:

- **B♭ minor** (B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭) contains:  
  B♭m, E♭, Ab, D♭maj7? Wait, D♭maj7 in B♭ minor would be D♭ F A♭ C — yes, that’s D♭ major, which is the bVI chord in B♭ minor.  
  So: B♭m, E♭ (IV), Ab (bVII), D♭ (bVI). Yes, all fit B♭ natural minor or B♭ harmonic/melodic minor.

- **E♭ major**? In Eb major: Eb (I), Bbm (vi), Ab (V), but Dbmaj7 is not in Eb major (Db is bVII, but Db major would be Db F Ab — yes, that’s bVII, but Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C — C is not in Eb major scale (C is natural in Eb major? Wait, Eb major scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D — yes, C natural! So Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C — Db and C together? That’s a half-step clash. Actually Db is not in Eb major scale (Db is C#), so no, Dbmaj7 is not in Eb major. So Eb major is out.

## 4. Check B♭ minor more carefully

B♭ natural minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭.

Chords:
- B♭m = B♭ D♭ F
- E♭ = E♭ G B♭
- A♭ = A♭ C E♭
- D♭maj7 = D♭ F A♭ C — all notes in B♭ natural minor.

Yes, all fit perfectly.

## 5. Role of Gdim

Gdim = G B♭ D♭ E = G B♭ C# E. Enharmonically, B♭ = A#; D♭ = C#; E = F♭? No, E is E. Let’s respell for B♭ minor:  
G B♭ D♭ E = G B♭ C# E. In B♭ minor, the notes are: G♭ is in the scale, but G natural is not. So G is raised 7? Actually G natural is in B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ → G natural for harmonic minor. Yes! B♭ harmonic minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ → no, that’s natural minor. Harmonic minor raises A♭ to A natural. So G is still G♭ in harmonic minor. So G natural is not in B♭ harmonic minor either. So Gdim is an altered chord.

But Gdim7 = G B♭ D♭ E = same as B♭dim7 = B♭ D♭ E G, same as D♭dim7 = D♭ E G B♭, same as Edim7 = E G B♭ D♭.  
In B♭ minor, Edim7 is the vii°7 if we use B♭ harmonic minor (B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A natural). Yes! If A is natural, then E dim7 = E G B♭ D♭ — all notes in B♭ harmonic minor. So Gdim7 is just an inversion of E dim7.

So Gdim = E dim7 in 3rd inversion. E dim7 is vii°7 of F (in B♭ minor, the V chord is F major, and vii°7 of F is E dim7). Yes! So Gdim is functioning as vii°7 / V in B♭ minor.

## 6. Check bass movement

Many chords have G in bass: Gdim, Eb/G, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F (F bass), Gdim.  
G pedal point? Possibly.

But functionally: Gdim → Eb (VI) → Gdim → Bbm (i) → Ab/G (bVII with G bass) → Gdim → Eb → Gdim → Dbmaj7 (bVI) → Gdim.

So Gdim is used as a recurring diminished chord, probably always as vii°7 of F (V), but F major itself never appears — it’s a deceptive resolution each time: Gdim goes to Eb (VI) or Bbm (i) or Ab (bVII) or Dbmaj7 (bVI), avoiding the dominant F.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The key is **B♭ minor** (harmonic minor for the dim chord).  
Mode: minor (Aeolian / Harmonic minor mixture).

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{Bb\ minor}
\]
