Let's analyze the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
Gdim â€“ Gdim â€“ Eb/G â€“ Eb/G  
Gdim â€“ Gdim â€“ Bbm/F â€“ Ab/G  
Gdim â€“ Gdim â€“ Eb/G â€“ Eb/G  
Gdim â€“ Gdim â€“ Dbmaj7/F â€“ Gdim

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their tones

Letâ€™s break down each chord:

- **Gdim (G diminished)** = G â€“ Bb â€“ Db  
- **Eb/G** = G â€“ Bb â€“ Eb (first inversion of Eb major)  
- **Bbm/F** = F â€“ Bb â€“ Db (first inversion of Bb minor)  
- **Ab/G** = G â€“ Ab â€“ C (Ab major with G in bass â€” unusual, but possible)  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F â€“ Ab â€“ C â€“ Eb (Db major 7th with F in bass)

---

### Step 2: Note repeating patterns and bass movement

The progression is highly repetitive, starting and ending on **Gdim**, and **Gdim** appears throughout.

Bass line (lowest notes):
- G â€“ G (Gdim)
- G â€“ G (Eb/G)
- G â€“ G (Gdim)
- F (Bbm/F)
- G (Ab/G)
- G â€“ G (Gdim)
- G â€“ G (Eb/G)
- G â€“ G (Gdim)
- F (Dbmaj7/F)
- G (Gdim)

So the bass is mostly **G**, with two exceptions: **F** under Bbm and Dbmaj7.

But notice: both **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F** have **F** in the bass â€” suggesting a momentary shift.

Also observe:
- **Eb/G**, **Bbm/F**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F** â€” all relate to **Eb major** or **Bb minor**.

List of chords in root terms:
- Gdim (Gâ€“Bbâ€“Db)
- Eb/G (Gâ€“Bbâ€“Eb)
- Bbm/F (Fâ€“Bbâ€“Db)
- Ab/G (Gâ€“Abâ€“Câ€“Eb? Wait â€” Ab/G is Ab major over G bass: Gâ€“Abâ€“Câ€“Eb)
- Dbmaj7/F (Fâ€“Abâ€“Câ€“Eb)

Wait â€” **Dbmaj7** is **Dbâ€“Fâ€“Abâ€“C**, so **Dbmaj7/F** is **Fâ€“Abâ€“Câ€“Db** â€” not Eb. So earlier thought was wrong.

**Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, **Db**, not Eb.

So chord tones are: F â€“ Ab â€“ C â€“ Db

Thatâ€™s important.

So:
- **Gdim** = G, Bb, Db
- **Eb/G** = G, Bb, Eb
- **Bbm/F** = F, Bb, Db
- **Ab/G** = G, Ab, C, Eb
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F, Ab, C, Db

Now collect all the pitch classes used:

- G
- Ab (G#)
- A? â€” not present
- Bb
- C
- Db
- D? â€” not present
- Eb
- F

So pitches: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

Now order them: **Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G**

That's the **Ab major scale**:
- Ab (1), Bb (2), C (3), Db (4), Eb (5), F (6), G (7)

Yes! All notes are in **Ab major**.

But wait: we have a **Gdim**, which includes G, Bb, Db â€” all in Ab major.

But Gdim = Gâ€“Bbâ€“Db â€” this is **viio** chord in Ab major.

But also, **Ab/G** is Ab major with G in bass â€” that's a common decoration (e.g., passing chord).

**Eb/G** = Gâ€“Bbâ€“Eb â€” that's a G in the bass, but chord is Eb major â€” Eb/G is the **I6** (first inversion of tonic) in **Eb major**, or **V6** in Ab major.

Hold on.

Letâ€™s consider **Ab major**:

- I: Ab
- ii: Bbm
- iii: Cm
- IV: Db
- V: Eb
- vi: Fm
- viiÂ°: GÂ°

Now look at the chords:

- **Gdim** = **viiÂ° chord** in Ab major âœ…
- **Eb/G** = G in bass, chord is Eb â€” this is **V6** (first inversion of V) in Ab major âœ…
- **Bbm/F** = F in bass, chord is Bbm â€” this is **ii6** in Ab major âœ…
- **Ab/G** = G in bass, chord is Ab â€” this is **I6** in Ab major âœ…
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F in bass, chord is Dbmaj7 â€” that's **IVmaj7** with 3rd in bass â€” IV6 in Ab major âœ…

So **all chords are diatonic to Ab major**!

Letâ€™s reframe:

- Gdim = **viiÂ°**
- Eb/G = **V6**
- Bbm/F = **ii6**
- Ab/G = **I6**
- Dbmaj7/F = **IV6 (or IVmaj7/F)**

So the progression:
Gdim â€“ Gdim â€“ Eb/G â€“ Eb/G  
Gdim â€“ Gdim â€“ Bbm/F â€“ Ab/G  
Gdim â€“ Gdim â€“ Eb/G â€“ Eb/G  
Gdim â€“ Gdim â€“ Dbmaj7/F â€“ Gdim

Is essentially:
viiÂ° â€“ viiÂ° â€“ V6 â€“ V6  
viiÂ° â€“ viiÂ° â€“ ii6 â€“ I6  
viiÂ° â€“ viiÂ° â€“ V6 â€“ V6  
viiÂ° â€“ viiÂ° â€“ IV6 â€“ viiÂ°

This makes strong sense in **Ab major**.

The **Gdim** (viiÂ°) acts as a leading-tone chord pulling toward Ab (tonic). It's used extensively for tension and chromatic bass motion (G in bass moving down to F, then back).

Also note the bass line:
G â€“ G â€“ G â€“ G  
G â€“ G â€“ F â€“ G  
G â€“ G â€“ G â€“ G  
G â€“ G â€“ F â€“ G

The **F** appears only under Bbm and Dbmaj7 â€” both of which are chords with F as third (Bbm = Bbâ€“Dbâ€“F, Dbmaj7 = Dbâ€“Fâ€“Abâ€“C), so F in bass is natural.

Then Ab/G reasserts G in bass.

Finally, Dbmaj7/F â†’ Gdim suggests a IV â€“ viiÂ° motion, which is not a strong cadence, but in modal or chromatic contexts it can work.

But most importantly: **all chords are diatonic to Ab major**.

So what about mode?

Well, if all the chords are from the **Ab major scale (ionian mode)**, and the tonic is **Ab** (reinforced by Ab/G, iiâ€“Vâ€“I-like motion: Bbm â†’ Eb â†’ Ab), then this is most likely in **Ab major (Ionian mode)**.

But is Ab the tonic?

Letâ€™s check:

- The chord **Ab/G** appears â€” though brief, it's the only time the tonic triad (Ab) appears.
- We have **V (Eb)** clearly established with Eb/G.
- We have **ii (Bbm)**, **IV (Db)** â€” all point to Ab as tonic.

But the progression starts and ends on **Gdim**, which is unstable. That might be a red herring â€” itâ€™s using Gdim as a pedal or passing chord, not as tonic.

Also, **Gdim** is symmetrical and often used as a passing chord.

But the harmonic movement from Bbm/F to Ab/G, and earlier Eb/G pulling to Ab, suggests Ab is the tonal center.

Moreover, **Dbmaj7/F** (IVmaj7) is more characteristic of major keys than minor â€” Ab natural minor would have Db **minor**, not major.

Wait! Important point:

- In **Ab minor** (natural minor), the iv chord would be **Dbm**, but here we have **Dbmaj7**, which implies **major IV**, which only occurs in **major keys**, or in harmonic minor contexts, but even then it would be a chromatic chord.

So **Dbmaj7** confirms this is not Ab minor. The IV chord being major confirms **Ab major**.

Also, the **Eb/G** chord is **Eb major**, not minor â€” in Ab minor, V would be **Eb minor**, unless raised (harmonic minor), but then it would have **D natural**, not Db.

But we have **Gdim**, which includes **Db**, not D natural â€” so no leading tone to Ab. In fact, the leading tone in Ab major is **G**, but the chord Gdim is used instead of a full **G major** or **Bdim/G** (as in harmonic minor), which would be needed for a strong cadence.

Still, the presence of **Eb major (V)** and **Db major (IV)** and **Ab major (I)** â€” all major â€” confirms this is in **Ab major**.

So despite starting and ending on Gdim, the harmonic context points to **Ab major** as the key.

### Final Answer:

**Key: Ab major**  
**Mode: Ionian**

Even though Gdim is used pervasively, it functions as the **viiÂ° chord** in Ab major, and all chords are diatonic to Ab major. The presence of major IV (Dbmaj7) and major V (Eb) confirms the key is major.

ðŸŽµ **Conclusion: The key is Ab major, in the Ionian mode.**
