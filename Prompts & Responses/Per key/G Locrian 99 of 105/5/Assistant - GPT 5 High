### Reasoning

**Interpreting chord progression**

I need to interpret the chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

I suspect it might be in Eb minor based on the chords used. I've noted repeated G diminished chords and others like Eb/G and Bbm/F, which indicate inversions with specific bass notes. For instance, Eb/G suggests a first inversion of the Eb major chord, while Ab/G could function as a tritone-type neighbor in a Lydian context.**Analyzing Ab major chord**

I'm realizing that the Ab major triad with a G bass likely represents an Abmaj7 chord but without the C. Given that the Ab major scale includes G as the major seventh, it could also be interpreted as a polychord or even a G7sus4(b9). 

The interval between G and Ab is a minor second, while the notes Ab, C, and Eb suggest a G7(b9, sus4, b13) sound. This gives it a typical V7alt sus character in the key of C minor, and there's a lot of movement around Eb, Db, and Bb minor to consider. The Gdim chord makes me think it's a fully diminished triad too!**Clarifying chord functions**

I realize the diminished triad G-Bb-Db serves as the leading-tone diminished triad to Ab. In the context of Ab major, Gdim is the vii° chord. Now, if we look at Eb/G, I initially thought it might be the tonic, but it's actually the dominant in this key. Eb is the V chord in Ab major, and with G in the bass, Eb/G becomes the V6 chord, putting the leading tone in the bass. That definitely makes sense!**Examining chord functions**

In Ab major, Bbm/F serves as the ii6 chord, since the ii chord is Bb minor. Now, for Ab/G, I see it's the Ab major chord with G in the bass, which is effectively Imaj7 in third inversion without the C. The Abmaj7 chord consists of Ab, C, Eb, and G, and putting G in the bass gives it that third inversion feel. Even though the slash chord doesn't include the C, it still evokes that Imaj7 sound nicely. This creates a smooth bass line moving from Bbm/F to Gdim!**Determining key and mode**

In analyzing the chord sequence, I note that Bbm/F functions as the ii6 in Ab major, while Eb/G acts as the V6. Overall, the progression alternates between G and F, suggesting an Ab major tonal center. The use of Gdim as the leading-tone diminished chord (vii°) helps establish this, primarily resolving to Eb/G. 

Although F natural minor could be a candidate, the presence of Eb/G as the V chord in Ab major emphasizes the key of Ab major (Ionian mode) more clearly, restricting Gdim's function as ii° in that context.**Analyzing key and mode**

In this complex progression, Bbm is ii in Ab major, while Eb major fails the diatonic test for other keys. The presence of G natural indicates we’re likely in Ab major, as Gdim fits the leading tone role (vii°). However, despite Gdim's presence, the Eb/G chord emphasizes Ab major's dominant (V6). The inclusion of Dbmaj7 requires C natural, further pointing to Ab major. 

Thus, the key is Ab major with the Ionian mode, given that all chords revolve around it. While Gdim and Eb/G appear frequently, overall functionality supports an Ab major interpretation.**Determining key and mode**

The user is asking to determine the key and mode based on the diatonic chords provided. While Gdim appears frequently, indicating a possible G Locrian center, typical functional tonality revolves around Eb (the dominant) resolving to Ab (the tonic). Analyzing the notes reveals they align with the Ab major scale, meaning the key is likely Ab major (Ionian). The functions of the chords support this interpretation. 

Thus, I conclude that the key is Ab major, and the mode is Ionian.

Ab major (Ionian).

All chords are diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6
- Ab/G ≈ Imaj7/7 (incomplete)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7/3

So the parent key is Ab major; mode is Ionian.
