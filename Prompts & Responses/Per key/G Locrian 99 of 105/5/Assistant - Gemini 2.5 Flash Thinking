### Reasoning

**Examining Harmonic Context**

I'm now cataloging the chords and their specific qualities, noting Gdim, and Eb/G. I'm taking care to correctly identify each chord's fundamental components before proceeding to the next step.


**Determining Tonal Centers**

I've been analyzing the chord roots and their movements, noting the potential resolutions of the Gdim chord. Now, I am considering Gdim's function, particularly as a leading-tone chord. I'm focusing on the melodic implications and considering the key of Ab minor.


**Evaluating Chord Functionality**

I'm now determining the harmonic function of each chord within the potential tonal context. The Gdim's role as a leading tone chord is further solidified by its frequent appearance. I'm starting to analyze the dominant function of the Eb/G and examining how it supports the Ab minor key center.


**Considering Possible Resolutions**

I'm now focusing on how the chords resolve, particularly the leading-tone pull of the Gdim. I am analyzing the function of Gdim as vii° in Ab minor, and I'm further examining the melodic movement and the resulting harmonic implications. I've re-examined the key signature, to assess the validity of the Gdim and the resulting key signature requirements.


**Determining the Overall Structure**

I'm now going over the implications of Gdim again, and I'm reconsidering Ab minor. The inclusion of Dbmaj7 makes me think I should consider Ab major, too. I've been studying the other chords and their commonality with Ab minor or major. I'm focusing on why Gdim is fully diminished.


**Concluding the Analysis**

I've reached a final conclusion. The harmonic analysis points strongly to Ab major. The Gdim, while seeming at first to suggest Ab minor, is instead a borrowed chord, creating chromatic tension. My focus now is on explaining the borrowed harmony.




The analysis of this chord progression strongly points to $\text{Ab}$ being the tonic center. The use of certain chords, especially the diminished chord, defines the specific mode.

### Chord Analysis and Function (in relation to $\text{Ab}$)

| Chord | Notes | Typical Function in $\text{Ab}$ | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\text{Gdim}$ | G - Bb - Db | $\text{vii}^\circ$ | This is the fully diminished chord built on the leading tone (G). It resolves strongly to $\text{Ab}$. |
| $\text{Eb/G}$ | G - Bb - Eb | $\text{V}$ (Dominant) | $\text{Eb}$ Major is the dominant chord. |
| $\text{Bbm/F}$ | F - Ab - Bb - Db (implied) | $\text{ii}$ (Supertonic) | A common predominant chord in $\text{Ab}$ Major. |
| $\text{Dbmaj7/F}$ | F - Ab - C - Db | $\text{IV}$ (Subdominant) | A common predominant chord in $\text{Ab}$ Major. |

### Determining the Key and Mode

1.  **Tonic Center:** The functional harmony centers around $\text{Ab}$ (the chords resolve to it, and $\text{Eb}$ is the dominant).
2.  **Mode Contenders (Major vs. Minor):**
    *   The presence of $\text{Dbmaj7}$ (Db-F-Ab-**C**) and $\text{Bbm}$ (Bb-Db-F) confirms the use of **Db natural, F natural, and Bb natural**. The $\text{C}$ natural in $\text{Dbmaj7}$ is the crucial deciding factor away from $\text{Ab}$ natural minor (which uses $\text{Cb}$). This strongly indicates the key is $\text{Ab}$ Major, where $\text{Bbm}$ is the $\text{ii}$ and $\text{Dbmaj7}$ is the $\text{IV}$.
    *   In $\text{Ab}$ Major, the diatonic leading tone chord should be $\text{G}$ half-diminished ($\text{G}^ø$: G-Bb-Db-F).
3.  **The Role of Gdim:** The progression uses the fully diminished triad $\text{Gdim}$ (G-Bb-Db). This chord is characteristic of the **Harmonic Minor** scale.
    *   The $\text{Gdim}$ chord is borrowed from $\text{Ab}$ Harmonic Minor (G is the raised 7th scale degree, creating $\text{vii}^\circ$).

### Conclusion

The overall framework $(\text{ii} \rightarrow \text{V} \rightarrow \text{IV} \rightarrow \text{I} \text{ [implied])$ functions primarily within **$\text{Ab}$ Major**. The substitution of the diatonic $\text{vii}^\varnothing$ chord with the fully diminished $\text{vii}^\circ$ provides an intensified dominant function.

**Key and Mode:** **$\text{Ab}$ Major**, utilizing **Borrowed Harmony** ($\text{vii}^\circ$ from $\text{Ab}$ Harmonic Minor).
