### Reasoning

**Analyzing musical key and modes**

I'm looking into the key and modes, noting the Ionian (major) mode, possibly in Ab major. I want to check if any accidentals appear in Ab major. Some chords, like Gdim, Eb/G, and Bbm/F, are diatonic. The bass note G acts as a leading tone, maintaining diatonic integrity. I also see that Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F fit within the key but Gdim reappears. I'm considering the relative mode of F minor too, as it includes diminished chords.**Exploring F natural minor chords**

In F natural minor, I see that the ii° chord is indeed a G fully diminished triad, comprised of G–B♭–D♭. The Eb major chord serves as the VII in this key, which is diatonic in the Aeolian mode. Eb/G appears as the first inversion. I recognize that Ab/G serves as bIII over the leading tone and is diatonically fitting. Dbmaj7/F is VImaj7, while Gdim functions as ii°. But Gdim seems to lead more towards Ab instead of F, so I want to explore the functional motion here.**Examining chord progressions in Ab major**

In Ab major, the Eb chord serves as the V, and I realize that toggling between vii° and V is a common way to prolong the dominant. Here, they share tones: V (Eb-G-Bb) and vii° (G-Bb-Db) have G and Bb in common, which leads to an interesting alternation of Gdim and Eb/G. The progression flows through Bbm/F, Ab/G, and returns to the dominant area, culminating in Dbmaj7/F and Gdim. The last Gdim might not resolve, suggesting the music could continue. In F minor, Eb/G serves as VII6, interacting with ii°, which might indicate a subdominant area.**Assessing chord functions in F minor and Eb major**

I see that G and Bb are shared between the keys, similar to previous observations. In F minor, this may create a mixture between the subdominant ii° and flat VII, but that’s not typical toggling. The dominant chord, C or C7, is nowhere in sight. Given that Eb and Gdim show up instead, which don't typically indicate standard dominant prolongation, it feels more aligned with Ab major. I also wonder if this could fit in Eb major, but Gdim wouldn't be diatonic there either, making that key unlikely.**Determining key and mode**

It looks like the key is A♭ major, specifically in the Ionian mode. The prominent bass note G acts as the leading tone to A♭. The chord structure supports this conclusion: V6 (Eb/G), vii° (Gdim), IV6 (Dbmaj7/F), and ii6/4 (Bbm/F), alongside the neighboring I/G. Since the user wants to determine the key and mode, I should keep it concise, stating that it's A♭ major. I could briefly mention its relationship to F natural minor, but I should prioritize clarity with the key being established.

A♭ major (Ionian).

Reason: Gdim is the diatonic leading‑tone triad (vii°) in A♭ major, Eb/G is V6, B♭m/F is ii6/4, A♭/G is I over 7, and D♭maj7/F is IV6. The frequent alternation between Gdim and Eb/G is a typical vii°–V dominant prolongation in A♭ major.
