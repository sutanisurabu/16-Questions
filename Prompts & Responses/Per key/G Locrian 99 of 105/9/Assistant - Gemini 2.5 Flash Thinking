### Reasoning

**Analyzing the Progression's Core**

I'm currently focused on the diminished chords within this progression. It's becoming clear that the $G^{\circ}$ keeps recurring, which is interesting. Considering how the bass note changes with the $Eb/G$ is also shaping my understanding. Now I am trying to figure out where to go from here.


**Exploring Harmonic Functionality**

I'm now investigating the potential harmonic functions. The initial $G^{\circ}$ chords point toward a possible chromatic approach. I'm noting the movement between $G^{\circ}$ and the various bass notes in the $Eb/G$ and the $Bbm/F$ chords. I believe I am getting closer to figuring out the underlying principles.


**Deconstructing Key Signatures**

Now, I'm trying to definitively categorize the key signatures. The dominance of $Eb$ and $Bbm$ is interesting, and the $G^{\circ}$ keeps recurring. Considering how $G^{\circ}$ might function as a chromatic passing chord helps me formulate this concept. I need to figure out its relationship within $Eb$ major.


**Re-evaluating the Framework**

I am now weighing the potential key centers more carefully. The $G^{\circ}$ keeps defying easy categorization. I'm leaning towards the idea that the diminished chord and the subsequent ones aren't straightforwardly functional, especially given the constant movement towards $Eb$. The Dbmaj7 is now making me rethink everything.


**Revising Key Center Theories**

I'm now back to the key center, but with a new perspective. After several passes, it is now seeming much more appropriate to consider the role of $G$ as a central tone. The constant return to the $Eb$ chords does not automatically suggest it's the tonic. I'm exploring the $G$ with the $G^{\circ}$ chords.


**Refining Key Determinations**

The Locrian scale's emergence is changing everything. My focus is now on how $G$ functions as the root within that Locrian framework. I am weighing the implication of a $G$ Locrian center, and the implications of it for a jazz-influenced piece. The next step is a deep dive into the implications of this.


**Re-examining Locrian's Significance**

I'm now integrating the modal context of $G$ Locrian. Understanding the chord functions within this mode is key. Identifying the roles of $Eb$, $Dbmaj7$, and $Bbm$ is proving helpful in forming a comprehensive understanding. The overall plan is now evolving, and I need to solidify the tonal center.


**Synthesizing Modal Evidence**

I'm now integrating the modal evidence. The $G$ Locrian mode feels right, but understanding chord functions within this mode is the next challenge. Specifically, I'm examining how each chord relates to the tonic and how it adds to the overall harmonic texture. My focus is on $G^{\circ}$ and its role.




The chords provided are:

$G^{\circ}$, $G^{\circ}$, $Eb/G$, $Eb/G$,
$G^{\circ}$, $G^{\circ}$, $Bbm/F$, $Ab/G$,
$G^{\circ}$, $G^{\circ}}$, $Eb/G$, $Eb/G$,
$G^{\circ}$, $G^{\circ}}$, $Dbmaj7/F$, $G^{\circ}$

### 1. Identifying the Key Center

The chord that dominates the entire progression is $G^{\circ}$ (G diminished triad: G, Bb, Db). It appears thirteen times and usually begins and ends phrases, making **G** the clear tonal center (tonic).

### 2. Deriving the Scale/Mode

To determine the mode, we compile all unique notes present in the chords:

*   $G^{\circ}$: G, Bb, Db
*   $Eb/G$: Eb, G, Bb (already present)
*   $Bbm/F$: F, Bb, Db (already present)
*   $Ab/G$: Ab, C, Eb (already present)
*   $Dbmaj7/F$: Db, F, Ab, C (all notes already present)

The collected pitch set is: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**.

### 3. Analyzing the Scale

We compare the derived scale to the major scale formula (1 2 3 4 5 6 7) by treating G as the root (1):

| Interval | Note in G | Major Scale | Deviation |
| :------: | :-------: | :---------: | :-------: |
| Root (1) | G | G | |
| b2 | Ab | A | b2 |
| b3 | Bb | B | b3 |
| 4 | C | C | |
| b5 | Db | D | b5 |
| b6 | Eb | E | b6 |
| b7 | F | F | b7 |

The mode sequence **1, b2, b3, 4, b5, b6, b7** is the definition of the **Locrian mode**.

### 4. Chord Function in G Locrian

The tonic triad of the G Locrian mode is $G^{\circ}$ (G diminished), which perfectly matches the dominant chord in the progression.

*   $G^{\circ}$ is the tonic ($i^{\circ}$).
*   $Eb$ Major ($Eb-G-Bb$) is the $\text{bVI}$ chord.
*   $Bbm$ ($Bb-Db-F$) is the $\text{bIII}$ minor chord.
*   $Ab$ ($Ab-C-Eb$) is the $\text{bII}$ major chord (Neapolitan).

All chords are diatonic to the $G$ Locrian scale (which is the seventh mode of $Ab$ Major).

### Conclusion

The Key is **G** and the Mode is **Locrian**.
