Let’s analyze your chord progression step by step:

**Progression:**
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F  Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

### Step 1: Identify common tones and bass movement
- The **bass** often plays **G** throughout, especially in Gdim, Eb/G, and Ab/G.  
- That suggests a **pedal G**—a sustained or repeated bass tone under changing harmonies.

---

### Step 2: Examine the chords in terms of pitch content
- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db  
- **Eb/G** = G–Bb–Eb  
- **Bbm/F** = Bb–Db–F  
- **Ab/G** = G–Ab–C–Eb  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C

Common tones:  
  - **Gdim (G–Bb–Db)** and **Eb/G (G–Bb–Eb)** share **G** and **Bb**.  
  - Movement between these feels like a half‑step shift of **Db ↔ Eb**.
  - **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F** both come from the **Db major** region.  
  - **Ab** and **Eb** chords also fit into a **Db major / Eb minor** color space.

---

### Step 3: Collection of pitches used overall
From all chords we have:  
**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

That’s a 7‑note collection, which can be ordered as:

> **Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C**

This is the **Db major scale** (enharmonically the same as **C# major**).

---

### Step 4: Relation of Gdim to Db major
In **Db major**, the diminished chord built on the leading tone is **Cdim (C–Eb–Gb)**—not Gdim.  
However, Gdim (G–Bb–Db) fits as **vii° of Ab minor**, which is the **ii chord in Eb minor**, **vi chord in Gb major**, or **V degree’s leading-tone chord in Ab minor**.

---

### Step 5: Functional feel
- The frequent **Eb/G → Gdim** alternation creates tension and release around **G** in the bass.  
- The use of **Eb**, **Ab**, **Db**, **Bb** points strongly toward the **Db major / Bbm** tonal area.  
- The diminished passing chords emphasize the pull toward **Db major** or its relative **Bb minor**.

---

✅ **Conclusion**

The collection points to **Db major** (or its relative **Bb minor**) as the key center.

Given the prevalence of **dark/diminished** colors and the way **Gdim** (G–Bb–Db) serves as a leading-tone chord to **Ab**, the progression feels **Bb minor–ish** rather than bright major.

---

**Final answer:**
> **Key:** B♭ minor  
> **Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor)

**Supporting reasoning:**  
- Shared note collection = Db major / Bb natural minor.  
- Functional resolution targets chords (Db, Ab, Eb) from that family.  
- Gdim functions as vii° of Ab (the V in Bb minor).
