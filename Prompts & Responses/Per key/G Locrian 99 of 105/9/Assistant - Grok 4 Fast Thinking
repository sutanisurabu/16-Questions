### Analysis of Chord Progression
The given progression is:  
**Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Dbmaj7/F - Gdim**

This is a repetitive, jazz-influenced sequence with diminished chords (Gdim) acting as tension builders, leading tones, or passing harmony, and inverted chords (e.g., Eb/G, Ab/G) providing bass movement. I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step.

#### Step 1: Chord Breakdown and Notes
Assuming standard triad interpretations unless specified (e.g., Gdim as G-Bb-Db triad; maj7 as fully voiced with 7th), here's the harmony and all unique notes involved:

- **Gdim**: G - Bb - Db (diminished triad, vii° in Ab major)
- **Eb/G** (Eb major triad in 1st inversion): Bass G; notes G - Eb - G - Bb → Eb - G - Bb
- **Bbm/F** (Bb minor triad in 2nd inversion): Bass F; notes F - Bb - Db
- **Ab/G** (Ab major triad in 1st inversion): Bass G; notes G - Ab - C - Eb → Ab - C - Eb - G
- **Dbmaj7/F** (Db major 7th chord in 3rd inversion): Bass F; notes F - Db - F - Ab - C → Db - F - Ab - C

**All notes in the progression**: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb  
No other pitches (e.g., no D natural, B natural, etc.) are implied. This is a tight set—no chromaticism outside a single scale.

#### Step 2: Scale/Key Fit
These notes exactly match the **Ab major scale** (Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G):  
- Every chord uses only diatonic pitches from Ab major.  
- No accidentals or borrowings are needed; it's fully diatonic.  

Testing other likely keys shows mismatches:  
- **Eb major** (Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D): Db (from Gdim, Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F) is foreign (would be ♭7 or altered).  
- **C minor** (C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb): Db replaces D natural, creating inconsistency (Db appears repeatedly without resolution to D).  
- **F minor** (F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb): Fits notes but not the root movement/chord functions (e.g., Gdim wouldn't lead naturally).  
- Other modes (e.g., Ab Dorian: Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G—wait, identical to Ab major? No, Dorian has Bb minor, but notes align; however, chord qualities point to major).

Ab major fits perfectly without forcing interpretations.

#### Step 3: Functional Harmony and Confirmation
In **Ab major**:  
- **Gdim** (vii°): Leading-tone diminished chord, resolves to Ab (i) or acts as a pivot (common in jazz for tension).  
- **Eb/G** (V6): Dominant in 1st inversion; bass G creates stepwise motion to Ab.  
- **Bbm/F** (ii6): Supertonic minor in 2nd inversion; bass F (VI) adds color, like a passing or modal mixture hint, but still diatonic.  
- **Ab/G** (i6/4): Tonic in 2nd inversion; bass G links back to Gdim.  
- **Dbmaj7/F** (III7, 3rd inversion): Mediants (III) are common in jazz standards for color; fully diatonic (Db - F - Ab - C), bass F smooths to resolution.  

The progression circles around the tonic (Ab) via dominant (Eb) and subdominant (Db/Bb) areas:  
- Repetitive Gdim → Eb/G feels like vii° → V (preparing i).  
- Bbm/F → Ab/G is ii → i (bass F → G moves to tonic).  
- Ends on Dbmaj7/F → Gdim (III7 → vii°), implying return to i (Ab) or looping back.  

This has a jazz ballad or standard feel (e.g., reminiscent of tunes like "Misty" or "Autumn Leaves" in similar keys, but exact match not needed for analysis). No modal mixture (e.g., no ♭III or ♭VI); it's straightforward.

#### Conclusion: Key and Mode
- **Key**: Ab major  
- **Mode**: Ionian (major scale—no alterations like Phrygian ♭2 or Mixolydian ♭7; pure major tonality).  

If this is from a specific song (e.g., a jazz chart), it might have contextual modulations, but based solely on the chords, Ab major is the clear center. If you provide more context (e.g., melody or full tune), I can refine this!
