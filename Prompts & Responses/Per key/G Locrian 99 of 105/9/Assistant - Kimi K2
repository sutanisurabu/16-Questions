**Assistant - Kimi K2**

This progression is built around G diminished and its sliding inversions (*Eb/G = first inversion of a G-diminished triad*, *Ab/G = first inversion of a G-diminished triad*), with a single “cadence” chord:  

Dbmaj7/F.

Db7 is the **tritone substitute of G7**, and in the key of C it resolves to C (I). That makes the whole sequence a **long embellished dominant preparation in C**, and the final sonority  

Dbmaj7/F ‑> (implied C)  

is the classic tritone-sub resolution.

Only one other chord appears: a **Bbm triad**.  
In the key of C that is the II chord, exactly the chord that normally precedes the tritone-sub (II – SubV – I). Everything else is just chromatic voice-leading through diminished colours that all function as **extensions/alterations of the dominant**.

Hence the passage is **tonal, not modal**; it is in:

**C major (tonic)**  
with the entire excerpt functioning as an **extended dominant approach** and ending on the tritone-substitute dominant (Db) that resolves to C.

The key signature you would write is **no sharps or flats (C major)**; the accidentals come from the chromatic dominant decoration.
