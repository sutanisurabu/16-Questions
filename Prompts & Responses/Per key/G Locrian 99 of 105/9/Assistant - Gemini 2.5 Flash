The chords provided are:

* **Gdim** (G diminished: G - B♭ - D♭)
* **Eb/G** (First inversion of E♭ major: G - B♭ - E♭)
* **Bbm/F** (First inversion of B♭ minor: F - G# - B♭ - D♭, or simplified F - B♭ - D♭) - *If it's Bbm, the notes are B♭ - D♭ - F. In F inversion, the bass is F.*
* **Ab/G** (Ab major over G: G - A♭ - C - E♭) - *This is a very unusual voicing. Standard Ab/G is G - A♭ - C - E♭.*
* **Dbmaj7/F** (First inversion of D♭ major 7: F - D♭ - F - A♭ - C)

Let's look at the roots and the overall harmonic landscape.

### Harmonic Analysis

The progression is highly cyclical and relies heavily on the **G diminished chord** (Gdim).

| Chord | Function/Context | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gdim | Diminished (often vii° or secondary function) | G - B♭ - D♭ |
| Eb/G | E♭ major (Tonic or relative major) | G - B♭ - E♭ |
| Gdim | Diminished (Repeated emphasis) | G - B♭ - D♭ |
| Bbm/F | B♭ minor | F - B♭ - D♭ |
| Ab/G | A♭ major (Subdominant or related) | G - A♭ - C - E♭ |
| Gdim | Diminished (Core focus) | G - B♭ - D♭ |
| Eb/G | E♭ major | G - B♭ - E♭ |
| Gdim | Diminished | G - B♭ - D♭ |
| Dbmaj7/F | D♭ Major 7 | F - A♭ - C - D♭ |
| Gdim | Diminished | G - B♭ - D♭ |

### Identifying the Key and Mode

1. **Major Chords Present:** E♭ Major, A♭ Major, D♭ Major 7.
2. **Minor Chords Present:** B♭ Minor.
3. **Diminished Chords Present:** G diminished.

These chords strongly align with the key of **E♭ Major**:
* E♭ Major = I
* A♭ Major = IV
* B♭ Minor = vi (B♭ minor substitute for Cm, or borrowed bvi from E♭ minor) - *If we assume **E♭ Natural Minor** (E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭), then B♭m is v.*
* D♭ Major = $\text{bVII}$ (Borrowed from E♭ minor/Phrygian)
* G Diminished = vii° in A♭ harmonic minor, or a $\text{V}^{7}$ substitute in E♭ major if it resolves to Cm.

The most characteristic chords (E♭, A♭, B♭m, D♭maj7) point toward a close relationship with **E♭**.

Let's test the scales related to E♭:

* **E♭ Major:** E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D (The presence of D♭ instead of D natural strongly contradicts E♭ Major as the mode.)
* **E♭ Natural Minor (Aeolian):** E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭
* **E♭ Dorian:** E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, D♭
* **E♭ Phrygian:** E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭

The key notes involved in the chords are: **G, B♭, D♭, E♭, F, A♭, C.** (No G♭ or C♭, but D♭ is prominent).

Based on the evidence:
* **E♭ Major (I):** E♭/G is a strong resting harmony (though inverted).
* **A♭ Major (IV):** Used prominently.
* **D♭ (bVII):** D♭maj7 is the most prominent characteristic non-major key chord.
* **G (Gdim):** The root G serves as the bass of the I chord (E♭/G) and the ubiquitous Gdim chord.

The collection of notes (E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭) corresponds to the **E♭ Dorian** scale, given the prominence of the natural 6th (C) from A♭Maj and C in the structure of Gdim (if Gdim is analyzed as a subset of other chords), and the lowered 7th (D♭).

* **E♭ Dorian Analysis:**
    * **i:** E♭ Minor (E♭, G♭, B♭) - *We see E♭ Major related chords (E♭/G), which means the mode is not purely Aeolian or Dorian.*
    * **ii°:** F diminished (F, A♭, C♭)
    * **bIII:** G♭ Major
    * **IV:** A♭ Major (Present)
    * **v:** B♭ Minor (Present)
    * **vi°:** C diminished (C, E♭, G♭)
    * **bVII:** D♭ Major (Present as D♭maj7)

The presence of the **G natural** in the E♭/G and Gdim chords strongly suggests that we are operating in a mode that contains the Natural 3rd of E♭ (G), which is characteristic of the **E♭ Major** side, not E♭ minor.

However, the other core chords (B♭m, D♭maj7) scream **E♭ Aeolian (Natural Minor)** or **E♭ Dorian**.

**The typical jazz/contemporary key that features I (Major), bVII (Major), and iv/v (minor) is the Key of the Parallel Minor borrowing the Major Tonic.**

* **Focusing on the Tonic and the bVII:** The progression cycles around E♭ (as the harmonic center) and uses the $\text{bVII}$ chord (D♭maj7), a classic indicator of **E♭ Mixolydian** or borrowing from E♭ natural minor.

Let's re-examine the core tension: **G natural** versus **D♭ natural**.

The key signature is dominated by the flat side of the circle (E♭, A♭, D♭, B♭).

**Conclusion based on Harmonic Center and Characteristic Chords:**

The key center is clearly **E♭**. The overall collection of dominant chords (E♭, A♭) and the powerful use of D♭maj7 ($\text{bVII}$) and B♭m $(\text{v})$ indicates a dark, mixed-mode harmony.

The presence of the G natural means the key signature is not strictly E♭ Aeolian. It is closest to **E♭ Dorian** if we interpret Gdim as a substitute, or more likely **E♭ Mixed Mode**.

In common music theory terms, when a section strongly establishes the major tonic (E♭) but draws heavily from its parallel minor (D♭, B♭m), we determine the key by the tonic and the overall mood by the mode.

Thus, the **Key is E♭**.

The **Mode** is highly suggestive of **Dorian** or **Aeolian borrows**, but because the G is natural (the Major 3rd of E♭) in the harmony:

* **This progression is rooted in E♭ Major, but heavily utilizes modal interchange from E♭ Natural Minor (Aeolian).**

The specific combination of $I^{maj}$, $bVII^{maj}$, and $v^{min}$ is too structurally unstable to fit cleanly into a single heptatonic mode, but it is typical of minor modal borrowing used over a major tonic.

### Final Determination:

**Key:** **E♭** (as the clear harmonic center and tonic)
**Mode:** **Mixed Mode** (Primarily E♭ Major with heavy borrowing from **E♭ Aeolian** (bVII, v/Bbm) and the pervasive use of Gdim as a highly chromatic color.)

*If forced to choose a simple mode that contains the strongest elements (E♭, A♭, B♭m, D♭), **E♭ Dorian** is the closest fit, even though G natural contradicts D♭ natural in that structure. However, the use of E♭ major chords in the progression (E♭/G) means we must define this as a major-key center borrowing minor harmony.*
