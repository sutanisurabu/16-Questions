### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm working on determining the key and mode from the given chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." It seems like there are several G diminished chords. The notation shows Eb major triad with G in bass, and Bbm/F is a B-flat minor over F. Given these, I wonder if this could be in G major or related to the key of Ab major since Gdim functions there as a leading tone diminished chord.**Clarifying chord structure**

I realize that G diminished triad consists of G-Bb-Db, which fits within Ab major since the scale includes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, and G. The vii째 chord forms G째 (G-Bb-Db) which is correct. Then, Eb/G represents the V chord in first inversion with G in the bass, which also fits Ab major. I verify that G natural is indeed in Ab major as the seventh degree. So, the progression from Gdim to Eb/G really toggles with G in the bass.**Analyzing Ab/G chord**

The Ab/G chord consists of Ab-C-Eb over G, creating a non-tertian structure that suggests an Ab major triad with a G bass, which might represent a G7sus4(b9#11). So, with G in the bass and Ab-C-Eb on top, the notes could be viewed as G7sus4 with those intervals: Ab as b9, C as 11, and Eb as b13. However, without D or F, it becomes a quartal cluster. In the Ab major context, this structure seems to lead into Ab major, but then it cycles back to Gdim after the Bbm/F to Ab/G sequence. Bbm/F serves as the ii chord in first inversion, fitting nicely in Ab major.**Examining Dbmaj7/F chord**

The Dbmaj7/F chord is significant in Ab major because Db serves as the IV chord, and the major seventh over F bass makes it a IVmaj7/3 in first inversion. All the notes fit within the Ab major scale. I also consider the possibility of it relating to F natural minor, where Bbm would be the iv chord. The diatonic sets for both keys are identical, emphasizing Eb and Ab as V and I in Ab major. The recurring Gdim acts as the leading-tone triad to Ab, making the Eb/G chord a common passing tone with G in the bass.**Determining key and mode**

My analysis suggests a tonal center around Ab major or potentially F natural minor. The Gdim chord functions as ii째 in F minor, while various triads align with both keys. The recurring G bass and Gdim chords hint at G Locrian, but G isn't a strong tonal center. The modal vamp primarily toggles between Gdim and Eb/G, creating instability around G. Ultimately, the pitches mirror the Ab major scale, implying Ab major (Ionian) to be the most suitable key based on the given chords.**Determining key and mode**

The tonal center here suggests Ab major due to the frequent use of the Gdim and Eb/G chords, which typically resolve to Ab. The only major triads present are Eb and Ab. Considering the consistent appearance of Gdim as a leading-tone triad, I conclude that the key is Ab major, mode Ionian. All chords align with the Ab major scale, with functional roles throughout the progression supporting this analysis. So, I would succinctly state: Ab major (Ionian), with pitch collection matching that of both Ab major and F natural minor.

Ab major (Ionian). All chords are diatonic to Ab major (same pitch set as F natural minor): Gdim (vii째), Eb/G (V6), Bbm/F (ii6), Ab/G (I over 7), Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7/3).
