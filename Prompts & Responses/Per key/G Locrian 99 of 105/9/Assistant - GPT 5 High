### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord variations**

I'm figuring out the minor third interval with notes like G to Bb, then Bb to Db, and why E can be represented as Fb. The G diminished triad consists of G, Bb, and Db, but sometimes E is included as a diminished seventh note. I notice that Eb/G, a first inversion major triad, shares notes with G dim. The G7sus(b9,b13) chord creates a unique sound with these notes. It's interesting how these notes interact!**Exploring chord functions**

I'm looking at Bbm/F, which is Bb minor over an F bass note. It might act as V/iv in either Eb minor or Ab major. Then there's the Ab/G chord, with a step from F to G. The tonal center seems to be Eb since Eb/G shows it as a tonic in first inversion. Gdim acts as the vii° chord in Ab minor. It’s fascinating how the leading-tone chords shift between keys, like G diminished in Ab major and D diminished in Eb major.**Analyzing Gdim and chord functions**

I’m exploring Gdim, which consists of G, Bb, and Db. In Eb major, the ii chord is Fm and the iii is Gm, while Gdim isn’t diatonic; it serves as the vii°/Ab. Gdim acts as a leading-tone chord to Ab, making it a secondary leading-tone to IV. Then there's Ab/G, which can represent voice-leading to Ab. Bbm over F bass in Eb major may act as a borrowed subdominant minor. This pattern shows some interesting bluesy progressions!**Exploring chord relationships**

In Eb major, Db is the flat VII chord, which is a common borrowed chord from Mixolydian. The Dbmaj7 chord with F in the bass might suggest some voice-leading. This implies the presence of a borrowed bVII chord in Eb, which could be a bVIImaj7. Alternatively, looking at the key of Ab, Eb/G acts as a V/6 chord. I see Gdim is the vii° of Ab, and Bbm/F functions as ii of Ab in first inversion. Very interesting connections here!**Examining chord relationships and context**

In this analysis, G serves as a leading tone to Ab, making Ab/G an interesting I chord over a leading tone bass. Interestingly, Gdim usually resolves to Ab, but this time it leads to other chords. The symmetry in the sequence, with repeated chords, suggests a gravitational center around Ab, even when Ab isn’t explicitly stated. The progression uses various diatonic chords, oscillating between G and F in the bass, indicating a modal context. 

Ultimately, it seems like the key is Ab major, integrating various elements while prominently featuring the leading-tone diminished triad!**Analyzing tonal centers and modes**

The progression feels centered around Ab, yet we rarely land on a plain Ab chord in root position. Gdim serves as a vii° leading to I (Ab), but it often transitions to Ab/G instead. I gather that the key center is likely Ab major with an Ionian mode. Yet, considering Eb Mixolydian is an option too, since both share similar pitch collections. It appears that Gdim could function as iii° in Mixolydian, while the presence of minor v and bVII strengthens that interpretation.

Ultimately, it seems both Eb Mixolydian and Ab major could work contextually, but the structure leans toward a Mixolydian vibe with Gdim and Bbm.**Determining key and mode**

I don't see an Ab or Eb root in the bass, but there's mention of Eb in the chord names. Moving from Gdim to Eb/G suggests that G could be a third for Eb; however, interpreting G as a leading tone isn't quite right in this context. It seems more appropriate to lean towards Eb Mixolydian, given the presence of Bbm and Dbmaj7. All the chords align with an Eb-centered sound. 

So, the final answer is:  
Key center: Eb  
Mode: Mixolydian (Eb Mixolydian)  
Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major; functions in Eb Mixolydian.

Eb Mixolydian (Eb as tonal center, using the Ab major pitch collection: Eb F G Ab Bb C Db)

Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major, but they function around Eb as tonic: Eb/G (I6), Gdim (iii°), Bbm/F (v), Ab/G (IV), Dbmaj7/F (bVIImaj7). This is the characteristic Mixolydian palette (bVII and minor v).
