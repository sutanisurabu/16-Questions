### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Progression**

\n\n

I've begun to break down the provided chord progression, starting with isolating each chord symbol. Next, I plan to identify the key(s) involved to get a sense of the harmonic context. I anticipate some key changes here, and the initial analysis suggests a potentially modal or ambiguous tonal center.


**Unpacking the Components**

\n\n

My current focus is on deconstructing each chord and its function. Examining each chord's component notes is revealing crucial harmonic relationships. Specifically, I'm noting the frequency of the Gdim, and the implications of the bass notes within the inversions. The Circle of Fifths pattern is indeed emerging, pointing to a potential key.


**Exploring Key Candidates**

\n\n

My current thinking centers on the likely key of Eb Major. While the presence of Bbm raises a flag, it appears borrowed from the parallel minor. The analysis strongly supports Eb Major as the primary key, with the Gdim chords functioning as passing chords or altered dominants. Further scrutiny of the chord functions will either cement this or push me to revise.


**Refining Key Context**

\n\n

My current thinking leans towards confirming Eb major, while considering the possibility of a modal shift to Eb Dorian in certain sections due to the borrowed chords. The role of Gdim remains intriguing, its non-diatonic nature emphasizing a complex harmonic landscape. The analysis of the inversions is helping me to understand the bass line motion.


**Evaluating Harmonic Functions**

\n\n

My current thinking circles back to refining the harmonic roles. The Gdim chords, now understood as `vii°/IV`, are crucial for harmonic color. I am now looking at the passing chords to assess how they contribute to the melody, and I'm further examining the specific bass note movements within the inversions, which will help determine the voice leading.


**Refining the Key Analysis**

\n\n

My current thinking centers on the use of secondary dominants, particularly the Gdim chords, and how they pull towards the IV chord, Ab. This makes Eb Major the clear tonal center. Considering the Gdim's function as a secondary dominant of the IV chord, I will now analyze the melody's alignment with the bass line for voice leading.


**Finalizing the Tonal Center**

\n\n

My current thinking confirms Eb major as the primary key, with clear harmonic functions. I've pinpointed the `vii°/IV` function of `Gdim`. I'm focusing on the bass line to identify voice-leading techniques. Overall, the harmonic analysis is progressing well. I am currently examining the `Gdim` and its use as a secondary dominant.


**Finalizing Harmonic Roles**

\n\n

My current thinking now moves towards considering the overall harmonic structure. With the key and function established, I'll now evaluate the melodic elements. The bassline's descending stepwise motion is a clear feature, and is worth studying to find the voice leading. The overall color is mostly major but with some minor colors as well.


**Evaluating Chord Functions**

\n\n

My current thinking now circles back to analyzing the functions. The Gdim chords, recognized as `vii°/IV`, are integral to the harmonic color, creating tension that resolves to the Ab. Examining the bass movement and the relationship to the melody is my next focus, as well as the passing chords.




Based on a harmonic analysis of the progression, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **Eb Major**
*   **Mode:** **Major with significant modal interchange** (borrowing from the parallel minor key, Eb minor).

### Detailed Analysis

Here is a breakdown of why this is the case, looking at each chord's function within the key of Eb Major:

1.  **The Tonal Center (The "Home" Chord):**
    *   The **Eb/G** chord appears multiple times. This is an **Eb Major** chord in first inversion (I⁶). Its frequent appearance acts as a point of stability and resolution, strongly suggesting Eb is the tonic or "home" key.

2.  **The Non-Diatonic "Color" Chords:**
    The other chords in the progression are not all diatonic to the standard Eb major scale, which is what makes the progression sound so rich and soulful. They are "borrowed" from the parallel Eb minor scale.

3.  **Chord-by-Chord Breakdown (in the key of Eb Major):**

    *   **Gdim (G - Bb - Db):** This is the **vii°/IV** chord. It's the leading-tone diminished chord of Ab. The note G is the leading tone to Ab, and this chord creates strong tension that wants to resolve to the Ab chord (the IV chord in Eb major).

    *   **Eb/G (Eb - G - Bb):** This is the **I⁶** chord (the tonic in first inversion). It establishes the key of Eb Major.

    *   **Bbm/F (Bb - Db - F):** This is the **v⁶** chord (a minor dominant chord in first inversion). In a standard major key, the V chord is major (Bb Major). A Bb minor chord is the v chord from the parallel **Eb minor key**. Borrowing the minor v chord is very common in Gospel, R&B, and Soul music.

    *   **Ab/G (Ab - C - Eb over a G bass):** This is the **IV** chord with the 3rd of the tonic (G) in the bass. This creates a specific kind of pleasant tension, functioning as a pre-dominant chord while maintaining a connection to the tonic harmony via the bass note.

    *   **Dbmaj7/F (Db - F - Ab - C):** This is the **♭VIImaj7** chord in first inversion. The Db Major chord is not in the key of Eb Major. It is the ♭VII chord borrowed from the parallel **Eb minor key** (specifically, Eb Aeolian mode). This is another classic modal interchange chord that adds a soulful, "yearning" quality.

### Summary

The progression is firmly rooted in **Eb Major** by the repeated use of the Eb/G chord. However, it heavily utilizes chords from the parallel minor key (Eb minor) to create harmonic interest and emotional color. This technique, known as **modal interchange** or "borrowing," is a defining characteristic of genres like Gospel, Neo-Soul, and R&B. You are hearing a major key that is "flavored" with chords from its parallel minor counterpart.
