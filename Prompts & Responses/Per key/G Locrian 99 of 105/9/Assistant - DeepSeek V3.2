Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## 1. List the chords clearly

The progression is:

**Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Eb/G** – **Eb/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Bbm/F** – **Ab/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Eb/G** – **Eb/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Dbmaj7/F** – **Gdim**

---

## 2. Identify chord qualities and roots

- **Gdim** = G diminished triad (G B♭ D♭) — could be vii° in some key.
- **Eb/G** = Eb major triad with G in bass (Eb G B♭).
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ minor triad with F in bass (B♭ D♭ F).
- **Ab/G** = A♭ major triad with G in bass (A♭ C E♭) — G is not in the chord, so it’s a slash chord creating tension.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = D♭maj7 (D♭ F A♭ C) with F in bass.

---

## 3. Look for a key

Let’s check possible keys by grouping these chords:

**Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ = could be from A♭ harmonic minor (Gdim = vii° of A♭ minor) or from B harmonic minor (Gdim = ii°? No, that’s G♯dim).  
Also could be from E harmonic minor (Gdim = iii°? No, that’s G♯dim again).  
So Gdim is vii° of A♭ harmonic minor, or could be a common-tone diminished in other keys.

**Eb** = E♭ major = could be IV of B♭ major, or V of A♭ major, or I of E♭ major, etc.

**Bbm** = B♭ minor = i of B♭ minor, or iv of F minor, or vi of D♭ major.

**Ab** = A♭ major = IV of E♭ major, or I of A♭ major, or V of D♭ major.

**Dbmaj7** = D♭ major 7 = I of D♭ major, or IV of A♭ major, or bVI of F minor.

---

## 4. Try to find a consistent key

Let’s test **A♭ major**:

- Gdim = not diatonic to A♭ major (A♭ major scale: A♭ B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G). Gdim has G B♭ D♭ — G natural is in A♭ major, but B♭ and D♭ are in A♭ major, but G B♭ D♭ is G half-diminished (G B♭ D♭ F) if it were m7b5, but here it’s just G B♭ D♭ = G diminished triad = G B♭ D♭ F♭? Wait, D♭ is same as C♯, but in A♭ major, the 7th is G, so G B♭ D♭ = G B♭ C♯? That’s not in A♭ major. So Gdim is not in A♭ major.

So Gdim is a borrowed chord from A♭ minor (harmonic).

---

## 5. Try **A♭ minor** (natural/harmonic)

A♭ natural minor: A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F♭ G♭ — chords:  
i A♭m, ii° B♭dim, III C♭ major (B major), iv D♭m, v E♭m, VI F♭ major (E major), VII G♭ major.

Gdim is not in natural minor.  
A♭ harmonic minor: A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F♭ G (natural) —  
chords: i A♭m(maj7), ii° B♭dim, III+ C♭aug, iv D♭m, V E♭, VI F♭maj7, vii° Gdim.

Yes! Gdim = vii° of A♭ harmonic minor.

So Eb = V of A♭ minor (harmonic).  
Bbm = ? B♭ D♭ F♭ — that’s B♭ diminished in A♭ harmonic minor, not Bbm. So Bbm is not in A♭ harmonic minor. So maybe Bbm is borrowed.

---

## 6. Try **D♭ major**

D♭ major scale: D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭ C  
Chords:  
I D♭, ii E♭m, iii Fm, IV G♭, V A♭, vi B♭m, vii° Cdim.

Our chords:  
Gdim = not in D♭ major.  
Eb = E♭ major? No, in D♭ major, E♭ is minor (E♭ G♭ B♭). So Eb major is not in D♭ major.  
Bbm = B♭ minor? In D♭ major, B♭ is minor (B♭ D♭ F) — yes! B♭m is vi of D♭ major.  
Ab = A♭ major = V of D♭ major — yes.  
Dbmaj7 = I of D♭ major — yes.

So D♭ major fits Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7, but not Gdim or Eb major.

---

## 7. Try **E♭ minor**?  

E♭ natural minor: E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭  
Harmonic minor: E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭ C♭ D  
Chords in E♭ harmonic minor: i E♭m, ii° Fdim, III+ G♭aug, iv A♭m, V B♭, VI C♭, vii° Ddim.

Gdim doesn’t fit.

---

## 8. Try **B♭ minor**

B♭ natural minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭  
Harmonic: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A  
Chords in B♭ harmonic minor: i B♭m, ii° Cdim, III+ D♭aug, iv E♭m, V F, VI G♭, vii° Adim.

Gdim doesn’t fit.

---

## 9. Maybe **Gdim** is a common-tone diminished with G as pedal tone

Bass G appears in Gdim, Eb/G, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F (F bass though), but G is in many chords.  
Gdim could be functioning as a chromatic passing chord.

---

## 10. Look at overall progression

Eb major and Ab major are IV and I in A♭ major, or V and I in D♭ major.  
Bbm is vi in D♭ major.  
Dbmaj7 is I in D♭ major.

So likely **key of D♭ major**, with Gdim as a common-tone diminished (G B♭ D♭ = actually G B♭ D♭ is enharmonic to G B♭ C♯, which is an altered chord, maybe from D♭ minor or just a diminished passing chord).

---

## 11. Mode

D♭ major is **Ionian mode**.

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{Db\ major}
\]
