### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord variations**

I'm figuring out the minor third interval with notes like G to Bb, then Bb to Db, and why E can be represented as Fb. The G diminished triad consists of G, Bb, and Db, but sometimes E is included as a diminished seventh note. I notice that Eb/G, a first inversion major triad, shares notes with G dim. The G7sus(b9,b13) chord creates a unique sound with these notes. It's interesting how these notes interact!**Exploring chord functions**

I'm looking at Bbm/F, which is Bb minor over an F bass note. It might act as V/iv in either Eb minor or Ab major. Then there's the Ab/G chord, with a step from F to G. The tonal center seems to be Eb since Eb/G shows it as a tonic in first inversion. Gdim acts as the vii° chord in Ab minor. It’s fascinating how the leading-tone chords shift between keys, like G diminished in Ab major and D diminished in Eb major.**Analyzing Gdim and chord functions**

I’m exploring Gdim, which consists of G, Bb, and Db. In Eb major, the ii chord is Fm and the iii is Gm, while Gdim isn’t diatonic; it serves as the vii°/Ab. Gdim acts as a leading-tone chord to Ab, making it a secondary leading-tone to IV. Then there's Ab/G, which can represent voice-leading to Ab. Bbm over F bass in Eb major may act as a borrowed subdominant minor. This pattern shows some interesting bluesy progressions!**Exploring chord relationships**

In Eb major, Db is the flat VII chord, which is a common borrowed chord from Mixolydian. The Dbmaj7 chord with F in the bass might suggest some voice-leading. This implies the presence of a borrowed bVII chord in Eb, which could be a bVIImaj7. Alternatively, looking at the key of Ab, Eb/G acts as a V/6 chord. I see Gdim is the vii° of Ab, and Bbm/F functions as ii of Ab in first inversion. Very interesting connections here!**Examining chord relationships and context**

In this analysis, G serves as a leading tone to Ab, making Ab/G an interesting I chord over a leading tone bass. Interestingly, Gdim usually resolves to Ab, but this time it leads to other chords. The symmetry in the sequence, with repeated chords, suggests a gravitational center around Ab, even when Ab isn’t explicitly stated. The progression uses various diatonic chords, oscillating between G and F in the bass, indicating a modal context. 

Ultimately, it seems like the key is Ab major, integrating various elements while prominently featuring the leading-tone diminished triad!**Analyzing tonal centers and modes**

The progression feels centered around Ab, yet we rarely land on a plain Ab chord in root position. Gdim serves as a vii° leading to I (Ab), but it often transitions to Ab/G instead. I gather that the key center is likely Ab major with an Ionian mode. Yet, considering Eb Mixolydian is an option too, since both share similar pitch collections. It appears that Gdim could function as iii° in Mixolydian, while the presence of minor v and bVII strengthens that interpretation.

Ultimately, it seems both Eb Mixolydian and Ab major could work contextually, but the structure leans toward a Mixolydian vibe with Gdim and Bbm.**Determining key and mode**

I don't see an Ab or Eb root in the bass, but there's mention of Eb in the chord names. Moving from Gdim to Eb/G suggests that G could be a third for Eb; however, interpreting G as a leading tone isn't quite right in this context. It seems more appropriate to lean towards Eb Mixolydian, given the presence of Bbm and Dbmaj7. All the chords align with an Eb-centered sound. 

So, the final answer is:  
Key center: Eb  
Mode: Mixolydian (Eb Mixolydian)  
Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major; functions in Eb Mixolydian.

Eb Mixolydian (Eb as tonal center, using the Ab major pitch collection: Eb F G Ab Bb C Db)

Reason: All chords are diatonic to Ab major, but they function around Eb as tonic: Eb/G (I6), Gdim (iii°), Bbm/F (v), Ab/G (IV), Dbmaj7/F (bVIImaj7). This is the characteristic Mixolydian palette (bVII and minor v).

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequence**

I need to parse the chord sequence the user provided: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." 

So, the chords break down into Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, and Dbmaj7/F. It seems like these could form chromatic neighbor chords, probably in Eb minor. Gdim is a diminished triad formed by G, Bb, and Db, which makes me wonder about their relation to the Bb minor scale. I’m thinking through this carefully now!**Clarifying chord relationships**

I’m working through Gdim, which contains G natural and has Db and Bb. In the context of Eb major, I realize G is natural, but Eb major actually has D natural, not Db. This means Gdim doesn't fit well with Eb major since it includes Db. I'm trying to figure out what key includes Bb and Db alongside G natural. I initially thought of C harmonic minor, but it has B natural instead of Bb. Now I'm considering Db major, which could work since it includes both Bb and Db, along with G.**Identifying Gdim's function**

I realize G natural isn't in Db major, which means it's a tritone to Db. Since Gdim is symmetrical, it could work as a leading-tone diminished chord for Ab major, where G serves as the leading tone. In the Ab major scale, G, Bb, and Db form Gdim, marking it as the vii° chord. This aligns with the Ab major scale, which does include G natural. I also wonder if Gdim fits into Ab minor as well, suggesting a connection to Ab chords.**Examining Ab/G and Eb/G chords**

I'm looking at the Ab/G chord, which has Ab over G in the bass and might be considered a neighbor to Gdim. It contains the notes Ab, C, and Eb, which form a semitone bass neighbor to Ab. I also notice Eb/G, which is an Eb major chord over a G bass. In Ab major, Eb is the V chord, but with G as the bass, it creates a V6/5 or perhaps a third-inversion seventh chord. However, Eb doesn't include the necessary Db for V7.**Determining key and mode**

I’ve figured out that Dbmaj7 includes C natural, which indicates that the key is Ab major, not Ab minor. Therefore, the key is Ab major (Ionian). If the user wants a mapping of scale degrees, I can outline chord functions: Gdim is vii°, Eb/G is V6, Bbm/F is ii6/4, Ab/G is I over 7, and Dbmaj7/F is IVmaj7 in first inversion. The straightforward answer would be:

- Key: Ab major (Ionian).
- All chords are diatonic to Ab major.
- Roman numerals: vii° (Gdim), V6 (Eb/G), ii6/4 (Bbm/F), I over 7 (Ab/G), IVmaj7 (Dbmaj7/F).

Ab major (Ionian)

All chords are diatonic to Ab major:
- Gdim = vii°
- Eb/G = V6
- Bbm/F = ii6/4
- Ab/G = I over 7 (neighbor/passing bass)
- Dbmaj7/F = IVmaj7 in first inversion

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm working on determining the key and mode from the given chord progression: "Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim." It seems like there are several G diminished chords. The notation shows Eb major triad with G in bass, and Bbm/F is a B-flat minor over F. Given these, I wonder if this could be in G major or related to the key of Ab major since Gdim functions there as a leading tone diminished chord.**Clarifying chord structure**

I realize that G diminished triad consists of G-Bb-Db, which fits within Ab major since the scale includes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, and G. The vii° chord forms G° (G-Bb-Db) which is correct. Then, Eb/G represents the V chord in first inversion with G in the bass, which also fits Ab major. I verify that G natural is indeed in Ab major as the seventh degree. So, the progression from Gdim to Eb/G really toggles with G in the bass.**Analyzing Ab/G chord**

The Ab/G chord consists of Ab-C-Eb over G, creating a non-tertian structure that suggests an Ab major triad with a G bass, which might represent a G7sus4(b9#11). So, with G in the bass and Ab-C-Eb on top, the notes could be viewed as G7sus4 with those intervals: Ab as b9, C as 11, and Eb as b13. However, without D or F, it becomes a quartal cluster. In the Ab major context, this structure seems to lead into Ab major, but then it cycles back to Gdim after the Bbm/F to Ab/G sequence. Bbm/F serves as the ii chord in first inversion, fitting nicely in Ab major.**Examining Dbmaj7/F chord**

The Dbmaj7/F chord is significant in Ab major because Db serves as the IV chord, and the major seventh over F bass makes it a IVmaj7/3 in first inversion. All the notes fit within the Ab major scale. I also consider the possibility of it relating to F natural minor, where Bbm would be the iv chord. The diatonic sets for both keys are identical, emphasizing Eb and Ab as V and I in Ab major. The recurring Gdim acts as the leading-tone triad to Ab, making the Eb/G chord a common passing tone with G in the bass.**Determining key and mode**

My analysis suggests a tonal center around Ab major or potentially F natural minor. The Gdim chord functions as ii° in F minor, while various triads align with both keys. The recurring G bass and Gdim chords hint at G Locrian, but G isn't a strong tonal center. The modal vamp primarily toggles between Gdim and Eb/G, creating instability around G. Ultimately, the pitches mirror the Ab major scale, implying Ab major (Ionian) to be the most suitable key based on the given chords.**Determining key and mode**

The tonal center here suggests Ab major due to the frequent use of the Gdim and Eb/G chords, which typically resolve to Ab. The only major triads present are Eb and Ab. Considering the consistent appearance of Gdim as a leading-tone triad, I conclude that the key is Ab major, mode Ionian. All chords align with the Ab major scale, with functional roles throughout the progression supporting this analysis. So, I would succinctly state: Ab major (Ionian), with pitch collection matching that of both Ab major and F natural minor.

Ab major (Ionian). All chords are diatonic to Ab major (same pitch set as F natural minor): Gdim (vii°), Eb/G (V6), Bbm/F (ii6), Ab/G (I over 7), Dbmaj7/F (IVmaj7/3).

### Analysis of Chord Progression
The given progression is:  
**Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Bbm/F - Ab/G - Gdim - Gdim - Eb/G - Eb/G - Gdim - Gdim - Dbmaj7/F - Gdim**

This is a repetitive, jazz-influenced sequence with diminished chords (Gdim) acting as tension builders, leading tones, or passing harmony, and inverted chords (e.g., Eb/G, Ab/G) providing bass movement. I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step.

#### Step 1: Chord Breakdown and Notes
Assuming standard triad interpretations unless specified (e.g., Gdim as G-Bb-Db triad; maj7 as fully voiced with 7th), here's the harmony and all unique notes involved:

- **Gdim**: G - Bb - Db (diminished triad, vii° in Ab major)
- **Eb/G** (Eb major triad in 1st inversion): Bass G; notes G - Eb - G - Bb → Eb - G - Bb
- **Bbm/F** (Bb minor triad in 2nd inversion): Bass F; notes F - Bb - Db
- **Ab/G** (Ab major triad in 1st inversion): Bass G; notes G - Ab - C - Eb → Ab - C - Eb - G
- **Dbmaj7/F** (Db major 7th chord in 3rd inversion): Bass F; notes F - Db - F - Ab - C → Db - F - Ab - C

**All notes in the progression**: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb  
No other pitches (e.g., no D natural, B natural, etc.) are implied. This is a tight set—no chromaticism outside a single scale.

#### Step 2: Scale/Key Fit
These notes exactly match the **Ab major scale** (Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G):  
- Every chord uses only diatonic pitches from Ab major.  
- No accidentals or borrowings are needed; it's fully diatonic.  

Testing other likely keys shows mismatches:  
- **Eb major** (Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D): Db (from Gdim, Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F) is foreign (would be ♭7 or altered).  
- **C minor** (C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb): Db replaces D natural, creating inconsistency (Db appears repeatedly without resolution to D).  
- **F minor** (F - G - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb): Fits notes but not the root movement/chord functions (e.g., Gdim wouldn't lead naturally).  
- Other modes (e.g., Ab Dorian: Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G—wait, identical to Ab major? No, Dorian has Bb minor, but notes align; however, chord qualities point to major).

Ab major fits perfectly without forcing interpretations.

#### Step 3: Functional Harmony and Confirmation
In **Ab major**:  
- **Gdim** (vii°): Leading-tone diminished chord, resolves to Ab (i) or acts as a pivot (common in jazz for tension).  
- **Eb/G** (V6): Dominant in 1st inversion; bass G creates stepwise motion to Ab.  
- **Bbm/F** (ii6): Supertonic minor in 2nd inversion; bass F (VI) adds color, like a passing or modal mixture hint, but still diatonic.  
- **Ab/G** (i6/4): Tonic in 2nd inversion; bass G links back to Gdim.  
- **Dbmaj7/F** (III7, 3rd inversion): Mediants (III) are common in jazz standards for color; fully diatonic (Db - F - Ab - C), bass F smooths to resolution.  

The progression circles around the tonic (Ab) via dominant (Eb) and subdominant (Db/Bb) areas:  
- Repetitive Gdim → Eb/G feels like vii° → V (preparing i).  
- Bbm/F → Ab/G is ii → i (bass F → G moves to tonic).  
- Ends on Dbmaj7/F → Gdim (III7 → vii°), implying return to i (Ab) or looping back.  

This has a jazz ballad or standard feel (e.g., reminiscent of tunes like "Misty" or "Autumn Leaves" in similar keys, but exact match not needed for analysis). No modal mixture (e.g., no ♭III or ♭VI); it's straightforward.

#### Conclusion: Key and Mode
- **Key**: Ab major  
- **Mode**: Ionian (major scale—no alterations like Phrygian ♭2 or Mixolydian ♭7; pure major tonality).  

If this is from a specific song (e.g., a jazz chart), it might have contextual modulations, but based solely on the chords, Ab major is the clear center. If you provide more context (e.g., melody or full tune), I can refine this!

### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Progression**

\n\n

I've begun to break down the provided chord progression, starting with isolating each chord symbol. Next, I plan to identify the key(s) involved to get a sense of the harmonic context. I anticipate some key changes here, and the initial analysis suggests a potentially modal or ambiguous tonal center.


**Unpacking the Components**

\n\n

My current focus is on deconstructing each chord and its function. Examining each chord's component notes is revealing crucial harmonic relationships. Specifically, I'm noting the frequency of the Gdim, and the implications of the bass notes within the inversions. The Circle of Fifths pattern is indeed emerging, pointing to a potential key.


**Exploring Key Candidates**

\n\n

My current thinking centers on the likely key of Eb Major. While the presence of Bbm raises a flag, it appears borrowed from the parallel minor. The analysis strongly supports Eb Major as the primary key, with the Gdim chords functioning as passing chords or altered dominants. Further scrutiny of the chord functions will either cement this or push me to revise.


**Refining Key Context**

\n\n

My current thinking leans towards confirming Eb major, while considering the possibility of a modal shift to Eb Dorian in certain sections due to the borrowed chords. The role of Gdim remains intriguing, its non-diatonic nature emphasizing a complex harmonic landscape. The analysis of the inversions is helping me to understand the bass line motion.


**Evaluating Harmonic Functions**

\n\n

My current thinking circles back to refining the harmonic roles. The Gdim chords, now understood as `vii°/IV`, are crucial for harmonic color. I am now looking at the passing chords to assess how they contribute to the melody, and I'm further examining the specific bass note movements within the inversions, which will help determine the voice leading.


**Refining the Key Analysis**

\n\n

My current thinking centers on the use of secondary dominants, particularly the Gdim chords, and how they pull towards the IV chord, Ab. This makes Eb Major the clear tonal center. Considering the Gdim's function as a secondary dominant of the IV chord, I will now analyze the melody's alignment with the bass line for voice leading.


**Finalizing the Tonal Center**

\n\n

My current thinking confirms Eb major as the primary key, with clear harmonic functions. I've pinpointed the `vii°/IV` function of `Gdim`. I'm focusing on the bass line to identify voice-leading techniques. Overall, the harmonic analysis is progressing well. I am currently examining the `Gdim` and its use as a secondary dominant.


**Finalizing Harmonic Roles**

\n\n

My current thinking now moves towards considering the overall harmonic structure. With the key and function established, I'll now evaluate the melodic elements. The bassline's descending stepwise motion is a clear feature, and is worth studying to find the voice leading. The overall color is mostly major but with some minor colors as well.


**Evaluating Chord Functions**

\n\n

My current thinking now circles back to analyzing the functions. The Gdim chords, recognized as `vii°/IV`, are integral to the harmonic color, creating tension that resolves to the Ab. Examining the bass movement and the relationship to the melody is my next focus, as well as the passing chords.




Based on a harmonic analysis of the progression, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **Eb Major**
*   **Mode:** **Major with significant modal interchange** (borrowing from the parallel minor key, Eb minor).

---

### Detailed Analysis

Here is a breakdown of why this is the case, looking at each chord's function within the key of Eb Major:

1.  **The Tonal Center (The "Home" Chord):**
    *   The **Eb/G** chord appears multiple times. This is an **Eb Major** chord in first inversion (I⁶). Its frequent appearance acts as a point of stability and resolution, strongly suggesting Eb is the tonic or "home" key.

2.  **The Non-Diatonic "Color" Chords:**
    The other chords in the progression are not all diatonic to the standard Eb major scale, which is what makes the progression sound so rich and soulful. They are "borrowed" from the parallel Eb minor scale.

3.  **Chord-by-Chord Breakdown (in the key of Eb Major):**

    *   **Gdim (G - Bb - Db):** This is the **vii°/IV** chord. It's the leading-tone diminished chord of Ab. The note G is the leading tone to Ab, and this chord creates strong tension that wants to resolve to the Ab chord (the IV chord in Eb major).

    *   **Eb/G (Eb - G - Bb):** This is the **I⁶** chord (the tonic in first inversion). It establishes the key of Eb Major.

    *   **Bbm/F (Bb - Db - F):** This is the **v⁶** chord (a minor dominant chord in first inversion). In a standard major key, the V chord is major (Bb Major). A Bb minor chord is the v chord from the parallel **Eb minor key**. Borrowing the minor v chord is very common in Gospel, R&B, and Soul music.

    *   **Ab/G (Ab - C - Eb over a G bass):** This is the **IV** chord with the 3rd of the tonic (G) in the bass. This creates a specific kind of pleasant tension, functioning as a pre-dominant chord while maintaining a connection to the tonic harmony via the bass note.

    *   **Dbmaj7/F (Db - F - Ab - C):** This is the **♭VIImaj7** chord in first inversion. The Db Major chord is not in the key of Eb Major. It is the ♭VII chord borrowed from the parallel **Eb minor key** (specifically, Eb Aeolian mode). This is another classic modal interchange chord that adds a soulful, "yearning" quality.

### Summary

The progression is firmly rooted in **Eb Major** by the repeated use of the Eb/G chord. However, it heavily utilizes chords from the parallel minor key (Eb minor) to create harmonic interest and emotional color. This technique, known as **modal interchange** or "borrowing," is a defining characteristic of genres like Gospel, Neo-Soul, and R&B. You are hearing a major key that is "flavored" with chords from its parallel minor counterpart.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chord symbols: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode for this progression. 

First, I need to understand what these chords are telling me. Diminished chords like Gdim (G-Bb-Db) are interesting because they're symmetrical and can function in different ways—often as passing chords or leading to other harmonies. The Eb/G is an Eb major chord with G in the bass—that's the first inversion since G is the third of Eb. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb major with F in the bass (first inversion), Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass (second inversion? Wait no—Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so G as bass would be a sixth chord, but it's written as Ab/G so it's Ab major over G bass). Dbmaj7/F is Db major seventh with F in the bass—F is the third of Db, so again first inversion. 

Hmm, the progression is built around Gdim repeating a lot, with these major chords with different bass notes sliding in between. Let me list out all the roots and bass notes to see the movement: 

- Gdim (root G, bass G) 
- ... 
- Eb/G (root Eb, bass G) 
- Bbm/F (root Bb, bass F) 
- Ab/G (root Ab, bass G) 
- Dbmaj7/F (root Db, bass F) 

I notice that G appears frequently in the bass—specifically in Eb/G, Ab/G, and the Gdim chords themselves. The bass notes seem to move in half-steps sometimes: G in Gdim → G in Eb/G → F in Bbm/F? Wait no: 

Let's extract just the bass notes from the progression: 

1. G (Gdim) 
2. G (Gdim) 
3. G (Eb/G) 
4. G (Eb/G) 
5. G (Gdim) 
6. G (Gdim) 
7. F (Bbm/F) 
8. G (Ab/G) → here it jumps back to G 
9. G (Gdim) 
10. G (Gdim) 
11. G (Eb/G) 
12. G (Eb/G) 
13. G (Gdim) 
14. G (Gdim) 
15. F (Dbmaj7/F) 
16. G (Gdim) 

Oh! The bass is mostly G, with only two bass notes changing: F in position 7 (Bbm/F) and F again in position 15 (Dbmaj7/F). So the bass line is firmly anchored on G for 14 out of 16 chords, with just two Fs interrupting it. That's unusual—it suggests G is functioning as a pedal tone, probably the tonic. 

Now, let's look at the chords themselves over this G bass: 

- When bass is G: 
  * Gdim = G-Bb-Db → so notes Bb, Db over G bass 
  * Eb/G = G (bass) + Eb chord (Eb-G-Bb) → but since bass is G, it's actually G-Eb-G-Bb → which is G7sus4? Wait no: Eb major triad over G bass gives G as root? Standard analysis: Eb/G is a first inversion Eb chord, but functionally it can imply G7 if we consider Bb as the minor 7th (since Eb/G = G-Bb-Eb, which is G7sus♭9? Not quite—G-Bb-Eb is actually Gm7♭5? Let's spell it: 

Eb major triad = Eb, G, Bb 
Over G bass → total notes: G (bass), Eb, G, Bb → so the chord is G-Eb-G-Bb. The intervals from G: m3 (Eb), P5 (Bb). So it's G minor 7th but missing the 7th? Wait, G-Eb-Bb is G minor triad. Adding the extra G makes it G minor with doubled root. But Eb/G is conventionally called "Eb major over G bass," not analyzed as a G chord. However, in context, with G pedal, it might be coloring the harmony around G. 

Similarly: 
- Bbm/F: F bass + Bb major (Bb-D-F) → notes F, Bb, D, F → so D is the 6th above F? It's F major 6th chord (F6 = F-A-C-D, but here it's F-Bb-D → wait Bb major is Bb-D-F, so over F bass it's F-Bb-D → which is actually Bb major in first inversion, but the bass F suggests it's functioning as an F-based chord. Specifically, F-Bb-D is F sus4? No—F-A-C is F major, so F-Bb-D has no third, it's F sus4 (Bb replaces A). But Bb isn't the fourth; Bb is the 11th? Messy. 

Perhaps better to think vertically: all chords are being heard with G as a pedal point after positions 7 and 15. But positions 7 and 15 have F bass, so maybe those are the only shifts. 

Wait, let's list all chords with their actual root (not bass): 

- Gdim: root G 
- Eb/G: root Eb 
- Bbm/F: root Bb 
- Ab/G: root Ab 
- Dbmaj7/F: root Db 

So the roots are: G, G, Eb, Eb, G, G, Bb, Ab, G, G, Eb, Eb, G, G, Db, G 

That's G dominant, then Eb major (which is the bVI in G minor?), Bb major (V in G minor?), Ab major (bVII), Db major (bIII in G minor?). 

Ah—this looks suspiciously like a minor key progression with chromatic mediants or borrowed chords. Let's test G minor as the key. 

In G natural minor: 
- i = Gm 
- bIII = Bb 
- iv = Cm 
- v = Dm 
- bVI = Eb 
- bVII = F 

But here we have Ab and Db, which aren't in G natural minor. Ab is bII? Db is bV? Not standard. 

G harmonic minor has: 
- Gm (G-Bb-D) 
- Adim (A-C-Eb) 
- Bb+ (Bb-Db-F#) — but we have Bb major here (Bb-D-F), not augmented. 

G melodic minor ascending: 
- Gm (G-Bb-D) 
- Am (A-C-E) 
- Bb+ (Bb-Db-F#) — again, not matching. 

But look at the chords: we have Eb major (bVI), Bb major (V? but in minor key V is major—D major), but here it's Bb, which is not V of G. V of G would be D major. 

Unless... this is in the key of C minor? Let me check. 

C minor key: 
- i = Cm 
- bIII = Eb 
- iv = Fm 
- v = Gm 
- bVI = Ab 
- bVII = Bb 

Look at the roots: we have Eb, Ab, Bb, Db. Eb is bIII in C minor, Ab is bVI, Bb is bVII, Db is—Db isn't in C natural minor (bIII is Eb, so Db would be double-flat or something? No). 

C harmonic minor has B natural, so G#dim, not Gdim. 

Wait, Gdim is prominent. Diminished chords often lead to dominant or tonic. Gdim could be vii° in Ab major, but we have Db chords too. 

Let's consider the Eb/G chord. Eb/G is enharmonically equivalent to Ebdim6 or something? Standard trick: Gdim (G-Bb-Db) can be respelled as Bbdim, Dbdim, or F#dim (enharmonically). For example, G-Bb-Db = Bb-Db-Fb (but Fb is E), so Bb-D-E? No, better: diminished 7th chords are symmetrical, but these are dim triads (no 7th), so not fully symmetrical. 

Gdim triad = G, Bb, Db 

This could function as: 
- vii° of Ab major (since Ab major: Ab-Bb-C, and vii° is G#-B-D, but G# = Ab, so Ab°7 = Ab-B-Db-E, but here it's just G-Bb-Db, so partial). 
If in Ab major, vii° of Ab is G#-B-D, which is enharmonically Ab-Db (since G#=Ab, B=Cb? Messy). 

Gdim could also lead to Ab (diatonic in G# minor? Complicated). 

But look at the progression: it ends with Dbmaj7/F → Gdim. Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C, over F bass → F-Db-Ab-C. Then Gdim. So Db to G is a tritone? Db to G is augmented fourth, which is common in jazz (e.g., tritone substitution). 

Db major is the bV of G? No—standard tritone sub: in key of G, dominant is D7, tritone sub is Ab7. But here we have Db, which is enharmonically C#, so C#7 would be tritone sub for G7? C#7 to G is tritone resolution (C# = Fb, but usually it's Ab7 to D). 

Perhaps this is in G but using chromatic mediants. 

Another approach: collect all the notes used. 

From the chords: 
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db 
- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (since Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, over G bass → notes G, Eb, Bb) 
- Bbm/F: F, Bb, D (Bb major is Bb-D-F, over F bass → F, Bb, D) 
- Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, over G bass → G, Ab, C, Eb 
- Dbmaj7/F: F, Db, Ab, C (Dbmaj7 = Db-F-Ab-C, over F bass → F, Db, Ab, C) 

Now compile all unique notes: G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, D, Ab, C. 

List: C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

That's: C, Db, D, Eb, E (wait no D is natural? From Bbm/F: Bb major has D natural, yes—Bb-D-F). 

So notes present: 
- C (from Ab/G and Dbmaj7) 
- Db (from Gdim and Dbmaj7) 
- D (from Bbm/F) 
- Eb (from Eb/G and Ab/G) 
- F (from Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F) 
- G (pedal) 
- Ab (from Ab/G and Dbmaj7) 
- Bb (from Gdim and Eb/G) 

Missing: A natural, E natural. 

So the scale is: C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

That's 8 notes, but let's see which mode fits. 

Order them: Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. 

This is almost Db major (Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C), but here we have D natural instead of Gb. Db major has Gb, but we have G natural? Wait no—the notes include G natural (pedal), and Ab. 

Actually, the notes are: 
Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. 

This resembles the diminished scale (octatonic), which alternates whole and half steps. Two types: WH (whole-half) or HW (half-whole). 

Check the intervals between consecutive notes: 
Start from Db: 
Db to D = half step 
D to Eb = half step → but should be whole for WH scale? WH scale is W-H-W-H etc. 

Sort ascending: Db, D, Eb, E (no), F, Gb? No—let's list all notes in order: 
C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

So: 
C - Db (H) 
Db - D (H) — but D natural is next after Db, so H step. 
D - Eb (H) 
Eb - F (W) 
F - G (W) 
G - Ab (H) 
Ab - Bb (W) 
Bb - C (W) 

Not consistent. Better to consider the pitch classes: 
0=C, 1=Db, 2=D, 3=Eb, 5=F, 7=G, 8=Ab, 10=Bb. 

So PC set: {0,1,2,3,5,7,8,10}. 

This is the octatonic scale (diminished scale). Specifically, it's the half-whole diminished scale starting on C: 
C, Db, D, Eb, E? No—half-whole is H-W-H-W-etc. 

Standard half-whole diminished from C: C, Db, D#, E, F#, G, A, Bb. 

But our notes are C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

So: 
C 
H: C-Db 
W: Db-D (but D is natural, yes) 
H: D-Eb 
W: Eb-F 
H: F-Gb? But we have F-G (whole step), not half. 

Actually, from F to G is whole step, G to Ab is half step, Ab to Bb is whole, Bb to C is whole → not matching. 

The set {C,Db,D,Eb,F,G,Ab,Bb} is exactly the C half-whole diminished scale: 
C (root) 
H up: Db 
W up: D (Eb? Wait standard is: C, Db, D#, E, F#, G, A, Bb — so D# is same as Eb? No, D# = Eb, but then E natural is missing. 

Standard C half-whole diminished: 
1. C 
2. Db (H) 
3. D# (W) — but D# = Eb 
4. E (H) — but E natural not in our set! 
Our set has D natural, not E natural. 

We have D natural (from Bbm/F: Bb-D-F), so pitch class 2 (D), not 3 (Eb) for the second note after Db? 

Better: our notes are: 
C (0) 
Db (1) 
D (2) 
Eb (3) 
F (5) 
G (7) 
Ab (8) 
Bb (10) 

Missing E (4) and A (9). 

This is precisely the octatonic scale 8-28 in set theory, specifically the half-whole diminished scale starting on C: 
C, Db, D, Eb, F, Gb? No—standard H/W: start on C: 
Half step: C to Db 
Whole step: Db to D# (Eb) 
Half step: D# to E 
Whole step: E to F# 
Etc. 

But we have C, Db, D (not D#/Eb yet), so it's not matching. 

Alternative: the notes correspond to G half-whole diminished scale. 

G half-whole diminished: 
G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D? Let's see: 
H: G-Ab 
W: Ab-Bb 
H: Bb-B 
W: B-C#? No. 

Standard: 
Start G: 
1. G 
2. Ab (H) 
3. A (W) — but A natural not present; we have Ab and Bb. 

Our notes: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, D, Eb, F. 

So from G: 
G, Ab (H), Bb (W), C (W), Db (H), D (H), Eb (W), F (W). 

Pattern: H, W, W, H, H, W, W — that's two whole steps after Bb? Not standard octatonic. 

Octatonic scales have alternating H and W. The two types: 
- Starting with H: H,W,H,W,H,W,H,W — e.g., C,Db,D#,E,F#,G,A,Bb 
- Starting with W: W,H,W,H,W,H,W,H — e.g., C,D,D#,E,F#,G,A,Bb 

Our set: from C — C,Db,D,Eb,F,G,Ab,Bb 
Intervals: 
C-Db = H 
Db-D = H → two halves, not alternating. 
So not octatonic. 

Could it be a mode of the harmonic minor or something else? 

List all notes: C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 
This is 8 notes, but scale degrees for what key? 

Suppose the tonic is G (since bass is mostly G). 
G as root, what scale? 
G to G: G Ab Bb C Db D Eb F G 
That's G diminished scale (half-whole): 
1 G 
b2 Ab 
#2 = Bbb? No—standard G half-whole: 
G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D 
But we have Bb, not A or B. 
Our notes: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, D, Eb, F → so for G: 
G 
Ab (b2) 
Bb (b3) 
C (4) 
Db (b5) 
D (5) — but 5 can't be both Db and D? 
D natural and Db both present — so it's a chromatic scale with alterations. 

This strongly suggests the half-whole diminished scale, but centered on G. 
The G half-whole diminished scale is: G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D — but we have Bb instead of A/B, and C, Db, D, Eb (which is Fb? no). 

Standard G half-whole: 
1. G 
2. Ab (b2) 
3. A (bb3? enharmonic Bbb, but usually called #2) 
4. Bb (b3) 
5. B (3) — but we don't have B natural; we have Bb and C. 
Our set has: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, D, Eb, F. 
So: 
G 
Ab (b2) 
Bb (b3) — but in diminished scale, the third is both minor and major, but here only b3 present. 

Perhaps it's not a standard scale. Let's think functionally. 

Back to chords: the progression keeps returning to Gdim over G bass. Gdim is unusual as a tonic chord—it's dissonant and unstable. But in some contexts, like minor keys, vii° can be prominent, but usually it's leading to i. 

Notice that Eb/G: Eb major over G bass = G7sus♭9? Let's spell the notes: G (bass) + Eb-G-Bb → so pitches: G, Eb, G, Bb. From G: root, minor 7th (F is missing? Bb is the minor 7th? G to Bb is minor 3rd, not 7th. G to F is minor 7th, but F is not in Eb/G chord. 

Eb/G contains: G, Bb, Eb → which is G minor 7th flat 5? G-Bb-Db-F is Gm7♭5, but here it's G-Bb-Eb — no Db or F. G-Bb-Eb is actually a Gsus4? No—G suspended 4th would be G-C-D. G-Bb-Eb: intervals from G: minor 3rd (Bb), perfect 5th (D would be, but it's Eb? G to Eb is minor 6th). So it's ambiguous. 

However, in jazz contexts, Eb major over G bass is often used as a substitute for G7♭9, because the notes Eb, G, Bb = the ♭9, 3rd, and ♭7 of G7♭9? G7♭9 is G-B-D-F-Ab, so ♭9 is Ab, not Eb. Not matching. 

G7 would be G-B-D-F. 
G7♭9 = G-B-D-F-Ab. 
Eb major is Eb-G-Bb. So Eb/G has G-Bb-Eb — which is the b7, root, and b3 of C minor? Not helpful. 

Another idea: the Eb/G chord can be heard as a tritone substitution for A7. Because D7 (V of G) tritone sub is Ab7, but here it's Eb over G. 

Tritone sub: the sub for D7 is Ab7 (since D and Ab are tritone apart). But Eb is a half step below E, which is root of the dominant? Not directly. 

Perhaps it's all built on G minor with borrowed chords. 

Let's assume key is G minor. 
G natural minor: G A Bb C D Eb F G 

Chords: 
- Gdim: this isn't in G minor; scale degrees: 1=G, 2=Ab? No, G minor has G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So Gdim (G-Bb-Db) — Db is not in the scale (enharmonic to C#, but G minor has D natural, not Db). So Gdim is foreign. 

G harmonic minor: G A Bb C D Eb F# G — has F#, not F natural. But our chords have F natural (in Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F), so not harmonic minor. 

G melodic minor ascending: G A Bb C D E F# G — again, F# not present. 

But our progression has F natural (from bass in two places), Bb, Eb, Ab, Db — all flats. 

This suggests G Dorian? G Dorian: G A Bb C D E F G — has F natural and no Gdim. 

Still no Gdim. 

Perhaps the mode is G half-diminished scale? But that's for chords, not a key. 

Let's look at the chord roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. 
These are all minor 3rds apart: G to Eb is minor 3rd down (or major 6th up), Eb to Bb is perfect 4th, not minor 3rd. G-Eb-Bb-Ab-Db: 
G to Eb = minor 3rd (down) 
Eb to Bb = perfect 5th (up) 
Bb to Ab = major 2nd (down) 
Ab to Db = perfect 4th (up) — not consistent. 

But Db to G is augmented 4th (tritone), which resolves outward to Eb and C or inward to D and C# — in the progression, Dbmaj7/F goes to Gdim, which could lead to Ab or something. 

Ah! Dbmaj7/F to Gdim: Db root to G root is tritone, so Db is likely functioning as a tritone substitution. 

In the key of G major, the V chord is D7. The tritone substitution for D7 is Ab7 (since D and Ab are a tritone apart). But here we have Db, not Ab. Db is G#'s tritone? D is V of G, tritone sub is Ab (which is bII major). But Db is a major third below Ab? Not directly. 

Db = enharmonic C#, and C#7 is the tritone sub for G7? Because G7 has tritone B-F, and C#7 has E#-B which is enharmonic F-B, same tritone. So C#7 (or Db7) is tritone sub for G7. 

But in this progression, we have Dbmaj7, not Db7. Dbmaj7 resolves to Gdim — how would that work? 

Dbmaj7 to Gdim: very chromatic. 

Perhaps the key is C minor. Let's try. 

In C minor: 
- i = Cm 
- V = G7 
- bVI = Ab 

But here we have Eb (bIII), Bb (bVII), Ab (bVI), Db (bV? not standard). 

C harmonic minor has G# in the scale, so G#dim chord. But we have Gdim, which is G natural, so not C harmonic minor. 

Another possibility: the progression is in the key of Ab major. 
Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G Ab 

Chords: 
- Gdim: that's vii° of Ab — yes! Gdim (G-Bb-Db) is the leading tone chord in Ab major. 
- Eb/G: Eb major is V in Ab, and Eb/G is first inversion — common. 
- Bbm/F: Bb major is vi in Ab? Ab major: vi is Fm, not Bb. Bb major is bII, not diatonic. 
- Ab/G: Ab major is I, but with G bass — so first inversion? Ab/G would be Ab major over G, which is not standard; I6 in Ab would be Ab/C. 
- Dbmaj7/F: Db major is IV in Ab, and Dbmaj7/F is first inversion. 

Let's check: 
- Gdim = vii° of Ab 
- Eb = V of Ab 
- Bbm: not diatonic; Ab major has Bbm as... no, Bb is natural in Ab, so Bbm would be borrowed. 
- Ab = I 
- Db = IV 

But the progression has Bbm/F and it's Bb major, not minor. In Ab major, ii is Bbm (Bb-Db-F), but here it's Bb major (Bb-D-F). So D natural is not in Ab major (which has Db). 

Ab major has Db, not D natural. Bb major requires D natural, which is outside Ab major. 

So not Ab major. 

But Bb major could be a borrowed chord from Ab mixolydian or something. 

Notice that Bb major is the V of Eb. 
Eb major is in the progression. 

So Eb/G could be part of an Eb key center. 
Eb major: Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb 

Then Eb/G is I6 in Eb. 
Gdim: not diatonic; vii° of Ab, but not for Eb. 

Gdim could relate to C minor or something. 

Let's consider the entire progression as revolving around G as tonic, with chords borrowed from parallel minor and diminished harmony. 

G major: G A B C D E F# 
G minor: G A Bb C D Eb F 

Chords in progression: 
- Gdim: not in G major or minor; would be vii° in Ab, but here it's tonicized. 
- Eb/G: Eb major is bVI in G minor — yes! In G minor, bVI is Eb major. 
- Bbm/F: Bb major is bIII in G minor — G minor has Bb, but as minor chord (Bbm), not major. Bb major is a common borrowed chord (from G Dorian or Phrygian). 
- Ab/G: Ab major is bII in G minor — borrowed from Phrygian. 
- Dbmaj7/F: Db major — not standard; could be tritone sub or from diminished scale. 

So this looks like G minor with extensive modal mixture and chromaticism. 

Specifically: 
- Gdim is emphasized as a tonic substitute or pedal point. In minor keys, the tonic minor chord is Gm, but here they're using Gdim to create tension. But Gdim = G-Bb-Db, while Gm = G-Bb-D. So replacing D natural with Db. 

Ah! That's the key. The tonic chord is being altered between Gm (implied) and Gdim by changing D to Db. 

In the progression: 
- When chords like Eb/G happen, Eb/G = G-Bb-Eb, which contains Bb (minor 3rd of Gm) and Eb (which is the 7th? Gm7 = G-Bb-D-F, so Eb isn't there). 

But let's see the scale implied by the chords: 

For G tonic: 
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db → so minor 3rd (Bb), diminished 5th (Db) 
- Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb → minor 3rd (Bb), minor 6th (Eb) relative to G? G to Eb is minor 6th. 
- Bbm/F: with G pedal, it's F-Bb-D over G bass → so notes G,F,Bb,D → G7 (G-B-D-F) but B is missing; it's G-F-Bb-D = Gm7 (if Bb is 3rd, F is 7th, D is 5th) 
- Ab/G: G bass + Ab chord (Ab-C-Eb) → G,Ab,C,Eb → which is Gm7b5? G-Bb-Db-F is Gm7b5; here it's G-Ab-C-Eb. Ab is b9, C is natural 11, Eb is minor 7. Very altered. 
- Dbmaj7/F: F bass + Dbmaj7 (Db-F-Ab-C) → G is not in it, but with pedal? The chord is F,Db,Ab,C over G bass → so total: G,F,Db,Ab,C. From G: minor 7th (F), b6 (Db), b9 (Ab), 4th (C). 

This is heavily chromatic, suggesting the use of the half-whole diminished scale over a G pedal. 

The G half-whole diminished scale contains: G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D — but in our progression, we have Bb and D natural (from Bbm/F: Bb-D-F), but no A or B natural. Instead, we have Eb and C, which correspond to Ebb and Bbb? Better: the scale degrees from G: 

1. G 
b2. Ab 
#2. Bbb = A (but not used) 
b3. Bb 
3. Cbb = B (not used) 
4. C 
b5. Db 
5. D 
#5. Ebb = D# (not used; we have Eb instead) 
b6. Ebb = D? Confusing. 

Standard G half-whole diminished: 
1. G 
b9. Ab 
#9. Bbb = A 
3. Bb 
#11. B 
5. C 
b13. Db 
13. D 
Back to 7. Eb (which is Fb) 

But in our chord analysis: 
- Ab/G gives Ab (b9), C (4), Eb (b7) 
- Dbmaj7/F gives Db (b5), Ab (b9), C (11), F (b7) 
- Bbm/F with G bass: F (b7), Bb (b3), D (5) 
- Eb/G: Eb (b7), Bb (b3), G (1) 
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db (1, b3, b5) 

So the notes occurring are: 
- Root: G 
- b3: Bb 
- 3: not present (A or B) 
- 4: C 
- b5: Db 
- 5: D 
- b7: F and Eb (Eb = D# = b7? G to Eb is minor 7th? G to F is minor 7th (F), G to Eb is major 6th down, but up it's minor 3rd — no. G to F is minor 7th (10 semitones), G to Eb is minor 6th (8 semitones). 

Gb7 would be G-Bb-Db-Fb, but Fb is E. We have F natural and Eb. 

This is messy. Let's consider jazz harmony: the heavy use of diminished chords and Eb/G, Bb, Ab, Db suggests tritone substitutions and chromatic mediants. 

But the constant G pedal suggests G is the tonal center. The only chords are major or diminished with G in bass (mostly), and the others are slides from F and G. 

Another clue: the progression has Eb/G twice, then later again — and Eb major is the relative major of C minor. But pedal is G, not C. 

Let's try to hear the bass motion from the two F points: 
Position 7: Bbm/F → bass F 
Position 8: Ab/G → bass jumps to G 
Position 15: Dbmaj7/F → bass F 
Position 16: Gdim → bass G 

So it's like F bass chords resolving up to G. Bbm/F to Ab/G: Bb major to Ab major is not standard, but F bass to G bass is whole step up. Similarly Db to G is fifth down (or fourth up), but bass F to G is whole step. 

The movement F to G in bass is common as a subdominant to dominant motion (e.g., F to G in C major), but here no clear key. 

Let's consider G as the dominant of C. 
If G is V of C, then: 
- Gdim = vii° of C — yes, Gdim is standard vii° in C major. 
- Eb/G: Eb is bVI in C minor, but in C major, Eb isn't diatonic. 
- Bbm/F: Bb is bII in C major (borrowed) or diatonic in C Mixolydian. 
- Ab/G: Ab is bVII in C major? C major has Bb, not Ab. 
- Dbmaj7/F: Db is bV in C? Not standard. 

But C harmonic minor has G#dim, not Gdim. 

C major scale: C D E F G A B 
Gdim = G Bb Db — Db not in C major. 

However, Gdim is the vii° chord in Ab major, as I thought earlier. 

Let me check the circle of fifths: the chord roots are G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. 
G to Eb is a minor 6th or minor 3rd down. 
In jazz, this could be tritone substitutions: 
- Gdim may be substitute for C7 or something. 

Standard diminished chord usage: Gdim can function as vii°7 of Ab, leading to Ab. 
Similarly, it could lead to A, but A isn't in the progression. 

The progression has Ab/G right after Bbm/F, so Bb to Ab is stepwise down. 

Let's line up the chords that aren't Gdim: 
- Eb/G (which is Eb major harmony) 
- Bbm/F (Bb major harmony) 
- Ab/G (Ab major harmony) 
- Dbmaj7/F (Db major harmony) 

So the non-Gdim chords are Eb, Bb, Ab, Db — all major chords. 

Eb, Bb, Ab, Db — what key has these? 
Eb major: Eb F G Ab Bb C D 
Has Ab and Bb, but not Db (Db would be the #IV or something). 

Relative major/minor: 
Eb major / C minor 
C minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C 
So C minor has Eb (bIII), Bb (bVII), Ab (bVI), but not Db. Db is not in C natural minor. 

C harmonic minor has B natural, so not. 

However, Db major is the Neapolitan chord in C minor! 
In C minor, the Neapolitan is Db major (bII). 

So in C minor: 
- bVI = Ab 
- bVII = Bb 
- bIII = Eb 
- bII = Db (Neapolitan) 

And Gdim: what is Gdim in C minor? 
Gdim = G Bb Db 
In C minor, the diatonic chords: 
i = Cm 
ii° = Ddim 
bIII = Eb 
iv = Fm 
v = Gm 
VI = Ab 
bVII = Bb 

No Gdim. But Gdim is enharmonically equivalent to G#dim, which is the leading tone chord for A major, but not relevant. 

However, Gdim can be seen as an extension of the Neapolitan: Db-Gdim is a common progression (bII - vii°). 

For example, in C minor: 
Db (bII) to Gdim (vii° of Ab, but also can lead to Ab or C). 

Yes! In minor keys, the Neapolitan (bII) often resolves to V or vii°. 

Specifically: in C minor, Db major (bII) to Gdim (which is the vii° of Ab, but Ab is the i chord of the subdominant area). 

Let's see the progression in C minor: 
- Gdim could be the diminished chord on scale degree 5, but C minor has Gm, not Gdim. However, Gdim is used as the dominant of Ab, which is the relative major's tonic? 

Ab major is the relative major of F minor, not C minor. 

C minor and Ab major share the same key signature (4 flats), and Ab is the bVI of C minor. 

So: 
- C minor tonic 
- bVI = Ab 
- But we have Db (bII), Gdim (which is not diatonic), etc. 

Standard progression in minor: i - bVI - bII - V 
In C minor: Cm - Ab - Db - G7 

But in this progression, we have: 
- Gdim (which is part of G7 or Ab tonic area) 
- Eb/G (Eb is bIII) 
- Bbm/F (Bb is bVII) 
- Ab/G (Ab is bVI) 
- Dbmaj7/F (Db is bII) 

The order is: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G (x2), Gdim (x2), Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim (x2), Eb/G (x2), Gdim (x2), Dbmaj7/F, Gdim. 

So the non-Gdim chords are: Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. 

In C minor: 
- Eb = bIII 
- Bb = bVII 
- Ab = bVI 
- Db = bII 

All are characteristic borrowed chords from the minor key. 

The Gdim chords: where do they fit? 

Gdim is G Bb Db. 
In C minor, Db is b2, Bb is b7, G is 5. 
So it contains the b2 (Db), b7 (Bb), and 5 (G) — which is the Neapolitan triad without the root? No. 

G Bb Db = Db G Bb, which is Db6 (Db-F-Ab-Bb) missing the F. 
But it's Gdim (root G). 

However, Gdim is enharmonically equivalent to Bbdim, Dbdim, or F#dim (for example, G Bb Db = Bb Db Fb, but Fb=E), so not helpful. 

But as a leading tone chord: Gdim leads to Ab (since Ab has G# as leading tone, but G is enharmonic to G#, so Gdim = G#dim, leading to A. But here it's leading to Ab in the progression (after Bbm/F comes Ab/G). 

Yes! Sequence: Bbm/F (Bb major) -> Ab/G (Ab major) 
Bb to Ab is a half step down, which is a common chromatic approach. 

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F -> Gdim: Db to G is tritone, but Db to G is not half step; however, after Dbmaj7, it goes to Gdim, which could be leading to Ab. 

In fact, the entire progression might be outlining C minor with the Gdim chords serving as passing or leading to the Ab (bVI) area. 

Let's test: 
- The chords Eb, Bb, Ab, Db are all diatonic to C minor as borrowed chords (bIII, bVII, bVI, bII). 
- Why are the Gdim chords inserted? 

Gdim (G Bb Db) contains Bb (which is b7 of C) and Db (b2 of C), and G (5 of C). 
So it's like a C7b9 chord without root and 3rd: C7b9 = C E G Bb Db, so Gdim = G Bb Db = the b9, 3rd, and b7 without C and E. Not quite. 

But in jazz, diminished chords are often used as dominant substitutes or leading tone chords. 

Specifically, Gdim can function as a dominant for Ab: Gdim = G#dim (enharmonic), which is vii°7 of Ab, resolving to Ab. 

And in the progression: 
- After two Gdim, comes Eb/G — which is not Ab. 
But later: after Bbm/F (position 7), comes Ab/G (position 8) — so Gdim is not immediately before Ab. 

Count the instances: 
- Before the first Eb: two Gdim 
- Before Bb: two Gdim 
- Before Db: two Gdim at the end 

But Bb is followed by Ab, not by Gdim directly. 

Sequence between non-G: 
- ... Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G ... 
So Gdim Gdim - Eb (x2) - Gdim Gdim - Bb - Ab - Gdim... 

So the Gdim chords are coming before the major chords: 
- Before Eb: two Gdim 
- Before Bb: two Gdim? No, after Bb is Ab directly. 

Let's list the chord sequence with labels: 
1-2: Gdim (2x) 
3-4: Eb/G (2x) 
5-6: Gdim (2x) 
7: Bbm/F 
8: Ab/G 
9-10: Gdim (2x) 
11-12: Eb/G (2x) 
13-14: Gdim (2x) 
15: Dbmaj7/F 
16: Gdim 

So the pattern is: 
(Gdim x2, Eb/G x2) repeated, then (Gdim x2, Bbm/F, Ab/G), then (Gdim x2, Eb/G x2) again, then (Gdim x2, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim). 

The Eb/G appears in two segments, and the Dbmaj7 is the climax before the final Gdim. 

Now, if we consider the Gdim as leading to Ab, then: 
- When does Gdim resolve? It often precedes Eb/G or Bbm/F or Dbmaj7/F, which are not Ab. 

But note: 
- Gdim to Eb/G: Gdim has G and Db; Eb/G has G and Bb — common tone G, and Db to Eb is whole step, not leading. 
- Gdim to Bbm/F: Gdim has G, Bb, Db; Bbm/F has F, Bb, D — common tone Bb. 
- Gdim to Ab/G: Gdim has G,Bb,Db; Ab/G has G,Ab,C,Eb — common tone G. 
- Gdim to Dbmaj7/F: Gdim has G,Bb,Db; Dbmaj7/F has F,Db,Ab,C — common tone Db, and Bb to Ab is whole step down. 

Not the typical leading tone resolution (half step up). 

However, in the context of the half-whole diminished scale, Gdim (G Bb Db) is the diminished arpeggio from G, and the scale provides the chromatic harmony. 

Given the prevalence of G in the bass and the chromatic major chords, the most likely tonal center is G, but with the key being G minor, and the scale used is G half-whole diminished for color. 

But diminished scale is usually for passing, not a key. 

Another possibility: the mode is G Locrian. 
G Locrian: G Ab Bb C Db Eb F G 
Chords: 
- i° = Gdim 
- bII = Ab 
- biii = Bbm 
- iv = Cm 
- v° = Ddim 
- bVI = Eb 
- bvii = F 

Check against progression: 
- Gdim = i° — yes! 
- Eb/G = bVI in first inversion — yes, bVI is Eb major. 
- Bbm/F = biii with F bass — but biii should be Bbm (minor), but here it's Bb major. So major instead of minor — not standard Locrian, but could be a variant. 
- Ab/G = bII — yes, but bII is Ab major, and Ab/G is first inversion? Locrian has bII, but typically it's minor or diminished, but in modern contexts, bII is major. 
- Dbmaj7/F = iv chord? In G Locrian, iv would be Cm, not Db. Db is enharmonic to C#, which would be biii# or something — no. In G Locrian, the fourth degree is C, so C diminished or minor. Db is not iv. 

However, Db major is bV in G minor? Let's see the scale: 
G Locrian: 1=G, b2=Ab, b3=Bb, 4=C, b5=Db, b6=Eb, b7=F 

So the chords: 
- i° = G Bb Db 
- bII = Ab C Eb 
- biii = Bb Db F 
- iv° = C Eb Gb (but Gb=F#) — not matching. 

The progression has Bb major (Bb D F), but biii in Locrian should be Bb Db F (Bbm). So it has D natural instead of Db, which is outside the scale. 

Unless it's mixing Locrian with Dorian or something. 

But Bb major (D natural) and Eb major (G natural) both have natural notes where Locrian has flats: 
- Locrian has Db for b5, but Eb major requires G natural (since Eb-G-Bb), and G natural is the root, so it's fine, but for the scale: Eb major has G natural, while G Locrian has G as root, so G natural is present, but the third of Eb is G natural, which is correct. 

G Locrian scale: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F 
So G natural, A flat, B flat, C, D flat, E flat, F. 

Eb major chord: Eb G Bb — G natural is in the scale (yes, it's the tonic), Bb is in the scale (b3), but Eb is the b7? G to Eb is minor 6th, but in the scale, Eb is the b6? G Locrian: 1, b2, b3, 4, b5, b6, b7. So b6 is Eb. Yes! In G Locrian, the b6 is Eb. 

So Eb major chord: Eb (b6), G (1), Bb (b3) — so it's the b6 major chord, which is diatonic to Locrian if we consider triads. In Locrian, the triad on b6 is Eb G Bb = Eb major (since G is natural, no flat). 

Similarly: 
- Ab major: Ab (b2), C (4), Eb (b6) — in Locrian, Ab to C is minor third? Ab to C is major third (Ab-C is 4 semitones), and Ab to Eb is perfect fifth, so yes, Ab major is diatonic. 
- Bb major: Bb (b3), D natural? In G Locrian, the third scale degree is Bb, which is minor, so the triad is Bb Db F = Bb minor. But we have Bb major (Bb D F), which requires D natural, but Locrian has Db (b5), not D natural. So D natural is outside the scale. 

Similarly, Db major: Db (b5), F (b7), Ab (b2) — Db major, but in Locrian, the b5 degree is Db, so triad is Db F Ab = Db major. Yes, that's diatonic. 

So the only issue is Bb major — should be Bb minor in strict Locrian. But in the progression, it's Bb major (with D natural). 

This could be a modal interchange or a melodic choice to have the major third. In some contexts, Locrian can have alterations. 

Moreover, the bass movement Bbm/F to Ab/G: in the progression it's Bb major/F to Ab/G, so Bb to Ab is down a whole step, which makes sense in Locrian context. 

Now, what about Dbmaj7/F? Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C — C is the 4th degree of G Locrian, which is diatonic. 

And Gdim = G Bb Db — the i° triad. 

The problem chord is Bbm/F — but if we interpret it as Bb major, it's not diatonic. However, in the bass it's F, which is b7 of G, so F Bb D — but D natural is not in the scale; should be Db. 

Unless this is G super Locrian or something, but super Locrian is the 7th mode of melodic minor, which has a major third. 

G super Locrian (7th mode of Ab melodic minor): 
Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb Gb Ab → enharmonic: G# A# B C# D# E F# G# 
But in flats for G: 
G Ab Bb B C# D E G — not matching. 

G Locrian #2 (which is the 6th mode of Ab melodic minor): 
Ab Bb C D Eb Fb Gb Ab → flats: G Ab Bb C Db Eb F G — wait, that's standard Locrian. 

Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G Ab 
6th mode is F: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb F — which is F Locrian? No, modes: 
1. Ab melodic minor: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G 
2. Bb Dorian: Bb C Db Eb F G Ab 
3. C Phrygian: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb 
4. Db Lydian: Db Eb F G Ab Bb C 
5. Eb Mixolydian: Eb F G Ab Bb C Db 
6. F Aeolian: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb 
7. G Locrian: G Ab Bb C Db Eb F 

Yes! G is the 7th mode of Ab melodic minor, which is G Locrian, and it has the notes G Ab Bb C Db Eb F. 

In this scale: 
- The triad on G is G Bb Db = Gdim — i° 
- Triad on Bb is Bb Db F = Bbm — biii 
- But in the progression, it's Bb major (Bb D F), which has D natural instead of Db. 

D natural is not in the scale; the scale has Db. So Bb major requires a natural D, which is outside. 

However, in jazz, it's common to play major chords on these degrees for color. 
Specifically, Bb major could be borrowed from G minor or Dorian. 

Given that the scale fits except for D natural in Bb major, and the progression is heavily centered on G with Gdim, the most plausible explanation is that the key is G, and the mode is Locrian, with the Bb major chord being a dynamic alteration (melodic choice to raise the D to natural for brightness). 

Moreover, Db major is diatonic (bV), Eb major is diatonic (bVI), Ab major is diatonic (bII). 

C major is missing in the chords? Dbmaj7 has C natural (the 7th), which is the 4th degree of G Locrian, diatonic. 

So overall: 
- Key: G 
- Mode: Locrian (7th mode of Ab melodic minor) 
- With a temporary major alteration on the bIII (Bb) chord for color. 

Therefore, the key is G, and the mode is Locrian. 

To confirm: 
- The tonic chord is Gdim, which is characteristic of Locrian. 
- The bass stays on G for most of the progression, reinforcing G as the tonal center. 
- The other chords (Eb, Bb, Ab, Db major) are all diatonic in Locrian except Bb should be minor, but it's common to use the major variant. 

In educational contexts, this would be identified as G Locrian. 

So final answer: Key = G, Mode = Locrian.

Based on the chord progression provided—**Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**—the key and mode can be determined by analyzing the harmonic function, bass movement, and scale degrees. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **1. Harmonic Analysis: Core Observations**
- **Gdim (G-B♭-D♭)** dominates the progression (10 out of 16 chords), functioning as a recurring tonic substitute. This is a strong indicator that **G is the tonal center**.
- **Bass movement is G-centric**: The bass note is **G for 14/16 chords** (all instances except `Bbm/F` and `Dbmaj7/F`, where the bass is F). This G pedal emphasizes G as the root.
- **Other chords are major triads with altered bass**:
  - `Eb/G` = E♭ major over G bass (notes: G, E♭, B♭).
  - `Bbm/F` = B♭ major over F bass (notes: F, B♭, D).
  - `Ab/G` = A♭ major over G bass (notes: G, A♭, C, E♭).
  - `Dbmaj7/F` = D♭ major 7th over F bass (notes: F, D♭, A♭, C).
- **Critical notes in the harmony**:
  - G (tonic emphasis), B♭ (minor 3rd), D♭ (diminished 5th), E♭ (minor 6th), F (minor 7th), A♭ (minor 9th), C (11th), D natural (from `Bbm/F`).

The full note collection is: **G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, D natural, E♭, F**.  
This forms the **G half-whole diminished scale** (a.k.a. **G Locrian ♯2** or the **7th mode of A♭ melodic minor**), but with one alteration: **D natural** instead of D♭ in `Bbm/F`. This D natural is a chromatic inflection (common in jazz/contemporary harmony) but does not change the underlying mode.

---

### **2. Why G Locrian?**
- **Locrian mode** is defined by:  
  **1 (root), ♭2, ♭3, 4, ♭5, ♭6, ♭7**.  
  For **G Locrian**: **G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F**.
- **Chord alignment with G Locrian**:
  | Chord       | Notes       | Function in G Locrian                     | Diatonic? |
  |-------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|
  | **Gdim**    | G-B♭-D♭    | **i°** (tonic diminished triad)           | ✅        |
  | **Eb/G**    | G-E♭-B♭-?  | **♭VI** (E♭ major = b6 triad)             | ✅        |
  | **Bbm/F**   | F-B♭-D     | **♭III** (B♭ triad, *altered to major* via D natural) | ⚠️ (D natural = chromatic inflection; diatonic would be B♭ minor) |
  | **Ab/G**    | G-A♭-C-E♭  | **♭II** (A♭ major = b2 triad)             | ✅        |
  | **Dbmaj7/F**| F-D♭-A♭-C  | **♭V** (D♭ major 7th = b5 triad + diatonic 7th) | ✅        |

- **Gdim as the tonic**: Locrian is the **only mode where the tonic chord is diminished** (i°). This matches the progression's heavy reliance on Gdim as the "home base."
- **G Pedal as reinforcement**: The consistent G bass (even under non-G chords like `Eb/G` and `Ab/G`) anchors G as the tonal center, despite the dissonance of Gdim.
- **Chromatic Bbm/F exception**: The B♭ major chord (`Bbm/F`) uses **D natural** (instead of the diatonic D♭), creating a major triad on ♭III. This is a **common jazz/pop alteration** (e.g., borrowing from G Dorian or harmonic minor for brightness) but doesn't override the Locrian framework. The progression still resolves toward Gdim/G, maintaining tonal gravity.

---

### **3. Why Not Other Keys/Modes?**
- **G Minor (Aeolian)**: 
  - Tonic chord should be **G minor (G-B♭-D)**, not Gdim (G-B♭-D♭). The D♭ (vs. D natural) confirms it's not minor.
  - B♭ major (♭III) is atypical; G minor expects B♭ minor (ii°).
- **G Phrygian**: 
  - Requires E♭ (♭3) but lacks D♭ (♭5) and dominant ♭II (A♭) usage.
  - Tonic chord would be G minor, not diminished.
- **C Minor (relative)**: 
  - Gdim = vii° of C, but C minor's tonic (Cm) is absent. The G pedal contradicts C as the center.
  - B♭ major would be V (but C minor expects Gm or G7 for V).
- **E♭ Major**: 
  - Gdim = vii° of E♭, but E♭ major's tonic (E♭) isn't emphasized (bass is G, not E♭).
  - B♭ major should be V of E♭, but it appears as `Bbm/F` with F bass, not dominant functionality.

---

### **4. How the Progression Works in G Locrian**
- **Tonic instability**: G Locrian's diminished tonic (Gdim) creates inherent tension, common in dark/mysterious jazz, film scores, or metal (e.g., "Crazy Train" riff uses Locrian).
- **Functional harmony**: 
  - `Gdim` → `Eb/G` = i° → ♭VI (submediant descent).
  - `Gdim` → `Bbm/F` → `Ab/G` = i° → ♭III → ♭II (chromatic approach to ♭II).
  - `Dbmaj7/F` → `Gdim` = ♭V → i° (tritone resolution; D♭ to G is a tritone, but the F bass smooths the cadence).
- **Scale usage**: Melodies here would use **G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F** (e.g., G diminished arpeggios or scalar runs), with D natural as a passing tone in the B♭ chord.

---

### **Conclusion: Key and Mode**
- **Key: G**  
  (Tonal center confirmed by pedal tone, chord resolutions, and diminished tonic).
- **Mode: Locrian**  
  (The only mode where the tonic chord is diminished, and all non-Gdim chords fit diatonically except for a jazz-influenced alteration on ♭III).

This progression is a **modern jazz/classical usage of G Locrian** (7th mode of A♭ melodic minor), leveraging chromaticism for color while maintaining G as the unresolved tonic. The D natural in `Bbm/F` is a deliberate major triad substitution but doesn't alter the mode—Locrian is defined by its structure, not rigid chord diatonicy.  

💡 **Listen for**: The "unstable" Gdim tonic and the smooth descent from F bass (`Dbmaj7/F`) back to Gdim, creating a cyclical, unresolved feel.

**Assistant - Qwen 235B**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F Ab/G
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

---

### Step 1: List the Chords and Their Notes

First, let's break down each chord into its **pitch content**.

#### 1. **Gdim (G diminished)**  
- G, Bb, Db

#### 2. **Eb/G (Eb major with G in bass)**  
- Eb, G, Bb

#### 3. **Bbm/F (Bb minor with F in bass)**  
- Bb, Db, F  
(Note: this is first inversion of Bb minor)

#### 4. **Ab/G (Ab major with G in bass)**  
- Ab, C, Eb (chord) + G (bass)  
→ Notes: Ab, C, Eb, G

#### 5. **Dbmaj7/F (Db major 7 with F in bass)**  
- Db, F, Ab, C (chord) + F (bass)  
→ Notes: Db, F, Ab, C

---

### Step 2: Collect All the Notes Used

From all chords:
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb
- Bbm/F: Bb, Db, F
- Ab/G: Ab, C, Eb, G
- Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C

So all **unique pitches**:
- G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C

List: **C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**

That’s:
- C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭

Sorted: C, Db, D#, E, F, G, A, Bb? Wait — better use consistent naming.

Actually, using enharmonics:
- Db = C#
But better to pick a key signature.

Wait: Notes are:
- C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

So:  
**C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**

These are the **same as the notes of C Phrygian**?

Let’s check:

### Step 3: Compare to Scales (Modes)

Try **C minor** (natural minor):  
C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb → yes, includes all except **Db**

But we have **Db**, which is not in C natural minor.

Wait — we have **C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**

That’s **8 notes**? No:

List again:
- C
- Db
- Eb
- F
- G
- Ab
- Bb

That’s 7 distinct notes: **C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**

This is the **Db major scale** transposed?

Check Db major:  
Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

Compare:
Our notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

So:
- F is natural, not Gb
- G is natural, not Gb

So not Db major.

But we have **F natural** and **G natural**, not Gb.

So not in Db major.

We have:
- F
- G
- Ab

So no Gb, but **G natural**.

That means: **F# is absent**, **Gb is absent**, but **G natural** is present.

So G natural is **#11 of Db**, or...

Wait — look at Eb major:
Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D

We don’t have D — we have **Db**, not D.

So not Eb major.

Ab major: Ab, Bb, C, D, E, F, G  
We have Db instead of D — so **Db**, not D → not Ab major.

How about **Bb Phrygian**?

Bb Phrygian = mode of Gb major  
Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab

Cb is B, which we don’t have — no B or Cb. We have **C natural**, so not.

Try **G Phrygian**?

G Phrygian = mode of Eb major  
G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

We have:
- G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

We have **Db**, not **D natural**

So D is missing, **Db** is present → not G Phrygian.

Wait — we have **Db**, not D.

So it's **flattened 2nd**, like a Phrygian flavor.

Try **C Phrygian**?

C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Our notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

→ **Exact match!**

C Phrygian:  
C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

Yes — all notes in progression are within **C Phrygian**.

---

### Step 4: Check Chord Harmonizations in C Phrygian

C Phrygian is the **3rd mode of Ab major**:
Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Degrees:  
1: Ab  
2: Bb  
3: C → tonic of Phrygian  
4: Db  
5: Eb  
6: F  
7: G

So in **C Phrygian**, the diatonic chords are built on C using only these notes.

Let’s see if the chords fit:

- **Gdim (G, Bb, Db)** → G is 7th degree, Bb is 2nd, Db is 4th. So G-Bb-Db = diminished triad on 7th degree of Ab major → **vii° of Ab**, which is **vii° of the parent major**, but in C Phrygian, it's the **bII°** chord? Wait.

In **C Phrygian**, scale: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb

So triads:
- C: C, Eb, G → Cm
- Db: Db, F, Ab → Db major
- Eb: Eb, G, Bb → Eb major
- F: F, Ab, C → Fm
- G: G, Bb, Db → G diminished → this is **ii° chord** in C Phrygian? No:

Wait:

In C Phrygian:
- Degree 1: C – C, Eb, G → Cm
- Degree 2: Db – Db, F, Ab → **Db major**
- Degree 3: Eb – Eb, Bb → Eb major
- Degree 4: F – F, Ab, C → Fm
- Degree 5: G – G, Bb, Db → **Gdim**
- Degree 6: Ab – Ab, C, Eb → Ab major
- Degree 7: Bb – Bb, Db, F → Bbm

So in **C Phrygian**, the **v chord is Gdim**, not G minor.

But Gdim is not a stable tonic chord — yet it appears repeatedly.

Now check each chord:

- **Gdim** → G, Bb, Db → degrees 5, b7, b2 of C Phrygian? No:
  - G = 5th
  - Bb = b7
  - Db = b9 (or #11 relative to G?) — actually in C Phrygian, this chord is diatonic: G (5), Bb (b7), Db (b9 relative to G)

But Gdim is built from scale degrees: 5, b7, b2 (Db) — but in tertian harmony, Gdim is G-Bb-Db — all in C Phrygian. So yes, **vii° of Ab**, which is diatonic.

But in **C Phrygian**, this is chord on **5th degree** — so **v° chord**, but normally in minor modes, we expect minor v, but here it's diminished due to the Db.

So **Gdim is the v° chord in C Phrygian** — unusual because Phrygian usually has a more static tonic.

But here, the chord progression revolves around **Gdim**, not C.

Wait — the progression starts and ends on **Gdim**, and Eb/G appears often.

So maybe the key center is **G**?

But Gdim is not a tonal center — diminished chords are unstable.

But repeated Gdim could suggest **G as tonic** with a Phrygian or diminished character.

Alternatively, could this be **G half-diminished or G locrian**?

Try **G Locrian**? (Bb major mode)

G Locrian: G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F

We have **Db**, not D — D is not in our set. We have **Db**, so not G Locrian.

We have Db, not C# or D.

So not.

Back: all chords are made of notes from **C Phrygian**.

But now, let's look at bass motion.

### Step 5: Bass Line Analysis

Sequence of bass notes:
- Gdim → G
- Eb/G → G
- Gdim → G
- Bbm/F → F
- Ab/G → G
- Gdim → G
- Dbmaj7/F → F
- Gdim → G

So bass:  
G, G, G, G,  
G, G, F, G,  
G, G, G, G,  
G, G, F, G

So mostly **G** in the bass, with **F** appearing under Bbm and Dbmaj7.

So **pedal tone on G**? Suggests **G** is important.

Now, harmonic motion:

Chords:
1. Gdim
2. Eb/G
3. Gdim
4. Bbm/F
5. Ab/G
6. Dbmaj7/F
7. Gdim

So harmonic rhythm: oscillation between Gdim and Eb/G, then Bbm/F, Ab/G, then Dbmaj7/F, back to Gdim.

Let’s see functional roles **if G is tonic**.

But Gdim is not stable. However, **G** as a pitch is central.

But we have **Eb/G**, **Ab/G**, **Dbmaj7/F** (has C, so G7sus? No).

Wait — let's see **Ab/G** → Ab triad over G → that's **Gsus-b9 no 5th?** or G7sus(b9)?

Ab/G = Ab, C, Eb + G → G, Ab, C, Eb → G7sus(b9) — missing fifth (D), but close.

Similarly, Eb/G = Eb, G, Bb → G, Bb, Eb → **Gm7 no 5th?** or G diminished with Eb?

G, Bb, Eb → that’s **Gm7(b5)** without D? No — Gm7(b5) is G Bb Db F.

But here: G, Bb, Eb → G + Eb is b5? No — Eb is b5 of G? G to Eb is minor 6th.

Intervals from G:
- G to Bb = minor third
- G to Eb = minor sixth (or augmented fifth?)

Wait — Eb is enharmonic to D#, which would be augmented 5th, but we’re in flat key.

In G, perfect 5th is D, so Eb is **#5**.

So G, Bb, Eb → **Gm(#5)** or G augmented? No — augmented is G, B, Eb.

Here it’s G, Bb, Eb → so **minor third**, **#5th** → **Gm(#5)**

But unusual.

Gdim = G, Bb, Db

So we see:
- Gdim → G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G → G, Bb, Eb

So only **Db vs Eb** — differs by one note.

So two chords: G-Bb-Db vs G-Bb-Eb

So it's like a chromatic movement between **Db and Eb** in the third voice.

Similarly, later: Bbm/F = F, Bb, Db
Ab/G = G, Ab, C, Eb
Dbmaj7/F = F, Ab, C, Db → F, Ab, C, Db (Fm with Db bass? No — chord is Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C over F)

So bass F, chord Dbmaj7 → F, G, Ab, C, Db possible.

But back to tonal center.

Notice that **Eb/G** and **Ab/G** and **Gdim** all contain **G and Bb** — like a G minor tonal area.

But the 5th (D) is missing — replaced by Db or Eb.

Also, the **Dbmaj7/F** is interesting: Db, F, Ab, C — that’s **IMaj7 of Db major**.

Similarly, **Ab/G** is Ab chord over G.

**Eb/G** is Eb over G.

So chords: Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F

Let’s see roots:
- G
- Eb
- Bb
- Ab
- Db

So roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db

What key has all these?

Look at **Ab major**: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G — yes! All those roots are in Ab major.

Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, G — all diatonic.

So roots are: G (7), Eb (5), Bb (2), Ab (1), Db (4)

So: 7, 5, 2, 1, 4 of **Ab major**

G = 7, Eb = 5, Bb = 2, Ab = 1, Db = 4

So the roots move:  
G (vii), Eb (V), Bb (ii), Ab (I), Db (IV)

Then back to G (vii)

But G is **Gdim**, which is **vii° of Ab** — very common.

So **this progression is in Ab major**, but with **Gdim as a predominant chord**, and the bass is often G or F.

But the overall tonal center might still be **Ab**, but the piece starts and ends on Gdim — so maybe **not**.

But **Gdim is the leading tone chord of Ab**, so it **resolves to Ab** — which it does in the last line: Dbmaj7/F → Gdim, but doesn't resolve to Ab.

Wait — last chord is Gdim — doesn't resolve.

But earlier we have Ab/G — that's Ab chord over G — so Ab with G in bass — that's **Ab6 or Gm13(no5,9)?**

Ab/G = G, Ab, C, Eb → so it contains Ab chord with G — so **Ab6** (Ab, C, Eb, G) — yes, **Ab6**

Similarly, **Dbmaj7** is IV in Ab.

So chords:
- Gdim = vii° of Ab
- Eb/G = V of Ab (with G in bass)
- Bbm/F = ii6 of Ab
- Ab/G = I6 of Ab
- Dbmaj7 = IV of Ab

So all chords are diatonic to **Ab major**!

Let’s recheck:
- Gdim = G, Bb, Db → yes in Ab
- Eb/G = Eb, G, Bb → yes
- Bbm/F = Bb, Db, F → Bb minor — ii in Ab? Wait: in Ab major, ii is **Bb minor**? Yes: Bb, D, F — wait! D natural?

Problem: **Bbm** = Bb, **D**, F — but we don’t have **D natural** in our set!

We have **Db**, not D.

So **Bbm = Bb, D, F** — but we have **Bb, Db, F** — that’s **Bb dim or Bb minor with Db?**

Bb, Db, F → Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third → so **Bb minor with flat 5?** No — Bb, Db, F is **Bb diminished triad**, not Bb minor.

But the chord is labeled **Bbm/F** — which implies **Bb minor** — Bb, D, F — but **D natural** is not in our chord.

From earlier: Bbm/F — Bb minor over F — but if Bb minor is Bb, D, F — but we don’t have D.

But from pitch analysis: Bbm/F has **Db**, not D — so it's **Bb diminished**, not Bb minor.

Is that a mistake?

Wait — let's double-check: in the sequence, is it **Bbm/F** or just a voicing?

The user wrote: **Bbm/F** — likely meaning a Bb minor chord with F in bass.

But Bb minor = Bb, D, F — requires **D natural**.

But earlier, we established all chords use only: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb — **no D natural**.

So if there's **Bbm/F**, and it's truly Bb minor, it would have D, not Db — but D is not in any other chord.

Contradiction.

Unless **Bbm/F** is actually **Bbdim/F** — Bb, Db, F — which is a **diminished triad**.

But user wrote **Bbm/F**, not Bbdim/F.

Similarly, **Gdim** has **Db**, not D.

So likely, the chord **Bbm/F** is actually **Bbdim/F** — a common chord in Ab major.

Because in **Ab major**, the diatonic chords are:
- I: Ab
- ii°: Bbdim
- iii: Cm
- IV: Db
- V: Eb
- vi: Fm
- vii°: Gdim

So both **Bbdim** and **Gdim** are diatonic diminished chords.

So likely, **Bbm/F** is a typo or mislabel — it should be **Bbdim/F** or just interpreted as Bb diminished.

Similarly, the chord has Bb, Db, F — which is **Bbdim**, not Bbm.

So assuming that correction, all chords are **diatonic to Ab major**.

Now check:
- Gdim = vii° of Ab
- Eb/G = V6 of Ab
- Bbdim/F = ii°6 of Ab
- Ab/G = I6 of Ab
- Dbmaj7 = IVmaj7 of Ab

All make perfect sense in **Ab major**.

But the progression starts and ends on Gdim, not Ab.

But Gdim is the **vii° chord**, which is highly unstable and leads to I.

But here, it’s used as a pedal or ostinato.

The presence of **Ab/G** (I6) suggests **Ab is tonic**, but it’s not emphasized.

The long stretches on Gdim and Eb/G suggest a **modal** or **static** harmony rather than functional.

Moreover, the repeated Gdim may give a **Phrygian flavor** — because Phrygian has a **b2** (Bb in C Phrygian? Wait).

But in **Ab major**, G is the **7th**, and Gdim has **Ab (b9)?** no.

Wait — **Gdim** (G, Bb, Db) over G — has **G and Bb and Db**

In the context of **Ab major**, Bb is the 2nd, Db is the 4th.

But the semitone between G and Ab (not present) is implied.

But the chord Gdim acts like a **vii°**, wanting to resolve to I.

Yet, it doesn't — it goes to Eb/G, which is V.

So the function is:

Gdim (vii°) → Eb/G (V6) → Gdim → Bbdim → Ab/G (I6) → Gdim

But Bbdim is also a diminished chord.

So it's a chain of diminished and applied dominants.

But simpler: all chords are in **Ab major**, and the progression is **chromatically tinged** but diatonic.

But the tonal center feels like **G**, due to bass.

But G is not tonic — it's a passing chord.

Alternatively, if we hear **G** as tonic, then the scale must include Db, Eb, etc.

Try **G Phrygian**: G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F — but we have **Db**, not D.

So no.

Unless it’s **G altered scale** or **diminished**, but too many major chords.

Best fit: **Ab major**, with **Gdim** used as a pedal point chord.

But the **Dbmaj7** is IV, Ab/G is I, so **Ab is the tonic**.

But it's not cadencing to Ab.

The progression is more **modal** — perhaps **C Phrygian**, as earlier.

Wait — let's hear it differently.

Suppose the key is **C Phrygian**.

- Gdim = v° chord (G, Bb, Db) — very tense, not typical
- Eb/G = bIII6 — common in Phrygian
- Bbm/F = iv6 — Bb minor = iv in C Phrygian (Bb, Db, F) — but again, Bb minor is Bb, D, F — not Db

Same problem: if chord is Bb, Db, F, it's **Bb diminished**, not Bb minor.

So unless we accept it as **diminished**, it's not in C Phrygian either.

But in C Phrygian, scale: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb — so Bb, Db, F are all in scale, so Bb diminished is diatonic.

In C Phrygian, the iv chord is **Bbdim** (Bb, Db, F), not Bbm.

But user wrote **Bbm/F**, which implies minor.

### Conclusion on Chord Label

Likely, **Bbm/F** is a mislabel or shorthand — in context, it's **Bbdim/F**, or the chord is Bb, Db, F.

Similarly, the scale allows it.

Now, in **C Phrygian**:
- Gdim = v°
- Eb/G = bIII6
- Bbdim/F = iv°6
- Ab/G = bVI6
- Dbmaj7 = bIImaj7

Dbmaj7 is bII in C — very characteristic of Phrygian mode.

Ab/G is bVI6 — also common in Phrygian.

Gdim is less common as a tonic, but could be v°.

But the bass is G — 5th of C.

Not typical.

However, the chord **Dbmaj7/F** is bII, which is a hallmark of **Phrygian cadence**: bII-I.

But here it's Dbmaj7 to Gdim, not to C.

But if the tonic is C, we never hear a C chord.

We have no C-minor chord.

So tonic is not established.

Alternatively, the progression is in **Ab major**, and the Gdim is used for color.

But the repeated Gdim and lack of resolution to Ab suggest **not**.

Another idea: perhaps the key is **G half-diminished**, but no.

### Final Assessment

The notes are: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb — which is **C Phrygian**.

The chords, when accepting Bbm/F as Bbdim/F (Bb, Db, F), are diatonic to C Phrygian.

The harmony features **bII (Db)** and **bVI (Ab)** and **bIII (Eb)** — all characteristic of Phrygian.

The bass on G may be a pedal, but the tonal center could be **C**, implied.

The last chord is Gdim, but that may not be the tonic.

Perhaps it's a vamp in C Phrygian with emphasis on the v chord.

But more likely: **the mode is C Phrygian**, with a non-resolving progression.

Alternatively, **Ab major**, but the frequent Gdim and lack of strong V-I motion suggest modal.

Given the use of **Dbmaj7** (bII) is a signature Phrygian chord, and the flat 2nd (Db) is prominent, this suggests **Phrygian mode**.

And the tonic is likely **C**, even if not stated.

But the bass is G, so perhaps it’s **G altered** or something.

Another possibility: **E-flat Phrygian**?

Eb Phrygian: Eb, Fb (E), Gb (F), Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db

We have G natural, not Gb — so no.

Not.

So back to **C Phrygian**.

### Final Answer:

**Key: C**  
**Mode: Phrygian**

- Scale: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb
- All chords use only these notes.
- Characteristic Phrygian chords: bII (Db), bIII (Eb), bVI (Ab)
- The bass on G is a pedal or non-tonic note.
- Despite Gdim starting/ending, the chord material and modal flavor point to C Phrygian.

**Answer: The key is C, mode is Phrygian.**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode. Hmm, let's see. First, I need to analyze these chords to figure out the key signature and any modes involved.

Starting with the chords. Let's list them out clearly. Gdim, which is G diminished (G, Bb, Db). Then Eb/G, which is E flat over G. So the root is E flat, but with G in the bass. So Eb minor or Eb major? Wait, Eb/G. But diminished chords are usually minor. Wait, Gdim is G diminished, so G, Bb, Db. Eb/G is probably Eb minor with G as bass note? Or maybe Eb major with G bass? But Eb major has G natural? No, Eb major is Eb, G, Bb. So Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So if it's Eb/G, that would be Eb major with G in the bass. But sometimes the slash chords can indicate bass notes regardless of the chord type.

Wait, but the user wrote Eb/G. So the chord is Eb, but with G in the bass. So the chord itself is Eb major, because Eb major has G. Alternatively, if it were Eb minor, it would be Eb, Gb, Bb, so Eb/G would be Eb minor with G natural? No, that's not right. G natural would be enharmonic. Let's clarify.

Diminished chords: Gdim is G, Bb, Db. The next is Eb/G. So the root is Eb, but the bass note is G. So the chord is Eb major? Let's see: Eb major scale is Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. So the Eb major triad is Eb, G, Bb. So yes, Eb/G would be an inversion of Eb major, with G in the bass. Similarly, Dbmaj7/F would be Db major 7 with F in the bass. So Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C. So Dbmaj7/F would have F as bass note.

Let me list all the chords with their possible structures:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G: Eb major in first inversion (since Eb is root, G is third, Bb fifth. So Bass G, so chord tones are G, Bb, Eb? Wait, no. When we say Eb/G, the chord is Eb major with G as the bass note. So the notes would be G, Eb, Bb. Because Eb major is Eb, G, Bb. So when written as Eb/G, it's Eb major with G in the bass. So the notes are G (bass), then Eb and Bb above.

Similarly, Bbm/F: Bb minor with F in bass. Bb minor chord is Bb, Db, F. So with F in bass, it's F, Bb, Db.

Ab/G: Ab major? Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. So Ab/G would be G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait, Ab major chord is Ab, C, Eb. So if it's Ab/G, that's Ab major with G in bass. But G is not in Ab major. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's Ab major chord with G as the bass, but that would create a different chord. Wait, maybe Ab/G is actually a G dominant 7th or something else? Let me check.

Wait, Ab major triad is Ab, C, Eb. If the bass is G, then the notes would be G, Ab, C, Eb. That's G minor 7th flat 5 or something? Wait, G, Ab, C, Eb. Let's see: G to Ab is minor second, which is unusual. Usually chord symbols use the root of the chord. Maybe Ab/G is a slash chord where the chord is Ab, and G is the bass. But maybe the actual chord is a G altered chord? Wait, but typically, a slash chord is named root bass, so Ab/G is Ab chord with G bass. But Ab major doesn't contain G. So that might be a bit non-standard. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe "Ab/G" is actually a G7 with Ab? Hmm. Wait, G7 chord is G, B, D, F. But Ab is the minor second above G. That might form a G7b9 or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user intended Ab/G as a chord where Ab is the root and G is bass. But that's odd, because Ab normally has Gb in the scale. Hmm. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps these are just chord symbols where the slash indicates the bass note. So the actual chord is written on the left, bass on the right. So for example, Eb/G is Eb chord with G in bass. So the chord quality for Eb is major? Because Eb major triad has G. Similarly, Bbm/F: Bbm is Bb minor chord with F in bass. Yes, Bb minor chord is Bb, Db, F. So F is the fifth, so Bbm/F is the chord in second inversion.

But then Ab/G: Ab major chord? But Ab major triad is Ab, C, Eb. So if we have G in bass, then the chord would be G, Ab, C, Eb. So maybe that's a G7b9 or G9? Wait, G7b9 would have G, B, D, F, Ab. Wait, but in the context here, if Ab/G is Ab chord over G, then G is bass. So the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. So G, Ab, C, Eb. That would be a G7b9 chord? Because G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab. Wait, but here we have G, Ab, C, Eb. So maybe G, Ab, C, Eb would be different. Let's see: the notes G, Ab, C, Eb. From G's perspective: Ab is b9, C is 11th, Eb is b13 or minor 7th? No, C is a 4th, Eb is minor 7th. Wait, G minor 7th chord is G, Bb, D, F. Wait, but this chord has Ab instead of Bb. So G, Ab, C, Eb. Hmm. The intervals: G to Ab is minor second, which is the same as augmented unison, but usually in chord symbols, Ab would be called a flat ninth. So if we have a chord with G in bass and Ab as upper tone, that could be a G7b9, but normally G7b9 has B natural? No, G7 (dominant 7th) is G, B, D, F. So G7b9 would be G, Bb (since b9 is Ab? Wait, no: B is the major third, b9 would be Ab. So G7b9 chord is G, Bb, D, F, Ab? Wait, but a dominant 7th chord has minor seventh, so F, and b9 would be Ab. But the standard G7 chord is G, B, D, F. Then the b9 is Ab. So yes: G, A (for 9th), but b9 would be Ab. So the chord tones for G7b9 are G, B, D, F, Ab. But in our case, the chord has notes G (bass), Ab, C, Eb. Wait, that's G, Ab, C, Eb. So root G, b9 (Ab), 11th (C), minor 7th (Eb). But usually the 11th is not used like that, but maybe. Alternatively, maybe the chord is Eb minor major 7 or something else? Let's check.

Alternatively, maybe the Ab/G is intended as Ab chord with G in bass, so Ab major triad plus G bass. So Ab, C, Eb plus G. So notes: G, Ab, C, Eb. Which is G minor 7th flat 5? Wait, G minor 7th is G Bb D F. But here it's G Ab C Eb. If we think of it as a G chord over Ab, but that's complicated. Hmm. Maybe it's better to treat each slash chord as root with bass note, regardless of whether the bass note is in the chord. So in Ab/G, the chord is Ab with G bass. So the chord itself is Ab major, but bass note is G. So the actual notes would be G (bass), then Ab, C, Eb for Ab major triad. So yes, G, Ab, C, Eb. But that's not a standard triad, but a quartal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the chord is actually a G diminished or something else. This is confusing. Let me see other parts.

Next, Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th chord with F in bass. Db major 7th is Db, F, Ab, C. So Dbmaj7/F would be F, Db, Ab, C. So F, C, Db, Ab. So the bass is F, then Db above. That's okay.

So putting all together:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db
- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (Eb major triad with G bass)
- Eb/G again: same
- Gdim again
- Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db (Bb minor triad with F bass)
- Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb? Or Ab chord with G bass? Let's note it as Ab chord with G in bass, so notes G, Ab, C, Eb.
- Gdim again
- Eb/G again
- Eb/G again
- Gdim
- Gdim
- Dbmaj7/F: F, Db, Ab, C (Dbmaj7 with F bass)
- Gdim

Now, trying to figure out the key. Let's see the notes present. Let's list all notes from all chords.

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb

Eb/G again same as above.

Bbm/F: Bb minor is Bb, Db, F. With F bass, so F, Bb, Db.

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb

Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C with F bass, so F, Db, Ab, C.

So compiling all unique notes from all chords:

G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C. Wait, from Gdim: G, Bb, Db.

Eb/G has G, Eb, Bb.

Bbm/F has F, Bb, Db.

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb.

Dbmaj7/F: F, Db, Ab, C.

So all notes present:

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So these are the notes of Db major scale, but let's check:

Db major scale is Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. Wait, but here we have G natural, not Gb. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the notes we have are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, in Db major, the scale is Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. But Gb is different from G. So the presence of G natural (G) in the chords suggests that it's not Db major. Because Db major would have Gb, not G.

Hmm, this is a problem. Let's check again. Are there any Gs in the chords? Yes, Gdim includes G natural. So G natural is present. But Db major scale has Gb, so the presence of G natural would be a chromatic note.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Bb minor? Wait, let's see. Let's list all pitch classes in the chords:

From chords:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db

Eb/G: Eb, Bb, G

Bbm/F: Bb, Db, F

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb

Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C

So all notes:

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Yes. Now, let's arrange these in order: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

This is the scale of Db major? But Db major has Gb, not G. So instead of Gb, we have G natural here. So this would be Db melodic minor or something? Let's check.

Alternatively, maybe it's Eb minor? Eb minor scale: Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db? Wait, no. Natural Eb minor is Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db? Wait, no. Standard minor scales. Eb natural minor would be Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. But that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's Bb Phrygian?

Wait, let's look at the chord progression. Since there are Gdim, which is diminished, and Dbmaj7, which is a major 7th. The presence of a lot of diminished chords suggests maybe a mode starting with a diminished chord.

Alternatively, maybe this key is Db, but with a G natural instead of Gb. Wait, that would be the Db major scale but with G natural instead of Gb. Which would be the same as C harmonic minor? Let's check.

C harmonic minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. But our notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So that's similar but not the same. C harmonic minor has Db (same as C#), no, actually C harmonic minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B natural.

Wait, our set of notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So let's see: Db is enharmonic to C#; Ab is G#; Bb is A#. Not sure. Alternatively, if we consider this as a mode of a scale. Let's see.

Another approach: find the tonic or home chord. Diminished chords often function as passing or leading tone chords. But Gdim—since G is the root of the diminished chord, perhaps G is the tonic? But Gdim chord in a key would usually be the vii° in minor, but here we have a lot of other chords.

Wait, let's see possible keys. Let's list the chords again:

Gdim (G, Bb, Db)

Eb/G (Eb major with G bass: notes G, Eb, Bb)

Bbm/F (Bb minor with F bass: F, Bb, Db)

Ab/G (G, Ab, C, Eb)

Dbmaj7/F (Db, F, Ab, C with F bass: F, Db, Ab, C)

Wait, maybe we can think of Db as the tonic. Let's see: if key is Db major, then the chords would be:

I: Db

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

VI: Bbm

VII: Cdim

But in our progression, we have Gdim, which would be the vii° in Db major, but Db major's vii° is Cdim. So Gdim isn't part of Db major. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the key is Bb minor. Let's see. Bb natural minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab.

Chords in Bb minor:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

bIII: Db

IV: Eb

v: Fm

bVI: Gb

bVII: Ab

But our chords have Gdim, which isn't present in Bb minor. G natural is outside.

Wait, Bb harmonic minor: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A natural. So Bb harmonic minor has A natural. So chords would include V major: F, A, C. But our chords don't have A natural, but we have G natural. Let's check our notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So yes, G natural is present. So perhaps key of Bb harmonic minor, but with a flattened 6th? Wait, Bb harmonic minor has A natural. So the notes would be Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. But in our chord progression, we have Ab (which is G#?), wait no. Ab is the same as G# in enharmonic, but usually named based on key.

Wait, if we have Ab in the chords (e.g., Ab/G), that's A flat. So in terms of key, if Bb harmonic minor has Ab? Wait, Bb harmonic minor scale: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A natural. So no Ab. So Ab would be G#? Wait, confusion here.

Wait, Ab is the same as G#, but in standard naming, it's Ab. So if we have both Ab and G in the chords, then it's conflicting.

Wait, our chord progression includes Ab (in Ab/G) and G natural (Gdim). So both G natural and Ab (which is A flat) are present. So G natural and Ab are different notes. So that's nine notes? No, wait, G natural is different from Ab. Ab is a half step lower than A natural. G natural is the note before Ab. So G and Ab are adjacent, a half step apart.

Wait, if we have both G natural and Ab in the scale, then it's possible. Let's see. If our scale has C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, that's seven notes. So:

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Let's check the intervals between them:

C to Db: half step

Db to Eb: whole step

Eb to F: whole

F to G: whole

G to Ab: half step

Ab to Bb: whole

Bb to C: whole? Wait, no: if it's a scale, then from Bb back to C would be a half step? Wait, but if we list these notes in order:

C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Then Bb to C is a half step. So this scale is C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C.

Let's see what scale that is. It's a scale with two half steps: between C-Db, G-Ab, and Bb-C. Wait, no: intervals:

C to Db: 1/2

Db to Eb: 1 whole

Eb to F: 1 whole

F to G: 1 whole

G to Ab: 1/2

Ab to Bb: 1 whole

Bb to C: 1/2

So this scale has three half-steps: between C-Db, G-Ab, Bb-C. That seems unusual. Let's compare to known scales.

Alternatively, maybe it's Phrygian with extra flattening? Or something else.

Wait, if we consider the scale degrees:

1: C

b2: Db

b3: Eb

4: F

5: G

b6: Ab

b7: Bb

So this would be C Phrygian? But C Phrygian is C Db Eb F G Ab Bb. Yes! That's exactly it.

C Phrygian mode. Let's check.

Phrygian mode: 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7.

Yes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Which matches all the notes present in the chords. Let's confirm each note:

C, Db (same as B#), Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Yes, exactly.

So all the notes from the chords fit into C Phrygian mode. Let's check each chord:

Gdim: G, Bb, Db. G is 5th, Bb is b7, Db is b2. Wait, in C Phrygian, the fifth scale degree is G. The chord built on G: G, Bb, Db. Which in the Phrygian mode would be G minor 7 flat 5? Wait, no. Let's see:

In C Phrygian:

C (1), Db (b2), Eb (b3), F (4), G (5), Ab (b6), Bb (b7)

So chords:

i: Cm (C, Eb, G)

ii°: Dbdim (Db, F, Ab)

III: Eb (Eb, G, Bb)

IV: Fm (F, Ab, C)

v: Gdim (G, Bb, Db) – yes! Because G is the fifth degree (G), then next chord tones: Bb (b7 from C, but for G as root, Bb is minor third, Db is diminished fifth). So Gdim chord is the vii° in C Phrygian? Wait, no.

Wait, chord built on G in C Phrygian:

G (root), Bb (minor third), Db (diminished fifth), so yes, G diminished triad. So Gdim is the v° chord in C Phrygian. Because the fifth degree chord in Phrygian is diminished.

Similarly, Eb/G: Eb major chord (Eb, G, Bb). In C Phrygian, Eb is the third degree. The chord built on Eb: Eb minor? Wait, in C Phrygian:

Chord on Eb: Eb, G, Bb. Eb to G is major third? Eb to G is a major third (three half steps: Eb-E-F-F#-G), yes. So Eb major triad. But the scale has Eb as b3. So chord on Eb in Phrygian mode would be major chord? Let's see.

C Phrygian scale: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Triad on Eb: Eb, G, Bb. Because Eb to G is 4 semi-tones (Eb to E is half, E to F whole, F to F# half, F# to G whole? Wait better to count half steps. Eb to E is 1, E to F is 1 half step? No: E to F is half step. So Eb to E is half step (1), E to F another half (total 2), F to F# half, F# to G half. So Eb to G is 4 half steps, which is major third. Then G to Bb is minor third (three half steps). So Eb major triad.

Yes, so in Phrygian mode, the III chord is major. Similarly, chord on C is minor (C Eb G), but here we don't have Cm chord as tonic.

Now, Bbm/F: Bb minor chord. Bb minor is Bb, Db, F. In C Phrygian, Bb is b7 degree. So chord on Bb: Bb, Db, F. Which is minor chord? Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third, so Bb minor. Yes. So Bbm is the vii chord in C Phrygian.

Ab/G: Ab is b6. Chord built on Ab in C Phrygian: Ab, C, Eb. Which is a minor chord? Ab to C is major third? Ab to A natural is half, then A to Bb half, Bb to C whole. So Ab to C is 3 half steps? Wait: Ab to A is 1 half, A to Bb is 1 half (but Bb is different from B natural), wait: Ab to A is half step, A to Bb is a whole step? No, A to Bb is half step. Wait, Ab to A is half, A to Bb is another half. So Ab to Bb is whole step. So better to count:

Ab, A, Bb, B, C. So Ab to C: Ab to A (1), A to Bb (2), Bb to B (3), B to C (4). Wait, no. From Ab to A: +1 semitone. A to Bb: +1 semitone. Bb to B: +1. B to C: +1. Wait, that's four half steps. Which is major third. So Ab to C is major third. C to Eb is minor third. So Ab major triad? (Ab, C, Eb). Wait, Ab to C is major third (4 semitones), then C to Eb is minor third (3 semitones). So yes, Ab major triad. But in C Phrygian, the b6 degree chord is major? Wait, chord built on Ab: Ab, C, Eb. Which is Ab major. Yes.

But in our chord progression, Ab/G is written as Ab/G, meaning Ab chord with G in bass. Which would be G, Ab, C, Eb. Which is part of Ab major triad (Ab, C, Eb) with G added. But G is the 5th in C Phrygian. Hmm.

But maybe the presence of Ab major chord here. Then Dbmaj7/F: Dbmaj7 chord. In C Phrygian, Db is b2. Chord built on Db: Db, F, Ab, C. Which in key of C Phrygian, Db major 7? Db to F is major third (Db-Eb-F: Db to Eb is whole step, Eb to F is half, so Db to F is 3 half steps? No: Db to D is half, D to D# half, D# to E half, E to F half. So Db to F is 4 half steps (major third). Then F to Ab is minor third (F to G whole, G to Ab half, total 3 half steps). Then Ab to C is major third (Ab to A half, A to Bb half, Bb to B half, B to C half: total 4). Wait, no. Ab to C: as before, four half steps. So Dbmaj7 would be Db-F-Ab-C. Which is a major 7th chord. So Db major 7 in C Phrygian.

But in the progression we have Dbmaj7/F, which is Dbmaj7 with F bass. So F, Db, Ab, C. Which fits.

So now, putting all together. If this is in C Phrygian mode, which has the chord progressions we see. Let's check if the tonic is C.

C Phrygian starts on C. The chord progression here: starting with Gdim, then Eb major, etc. But in Phrygian mode, sometimes the tonic is not the first chord. Often the tonic chord is the minor chord on the root. But in this progression, we don't have a C chord. Wait, do we have any C chord? In the Dbmaj7/F chord, there's a C note. In Ab/G chord: G, Ab, C, Eb. So yes, C is present in those chords.

But looking at the chords, is there any indication of C being the tonic? Hmm. Let's see the progression: Gdim-Gdim-Eb/G-Eb/G-Gdim-Gdim-Bbm/F-Ab/G-Gdim-Gdim-Eb/G-Eb/G-Gdim-Gdim-Dbmaj7/F-Gdim.

If we consider the last chord is Gdim, ending on Gdim. But maybe the key centers around C but using Phrygian mode. Let's see.

Another point: in Phrygian mode, there's a characteristic note, which is the b2. Here we have Db, which is the b2 of C. And in the chords, we see chords with Db (like C Phrygian has Db as b2).

Also, looking at the chords:

Gdim – which in C Phrygian is the fifth degree diminished chord (v°). It's often used as a dominant function leading to tonic? But in Phrygian, the v° is diminished, so it might not function as dominant. The vii chord (Bbm) in Phrygian is minor as well.

But maybe the progression is centered around C. Let's see if any chord serves as home chord. If we take the Dbmaj7 chord with F bass, but Dbmaj7 is a major 7th chord in the key of C Phrygian? Wait, Db is the b2. So Dbmaj7 is not diatonic in C major or minor, but it is in C Phrygian. Wait, in C Phrygian, the chords are:

i: Cm

ii°: Dbdim

III: Ebmaj

IV: Fm

v°: Gdim

bVI: Abmaj

bVII: Bbm

So yes, the chords in the progression match this. For example:

Gdim is the v° chord.

Eb/G: Eb major is the III chord.

Bbm/F: Bbm is the bVII chord.

Ab/G: Ab major chord is the bVI chord.

Dbmaj7/F: Db major 7th chord, but in Phrygian mode, Db is b2, and the chord built on Db would be Dbdim. Wait, no. Earlier I thought Dbmaj7 is in the scale, but in C Phrygian, chord built on Db: Db, F, Ab, C. But Db-F is major third, F-Ab minor third, Ab-C major third. So Dbmaj7. But in the natural Phrygian mode scale, the chord on Db would be Dbdim. Wait, confusion here.

Let me calculate the diatonic chords for C Phrygian:

C Phrygian notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Triads:

C: C Eb G → C minor

Db: Db F Ab → Dbdim (since Db to F is 3 semitones, F to Ab is 3 semitones → diminished)

Eb: Eb G Bb → Eb major (Eb to G is 4 semitones; G to Bb 3 → major triad)

F: F Ab C → F minor

G: G Bb Db → Gdim

Ab: Ab C Eb → Ab major

Bb: Bb Db F → Bb minor

Yes. So the Db chord is Dbdim. Not Dbmaj7. Wait, but in the progression, the Dbmaj7/F is present. So Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C. Which is the same as the diatonic diminished chord on Db (Dbdim) but with a major 7th added. Wait, Dbdim would be Db, Fb, Ab, but Fb is E. Hmm. No. Wait, Dbdim chord: diminished triad (root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th). So Db - Fb (E) - Ab. But in our scale, Db to F is major third. Wait, no. Db to F: Db to D is 1 semitone, D to D# 1, D# to Eb 1, Eb to E 1, E to F 1 → total 5 semitones? No.

Wait, better step by step:

Db to Db: 0

Db to D: 1 semitone

D to D#: 2

D# to Eb: 3

Eb to E: 4

E to F: 5 semitones. So Db to F is five semitones, which is a perfect fourth? No. Wait no: from Db to F:

Db, D, D#, Eb, E, F. So Db to D is 1, D to D# is 2, D# to Eb is 3, Eb to E is 4, E to F is 5. So Db to F is five semitones. That's a perfect fourth. Wait, no, in terms of intervals: interval between Db and F is a diminished fifth if Db is root and Fb? Wait, this is confusing.

Actually, the interval from Db to F: Db to E is 3 semitones (Db-D-D#-Eb), then Eb to E is 1 semitone, then E to F is another, so total 4 semitones. Which is a major third. Because Db to F is a major third (four semitones). Yes: Db-D-1, D-D#-2, D#-Eb-3, Eb-E-4. Wait, no, from Db to F: Db to D is +1, D to D# is +2, D# to Eb is +3, Eb to E is +4, E to F is +5. Wait, no, when counting semitones, it's simpler: Db to C# is 1, but better to count steps.

From Db:

Db to D: 1 half step

D to D#: 2

D# to Eb: 3

Eb to E: 4

E to F: 5

So Db to F is 5 half steps. Which is a perfect fourth. Because 5 semitones is a perfect fourth (C to F is perfect fourth, which is five semitones). So Db to F is perfect fourth. But then Db to Ab: Db to Ab is how many semitones? Db to D: 1, D to D#:2, D# to Eb:3, Eb to E:4, E to F:5, F to F#:6, F# to G:7, G to Ab:8. So Db to Ab is 8 semitones, which is a minor sixth. But for chord construction:

For a Db chord in C Phrygian:

The notes are Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, to build a triad on Db: root Db, third is F (since Db to F is 4 semitones? Wait, no. Let's use the scale degrees:

C Phrygian: 1=C, 2=Db, 3=Eb, 4=F, 5=G, 6=Ab, 7=Bb.

So triad on 2 (Db): root Db, third is 4 (F), fifth is 6 (Ab). So Db-F-Ab. Which intervals: Db to F is a major third (since F is the fourth scale degree; in the scale, Db to F is the interval from degree 2 to 4 – which is a major third). F to Ab is minor third (Ab is degree 6; F to Ab is three semitones). So Db, F, Ab makes a diminished triad? Wait, because major third plus minor third equals diminished fifth? No. If root to third is major third (four semitones), root to fifth is a minor sixth? Wait Db to Ab is eight semitones? Wait, Db to Ab:

Db to Db is 0

Db to D → 1

D to D# →2

D# to E♭ →3

E♭ to E →4

E to F →5

F to F# →6

F# to G →7

G to Ab →8 semitones. So Db to Ab is 8 semitones (8 half steps), which is a minor sixth.

But the fifth in a triad should be a perfect fifth from root. A perfect fifth is seven semitones. So Db to Ab is eight semitones, which is a minor sixth. Wait, but Ab is enharmonic to G#, and Db to G# is seven semitones. Wait, hold on, Db to G#:

Db is 0

D# →1

E →2

F →3

F# →4

G →5

G# →6. Wait, no. Db to D# is 1

D# to E is 2 (D#-E is a half step)

E to F is 3

F to F# is 4

F# to G is 5

G to G# is 6

So Db to G# is six semitones. Which is diminished fifth (tritone), but wait. Wait Db to A: Db to D→1, D→D#→2, D#→Eb→3, Eb→E→4, E→F→5, F→F#→6, F#→G→7, G→Ab→8. Wait, this is confusing.

Actually, standard interval calculation:

From Db to Ab:

Db, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G, Ab.

Counting semitones:

Db to D: 1

D to D#: 2

D# to Eb: 3

Eb to E: 4

E to F:5

F to F#:6

F# to G:7

G to Ab:8.

So eight semitones. Which equals one octave minus a major second (but in terms of interval size, eight semitones is a minor sixth). Because a perfect fifth is seven semitones, so eight semitones is minor sixth.

So the chord Db-F-Ab would be root Db, major third F (four semitones?), wait Db to F: let's count half steps.

Db to D: 1

D to D#:2

D# to Eb:3

Eb to E:4 → yes, so Db to E is four semitones, but F is one more: 5 semitones. Wait, no: Db → D (1), D→D# (2), D#→E♭ (3), E♭→E (4), E→F (5). So Db to F is five semitones, which is a perfect fourth.

Because from Db to F: Db-C# (1), C#-D (2), D-D# (3), D#-E (4), E-F (5): so five half steps. A perfect fourth. So if root to third is a perfect fourth? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: the third should be four semitones for major third. Ah! I'm making a mistake. Let's count correctly.

From Db to F: how many semitones?

Db to D: 1

D to D#: 2

D# to Eb: 3

Eb to E: 4

E to F: 5

Wait yes, Db to F is five semitones. But a major third is four semitones. So Db to F# would be four semitones. But F is five semitones, which is a perfect fourth. So in the chord Db-F-Ab:

Db to F is perfect fourth (5 semitones), which is not a third. Wait, no. The third of the chord would be the note three degrees above root. So for a triad on Db, the third should be the third scale degree of the Db-based scale. But in C Phrygian mode, the notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So to build triad on Db, it's Db (I), Eb (II), F (III), etc. Wait no. The chord built on Db would be from the notes of C Phrygian: so the triad would be Db, Eb, F? No. Wait, diatonic chords for C Phrygian mode:

The scale is C Db Eb F G Ab Bb.

So to build triads:

On C: C-Eb-G → C minor

On Db: Db-F-Ab → because C, Db, Eb, F, so Db to F is skipping a note. Chord tones for Db: root, third, fifth. In the scale, note after Db is Eb, then F, then G. So the third above Db is F (since Eb is second, F is third). Wait no. In terms of scale degrees: the scale is 1=C, 2=Db, 3=Eb, 4=F, 5=G, 6=Ab, 7=Bb.

So chord built on 2 (Db):

Root = 2 (Db), third = 4 (F), fifth = 6 (Ab). Yes.

So Db to F: interval is 4 (third), but in terms of semitones: Db to F is five semitones (as calculated), which is a perfect fourth. Wait, but the interval between root and third should be a major or minor third depending on the mode.

But if we have root Db, third F (which is five semitones), which is a perfect fourth, that's not a triad. Wait, clearly something is wrong here. I think the confusion is because when building triads on each scale degree, the intervals from root to third and fifth depend on the scale degree.

Let's take standard major scale for reference. In major scale, triad on 2nd degree: Dm. So root D, third F (minor third), fifth A. So root to third is minor third (three semitones). Similarly.

So back to C Phrygian. Triad on 2nd degree (Db):

Root = Db

Third = Eb? Wait no. Wait, scale degrees:

In the mode called "C Phrygian", the first note is C (1), then Db (2), Eb (3), F (4), G (5), Ab (6), Bb (7).

So the note two steps above Db would be F? No: starting at Db as root of chord, the third would be the third note in the scale relative to Db.

So for triad on Db:

Root: Db

3rd: D#? No. Wait, better to take the scale notes.

The scale notes available for building the Db chord: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So the diatonic chord on Db would consist of Db, Eb, F? Or Db, F, Ab?

Wait, to build a triad on Db using notes from C Phrygian, it should be:

Db (root), then move up by degree: next note in the scale is Eb (second degree), then F (third degree of the scale). Wait no. For chord building on a tonic, the triad is tonic, third, fifth. So in the C Phrygian scale, the chord built on Db would take Db as the root, then find the third and fifth intervals.

Db to Eb is a minor second. Eb is a 9th if Db is a root. Not helpful. Instead, better to consider the scale notes:

Scale: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb

To build a chord on Db, the diatonic notes available are Db, Eb, F, Ab (since those are the notes from the scale). So the root is Db, then the third should be Eb? No, Db to Eb is a minor second. That would not make sense for a triad. So actually, the third is Eb? Wait, no. A third should be separated by two scale degrees.

For example, in major scale, tonic chord: 1, 3, 5. So in C major: C, E, G. E is three scale degrees above C.

So for Db chord in C Phrygian:

Root: Db

Third: Eb? Because it's two steps above Db (Db is 2nd degree of C Phrygian, so to get the third of Db chord, it would be Eb? No. Let's think of the mode's notes relative to Db.

If our key is C Phrygian, then the root of the mode is C. But if we build a chord on Db, we treat Db as the root of the chord. So what's the third above Db in the context of C Phrygian scale?

The C Phrygian scale has Db as the second note. Starting from Db, the scale degrees relative to Db would be:

Db (1), Eb (2), F (3), G (4), Ab (5), Bb (6), C (7). But wait, the scale from Db would be Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. Which is actually a Db Phrygian scale. But in the context of C Phrygian, the mode is based on C as tonic.

This is getting complicated. Let's step back.

If the chord progression uses notes only from C Phrygian (C Db Eb F G Ab Bb), then the diatonic chords are:

- C minor: C Eb G

- Dbdim: Db F Ab

- Eb major: Eb G Bb

- F minor: F Ab C

- Gdim: G Bb Db

- Ab major: Ab C Eb

- Bbm: Bb Db F

So yes, the diatonic chords are:

i: Cm

ii°: Dbdim

III: Ebmaj

iv: Fm

v°: Gdim

bVI: Abmaj

bVII: Bbm

Wait, so the Db chord is diminished (Dbdim), but in the progression, there's a Dbmaj7/F chord, which would be Dbmaj7: Db, F, Ab, C. But that would be a major seventh chord on Db. However, in the diatonic chords for C Phrygian, the chord on Db is diminished triad: Db, Fb, Ab? No, wait.

Wait, no. To get a diminished triad for Dbdim, the notes would be Db, Fb, Ab. Because root, minor third (Fb), diminished fifth (Ab). But Fb is E, so Db, E, Ab. However, in the C Phrygian scale, the notes available are Db, Eb (which is same as D#), F, etc. So F natural is present. So Db to F is five semitones (perfect fourth). So that would be a major third? No, five semitones is perfect fourth.

I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's recast:

If C Phrygian has notes: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chord built on Ab: Ab C Eb. That's Ab major triad.

Chord built on Eb: Eb G Bb → Eb major.

Chord built on Bb: Bb Db F → Bb minor.

Chord built on C: C Eb G → minor.

Chord built on Db: Db F Ab. Let's see intervals: Db to F is five semitones (perfect fourth), Db to Ab is eight semitones (minor sixth). So this isn't a triad that's standard. Wait, but how can that be?

Actually, when building triads in the Phrygian mode, the ii chord is diminished.

Wait, perhaps I should list all the triads properly.

C Phrygian scale: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

- Chord on C: C-Eb-G → C minor

- Chord on Db: Db-F-Ab. Db to F is perfect fourth (distance of 5 semitones), not a third. So this seems off.

Wait, this issue occurs because the intervals between consecutive scale degrees in Phrygian mode are not uniform like major scale. Let's count intervals between scale degrees.

C to Db: minor second (1 semitone)

Db to Eb: major second (2 semitones)

Eb to F: minor second (1)

F to G: major second (2)

G to Ab: minor second (1)

Ab to Bb: major second (2)

Bb to C: minor second (1)

Ah, but when building triads on each degree, the chord quality depends on the intervals.

For chord on root X, the third and fifth are based on scale degrees.

For example, chord built on root C (degree 1):

1=C, 3rd=Eb (degree 3), fifth=G (degree 5).

So C-Eb-G → minor triad.

Chord built on Db (degree 2):

Root=Db (degree 2), third would be F (degree 4), fifth=Ab (degree 6).

Db, F, Ab.

Interval from Db to F: Db → Eb (1), Eb→F (2), so two whole steps? No. Db to Eb (semitone), Eb to F (semitone), so Db to F is two semitones? No, no. Wait semitone count:

Db to D: 1

D to Db#? No. Db to D is +1 semitone,

D to D# is +2,

D# to Eb is +3,

Eb to E is +4,

E to F is +5. So five semitones, which is a perfect fourth.

Db to Ab: Db→D(1), D→D#(2), D#→Eb(3), Eb→E(4), E→F(5), F→F#(6), F#→G(7), G→Ab(8). So eight semitones, minor sixth.

So Db-F-Ab chord has perfect fourth and minor sixth—this is not a standard triad. But actually, in reality, the triad is Db-F-Ab: the interval between Db and Ab is a diminished fifth? No. Wait, Db to Ab: as above eight semitones.

But 8 semitones is a minor sixth. Perfect fifth is seven semitones. So Db to A is perfect fifth (Db to Ab is actually Db to A is 9 semitones? Wait no. Let's take notes.

Db to A:

Db to D: 1

D to D#→2

D#→Eb→3

Eb→E→4

E→F→5

F→F#→6

F#→G→7

G→G#→8

G#→A→9

So Db to A is nine semitones, which is a minor sixth? No, nine semitones is a major sixth. Because perfect fifth is seven, minor sixth is eight, major sixth nine.

Wait, no: the interval from Db to Ab is: Ab is the same as G#, so Db to G#:

Db to D: +1

D to D#: +2

D# to Eb: +3

Eb to E: +4

E to F: +5

F to F#: +6

F# to G: +7

G to G#: +8

Wait, so Db to G# is eight semitones. And G# is enharmonic to Ab. So Db to Ab is eight semitones → minor sixth.

But in the chord Db-F-Ab: Db to F is five semitones (perfect fourth), F to Ab is three semitones (minor third). So overall, this is a diminished triad? Because root to fifth is Db to Ab (minor sixth), but that's not standard. Wait, no. In standard chord theory:

If we have Db, F, Ab, let's see:

The interval between Db and Ab should ideally be a perfect fifth (seven semitones), but it's eight semitones. So diminished fifth is six semitones (tritone), but eight is minor sixth. So this isn't a diminished triad.

This is getting too confusing. Perhaps better to consider the key as C Phrygian, and the chord progression fits because it uses all the notes of the scale. Even if the chord qualities seem odd.

But in the progression we have Dbmaj7/F. Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C. Which in C Phrygian contains all the notes, and yes, it's a diatonic chord.

Because in C Phrygian, the notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So Dbmaj7 is Db, F, Ab, C—all within the scale. So that chord exists in C Phrygian.

Similarly, Eb major is Eb, G, Bb.

Bbm is Bb, Db, F.

Abmaj is Ab, C, Eb.

Gdim is G, Bb, Db.

All those notes fit.

So the key is C Phrygian. But let's see the tonic. The tonic would be C, as Phrygian mode starts on C.

But in the progression, there's no clear C chord. Although in Abmaj chord (Ab C Eb), there's C, and in Dbmaj7/F there's C. Also, Bbm chord has F and Bb.

But Phrygian mode often uses the b2 as characteristic, so here we have Db throughout, which is present in all the chords.

Another point: the progression starts and ends with Gdim, but that might not indicate the tonic. In many cases, the mode is determined by the tonal center, not just the first chord. But without a clear tonic chord (Cm), it's a bit hard. However, Phrygian mode is defined by having the minor second above the tonic.

Given all the notes fit in C Phrygian scale, and the chord progression uses diatonic chords from that mode, the key is C Phrygian.

But let's check another angle: look for the tonic. If it were a minor key with a flattened second, which is characteristic of Phrygian. The tonic would be C minor with a b2 (Db). And that's the case here.

Alternatively, if someone thinks the key is Db major but with G natural, but that doesn't fit. Because Db major would have Cb, not C natural. But we have C natural.

Another possibility: Bb minor, but with some chromaticism. Let's see. Bb minor scale natural: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab. Our chord progression has natural G, which is outside of Bb natural minor (which has Gb). So if it's Bb harmonic minor, then Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A natural. Again, we have G natural here. So Bb harmonic minor has A natural, but Gb, not G natural. So the presence of G natural and Bb minor scale would have Gb.

So likely not. So the presence of G natural and Ab (which is separate notes) suggests C Phrygian.

Because in C Phrygian: C, Db(=C#), Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So we have both G and Ab. G is natural, and Ab is flat. Which fits perfectly.

Yes, C Phrygian contains G natural and Ab.

So now, the tonic is C. The mode is Phrygian.

Another way to check: the characteristic note of Phrygian is the flattened second (b2). Here, Db (b2 of C) is used extensively. In all the chords, for example, in Gdim: G, Bb, Db. So Db is part of it. In Eb/G chord has Db? Wait Eb/G is Eb over G, which is G, Eb, Bb. So no Db there. Wait:

Gdim is G, Bb, Db – yes has Db.

Eb/G: Eb major with G bass: G, Eb, Bb. No Db here.

Bbm/F: F, Bb, Db. Yes, has Db.

Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb – Ab is present.

Dbmaj7/F: F, Db, Ab, C – yes.

So Db is in Gdim, Bbm/F, Dbmaj7/F chords. So the flat second (Db in C Phrygian) is present.

So yes, C Phrygian makes sense.

Is there another mode that fits? Let's see.

C Phrygian is mode 3 of Ab major scale? Wait, no. Let's see:

Phrygian mode starting on C would be the third mode of Ab major? No. Modes:

Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian.

So C Phrygian is the third mode of Ab major. Because Ab Ionian (Ab major), then:

Ab: I

Bb: ii

C: iii Phrygian

Db: IV

Eb: V

F: vi

G: vii°

Yes, so C Phrygian is the iii mode of Ab major. But the key center would be C Phrygian, not Ab major. However, if the piece is centered around C Phrygian, then C is the tonic.

So the key and mode would be C Phrygian.

But usually key signatures are based on major/minor. But here the mode is Phrygian. So the key is C Phrygian.

But let's see if any chords suggest the tonic. If the progression resolves to C chord, but here there's no C chord. However, in Ab major chord: Ab C Eb → there is a C in it. Also, Dbmaj7 contains C. So C appears in several chords.

It's common in modes that the tonic might not be immediately obvious, but based on the scale notes, it's C Phrygian.

Another check: look at the intervals from C. If we consider C as tonic, then we have:

Db (b2), Eb (b3), G (natural 5th), Ab (b6), Bb (b7).

Which fits the Phrygian mode.

Yes, so C Phrygian.

So the key is C Phrygian. Or simply stated as C Phrygian mode.

But sometimes the key is written as "C Phrygian" or "C minor with b2" but usually Phrygian is the mode name.

So final answer: Key is C Phrygian.

Wait, but some might argue it's Eb major with some chromaticism, but the notes don't match. Since there's G natural and Ab, but Eb major would have Gb, not G. So no.

Alternatively, is it a C minor with a raised fourth or something? No, because in C minor, the standard scale has Bb, Eb, etc., but we have Db, which would be the flattened second, yes.

C minor would have C minor scale: natural minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait a minute! C natural minor scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Wait, that's the same as C Phrygian? No, wait. C natural minor (Aeolian mode) is:

C (1), D (2), Eb (b3), F (4), G (5), Ab (b6), Bb (b7).

C Phrygian is:

C (1), Db (b2), Eb (b3), F (4), G (5), Ab (b6), Bb (b7).

Ah! Yes! So C Aeolian (natural minor) has D natural as second degree, but Phrygian has Db. So our scale includes Db (b2), which means it's Phrygian, not Aeolian.

C natural minor has D natural (no, it has C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb). So yes, C natural minor (Aeolian) has D natural as 2nd degree. But in our scale, the second degree is Db instead of D natural. So it's Phrygian.

So yes, C Phrygian mode.

Therefore, the key and mode would be C Phrygian.

But let's check the chords again. In C Phrygian, the chords are as we listed:

i: Cm

ii°: Dbdim

III: Ebmaj

iv: Fm

v°: Gdim

bVI: Abmaj

bVII: Bbm

In the progression:

- Gdim (v°)

- Eb/G (III chord with G bass)

- Bbm/F (bVII with F bass)

- Ab/G (bVI chord)

- Dbmaj7/F (Db major 7th, which in this mode is the IImaj7?)

Wait, no: the chord on Db is Dbdim? But Dbmaj7 would be Db, F, Ab, C. Which contains all notes of C Phrygian. So yes, it is a diatonic chord. In this mode, the second degree chord has been altered to major 7th, which is possible since Phrygian mode has a diminished second scale degree, but chords can vary.

Anyway, regardless of exact chord qualities, all the notes fit into C Phrygian, so the key is C Phrygian mode.

Thus, the key is C with Phrygian mode.

The chord progression provided is:

**Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim**

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### **1. Identify All Chord Tones**
List all distinct notes present in the progression:

- **Gdim** → G, B♭, D♭  
- **Eb/G** → G, E♭, B♭  
- **Bbm/F** → F, B♭, D♭  
- **Ab/G** → G, A♭, C, E♭  
- **Dbmaj7/F** → F, D♭, A♭, C  

Compiling the notes:  
**C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭**

This set of notes matches **C Phrygian mode**, which consists of:
- **C (1)**  
- **D♭ (b2)**  
- **E♭ (b3)**  
- **F (4)**  
- **G (5)**  
- **A♭ (b6)**  
- **B♭ (b7)**

#### **2. Diatonic Chords in C Phrygian**
All chords in the progression are diatonic to C Phrygian:

| Chord | Notes | Role in C Phrygian |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **Gdim** | G, B♭, D♭ | v° (diminished) |
| **Eb/G** | G, E♭, B♭ | III (major triad) |
| **Bbm/F** | F, B♭, D♭ | bVII (minor triad) |
| **Ab/G** | G, A♭, C, E♭ | bVI (major triad) |
| **Dbmaj7/F** | F, D♭, A♭, C | II (major seventh) |

#### **3. Key Characteristic: b2 Degree**
- The presence of **D♭ (b2)** is the defining feature of the Phrygian mode.
- The key center is **C**, with D♭ as the second degree.
- This aligns perfectly with **C Phrygian**, a mode of the Ab major scale, but with **C** as the tonic.

#### **4. Why Not Other Keys?**
- **Ab Major**: Contains G♭ (not G natural), so the presence of **G natural** rules this out.
- **C Minor (Aeolian)**: Contains D natural (2nd degree), but the progression uses **D♭**, which is characteristic of Phrygian, not Aeolian.
- **Db Major**: Contains C♭ (not C natural), but the progression includes **C natural**.
- **Bb Minor**: Contains G♭ (not G natural), and also lacks the required b2 (D♭) in its natural form.

#### **5. Tonal Center**
- The tonic **C** is implied through the scale notes (e.g., presence of **C** in Ab/G and Dbmaj7/F chords).
- While no explicit C minor chord (C, E♭, G) appears, the scale and chord structure clearly center around **C** as the tonic.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

**Key: C Phrygian**  
- **Mode:** Phrygian  
- **Scale:** C, D♭, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭  
- **Tonic:** C  
- **Characteristic Feature:** D♭ (b2) — the hallmark of Phrygian mode.

This progression is firmly rooted in **C Phrygian**, with all chords fitting diatonically within the scale. The repeated use of D♭ and the scale structure confirm this identity.

**Assistant - Qwen Next 80B**

This chord progression:

> **Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**

...is **not in a traditional major/minor key**, but rather exhibits strong characteristics of **modal interchange, chromatic voice leading, and harmonized diminished patterns** — typical of **jazz, film noir, or post-tonal/styles**. However, we can analyze it for the most plausible **tonal center and mode**.

---

### Step 1: List the chords clearly with bass notes

Let’s write them with full notation:

1. G° (G diminished)  
2. G°  
3. Eb/G — E-flat major chord with G in bass → **G bass, Eb major triad = G, Bb, Eb**  
4. Eb/G  
5. G°  
6. G°  
7. Bbm/F — B-flat minor chord with F in bass → **F, A♭, C♭ (B♭)** → F is bass, chord is Bbm = F, Ab, Bb? Wait — **Bbm = Bb, Db, F** → so F is the 5th → **F bass, Bbm triad = F, Bb, Db**  
8. Ab/G — A-flat major chord with G in bass → **G, Bb, Db**  
9. G°  
10. G°  
11. Eb/G — same as #3  
12. Eb/G  
13. G°  
14. G°  
15. Dbmaj7/F — D-flat major 7th chord with F in bass → F, Ab, Cb (B), Eb → **F bass, Dbmaj7 = F, Ab, Cb, Eb**  
16. G°

---

### Step 2: Identify underlying pitches and potential key centers

Let’s extract the **notes** used:

- **G°**: G, Bb, Db  
- **Eb/G**: G, Bb, Eb  
- **Bbm/F**: F, Bb, Db  
- **Ab/G**: G, Bb, Db  
- **Dbmaj7/F**: F, Ab, Cb (B), Eb

So the notes appearing are:  
**G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, Cb (B)**

That’s:  
**G, A♭, B♭, C♭ (B), D♭, E♭, F**

Written in pitch class:  
G, Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, F

That’s **7 notes** — almost a full octave. Let's arrange them in order:

**B, Cb (B), Db, Eb, F, G, Ab**

Wait — that’s missing C natural and E natural. But let’s try to see if this fits a **mode of a scale**.

Actually, these notes are:  
**B, Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab**

But Cb is B, so redundant. Set:

**B, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab**

Still 6 unique notes + G. Wait — **all unique pitch classes**:

From above:  
- **B (Cb)**  
- **Db**  
- **Eb**  
- **F**  
- **G**  
- **Ab**  
- **Bb**

That’s 7 notes: **B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab**

That’s **no diatonic major or minor scale** — too many accidentals.

Let’s consider **tonal center**.

Notice: The progression keeps returning to **G° (G diminished)**, and **G is in the bass** of several major chords: **Eb/G, Ab/G**.

Also, **G** appears as root of diminished, and as bass note in major chords — suggesting **G is a gravitational center**.

Also, the final chord is **G°** — ending on G diminished.

So **G** is likely **tonic**.

But G diminished is **G, Bb, Db** — which is the same as **Bb dim** or **Db dim** — it's symmetrical.

So the key might be **G Locrian**? Let’s check.

---

### Step 3: Check G Locrian mode

Locrian mode is the 7th mode of major:  
**G Locrian** = G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F

Check if this matches:

Our notes:  
G (tonic)  
Bb (b3)  
Db (b5) ← from G°  
Also encountered: Eb (b6), F (b7), Ab (b2 — not in G Locrian!), B (Cb)

Wait — we have **Ab (A♭)** — which is **b2** — that’s in G Locrian.

G Locrian:  
1. G  
2. A♭  
3. B♭  
4. C  
5. D♭  
6. E♭  
7. F

Our notes:  
✔ G  
✔ Ab (b2)  
✔ Bb (b3)  
✔ Db (b5)  
✔ Eb (b6)  
✔ F (b7)  
✔ **B = Cb** → Cb is **double flat 4?** — Wait, we have **Cb** from Dbmaj7/F → **Dbmaj7 = Db, F, Ab, Cb**

So **Cb** = enharmonic of **B** — that’s **not** in G Locrian.

G Locrian has **C natural** as 4th.

But we have **Cb (B)** — which would be a **diminished 4th** — **not** in G Locrian.

So **Cb (B) is outside G Locrian**.

G Locrian has **C**, not **Cb**.

So we have an **outlier**: **Cb**

That means we’re **not** in G Locrian.

---

### Step 4: Is it in **Db major**? Let’s check.

Db major: Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C

Our notes: B, Bb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab — we have **G** and **B** (Cb) — both **outside** Db major (Gb and C are in Db major, not G and Cb)

So not Db major.

What if **C minor**?  
C minor = C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb — we have **all** of these except C, but we have **Cb (B)** and **G** — G is in, but Cb is out — Cb ≠ C.

We have **Cb**, not C.

So — this progression is **chromatic**, and the presence of **Cb** (B) complicates everything.

Wait — **Dbmaj7/F**: F, Ab, Cb, Eb → Cb is the 7th of Db major = **leading tone**? No — in Db major, major 7th is **C**, not Cb.

**Cb** is **diminished 7th** — that’s the **7th of a Db fully diminished chord**.

→ **Db°7 = Db, F, Ab, Cb** — that’s a fully diminished 7th chord!

But the chord is written **Dbmaj7/F** — which suggests **D-flat major 7th**: Db, F, Ab, **C**

But it says **Cb** — that’s **Db°7**, not Dbmaj7.

This is likely a **mistake in notation**!

### Critical Analysis: Is it **Dbmaj7** or **Db°7**?

Truly:  
- **Dbmaj7** = Db, F, Ab, **C**  
- **Db°7** = Db, F, Ab, **Cb**

The bass is **F** — F is the 3rd of Db°7, and the 5th of Dbmaj7.

But in **jazz notation**, **Dbmaj7/F** with **Cb** would be **incorrect** — it should be **Db°7/F**.

Given that **Cb** is used, and the chord is in a progression full of **diminished** chords, it is **highly likely** that this is intended to be **Db°7/F** — **enharmonic error** in labeling.

So we’ll assume:  
**Dbmaj7/F** → **Db°7/F**

That makes the whole progression consistent!

So corrected chords:

1. G°  
2. G°  
3. Eb/G  
4. Eb/G  
5. G°  
6. G°  
7. Bbm/F → Bb, Db, F with F bass → **F, Bb, Db**  
8. Ab/G → G, Bb, Db  
9. G°  
10. G°  
11. Eb/G → G, Bb, Eb  
12. Eb/G  
13. G°  
14. G°  
15. Db°7/F → F, Ab, Db, Cb  
16. G°

Now all chords are **almost entirely built on or around G°, Eb/G, Ab/G, Bbm/F, Db°7/F**

### What do these chords have in common?

All contain **G, Bb, Db** — the G° triad.

Let’s look at common tones:

- G° = G, Bb, Db  
- Eb/G = G, Bb, Eb — replaces Db with Eb  
- Ab/G = G, Bb, Db — same as G°  
- Bbm/F = F, Bb, Db  
- Db°7/F = F, Ab, Db, Cb

Now, notice: **G, Bb, Db, F, Eb, Ab, Cb**

This set is **exactly the notes of a G half-diminished scale** — **G Locrian** with a lowered 4? No.

Wait — **G Locrian** is: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

We’re missing **C**, but we have **Cb (B)** — so that’s **G Locrian with lowered 4**

That’s **G Locrian ♭4** or **G Phrygian ♭4** — but that's not standard.

Alternatively — this is **G half-diminished (m7♭5)** scale with the 3rd and 7th extended.

But here's the key insight:

### GOLDEN INSIGHT

These chords **G°, Eb/G, Ab/G, Bbm/F, Db°7/F** are all **inversions of the same fully diminished 7th chord**!

Fully diminished 7th chords are **symmetrical** — every minor 3rd apart — so one chord = 4 possible roots.

**G°7 = G, Bb, Db, E (or Fb)**

But our chords:

- G° = G, Bb, Db  
- Eb/G = G, Bb, Eb → wait, Eb is **not** in G°7 — G°7 has **Fb** (E) as 7th  
But Eb is **not** in G°7 — unless enharmonic.

Wait — **G°7 = G, Bb, Db, Fb**  
**Fb = E**

But we have **Eb** — that's not Fb.

But notice:  
The chord **Eb/G** is G, Bb, Eb — that’s **Bb°7 in second inversion**: Bb°7 = Bb, Db, Fb, Ab  
But Eb is not in there.

Alternative:

Observe that **G°, Eb/G, Ab/G, Bbm/F, Db°7/F**

Let’s write all as triads or 7ths with shared notes.

Wait — **G° = G-Bb-Db**  
**E♭/G = G-Bb-E♭**  
**A♭/G = G-Bb-Db**  
**Bb°/F = F-Bb-Db**  
**D♭°7/F = F-Ab-Db-Cb**

So **G, Bb, Db** is the core.

Now look — **D♭°7/F = F-Ab-Db-Cb**

Ab and Cb are new.

But if we consider **C°7** — C, Eb, Gb, Bbb (A)

Not matching.

Consider **D°7** — D, F, Ab, Cb — I see **Db, Ab, Cb, F** — that’s **Db°7**

But we also have **F, Bb, Db** = **Bb°7** (Bb, Db, F, Ab) — yes!

So:

- **G° = G, Bb, Db**  
- **Eb/G = G, Bb, Eb** — here Eb? That’s new

Wait — **Eb** doesn't fit G°7.

But — **G°7** should be G, Bb, Db, Fb  
But we have **Eb** — perhaps it's an **outlier** or **melodic passing tone**?

Wait — perhaps **Eb/G** is a **mistake**?

If **Eb/G = G, Bb, Eb**, this is the **Ebmaj7** chord without E — no.

G, Bb, Eb is **G minor 6th**? G, Bb, C, Eb? No, just 3 notes.

Actually, G, Bb, Eb = **Eb major triad in first inversion?** No — root is G.

**G, Bb, Eb** is **G7#5?** (G, B, D#, Ab?) No.

This is **G Half-Diminished 7th without the 7th?**

Too messy.

### Final, Best Interpretation:

Let’s **replace Eb/G with E/G#?** No — that’s way off.

Wait — maybe **Eb/G** is meant to be **E/G?** But written as Eb...

Another possibility: This is a **chord sequence using a descending bass line**.

Look at the **bass notes**:

1. G  
2. G  
3. G  
4. G  
5. G  
6. G  
7. F  
8. G  
9. G  
10. G  
11. G  
12. G  
13. G  
14. G  
15. F  
16. G

So bass: G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G

So it’s mostly **G**, with occasional **F** in bass.

The chords over G are: G°, Eb/G, G°, Ab/G

So the bass is holding **G**, while chords above move:

- G°: G-Bb-Db  
- Eb/G: G-Bb-Eb  
- Ab/G: G-Bb-Db

So the top note is moving: Db → Eb → Db

That’s a **stepwise motion** — D to E — chromatic passing tone.

Then we get F bass: Bbm/F = F-Bb-Db and Db°7/F = F-Ab-Db-Cb

So the bass descends from G to F.

Then back to G.

So this is a **chromatic descent from G to F**, over a **G-centered harmonic space**.

The consistent presence of **G°** and the movement by half-steps around it suggest this is **G Harmonic Minor or G Locrian with chromatic inflections**, but the **Cb** from Db°7/F suggests **a secondary diminished chord resolving to F**, which is the 7th of G minor.

Wait — **Db°7 is the vii°7 of C minor?** Or of F?

Actually, **Db°7 = C#°7** — and in **C harmonic minor**, vii°7 is B°7 — not C#°7.

But **F natural** is the **5th** of Bb, but also the **7th** of G.

In **G minor**:

- G minor scale: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F  
- G°7 = G, Bb, Db, F — which is **G half-diminished** (m7♭5)  
- and **Db°7** = C#°7 — enharmonic is **Eb°7** = Eb, Gb, Bbb, Dbb — not useful.

Wait — **Db°7/F** — F is the 3rd of Db°7 — so it’s a **vii°7 embedded in F**.

But F is the **7th of G** — so **ii°7 of C?**

This is over-complicating.

---

## ✅ Final Answer: The key is **G minor**, in **G Dorian mode**? No.

### 🟡 Most plausible conclusion:

**This progression is centered on G, using chromatic mediants and diminished harmony, and strongly implies G minor (natural or harmonic), but with a strong penchant for ♯5 and ♯2 color tones. The final chord G° suggests G as tonic, and the presence of F (7th) and Eb and Db (6th and 5th b) confirms G minor.**

**Mode: G minor = G Aeolian (natural minor)**

But we have **Cb** → **B natural** — that’s the **♯5** of G minor? In G harmonic minor, the 5th is D, not raised.

Wait — G harmonic minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, **F#**

We don't have F#, we have **F natural** — so **not harmonic minor**.

We have **F**, not F# → so **G natural minor (Aeolian)**

But G natural minor: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F — perfect.

And our notes:

G, Bb, Db, F, Eb, Ab, Cb (B)

Cb (B) is **not** in G natural minor — G natural minor has **C natural**, not B.

We have **Cb (B)** — that is a **chromatic alteration**.

But we lack C natural — so **this is not in G minor** — because C is missing and replaced by Cb.

So... what scale has **G, Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Cb**?

List them:

G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F

Arrange in order:

**Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**

That’s **Cb major scale**: Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bb — doesn't match.

Wait — **Cb, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb**

F is natural, G natural — that’s not Cb major, which has **Fb**.

This scale is: **G, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F**

This is **G Locrian ♭4** — or **G Phrygian ♭4**

But it’s **exactly** the **G altered dominant scale**? No.

Actually, this is:

**G Phrygian Dominant**? G, Ab, B, C, D, Eb, F — no, we have Cb, not B.

I’m convinced:

## 🎯 The most accurate answer is:

> **The key center is G, using a chromatic descending bass movement (G–F) and primarily G diminished harmony. The material is strongly suggestive of G minor, but the presence of Cb (B) indicates heavy chromaticism and modal mixture. There is no single diatonic mode that fits — the progression is best understood as G minor with borrowed or passing chromatic tones, in an ambiguous, jazz/dark cinematic style.**

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **The key is G minor (Aeolian mode), with heavy chromatic embellishment and modal mixture. The progression uses G° as tonic, and the Cb in Db°7/F is a chromatic passing or blue note, indicating a jazz or cinematic harmonic language rather than a diatonic mode. The mode can be described as G Aeolian with chromatic alterations.**

Alternatively, to be more precise:

> **No single mode perfectly fits — the progression is in G minor (Aeolian) with frequent use of the ♯5 (Cb = B, enharmonic) as a chromatic passing tone / altered scale member, suggesting a hybrid of G minor and G Locrian with ♯4 alternative. The tonal center is G.**

But best simplified:

---

## 🟩 **Answer: Key = G minor | Mode = Aeolian (natural minor)**, **with extensive chromaticism.**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the **key and mode** of the chord progression:

```
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim
```

Let’s analyze step by step.

---

### Step 1: Look at the Chord Types and Notes

First, list the chords with their notes:

- **Gdim** = G – B♭ – D♭  
- **Eb/G** = G – B♭ – E♭ (first inversion of Eb major)  
- **Bbm/F** = F – B♭ – D♭ (first inversion of B♭ minor)  
- **Ab/G** = G – A♭ – C – E♭ (Ab major with G in the bass – essentially a G bass under Ab major)  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F – A♭ – C – D♭ (first inversion of Db major 7)

So the main pitch classes used across all chords are:

- **G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F**

That’s **7 notes**, which correspond to the **key of D♭ major** (or its relative B♭ minor):

**D♭ major scale**: D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭ – C

Wait—but we have **G natural**, not G♭. That’s a red flag.

Hold on: **G natural** is **not** in D♭ major (which has G♭). So maybe it’s **C♯ major?** That also has G♯, not G.

So perhaps the key isn’t D♭ major.

Let’s consider **E♭ minor** or **G♭ major**? Still has G♭.

But we keep seeing **G natural**, **B♭**, **D♭**, **E♭**, **A♭**, **C**, and **F**.

Let’s list the notes **chromatically**:

- G (natural)
- A♭
- B♭
- C
- D♭
- E♭
- F

This is a **7-note collection** missing only **D, E, A, B**. It includes both **G** and **A♭**, which are a half step apart—so it’s **not** a standard diatonic scale.

But notice: this is the **G half-whole diminished scale** (also called the **octatonic scale**), but that has 8 notes. However, these 7 notes are a subset.

Alternatively, consider **enharmonic reinterpretation**.

### Step 2: Reconsider Enharmonics – Is it Really in C Minor?

What if we reinterpret **D♭ as C#** and **G as G**? Then the dim chord is **G–B♭–C#**, which is an **E diminished** chord (E–G–B♭–C# is a fully diminished 7th). But that may not help.

Alternatively, think in **E♭ minor**:

- E♭ natural minor: E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭ – C♭ – D♭  
Again, G♭, not G.

But **E♭ harmonic minor**: E♭ – F – G – A♭ – B♭ – C♭ – D  
→ Has G natural! But also **C♭ (which is B)**, and **D natural**, which we **don’t have** in our chords.

Our chords **never use D natural or B natural**, so probably not E♭ harmonic minor.

### Step 3: Look for a Common Tonal Center

Notice that **Gdim** appears **very frequently**—it’s the backbone.

Also, **Eb/G** (Eb major with G in the bass) appears regularly.

So perhaps the tonal center is **G**, and the harmony is **modal or chromatic**.

But **G diminished** is not a tonic chord in traditional tonality—it’s unstable.

However, in **jazz and film scoring**, **diminished chords** are often used as **passing chords** or to create tension.

Now consider **Dbmaj7/F**. That’s a very specific chord—it contains **F in the bass**, and the chord is **Db major 7**.

Notes: **F–Ab–C–Db**

Now, **Db major** is the **tritone away from G**. G and Db are tritone apart.

Also, **Gdim** is a subset of **G°7 = G–B♭–D♭–E**, which contains **E natural**, but our Gdim is likely just a **triad**, not a 7th.

But note: **G°7 (fully diminished)** can resolve to **Ab7**, which is the V7 of **Db major**.

Wait—look at the chord before **Dbmaj7/F**—it’s **Gdim**.

So **Gdim → Dbmaj7** is a **root movement by tritone**, which is a classic **diminished chord as dominant substitute**.

In fact, **G°7** is often used as a substitute for **E7**, which is the V7 of **Am**, but also can lead to **Ab7 → Db**.

But here we go **Gdim → Dbmaj7**, which strongly suggests **Db major** as a temporary tonic.

But again, **Db major has Gb, not G**.

Unless… the **G** in the bass (in Eb/G and Ab/G) is **not part of the key**, but a **pedal tone** or **chromatic passing tone**.

### Step 4: Consider G as a Pedal Tone

Many chords have **G in the bass**:

- Eb/G
- Ab/G
- Gdim
- Dbmaj7/F → but that’s F in bass

So **G** is a **common bass tone**, possibly a **pedal point**.

If **G is a pedal tone**, then the harmonies above are:
- Eb major (over G)
- Ab major (over G)
- Bbm (over F, though)
- Dbmaj7 (over F)

So maybe the **harmony is shifting**, and **G is a drone**.

This is common in **modal or cinematic music**.

Now, what key contains **Eb, Ab, Bbm, Db**?

Those are all chords in **Db major**:

- Db major diatonic chords:
  - I = Db
  - ii = Ebm
  - iii = Fm
  - IV = Gb
  - V = Ab
  - vi = Bbm
  - vii° = C°

But we have **Eb major**, not Eb minor. So that’s **not diatonic** to Db major.

But **Eb major** is the **Neapolitan chord (bII)** in **Db major**.

Similarly, **Ab** is **V**, **Bbm** is **vi**, **Db** is **I**.

So the chords **Eb, Ab, Bbm, Db** fit as **bII – V – vi – I** in **Db major**.

That’s a **plagal-like cadence** with Neapolitan.

And the **G in the bass**? In **Db major**, **G is Gb enharmonically**, but here it’s **G natural**, which is **enharmonically the #5 of Db** (since Db’s #5 is A, not G... wait no).

Actually, **G natural is the #11 or b5 of Db?**

- Db to G is an **augmented 4th (tritone)** → **G = #11** of Db.

So **G in the bass** under Db chords is a **tritone substitution or altered bass**.

In jazz, it’s common to use **tritone bass movement**.

But here, **G is static**.

### Step 5: Consider the Possibility of G Phrygian or G Locrian?

G Phrygian: G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D – E♭ – F  
→ Contains **G, A♭, B♭, C, D, E♭, F**

But our chords use **D♭**, not D natural.

So **not Phrygian**.

G Locrian: G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F  
→ **Exactly our notes!**

**G Locrian mode** = G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F

That’s the **7th mode of A♭ major**.

A♭ major scale: A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F – G

So **G Locrian** uses:
- G (root)
- A♭ (♭2)
- B♭ (♭3)
- C (4)
- D♭ (♭5)
- E♭ (♭6)
- F (♭7)

This matches **all the notes we see**:
- Gdim = G–B♭–D♭ → root, ♭3, ♭5 → **the tonic chord of Locrian**
- Eb/G = G–B♭–E♭ → G (root), ♭3, ♭6
- Bbm/F = F–B♭–D♭ → ♭7, ♭3, ♭5
- Ab/G = G–A♭–C–E♭ → root, ♭2, 4, ♭6 → essentially **Ab major over G**
- Dbmaj7/F = F–A♭–C–D♭ → ♭7, ♭2, 4, ♭5 → this is a bit odd in Locrian, but note: **Db is the ♭5 of G**, so **Db major** is built on the **♭5**, which is **not diatonic** to Locrian (Locrian has **Db minor**, not major).

Wait—in **G Locrian**, the **♭5 chord** is **Db diminished or Db minor**, not **Db major**.

**Db major** has **F**, which is in the scale, and **A♭**, also in the scale, and **C**, also in the scale, and **Db**.

So **Db major** = Db–F–Ab–C → all notes are in **G Locrian**!

Check:
- Db = ♭5 → yes
- F = ♭7 → yes
- Ab = ♭2 → yes
- C = 4 → yes

So **Db major** is a **diatonic chord** in **G Locrian**? Let’s build the diatonic triads of G Locrian:

G Locrian (from A♭ major):
- G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F – G

Triads:
1. G – B♭ – D♭ → **Gdim** (i°)
2. A♭ – C – E♭ → **Ab major** (♭II)
3. B♭ – D♭ – F → **Bbm** (♭iii)
4. C – E♭ – G → **Cm** (iv)
5. D♭ – F – A♭ → **Db major** (♭V)
6. E♭ – G – B♭ → **Ebm** (♭VI)
7. F – A♭ – C → **Fm** (♭vii)

Ah! So **Db major** is the **♭V triad** in **G Locrian**, and it’s **major** because of the key signature of A♭ major.

Similarly:
- **Eb/G** = E♭ major chord? Wait, **E♭ major** = E♭–G–B♭ → but in A♭ major, the E♭ chord is **E♭ major** (V chord of A♭), but in **G Locrian**, the 6th scale degree is **E♭**, and the triad is **E♭–G–B♭ = E♭ major**!

But earlier I thought it was E♭ minor—but no! In **A♭ major**, **E♭ is major** (V chord).

So **G Locrian**, being mode VII of A♭ major, inherits all chords from A♭ major.

So let’s list all chords in **A♭ major**:

- I = A♭ major
- ii = B♭ minor
- iii = C minor
- IV = D♭ major
- V = E♭ major
- vi = F minor
- vii° = G diminished

So **G Locrian** (mode vii) has:
- i° = G°
- ♭II = A♭
- ♭iii = B♭m
- iv = Cm
- ♭V = D♭
- ♭VI = E♭
- ♭vii = Fm

Exactly!

Thus:
- **Gdim** = i°
- **Eb/G** = E♭ major in first inversion → ♭VI chord
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ minor in first inversion → ♭iii
- **Ab/G** = A♭ major over G → ♭II with G bass (i.e., G in bass under ♭II)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = D♭ major 7 over F → ♭V7 over ♭vii bass

All these chords are **diatonic to A♭ major**, and when **G is used as the tonal center**, the mode is **G Locrian**.

### Final Answer:

**Key: A♭ major (parent key)**  
**Mode: G Locrian**

The progression is **centered around G** with chords drawn from **A♭ major**, making it **G Locrian mode**.

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

This progression is built around G diminished and its sliding inversions (*Eb/G = first inversion of a G-diminished triad*, *Ab/G = first inversion of a G-diminished triad*), with a single “cadence” chord:  

Dbmaj7/F.

Db7 is the **tritone substitute of G7**, and in the key of C it resolves to C (I). That makes the whole sequence a **long embellished dominant preparation in C**, and the final sonority  

Dbmaj7/F ‑> (implied C)  

is the classic tritone-sub resolution.

Only one other chord appears: a **Bbm triad**.  
In the key of C that is the II chord, exactly the chord that normally precedes the tritone-sub (II – SubV – I). Everything else is just chromatic voice-leading through diminished colours that all function as **extensions/alterations of the dominant**.

Hence the passage is **tonal, not modal**; it is in:

**C major (tonic)**  
with the entire excerpt functioning as an **extended dominant approach** and ending on the tritone-substitute dominant (Db) that resolves to C.

The key signature you would write is **no sharps or flats (C major)**; the accidentals come from the chromatic dominant decoration.

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let’s analyze your chord progression step by step:

**Progression:**
```
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Bbm/F  Ab/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Eb/G  Eb/G  
Gdim  Gdim  Dbmaj7/F  Gdim
```

---

### Step 1: Identify common tones and bass movement
- The **bass** often plays **G** throughout, especially in Gdim, Eb/G, and Ab/G.  
- That suggests a **pedal G**—a sustained or repeated bass tone under changing harmonies.

---

### Step 2: Examine the chords in terms of pitch content
- **Gdim** = G–Bb–Db  
- **Eb/G** = G–Bb–Eb  
- **Bbm/F** = Bb–Db–F  
- **Ab/G** = G–Ab–C–Eb  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = Db–F–Ab–C

Common tones:  
  - **Gdim (G–Bb–Db)** and **Eb/G (G–Bb–Eb)** share **G** and **Bb**.  
  - Movement between these feels like a half‑step shift of **Db ↔ Eb**.
  - **Bbm/F** and **Dbmaj7/F** both come from the **Db major** region.  
  - **Ab** and **Eb** chords also fit into a **Db major / Eb minor** color space.

---

### Step 3: Collection of pitches used overall
From all chords we have:  
**G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**

That’s a 7‑note collection, which can be ordered as:

> **Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C**

This is the **Db major scale** (enharmonically the same as **C# major**).

---

### Step 4: Relation of Gdim to Db major
In **Db major**, the diminished chord built on the leading tone is **Cdim (C–Eb–Gb)**—not Gdim.  
However, Gdim (G–Bb–Db) fits as **vii° of Ab minor**, which is the **ii chord in Eb minor**, **vi chord in Gb major**, or **V degree’s leading-tone chord in Ab minor**.

---

### Step 5: Functional feel
- The frequent **Eb/G → Gdim** alternation creates tension and release around **G** in the bass.  
- The use of **Eb**, **Ab**, **Db**, **Bb** points strongly toward the **Db major / Bbm** tonal area.  
- The diminished passing chords emphasize the pull toward **Db major** or its relative **Bb minor**.

---

✅ **Conclusion**

The collection points to **Db major** (or its relative **Bb minor**) as the key center.

Given the prevalence of **dark/diminished** colors and the way **Gdim** (G–Bb–Db) serves as a leading-tone chord to **Ab**, the progression feels **Bb minor–ish** rather than bright major.

---

**Final answer:**
> **Key:** B♭ minor  
> **Mode:** Aeolian (natural minor)

**Supporting reasoning:**  
- Shared note collection = Db major / Bb natural minor.  
- Functional resolution targets chords (Db, Ab, Eb) from that family.  
- Gdim functions as vii° of Ab (the V in Bb minor).

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim.

I need to determine the key and mode. Diminished chords often function as passing chords or leading tones, so I should look for the tonic or home chord.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

1. Gdim

2. Gdim

3. Eb/G

4. Eb/G

5. Gdim

6. Gdim

7. Bbm/F

8. Ab/G

9. Gdim

10. Gdim

11. Eb/G

12. Eb/G

13. Gdim

14. Gdim

15. Dbmaj7/F

16. Gdim

Now, Eb/G is an Eb major chord with a G in the bass, so it's first inversion. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bbm with F in the bass, and Dbmaj7/F is Dbmaj7 with F in the bass.

Gdim is a diminished chord. Since it's written as Gdim, it's probably a diminished triad, but in context, it might be a full diminished seventh chord. I'll assume it's a diminished seventh for functional analysis.

In key analysis, diminished chords are often vii° chords or secondary dominants.

Let me look at the chords that aren't diminished: Eb, Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7.

Eb, Ab, and Db are all flat keys, suggesting a key with flats. Bbm is also flat.

Let me consider the key of Eb major. In Eb major, the chords would be:

I: Eb

ii: Fm

iii: Gm

IV: Ab

V: Bb

vi: Cm

vii°: Ddim

But here we have Gdim, which isn't Ddim. Gdim would be the iii chord in Eb major? Eb major has Gm as iii, which is minor, not diminished. So Gdim doesn't fit as a diatonic chord in Eb major.

Perhaps it's in a minor key. Let's try Eb minor. Eb natural minor has: i: Ebm, ii°: Fdim, III: Gb, iv: Abm, v: Bbm, VI: Cb, VII: Db. But Gdim is not Gb, so not that.

Gdim might be a leading tone chord in Ab major. In Ab major, the vii° is Gdim, since Ab major has notes Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, and Gdim is G, Bb, Db, which are the leading tone, supertonic, and subdominant? Let's see the scale degrees.

In Ab major:

- G is the leading tone (7)

- Bb is the supertonic (2)

- Db is the subdominant (4)

So Gdim is vii° in Ab major, which is a diminished chord.

Now, looking at the progression, we have Eb/G, which is Eb major with G bass. Eb is the IV chord in Ab major? In Ab major, IV is Db, not Eb. Eb is V in Ab major? In Ab major, V is Eb, yes! So Eb is the V chord in Ab major.

Similarly, Bbm/F: Bbm is vi in Ab major? In Ab major, vi is Fm, not Bbm. Bbm would be bvi, which is not diatonic.

Ab/G: Ab with G bass. Ab is I in Ab major, but with G bass, which is the leading tone, so it might be a dominant function.

Dbmaj7/F: Db is IV in Ab major, with F bass. F is the sixth of Db, so Dbmaj7 is Db F Ab C, and with F bass, it's first inversion.

But we have Bbm, which is not diatonic in Ab major. Bbm has Bb, Db, F, which in Ab major, Bb is ii, which is minor, so ii is Bbm, yes! In Ab major, ii is Bbm, because the supertonic is Bb minor.

In major keys, the supertonic is minor. So in Ab major, ii is Bbm. So Bbm is diatonic in Ab major.

So let's list the chords in relation to Ab major:

- Gdim: vii° (diatonic)

- Eb/G: V with first inversion? Eb is V, and with G bass, it's V6, which is common.

- Bbm/F: ii with first inversion? Bbm is ii, and with F bass, it's ii6.

- Ab/G: I with leading tone in bass? This is like a cadential 6/4, but Ab/G is I with seventh? Ab/G means Ab chord with G in bass, so Ab major chord (Ab, C, Eb) with G bass, so it's not a standard chord because G is not part of Ab major chord. Ab major triad is Ab, C, Eb, so if you add G, it becomes Ab major seventh? But it's written as Ab/G, which means Ab chord over G bass, so the chord is Ab major, but the bass is G, so it's an inversion of something? Ab/G could be interpreted as a dominant seventh chord missing the third or something? Let's think.

In classical terms, Ab/G might be used as a passing chord or as part of a dominant function. Since G is the leading tone in Ab major, Ab/G could be seen as a I chord with a suspension or something, but it's not standard.

Perhaps Ab/G is actually G7 with missing notes? G7 is G, B, D, F, but here we have Ab, C, Eb with G bass, so the notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. That doesn't sound like G7. G7 has B and F, not Ab and C.

Another thought: in jazz or popular music, Ab/G might be used as a slash chord for voice leading. But let's see the context.

We have Gdim before and after, so perhaps Gdim is acting as a common tone diminished chord or something.

Let's list all chords with their possible functions in Ab major.

First, Gdim: vii° in Ab major.

Eb/G: V in Ab major, first inversion.

Bbm/F: ii in Ab major, first inversion.

Ab/G: I in Ab major with non-chord tone in bass? Or perhaps it's a dominant preparation.

Dbmaj7/F: IV in Ab major, first inversion, with maj7.

But the progression has multiple Gdim chords, and it starts and ends with Gdim, so perhaps Gdim is acting as a tonic substitute? But diminished chords are rarely tonic.

Perhaps the key is not Ab major. Let's consider other keys.

Another common key with flats is Db major. In Db major:

I: Db

ii: Ebm

iii: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

vi: Bbm

vii°: Cdim

But we have Gdim, which is not Cdim. Gdim would be ? In Db major, G is the fourth, so Gdim would be a diminished chord on the fourth, which is not diatonic.

We have Eb, which is II in Db major, not diatonic.

Bbm is vi in Db major, which is diatonic.

Ab is V in Db major, diatonic.

Dbmaj7 is I in Db major.

But Gdim doesn't fit.

Perhaps it's G minor? Let's try G minor.

In G minor:

i: Gm

ii°: Adim

III: Bb

iv: Cm

v: Dm

VI: Eb

VII: F

But we have Gdim, which is not Gm. Gdim is diminished, while i is minor.

So not G minor.

Another idea: perhaps the Gdim is actually functioning as a dominant diminished chord. Diminished chords often substitute for dominant chords. For example, Gdim shares notes with Ebdim, Bbdim, etc., but let's see the notes.

Gdim triad is G, Bb, Db. If it's Gdim7, it would be G, Bb, Db, E.

Now, Eb/G is Eb, G, Bb, so it has G and Bb in common with Gdim.

Similarly, Ab/G has Ab, C, Eb with G bass, so notes G, Ab, C, Eb.

Bbm/F has Bb, Db, F with F bass, so notes F, Bb, Db.

Dbmaj7/F has Db, F, Ab, C with F bass, so notes F, Db, Ab, C.

Now, let's find common tones or leading tones.

Notice that Gdim has G, Bb, Db. Eb major has Eb, G, Bb. So when moving from Gdim to Eb/G, it's smooth because G and Bb are common.

From Eb/G to Gdim, similarly.

From Gdim to Bbm/F: Gdim has G, Bb, Db; Bbm has Bb, Db, F; so Bb and Db are common, and G moves to F? G to F is a step down.

Then Bbm/F to Ab/G: Bbm/F has F, Bb, Db; Ab/G has G, Ab, C, Eb; so no direct common tones, but F to G is step up, Bb to Ab step down, Db to C step down, and new Eb.

Then back to Gdim.

Then later Dbmaj7/F to Gdim: Dbmaj7/F has F, Db, Ab, C; Gdim has G, Bb, Db; so Db common, F to G step up, Ab to Bb step up, C to Bb step down? Not very smooth.

Perhaps the key is Ab major, and Gdim is the vii° which leads to I, but here it often goes to Eb/G which is V, so vii° to V is common.

In Ab major, vii° is Gdim, V is Eb, so Gdim to Eb is common.

Similarly, ii to V is common, so Bbm to Eb, but here we have Bbm/F to Ab/G, which is ii to I, but with Ab/G, which is I with G bass, so it might be a passing chord to Gdim or something.

Let's look at the sequence: after Bbm/F and Ab/G, it goes to Gdim, so perhaps Ab/G is acting as a approach to Gdim.

Ab/G has G in bass, and Gdim has G in root, so bass moves from G to G, but chord changes from Ab to Gdim.

Ab chord has Ab, C, Eb; Gdim has G, Bb, Db; so the voices: Ab to G, C to Bb, Eb to Db, all moving down by half step? Ab to G is half step down? Ab to G is a half step only if we consider Ab and G, but in equal temperament, Ab and G are adjacent, so yes, Ab to G is semitone down. C to Bb is whole step down? C to Bb is a whole step, not half step. C to B is half step, but Bb is whole step from C? Let's think in terms of notes.

C to Bb: C to B is half step, but Bb is one semitone below B? No, in pitch, C to B is half step, but B to Bb is half step, so C to Bb is a whole step? Let's list the frequencies.

In standard tuning, C to B is a semitone? No, C to B is a whole step? Let's recall the piano keyboard.

From C to B: C to C# is semitone, C# to D is semitone, ... up to B, so from C to B is 11 semitones? No, from C to B is a major seventh, which is 11 semitones, so it's not a step; it's a large interval.

I think I'm confusing myself with chord tones and voice leading.

When moving from Ab chord to Gdim chord, the notes are:

Ab chord: Ab, C, Eb

Gdim chord: G, Bb, Db

So the voice leading:

Ab to G: down one semitone? Ab to G: on piano, Ab is the black key left of A, G is the white key left of Ab, so from Ab to G is down one semitone? Yes, because from G to Ab is up semitone, so Ab to G is down semitone.

C to Bb: C to Bb is down one whole step? C to B is down semitone, but B to Bb is down semitone, so C to Bb is down two semitones, which is a whole step. Yes.

Eb to Db: Eb to D is down semitone? Eb to D is down whole step? Eb to D: from Eb to D is down one whole step because Eb to D is two semitones down? Let's see: from D to Eb is up semitone, so from Eb to D is down semitone? No.

D to Eb is up semitone, so Eb to D is down semitone. Similarly, Eb to Db: from Db to Eb is up whole step? Db to D is up semitone, D to Eb is up semitone, so Db to Eb is up two semitones, so Eb to Db is down two semitones, which is down whole step.

So from Eb to Db is down whole step.

So in voice leading from Ab to Gdim, all three voices move down: Ab to G down semitone, C to Bb down whole step, Eb to Db down whole step. So not all semitones, but two whole steps and one semitone.

But in music, this might be acceptable, but it's not the smoothest.

Perhaps the Gdim is not a triad but a diminished seventh chord. If Gdim7, it would be G, Bb, Db, E. Then from Ab to Gdim7: Ab to G down semitone, C to Bb down whole step, Eb to Db down whole step, and no fourth voice, or if we have four voices, from Ab chord we have Ab,C,Eb, and Gdim7 has G,Bb,Db,E, so C to E? C to E is up major third, not smooth.

So not ideal.

Another thought: perhaps the key is Eb major, and Gdim is a chromatic chord.

Let's list the chords based on their roots. The bass notes are often G, since many chords have G in bass.

From the progression: Gdim has bass G, Eb/G has bass G, Bbm/F has bass F, Ab/G has bass G, Dbmaj7/F has bass F, and Gdim has bass G.

So the bass alternates between G and F.

When bass is G, chords are Gdim or Eb/G or Ab/G.

When bass is F, chords are Bbm/F or Dbmaj7/F.

So bass G and F are prominent.

In many keys, G and F are scale degrees 5 and 4 or something.

Let's consider the key of C minor or C major.

In C major, G is V, F is IV.

But chords like Eb and Ab are not diatonic in C major.

In C minor, G is V, F is IV, but Eb is III, Ab is VI, so possible.

In C minor, the chords would be: i: Cm, ii°: Ddim, III: Eb, iv: Fm, v: Gm, VI: Ab, VII: Bb.

But we have Gdim, which is not Gm. Gdim would be a diminished chord on G, which is not diatonic in C minor. In C minor, the v chord is Gm, which is minor, not diminished.

So not C minor.

Perhaps the key is Bb major.

In Bb major: I: Bb, ii: Cm, iii: Dm, IV: Eb, V: F, vi: Gm, vii°: Adim.

We have Gdim, which is not Adim. We have Eb which is IV, Bbm which is not diatonic because Bbm would be bI or something, not diatonic. Bbm is minor, but in Bb major, ii is Cm, so Bbm is not in the scale.

Ab is bVII in Bb major, which is common in rock music, but then Gdim doesn't fit.

Another idea: perhaps the Gdim is actually a mislabeled chord, or it's functioning as a leading tone to Ab.

Let's consider that Gdim is the vii° of Ab, as I thought earlier.

But why the Ab/G chord? Ab/G is like I with added seventh, but in inversion, it could be a dominant chord.

Ab/G can be seen as G7b9? G7b9 is G, B, D, F, Ab? So G7b9 has G, B, F, Ab? But B is not in Ab/G, which has Ab, C, Eb, so instead of B, it has C, and instead of F, it has Eb? So not G7b9.

Ab/G has notes G, Ab, C, Eb. This could be interpreted as an Eb minor chord over G? Eb minor would be Eb, Gb, Bb, not this.

Perhaps it's a polychord or something.

Let's look at the overall progression. The progression has Gdim repeated, then Eb/G, then Gdim, then Bbm/F and Ab/G, then Gdim, then Eb/G, then Gdim, then Dbmaj7/F, then Gdim.

So the Gdim appears frequently, and it starts and ends with Gdim, so perhaps Gdim is the tonic? But diminished chords are unstable, so they are not usually tonic.

Unless it's a diminished key, but that's rare.

Perhaps the mode is locrian or something, but locrian has diminished tonic, so if G is tonic, then G locrian would have G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, so chords would include Gdim, Ab, Bbm, C, Db, Eb, Fdim.

In this progression, we have Gdim, Eb, Bbm, Ab, Db, so all these chords are in G locrian? Let's see.

In G locrian, the chords would be: i: Gdim, II: Ab, III: Bb, iv: Cm, v: Ddim, VI: Eb, VII: F.

So we have Gdim (i), Eb (VI), Bbm (III? but Bbm is Bb minor, and in locrian, III is Bb major? In locrian, the scale is G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, so the chord on Bb is Bb, Db, F, which is Bb diminished? No, Bb chord in G locrian: Bb, Db, F? Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third, so it's a diminished chord? Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third, so overall, it's a minor chord? No, from Bb to F is diminished fifth? Bb to F is perfect fifth? Bb to F is perfect fifth? Bb to F is five semitones? Bb to F: Bb to B is semitone, B to C is semitone, C to C# is semitone, C# to D is semitone, D to D# is semitone, D# to E is semitone, E to F is semitone? Let's calculate: from Bb to F: Bb to B is 1 semitone, B to C is 1 semitone, C to C# is 1, C# to D is 1, D to D# is 1, D# to E is 1, E to F is 1? That's too many.

Standard interval: from Bb to F is a perfect fifth. In terms of semitones, from Bb to F is 7 semitones? Bb to B is 1, B to C is 2, C to C# is 3, C# to D is 4, D to D# is 5, D# to E is 6, E to F is 7? But from Bb to B is 1 semitone, B to C is 1 semitone, so from Bb to C is 2 semitones, to C# is 3, to D is 4, to D# is 5, to E is 6, to F is 7 semitones. Yes, so Bb to F is 7 semitones, which is a perfect fifth.

So in Bb chord, Bb to F is perfect fifth, so it is a major chord? But Bb to Db is minor third, so Bb, Db, F is Bb minor chord, because the third is minor.

In G locrian scale, the notes are G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F. So the chord built on Bb would be Bb, Db, F, which is Bb minor chord, because Bb to Db is minor third, and Db to F is major third, so it is a minor chord. Similarly, chord on Eb would be Eb, G, Bb? Eb to G is major third, G to Bb is minor third, so Eb major chord. Chord on Ab would be Ab, C, Eb, which is Ab major chord. Chord on Db would be Db, F, Ab, which is Db major chord. Chord on G would be G, Bb, Db, which is G diminished chord because G to Bb is minor third, Bb to Db is minor third, so diminished triad.

So in G locrian, i is Gdim, II is Ab major, III is Bb minor, iv is C minor, v is Ddim, VI is Eb major, VII is F major.

Now, look at our chords: Gdim, Eb/G, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F.

So Gdim is i, Eb is VI, Bbm is III, Ab is II, Db is IV? In locrian, IV is Db major, so Dbmaj7 is IV maj7.

And the slash chords indicate inversions: Eb/G means VI chord with root in bass? Eb/G has Eb chord with G bass, but in locrian, the VI chord is Eb major, and G is the third of Eb, so Eb/G is first inversion of VI chord.

Similarly, Bbm/F is III chord with F bass, and F is the fifth of Bbm, so it's second inversion? Bbm chord is Bb, Db, F, so with F bass, it's root position? No, if chord is Bbm and bass is F, since F is the fifth, it is second inversion only if the root is not in bass. In root position, bass is Bb, so if bass is F, it is second inversion.

Similarly, Ab/G is II chord with G bass, but G is not a chord tone of Ab major? Ab major has Ab, C, Eb, so G is not in the chord, so Ab/G is not an inversion; it's a slash chord with non-chord tone in bass. In locrian, G is the tonic, so having Ab chord with G bass might be a passing thing.

Dbmaj7/F is IV chord with F bass, and F is the third of Db, so it's first inversion of IV maj7.

So in G locrian, we have i, VI, III, II, IV, and i.

But the progression has Ab/G, which is II with G bass, and G is the tonic, so this might be a way to emphasize the tonic in bass while playing II chord.

Similarly, the frequent Gdim chords reinforce the tonic.

So it seems that the key is G locrian.

But let's confirm if all chords are diatonic to G locrian.

G locrian scale: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F

Chords:

- Gdim: G, Bb, Db → all in scale

- Eb/G: Eb, G, Bb → all in scale

- Bbm/F: Bb, Db, F → all in scale

- Ab/G: Ab, C, Eb with G bass → the chord tones Ab, C, Eb are in scale, and G bass is in scale, so it's fine.

- Dbmaj7/F: Db, F, Ab, C with F bass → all notes in scale.

So yes, all chords are diatonic to G locrian.

Therefore, the key is G locrian.

So the key is G, and the mode is locrian.

But in the progression, we have Dbmaj7 which is IV, and in locrian, IV is major, which is correct.

Also, the progression starts and ends with Gdim, which is the tonic chord in locrian.

So this makes sense.

Therefore, the key is G locrian.

The chord progression provided is entirely diatonic to the G locrian mode. The G locrian scale consists of the notes G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, which form the following chords:

- i: G diminished (Gdim)
- II: Ab major (Ab)
- III: Bb minor (Bbm)
- iv: C minor (Cm)
- v: D diminished (Ddim)
- VI: Eb major (Eb)
- VII: F major (F)

In the progression:
- Gdim functions as the tonic chord (i).
- Eb/G is the VI chord (Eb major) in first inversion, with G in the bass.
- Bbm/F is the III chord (Bb minor) in second inversion, with F in the bass.
- Ab/G is the II chord (Ab major) with G in the bass, emphasizing the tonic note.
- Dbmaj7/F is the IV chord (Db major with a major seventh) in first inversion, with F in the bass.

The frequent use of Gdim, both at the beginning and end of the progression, reinforces G as the tonal center, consistent with the locrian mode. The bass movement between G and F further supports the locrian character.

Thus, the key is G, and the mode is locrian.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## 1. List the chords clearly

The progression is:

**Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Eb/G** – **Eb/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Bbm/F** – **Ab/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Eb/G** – **Eb/G** – **Gdim** – **Gdim** – **Dbmaj7/F** – **Gdim**

---

## 2. Identify chord qualities and roots

- **Gdim** = G diminished triad (G B♭ D♭) — could be vii° in some key.
- **Eb/G** = Eb major triad with G in bass (Eb G B♭).
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ minor triad with F in bass (B♭ D♭ F).
- **Ab/G** = A♭ major triad with G in bass (A♭ C E♭) — G is not in the chord, so it’s a slash chord creating tension.
- **Dbmaj7/F** = D♭maj7 (D♭ F A♭ C) with F in bass.

---

## 3. Look for a key

Let’s check possible keys by grouping these chords:

**Gdim** = G B♭ D♭ = could be from A♭ harmonic minor (Gdim = vii° of A♭ minor) or from B harmonic minor (Gdim = ii°? No, that’s G♯dim).  
Also could be from E harmonic minor (Gdim = iii°? No, that’s G♯dim again).  
So Gdim is vii° of A♭ harmonic minor, or could be a common-tone diminished in other keys.

**Eb** = E♭ major = could be IV of B♭ major, or V of A♭ major, or I of E♭ major, etc.

**Bbm** = B♭ minor = i of B♭ minor, or iv of F minor, or vi of D♭ major.

**Ab** = A♭ major = IV of E♭ major, or I of A♭ major, or V of D♭ major.

**Dbmaj7** = D♭ major 7 = I of D♭ major, or IV of A♭ major, or bVI of F minor.

---

## 4. Try to find a consistent key

Let’s test **A♭ major**:

- Gdim = not diatonic to A♭ major (A♭ major scale: A♭ B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G). Gdim has G B♭ D♭ — G natural is in A♭ major, but B♭ and D♭ are in A♭ major, but G B♭ D♭ is G half-diminished (G B♭ D♭ F) if it were m7b5, but here it’s just G B♭ D♭ = G diminished triad = G B♭ D♭ F♭? Wait, D♭ is same as C♯, but in A♭ major, the 7th is G, so G B♭ D♭ = G B♭ C♯? That’s not in A♭ major. So Gdim is not in A♭ major.

So Gdim is a borrowed chord from A♭ minor (harmonic).

---

## 5. Try **A♭ minor** (natural/harmonic)

A♭ natural minor: A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F♭ G♭ — chords:  
i A♭m, ii° B♭dim, III C♭ major (B major), iv D♭m, v E♭m, VI F♭ major (E major), VII G♭ major.

Gdim is not in natural minor.  
A♭ harmonic minor: A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E♭ F♭ G (natural) —  
chords: i A♭m(maj7), ii° B♭dim, III+ C♭aug, iv D♭m, V E♭, VI F♭maj7, vii° Gdim.

Yes! Gdim = vii° of A♭ harmonic minor.

So Eb = V of A♭ minor (harmonic).  
Bbm = ? B♭ D♭ F♭ — that’s B♭ diminished in A♭ harmonic minor, not Bbm. So Bbm is not in A♭ harmonic minor. So maybe Bbm is borrowed.

---

## 6. Try **D♭ major**

D♭ major scale: D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭ C  
Chords:  
I D♭, ii E♭m, iii Fm, IV G♭, V A♭, vi B♭m, vii° Cdim.

Our chords:  
Gdim = not in D♭ major.  
Eb = E♭ major? No, in D♭ major, E♭ is minor (E♭ G♭ B♭). So Eb major is not in D♭ major.  
Bbm = B♭ minor? In D♭ major, B♭ is minor (B♭ D♭ F) — yes! B♭m is vi of D♭ major.  
Ab = A♭ major = V of D♭ major — yes.  
Dbmaj7 = I of D♭ major — yes.

So D♭ major fits Bbm, Ab, Dbmaj7, but not Gdim or Eb major.

---

## 7. Try **E♭ minor**?  

E♭ natural minor: E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭  
Harmonic minor: E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭ C♭ D  
Chords in E♭ harmonic minor: i E♭m, ii° Fdim, III+ G♭aug, iv A♭m, V B♭, VI C♭, vii° Ddim.

Gdim doesn’t fit.

---

## 8. Try **B♭ minor**

B♭ natural minor: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭  
Harmonic: B♭ C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A  
Chords in B♭ harmonic minor: i B♭m, ii° Cdim, III+ D♭aug, iv E♭m, V F, VI G♭, vii° Adim.

Gdim doesn’t fit.

---

## 9. Maybe **Gdim** is a common-tone diminished with G as pedal tone

Bass G appears in Gdim, Eb/G, Ab/G, Dbmaj7/F (F bass though), but G is in many chords.  
Gdim could be functioning as a chromatic passing chord.

---

## 10. Look at overall progression

Eb major and Ab major are IV and I in A♭ major, or V and I in D♭ major.  
Bbm is vi in D♭ major.  
Dbmaj7 is I in D♭ major.

So likely **key of D♭ major**, with Gdim as a common-tone diminished (G B♭ D♭ = actually G B♭ D♭ is enharmonic to G B♭ C♯, which is an altered chord, maybe from D♭ minor or just a diminished passing chord).

---

## 11. Mode

D♭ major is **Ionian mode**.

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{Db\ major}
\]

**Assistant - GLM 4.6 Thinking**

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**
    *   **Input:** A sequence of chords: `Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim`
    *   **Task:** Determine the key and mode.

2.  **Initial Impression & First Pass Analysis:**
    *   The chords are unusual. Lots of diminished chords (`Gdim`), slash chords (`Eb/G`, `Bbm/F`, `Ab/G`, `Dbmaj7/F`), and one major 7th chord (`Dbmaj7/F`).
    *   The repetition of `Gdim` is a huge clue. It's clearly a central, recurring harmonic idea.
    *   The slash chords are also important. Let's analyze them individually:
        *   `Eb/G`: This is an Eb major triad (Eb - G - Bb) with G in the bass. This is the first inversion of Eb major.
        *   `Bbm/F`: This is a Bb minor triad (Bb - Db - F) with F in the bass. This is the first inversion of Bb minor.
        *   `Ab/G`: This is an Ab major triad (Ab - C - Eb) with G in the bass. This is not a standard inversion. The notes are G, Ab, C, Eb. This sounds like an Abmaj7#11 or a G Phrygian dominant sound (G - Ab - C - Eb). Let's hold that thought.
        *   `Dbmaj7/F`: This is a Db major 7th chord (Db - F - Ab - C) with F in the bass. This is the third inversion of Dbmaj7.

3.  **Identify the Pools of Notes:**
    *   Let's list all the unique notes present in all the chords.
    *   `Gdim`: G - Bb - Db
    *   `Eb/G`: Eb - G - Bb
    *   `Bbm/F`: Bb - Db - F
    *   `Ab/G`: Ab - C - Eb - G
    *   `Dbmaj7/F`: Db - F - Ab - C
    *   **All unique notes:** G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab, C.
    *   Let's arrange them in order: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.
    *   This is a 7-note collection. What scale is this?
        *   It looks like a standard major scale but with a flat 2 and flat 5... wait, no.
        *   Let's check it against a major scale. C major? No, has Ab, Db, Eb. Gb major? No, has C.
        *   Let's check it against a minor scale. C minor? C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. We have all those except D. We have a Db instead. So, it's almost C natural minor, but with a D♭ instead of a D. This is a C *Phrygian* scale (C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb). Let's check: C Phrygian has the notes C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Our collection is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. This is the *exact same set of notes*, just starting on Ab.
        *   Let's check another mode. Ab Lydian? Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. We have a Db, not a D natural. So, not Ab Lydian.
        *   Ab Mixolydian? Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb. We have a G natural, not Gb. Not Ab Mixolydian.
        *   Let's go back to C Phrygian. The notes are C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. This matches our collection perfectly. So, the pitch collection is C Phrygian.

4.  **Re-evaluating the Chords in Light of C Phrygian:**
    *   The tonic of C Phrygian is C.
    *   The chords in C Phrygian would be built from these notes:
        *   C minor (Cm7): C - Eb - G - Bb
        *   Db major (Dbmaj7): Db - F - Ab - C
        *   Eb major (Ebmaj7): Eb - G - Bb - D (we don't have D, so this is tricky)
        *   F minor (Fm7): F - Ab - C - Eb
        *   G diminished (Gø7): G - Bb - Db - F
        *   Ab major (Abmaj7): Ab - C - Eb - G
        *   Bb minor (Bbm7): Bb - Db - F - Ab
    *   Now let's map the given chords to this C Phrygian landscape:
        *   `Gdim`: This is the `viio` chord in C Phrygian (or more accurately, the `viiø7` without the 7th). It strongly wants to resolve to Cm. This is a very strong piece of evidence.
        *   `Eb/G`: This is the `III` chord (Eb major) in first inversion. It functions as a tonic-like chord in Phrygian because it contains the tonic note C (well, not in the triad itself, but it's part of the overall harmony). The bass note G is also a strong note in the key.
        *   `Bbm/F`: This is the `v` chord (Bbm) in first inversion. The F is the subdominant of C. This is a common pre-dominant function.
        *   `Ab/G`: This is the `VI` chord (Abmaj7) with a G in the bass. The notes G, Ab, C, Eb create an Abmaj7#11 sound, which is very characteristic of the Lydian mode, but here it's being used in a Phrygian context. The G in the bass is the leading tone *to* Ab, but it's also the root of our main `Gdim` chord. This is a very interesting, ambiguous chord.
        *   `Dbmaj7/F`: This is the `II` chord (Dbmaj7) in third inversion. This is the characteristic Phrygian chord, the ♭II major chord (the "Neapolitan" chord). It strongly establishes the Phrygian sound.

5.  **Synthesizing the Analysis and Forming a Hypothesis:**
    *   **Primary Hypothesis:** The key is **C Phrygian**.
    *   **Evidence:**
        1.  The complete collection of notes across all chords (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G) is exactly the C Phrygian scale.
        2.  The most prominent and recurring chord is `Gdim` (G, Bb, Db), which is the `viiø7` chord of C Phrygian. It functions as a dominant to the tonic Cm (even though Cm isn't explicitly played, it's strongly implied).
        3.  The presence of `Dbmaj7/F` (the `II` chord) is the "smoking gun" for Phrygian. The ♭II major chord is the defining feature of the Phrygian mode's sound.
        4.  The other chords (`Eb/G`, `Bbm/F`, `Ab/G`) all fit neatly within the C Phrygian diatonic harmony. The slash chords suggest a descending or stepwise bass line, which is a common compositional device. Let's look at the bass notes: G, G, G, G, G, F, G, G, G, G, G, G, G, F, G. The bass is predominantly G, with two brief motions down to F. This G is the root of the `Gdim` chord, reinforcing its importance. The G is also the 5th of the implied Cm tonic.

6.  **Considering Alternatives (and why they are less likely):**
    *   **Could it be G minor?** G minor has G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. Our chords have Db and Ab, not A or D. So, no.
    *   **Could it be Eb Major?** Eb major has Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. Our chords have Db, not D. So, no. The `Gdim` chord would be a `#ivdim` in Eb, which is possible, but the `Dbmaj7` would be a `♭VII` and the `Bbm` would be a `iii`. The presence of both Db and D natural is the conflict. Since we have Db and no D, Eb major is out.
    *   **Could it be Db Major?** Db major has Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. Our chords have G natural, not Gb. So, no.
    *   **Could it be Ab Lydian?** Ab Lydian has Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G. We have Db, not D. So, no.
    *   **Could it be A♭ Phrygian?** A♭ Phrygian is Ab, Bbb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb. That's not even close.
    *   **Could it be G Phrygian?** G Phrygian is G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. We have Db, not D. So, no.
    *   **Could it be something more "out there"?** Like a symmetrical scale or a non-diatonic collection?
        *   The notes (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G) form a perfect diatonic scale (C Phrygian). There's no need to invoke more complex explanations like octatonic or diminished scales, which would have different interval structures (e.g., whole-half, half-whole). The fact that it maps perfectly to a standard mode is the strongest argument.

7.  **Finalizing the Answer:**
    *   Start with the direct answer: The key is **C Phrygian**.
    *   Provide the step-by-step reasoning.
    *   **Step 1: Analyze the Pitches.** List all the unique notes from the chords. Show how they form the C Phrygian scale.
    *   **Step 2: Identify the Tonic.** Explain why C is the tonic, even though a Cm chord isn't played. The `Gdim` chord acts as a `viiø7` leading strongly to the implied Cm. The entire harmonic collection revolves around this C tonal center.
    *   **Step 3: Highlight the "Modal Fingerprint" Chord.** Point out the `Dbmaj7/F` chord as the `♭II` (Neapolitan) chord, which is the defining characteristic of the Phrygian mode.
    *   **Step 4: Explain the other chords.** Show how `Gdim`, `Eb/G`, `Bbm/F`, and `Ab/G` all function diatonically within C Phrygian. Mention the pedal point on G in the bass, which grounds the harmony and emphasizes the dominant feel of the `Gdim` chord.
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize that the combination of the specific pitch collection, the functional pull of the `Gdim` to an implied Cm, and the presence of the `♭II` chord makes C Phrygian the only logical conclusion.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **C Phrygian**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. Collect All the Pitches

First, let's identify every unique note present in all the chords:

*   **Gdim**: G - Bb - Db
*   **Eb/G**: Eb - G - Bb
*   **Bbm/F**: Bb - Db - F
*   **Ab/G**: Ab - C - Eb - G
*   **Dbmaj7/F**: Db - F - Ab - C

Combining these, the complete set of notes used is:
**Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G**

### 2. Identify the Scale/Mode

Now, let's arrange these notes in order to see what scale they form. Starting on C, we get:

**C - Db - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb**

This is the C Phrygian mode. The Phrygian mode is characterized by its minor 2nd (Db) and minor 6th (Ab) scale degrees.

### 3. Analyze the Chord Functions in C Phrygian

Let's look at how each chord functions within the key of C Phrygian. The tonic (the "home" chord) would be C minor (Cm7). Although Cm is never explicitly played, the entire progression is built to create a strong pull towards it.

*   **Gdim (G-Bb-Db):** This is the **viiø7** chord of C Phrygian. It's built on the 7th degree and functions as a dominant chord, creating intense tension that wants to resolve to the tonic Cm. The fact that this chord is repeated so often makes it the central harmonic driver of the progression.

*   **Dbmaj7/F (Db-F-Ab-C):** This is the **♭II** chord, also known as the Neapolitan chord. This is the "fingerprint" chord of the Phrygian mode. The presence of a major chord built on the flattened 2nd degree (Db) is the single biggest indicator of a Phrygian tonality.

*   **Eb/G (Eb-G-Bb):** This is the **III** chord (Ebmajor) in first inversion. In Phrygian, the III chord often serves as a temporary tonic or a way to prolong the tonic feel, as it shares many notes with the Cm7 chord (C, Eb, G, Bb).

*   **Bbm/F (Bb-Db-F):** This is the **v** chord (Bb minor) in first inversion. It's a subdominant chord, leading naturally to the Gdim (viiø7).

*   **Ab/G (Ab-C-Eb-G):** This is the **VI** chord (Abmaj7) with a G in the bass. The notes form an Abmaj7#11, which adds a Lydian-flavored color, but it functions diatonically as the submediant (vi) chord in C Phrygian.

### 4. The Role of the Bass Line

Notice the bass notes: **G, G, G, F, G, F, G**.
The bass is heavily centered on **G**, the root of the dominant `Gdim` chord. This creates a dominant pedal point, which constantly reinforces the tension and the need to resolve to the C tonic. The brief movements down to F (the 4th degree of C) provide a momentary release before returning to the G tension.

### Conclusion

The evidence overwhelmingly points to **C Phrygian**:

1.  **Pitch Collection:** The notes used are exactly those of the C Phrygian scale.
2.  **Modal Fingerprint:** The presence of the `Dbmaj7` (♭II) chord is the defining characteristic of the Phrygian mode.
3.  **Harmonic Function:** The progression is built around the tension of the `Gdim` (viiø7) chord resolving to an implied Cm tonic.

While the tonic chord itself is absent, the entire harmonic structure is designed to make you hear C as the "home" note, which is the essence of modal harmony.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing the Progression's Core**

I'm currently focused on the diminished chords within this progression. It's becoming clear that the $G^{\circ}$ keeps recurring, which is interesting. Considering how the bass note changes with the $Eb/G$ is also shaping my understanding. Now I am trying to figure out where to go from here.


**Exploring Harmonic Functionality**

I'm now investigating the potential harmonic functions. The initial $G^{\circ}$ chords point toward a possible chromatic approach. I'm noting the movement between $G^{\circ}$ and the various bass notes in the $Eb/G$ and the $Bbm/F$ chords. I believe I am getting closer to figuring out the underlying principles.


**Deconstructing Key Signatures**

Now, I'm trying to definitively categorize the key signatures. The dominance of $Eb$ and $Bbm$ is interesting, and the $G^{\circ}$ keeps recurring. Considering how $G^{\circ}$ might function as a chromatic passing chord helps me formulate this concept. I need to figure out its relationship within $Eb$ major.


**Re-evaluating the Framework**

I am now weighing the potential key centers more carefully. The $G^{\circ}$ keeps defying easy categorization. I'm leaning towards the idea that the diminished chord and the subsequent ones aren't straightforwardly functional, especially given the constant movement towards $Eb$. The Dbmaj7 is now making me rethink everything.


**Revising Key Center Theories**

I'm now back to the key center, but with a new perspective. After several passes, it is now seeming much more appropriate to consider the role of $G$ as a central tone. The constant return to the $Eb$ chords does not automatically suggest it's the tonic. I'm exploring the $G$ with the $G^{\circ}$ chords.


**Refining Key Determinations**

The Locrian scale's emergence is changing everything. My focus is now on how $G$ functions as the root within that Locrian framework. I am weighing the implication of a $G$ Locrian center, and the implications of it for a jazz-influenced piece. The next step is a deep dive into the implications of this.


**Re-examining Locrian's Significance**

I'm now integrating the modal context of $G$ Locrian. Understanding the chord functions within this mode is key. Identifying the roles of $Eb$, $Dbmaj7$, and $Bbm$ is proving helpful in forming a comprehensive understanding. The overall plan is now evolving, and I need to solidify the tonal center.


**Synthesizing Modal Evidence**

I'm now integrating the modal evidence. The $G$ Locrian mode feels right, but understanding chord functions within this mode is the next challenge. Specifically, I'm examining how each chord relates to the tonic and how it adds to the overall harmonic texture. My focus is on $G^{\circ}$ and its role.




The chords provided are:

$G^{\circ}$, $G^{\circ}$, $Eb/G$, $Eb/G$,
$G^{\circ}$, $G^{\circ}$, $Bbm/F$, $Ab/G$,
$G^{\circ}$, $G^{\circ}}$, $Eb/G$, $Eb/G$,
$G^{\circ}$, $G^{\circ}}$, $Dbmaj7/F$, $G^{\circ}$

### 1. Identifying the Key Center

The chord that dominates the entire progression is $G^{\circ}$ (G diminished triad: G, Bb, Db). It appears thirteen times and usually begins and ends phrases, making **G** the clear tonal center (tonic).

### 2. Deriving the Scale/Mode

To determine the mode, we compile all unique notes present in the chords:

*   $G^{\circ}$: G, Bb, Db
*   $Eb/G$: Eb, G, Bb (already present)
*   $Bbm/F$: F, Bb, Db (already present)
*   $Ab/G$: Ab, C, Eb (already present)
*   $Dbmaj7/F$: Db, F, Ab, C (all notes already present)

The collected pitch set is: **G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F**.

### 3. Analyzing the Scale

We compare the derived scale to the major scale formula (1 2 3 4 5 6 7) by treating G as the root (1):

| Interval | Note in G | Major Scale | Deviation |
| :------: | :-------: | :---------: | :-------: |
| Root (1) | G | G | |
| b2 | Ab | A | b2 |
| b3 | Bb | B | b3 |
| 4 | C | C | |
| b5 | Db | D | b5 |
| b6 | Eb | E | b6 |
| b7 | F | F | b7 |

The mode sequence **1, b2, b3, 4, b5, b6, b7** is the definition of the **Locrian mode**.

### 4. Chord Function in G Locrian

The tonic triad of the G Locrian mode is $G^{\circ}$ (G diminished), which perfectly matches the dominant chord in the progression.

*   $G^{\circ}$ is the tonic ($i^{\circ}$).
*   $Eb$ Major ($Eb-G-Bb$) is the $\text{bVI}$ chord.
*   $Bbm$ ($Bb-Db-F$) is the $\text{bIII}$ minor chord.
*   $Ab$ ($Ab-C-Eb$) is the $\text{bII}$ major chord (Neapolitan).

All chords are diatonic to the $G$ Locrian scale (which is the seventh mode of $Ab$ Major).

---

### Conclusion

The Key is **G** and the Mode is **Locrian**.

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

The chords provided are:

* **Gdim** (G diminished: G - B♭ - D♭)
* **Eb/G** (First inversion of E♭ major: G - B♭ - E♭)
* **Bbm/F** (First inversion of B♭ minor: F - G# - B♭ - D♭, or simplified F - B♭ - D♭) - *If it's Bbm, the notes are B♭ - D♭ - F. In F inversion, the bass is F.*
* **Ab/G** (Ab major over G: G - A♭ - C - E♭) - *This is a very unusual voicing. Standard Ab/G is G - A♭ - C - E♭.*
* **Dbmaj7/F** (First inversion of D♭ major 7: F - D♭ - F - A♭ - C)

Let's look at the roots and the overall harmonic landscape.

### Harmonic Analysis

The progression is highly cyclical and relies heavily on the **G diminished chord** (Gdim).

| Chord | Function/Context | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gdim | Diminished (often vii° or secondary function) | G - B♭ - D♭ |
| Eb/G | E♭ major (Tonic or relative major) | G - B♭ - E♭ |
| Gdim | Diminished (Repeated emphasis) | G - B♭ - D♭ |
| Bbm/F | B♭ minor | F - B♭ - D♭ |
| Ab/G | A♭ major (Subdominant or related) | G - A♭ - C - E♭ |
| Gdim | Diminished (Core focus) | G - B♭ - D♭ |
| Eb/G | E♭ major | G - B♭ - E♭ |
| Gdim | Diminished | G - B♭ - D♭ |
| Dbmaj7/F | D♭ Major 7 | F - A♭ - C - D♭ |
| Gdim | Diminished | G - B♭ - D♭ |

### Identifying the Key and Mode

1. **Major Chords Present:** E♭ Major, A♭ Major, D♭ Major 7.
2. **Minor Chords Present:** B♭ Minor.
3. **Diminished Chords Present:** G diminished.

These chords strongly align with the key of **E♭ Major**:
* E♭ Major = I
* A♭ Major = IV
* B♭ Minor = vi (B♭ minor substitute for Cm, or borrowed bvi from E♭ minor) - *If we assume **E♭ Natural Minor** (E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭), then B♭m is v.*
* D♭ Major = $\text{bVII}$ (Borrowed from E♭ minor/Phrygian)
* G Diminished = vii° in A♭ harmonic minor, or a $\text{V}^{7}$ substitute in E♭ major if it resolves to Cm.

The most characteristic chords (E♭, A♭, B♭m, D♭maj7) point toward a close relationship with **E♭**.

Let's test the scales related to E♭:

* **E♭ Major:** E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D (The presence of D♭ instead of D natural strongly contradicts E♭ Major as the mode.)
* **E♭ Natural Minor (Aeolian):** E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭
* **E♭ Dorian:** E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, D♭
* **E♭ Phrygian:** E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭

The key notes involved in the chords are: **G, B♭, D♭, E♭, F, A♭, C.** (No G♭ or C♭, but D♭ is prominent).

Based on the evidence:
* **E♭ Major (I):** E♭/G is a strong resting harmony (though inverted).
* **A♭ Major (IV):** Used prominently.
* **D♭ (bVII):** D♭maj7 is the most prominent characteristic non-major key chord.
* **G (Gdim):** The root G serves as the bass of the I chord (E♭/G) and the ubiquitous Gdim chord.

The collection of notes (E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭) corresponds to the **E♭ Dorian** scale, given the prominence of the natural 6th (C) from A♭Maj and C in the structure of Gdim (if Gdim is analyzed as a subset of other chords), and the lowered 7th (D♭).

* **E♭ Dorian Analysis:**
    * **i:** E♭ Minor (E♭, G♭, B♭) - *We see E♭ Major related chords (E♭/G), which means the mode is not purely Aeolian or Dorian.*
    * **ii°:** F diminished (F, A♭, C♭)
    * **bIII:** G♭ Major
    * **IV:** A♭ Major (Present)
    * **v:** B♭ Minor (Present)
    * **vi°:** C diminished (C, E♭, G♭)
    * **bVII:** D♭ Major (Present as D♭maj7)

The presence of the **G natural** in the E♭/G and Gdim chords strongly suggests that we are operating in a mode that contains the Natural 3rd of E♭ (G), which is characteristic of the **E♭ Major** side, not E♭ minor.

However, the other core chords (B♭m, D♭maj7) scream **E♭ Aeolian (Natural Minor)** or **E♭ Dorian**.

**The typical jazz/contemporary key that features I (Major), bVII (Major), and iv/v (minor) is the Key of the Parallel Minor borrowing the Major Tonic.**

* **Focusing on the Tonic and the bVII:** The progression cycles around E♭ (as the harmonic center) and uses the $\text{bVII}$ chord (D♭maj7), a classic indicator of **E♭ Mixolydian** or borrowing from E♭ natural minor.

Let's re-examine the core tension: **G natural** versus **D♭ natural**.

The key signature is dominated by the flat side of the circle (E♭, A♭, D♭, B♭).

**Conclusion based on Harmonic Center and Characteristic Chords:**

The key center is clearly **E♭**. The overall collection of dominant chords (E♭, A♭) and the powerful use of D♭maj7 ($\text{bVII}$) and B♭m $(\text{v})$ indicates a dark, mixed-mode harmony.

The presence of the G natural means the key signature is not strictly E♭ Aeolian. It is closest to **E♭ Dorian** if we interpret Gdim as a substitute, or more likely **E♭ Mixed Mode**.

In common music theory terms, when a section strongly establishes the major tonic (E♭) but draws heavily from its parallel minor (D♭, B♭m), we determine the key by the tonic and the overall mood by the mode.

Thus, the **Key is E♭**.

The **Mode** is highly suggestive of **Dorian** or **Aeolian borrows**, but because the G is natural (the Major 3rd of E♭) in the harmony:

* **This progression is rooted in E♭ Major, but heavily utilizes modal interchange from E♭ Natural Minor (Aeolian).**

The specific combination of $I^{maj}$, $bVII^{maj}$, and $v^{min}$ is too structurally unstable to fit cleanly into a single heptatonic mode, but it is typical of minor modal borrowing used over a major tonic.

### Final Determination:

**Key:** **E♭** (as the clear harmonic center and tonic)
**Mode:** **Mixed Mode** (Primarily E♭ Major with heavy borrowing from **E♭ Aeolian** (bVII, v/Bbm) and the pervasive use of Gdim as a highly chromatic color.)

*If forced to choose a simple mode that contains the strongest elements (E♭, A♭, B♭m, D♭), **E♭ Dorian** is the closest fit, even though G natural contradicts D♭ natural in that structure. However, the use of E♭ major chords in the progression (E♭/G) means we must define this as a major-key center borrowing minor harmony.*
