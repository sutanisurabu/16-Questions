To determine the **key and mode** of the chord progression:

```
Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Bbm/F – Ab/G – Gdim – Gdim – Eb/G – Eb/G – Gdim – Gdim – Dbmaj7/F – Gdim
```

Let’s analyze step by step.

---

### Step 1: Look at the Chord Types and Notes

First, list the chords with their notes:

- **Gdim** = G – B♭ – D♭  
- **Eb/G** = G – B♭ – E♭ (first inversion of Eb major)  
- **Bbm/F** = F – B♭ – D♭ (first inversion of B♭ minor)  
- **Ab/G** = G – A♭ – C – E♭ (Ab major with G in the bass – essentially a G bass under Ab major)  
- **Dbmaj7/F** = F – A♭ – C – D♭ (first inversion of Db major 7)

So the main pitch classes used across all chords are:

- **G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F**

That’s **7 notes**, which correspond to the **key of D♭ major** (or its relative B♭ minor):

**D♭ major scale**: D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭ – C

Wait—but we have **G natural**, not G♭. That’s a red flag.

Hold on: **G natural** is **not** in D♭ major (which has G♭). So maybe it’s **C♯ major?** That also has G♯, not G.

So perhaps the key isn’t D♭ major.

Let’s consider **E♭ minor** or **G♭ major**? Still has G♭.

But we keep seeing **G natural**, **B♭**, **D♭**, **E♭**, **A♭**, **C**, and **F**.

Let’s list the notes **chromatically**:

- G (natural)
- A♭
- B♭
- C
- D♭
- E♭
- F

This is a **7-note collection** missing only **D, E, A, B**. It includes both **G** and **A♭**, which are a half step apart—so it’s **not** a standard diatonic scale.

But notice: this is the **G half-whole diminished scale** (also called the **octatonic scale**), but that has 8 notes. However, these 7 notes are a subset.

Alternatively, consider **enharmonic reinterpretation**.

### Step 2: Reconsider Enharmonics – Is it Really in C Minor?

What if we reinterpret **D♭ as C#** and **G as G**? Then the dim chord is **G–B♭–C#**, which is an **E diminished** chord (E–G–B♭–C# is a fully diminished 7th). But that may not help.

Alternatively, think in **E♭ minor**:

- E♭ natural minor: E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭ – C♭ – D♭  
Again, G♭, not G.

But **E♭ harmonic minor**: E♭ – F – G – A♭ – B♭ – C♭ – D  
→ Has G natural! But also **C♭ (which is B)**, and **D natural**, which we **don’t have** in our chords.

Our chords **never use D natural or B natural**, so probably not E♭ harmonic minor.

### Step 3: Look for a Common Tonal Center

Notice that **Gdim** appears **very frequently**—it’s the backbone.

Also, **Eb/G** (Eb major with G in the bass) appears regularly.

So perhaps the tonal center is **G**, and the harmony is **modal or chromatic**.

But **G diminished** is not a tonic chord in traditional tonality—it’s unstable.

However, in **jazz and film scoring**, **diminished chords** are often used as **passing chords** or to create tension.

Now consider **Dbmaj7/F**. That’s a very specific chord—it contains **F in the bass**, and the chord is **Db major 7**.

Notes: **F–Ab–C–Db**

Now, **Db major** is the **tritone away from G**. G and Db are tritone apart.

Also, **Gdim** is a subset of **G°7 = G–B♭–D♭–E**, which contains **E natural**, but our Gdim is likely just a **triad**, not a 7th.

But note: **G°7 (fully diminished)** can resolve to **Ab7**, which is the V7 of **Db major**.

Wait—look at the chord before **Dbmaj7/F**—it’s **Gdim**.

So **Gdim → Dbmaj7** is a **root movement by tritone**, which is a classic **diminished chord as dominant substitute**.

In fact, **G°7** is often used as a substitute for **E7**, which is the V7 of **Am**, but also can lead to **Ab7 → Db**.

But here we go **Gdim → Dbmaj7**, which strongly suggests **Db major** as a temporary tonic.

But again, **Db major has Gb, not G**.

Unless… the **G** in the bass (in Eb/G and Ab/G) is **not part of the key**, but a **pedal tone** or **chromatic passing tone**.

### Step 4: Consider G as a Pedal Tone

Many chords have **G in the bass**:

- Eb/G
- Ab/G
- Gdim
- Dbmaj7/F → but that’s F in bass

So **G** is a **common bass tone**, possibly a **pedal point**.

If **G is a pedal tone**, then the harmonies above are:
- Eb major (over G)
- Ab major (over G)
- Bbm (over F, though)
- Dbmaj7 (over F)

So maybe the **harmony is shifting**, and **G is a drone**.

This is common in **modal or cinematic music**.

Now, what key contains **Eb, Ab, Bbm, Db**?

Those are all chords in **Db major**:

- Db major diatonic chords:
  - I = Db
  - ii = Ebm
  - iii = Fm
  - IV = Gb
  - V = Ab
  - vi = Bbm
  - vii° = C°

But we have **Eb major**, not Eb minor. So that’s **not diatonic** to Db major.

But **Eb major** is the **Neapolitan chord (bII)** in **Db major**.

Similarly, **Ab** is **V**, **Bbm** is **vi**, **Db** is **I**.

So the chords **Eb, Ab, Bbm, Db** fit as **bII – V – vi – I** in **Db major**.

That’s a **plagal-like cadence** with Neapolitan.

And the **G in the bass**? In **Db major**, **G is Gb enharmonically**, but here it’s **G natural**, which is **enharmonically the #5 of Db** (since Db’s #5 is A, not G... wait no).

Actually, **G natural is the #11 or b5 of Db?**

- Db to G is an **augmented 4th (tritone)** → **G = #11** of Db.

So **G in the bass** under Db chords is a **tritone substitution or altered bass**.

In jazz, it’s common to use **tritone bass movement**.

But here, **G is static**.

### Step 5: Consider the Possibility of G Phrygian or G Locrian?

G Phrygian: G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D – E♭ – F  
→ Contains **G, A♭, B♭, C, D, E♭, F**

But our chords use **D♭**, not D natural.

So **not Phrygian**.

G Locrian: G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F  
→ **Exactly our notes!**

**G Locrian mode** = G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F

That’s the **7th mode of A♭ major**.

A♭ major scale: A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F – G

So **G Locrian** uses:
- G (root)
- A♭ (♭2)
- B♭ (♭3)
- C (4)
- D♭ (♭5)
- E♭ (♭6)
- F (♭7)

This matches **all the notes we see**:
- Gdim = G–B♭–D♭ → root, ♭3, ♭5 → **the tonic chord of Locrian**
- Eb/G = G–B♭–E♭ → G (root), ♭3, ♭6
- Bbm/F = F–B♭–D♭ → ♭7, ♭3, ♭5
- Ab/G = G–A♭–C–E♭ → root, ♭2, 4, ♭6 → essentially **Ab major over G**
- Dbmaj7/F = F–A♭–C–D♭ → ♭7, ♭2, 4, ♭5 → this is a bit odd in Locrian, but note: **Db is the ♭5 of G**, so **Db major** is built on the **♭5**, which is **not diatonic** to Locrian (Locrian has **Db minor**, not major).

Wait—in **G Locrian**, the **♭5 chord** is **Db diminished or Db minor**, not **Db major**.

**Db major** has **F**, which is in the scale, and **A♭**, also in the scale, and **C**, also in the scale, and **Db**.

So **Db major** = Db–F–Ab–C → all notes are in **G Locrian**!

Check:
- Db = ♭5 → yes
- F = ♭7 → yes
- Ab = ♭2 → yes
- C = 4 → yes

So **Db major** is a **diatonic chord** in **G Locrian**? Let’s build the diatonic triads of G Locrian:

G Locrian (from A♭ major):
- G – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭ – F – G

Triads:
1. G – B♭ – D♭ → **Gdim** (i°)
2. A♭ – C – E♭ → **Ab major** (♭II)
3. B♭ – D♭ – F → **Bbm** (♭iii)
4. C – E♭ – G → **Cm** (iv)
5. D♭ – F – A♭ → **Db major** (♭V)
6. E♭ – G – B♭ → **Ebm** (♭VI)
7. F – A♭ – C → **Fm** (♭vii)

Ah! So **Db major** is the **♭V triad** in **G Locrian**, and it’s **major** because of the key signature of A♭ major.

Similarly:
- **Eb/G** = E♭ major chord? Wait, **E♭ major** = E♭–G–B♭ → but in A♭ major, the E♭ chord is **E♭ major** (V chord of A♭), but in **G Locrian**, the 6th scale degree is **E♭**, and the triad is **E♭–G–B♭ = E♭ major**!

But earlier I thought it was E♭ minor—but no! In **A♭ major**, **E♭ is major** (V chord).

So **G Locrian**, being mode VII of A♭ major, inherits all chords from A♭ major.

So let’s list all chords in **A♭ major**:

- I = A♭ major
- ii = B♭ minor
- iii = C minor
- IV = D♭ major
- V = E♭ major
- vi = F minor
- vii° = G diminished

So **G Locrian** (mode vii) has:
- i° = G°
- ♭II = A♭
- ♭iii = B♭m
- iv = Cm
- ♭V = D♭
- ♭VI = E♭
- ♭vii = Fm

Exactly!

Thus:
- **Gdim** = i°
- **Eb/G** = E♭ major in first inversion → ♭VI chord
- **Bbm/F** = B♭ minor in first inversion → ♭iii
- **Ab/G** = A♭ major over G → ♭II with G bass (i.e., G in bass under ♭II)
- **Dbmaj7/F** = D♭ major 7 over F → ♭V7 over ♭vii bass

All these chords are **diatonic to A♭ major**, and when **G is used as the tonal center**, the mode is **G Locrian**.

### Final Answer:

**Key: A♭ major (parent key)**  
**Mode: G Locrian**

The progression is **centered around G** with chords drawn from **A♭ major**, making it **G Locrian mode**.
