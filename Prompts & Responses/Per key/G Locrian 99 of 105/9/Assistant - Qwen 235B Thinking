**Assistant - Qwen 235B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chord symbols: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G, Eb/G, Gdim, Gdim, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim. They want me to determine the key and mode for this progression. 

First, I need to understand what these chords are telling me. Diminished chords like Gdim (G-Bb-Db) are interesting because they're symmetrical and can function in different ways—often as passing chords or leading to other harmonies. The Eb/G is an Eb major chord with G in the bass—that's the first inversion since G is the third of Eb. Similarly, Bbm/F is Bb major with F in the bass (first inversion), Ab/G is Ab major with G in the bass (second inversion? Wait no—Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so G as bass would be a sixth chord, but it's written as Ab/G so it's Ab major over G bass). Dbmaj7/F is Db major seventh with F in the bass—F is the third of Db, so again first inversion. 

Hmm, the progression is built around Gdim repeating a lot, with these major chords with different bass notes sliding in between. Let me list out all the roots and bass notes to see the movement: 

- Gdim (root G, bass G) 
- ... 
- Eb/G (root Eb, bass G) 
- Bbm/F (root Bb, bass F) 
- Ab/G (root Ab, bass G) 
- Dbmaj7/F (root Db, bass F) 

I notice that G appears frequently in the bass—specifically in Eb/G, Ab/G, and the Gdim chords themselves. The bass notes seem to move in half-steps sometimes: G in Gdim → G in Eb/G → F in Bbm/F? Wait no: 

Let's extract just the bass notes from the progression: 

1. G (Gdim) 
2. G (Gdim) 
3. G (Eb/G) 
4. G (Eb/G) 
5. G (Gdim) 
6. G (Gdim) 
7. F (Bbm/F) 
8. G (Ab/G) → here it jumps back to G 
9. G (Gdim) 
10. G (Gdim) 
11. G (Eb/G) 
12. G (Eb/G) 
13. G (Gdim) 
14. G (Gdim) 
15. F (Dbmaj7/F) 
16. G (Gdim) 

Oh! The bass is mostly G, with only two bass notes changing: F in position 7 (Bbm/F) and F again in position 15 (Dbmaj7/F). So the bass line is firmly anchored on G for 14 out of 16 chords, with just two Fs interrupting it. That's unusual—it suggests G is functioning as a pedal tone, probably the tonic. 

Now, let's look at the chords themselves over this G bass: 

- When bass is G: 
  * Gdim = G-Bb-Db → so notes Bb, Db over G bass 
  * Eb/G = G (bass) + Eb chord (Eb-G-Bb) → but since bass is G, it's actually G-Eb-G-Bb → which is G7sus4? Wait no: Eb major triad over G bass gives G as root? Standard analysis: Eb/G is a first inversion Eb chord, but functionally it can imply G7 if we consider Bb as the minor 7th (since Eb/G = G-Bb-Eb, which is G7sus♭9? Not quite—G-Bb-Eb is actually Gm7♭5? Let's spell it: 

Eb major triad = Eb, G, Bb 
Over G bass → total notes: G (bass), Eb, G, Bb → so the chord is G-Eb-G-Bb. The intervals from G: m3 (Eb), P5 (Bb). So it's G minor 7th but missing the 7th? Wait, G-Eb-Bb is G minor triad. Adding the extra G makes it G minor with doubled root. But Eb/G is conventionally called "Eb major over G bass," not analyzed as a G chord. However, in context, with G pedal, it might be coloring the harmony around G. 

Similarly: 
- Bbm/F: F bass + Bb major (Bb-D-F) → notes F, Bb, D, F → so D is the 6th above F? It's F major 6th chord (F6 = F-A-C-D, but here it's F-Bb-D → wait Bb major is Bb-D-F, so over F bass it's F-Bb-D → which is actually Bb major in first inversion, but the bass F suggests it's functioning as an F-based chord. Specifically, F-Bb-D is F sus4? No—F-A-C is F major, so F-Bb-D has no third, it's F sus4 (Bb replaces A). But Bb isn't the fourth; Bb is the 11th? Messy. 

Perhaps better to think vertically: all chords are being heard with G as a pedal point after positions 7 and 15. But positions 7 and 15 have F bass, so maybe those are the only shifts. 

Wait, let's list all chords with their actual root (not bass): 

- Gdim: root G 
- Eb/G: root Eb 
- Bbm/F: root Bb 
- Ab/G: root Ab 
- Dbmaj7/F: root Db 

So the roots are: G, G, Eb, Eb, G, G, Bb, Ab, G, G, Eb, Eb, G, G, Db, G 

That's G dominant, then Eb major (which is the bVI in G minor?), Bb major (V in G minor?), Ab major (bVII), Db major (bIII in G minor?). 

Ah—this looks suspiciously like a minor key progression with chromatic mediants or borrowed chords. Let's test G minor as the key. 

In G natural minor: 
- i = Gm 
- bIII = Bb 
- iv = Cm 
- v = Dm 
- bVI = Eb 
- bVII = F 

But here we have Ab and Db, which aren't in G natural minor. Ab is bII? Db is bV? Not standard. 

G harmonic minor has: 
- Gm (G-Bb-D) 
- Adim (A-C-Eb) 
- Bb+ (Bb-Db-F#) — but we have Bb major here (Bb-D-F), not augmented. 

G melodic minor ascending: 
- Gm (G-Bb-D) 
- Am (A-C-E) 
- Bb+ (Bb-Db-F#) — again, not matching. 

But look at the chords: we have Eb major (bVI), Bb major (V? but in minor key V is major—D major), but here it's Bb, which is not V of G. V of G would be D major. 

Unless... this is in the key of C minor? Let me check. 

C minor key: 
- i = Cm 
- bIII = Eb 
- iv = Fm 
- v = Gm 
- bVI = Ab 
- bVII = Bb 

Look at the roots: we have Eb, Ab, Bb, Db. Eb is bIII in C minor, Ab is bVI, Bb is bVII, Db is—Db isn't in C natural minor (bIII is Eb, so Db would be double-flat or something? No). 

C harmonic minor has B natural, so G#dim, not Gdim. 

Wait, Gdim is prominent. Diminished chords often lead to dominant or tonic. Gdim could be vii° in Ab major, but we have Db chords too. 

Let's consider the Eb/G chord. Eb/G is enharmonically equivalent to Ebdim6 or something? Standard trick: Gdim (G-Bb-Db) can be respelled as Bbdim, Dbdim, or F#dim (enharmonically). For example, G-Bb-Db = Bb-Db-Fb (but Fb is E), so Bb-D-E? No, better: diminished 7th chords are symmetrical, but these are dim triads (no 7th), so not fully symmetrical. 

Gdim triad = G, Bb, Db 

This could function as: 
- vii° of Ab major (since Ab major: Ab-Bb-C, and vii° is G#-B-D, but G# = Ab, so Ab°7 = Ab-B-Db-E, but here it's just G-Bb-Db, so partial). 
If in Ab major, vii° of Ab is G#-B-D, which is enharmonically Ab-Db (since G#=Ab, B=Cb? Messy). 

Gdim could also lead to Ab (diatonic in G# minor? Complicated). 

But look at the progression: it ends with Dbmaj7/F → Gdim. Dbmaj7 is Db-F-Ab-C, over F bass → F-Db-Ab-C. Then Gdim. So Db to G is a tritone? Db to G is augmented fourth, which is common in jazz (e.g., tritone substitution). 

Db major is the bV of G? No—standard tritone sub: in key of G, dominant is D7, tritone sub is Ab7. But here we have Db, which is enharmonically C#, so C#7 would be tritone sub for G7? C#7 to G is tritone resolution (C# = Fb, but usually it's Ab7 to D). 

Perhaps this is in G but using chromatic mediants. 

Another approach: collect all the notes used. 

From the chords: 
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db 
- Eb/G: G, Eb, Bb (since Eb major is Eb-G-Bb, over G bass → notes G, Eb, Bb) 
- Bbm/F: F, Bb, D (Bb major is Bb-D-F, over F bass → F, Bb, D) 
- Ab/G: G, Ab, C, Eb? Wait Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, over G bass → G, Ab, C, Eb 
- Dbmaj7/F: F, Db, Ab, C (Dbmaj7 = Db-F-Ab-C, over F bass → F, Db, Ab, C) 

Now compile all unique notes: G, Bb, Db, Eb, F, D, Ab, C. 

List: C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

That's: C, Db, D, Eb, E (wait no D is natural? From Bbm/F: Bb major has D natural, yes—Bb-D-F). 

So notes present: 
- C (from Ab/G and Dbmaj7) 
- Db (from Gdim and Dbmaj7) 
- D (from Bbm/F) 
- Eb (from Eb/G and Ab/G) 
- F (from Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F) 
- G (pedal) 
- Ab (from Ab/G and Dbmaj7) 
- Bb (from Gdim and Eb/G) 

Missing: A natural, E natural. 

So the scale is: C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

That's 8 notes, but let's see which mode fits. 

Order them: Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. 

This is almost Db major (Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C), but here we have D natural instead of Gb. Db major has Gb, but we have G natural? Wait no—the notes include G natural (pedal), and Ab. 

Actually, the notes are: 
Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. 

This resembles the diminished scale (octatonic), which alternates whole and half steps. Two types: WH (whole-half) or HW (half-whole). 

Check the intervals between consecutive notes: 
Start from Db: 
Db to D = half step 
D to Eb = half step → but should be whole for WH scale? WH scale is W-H-W-H etc. 

Sort ascending: Db, D, Eb, E (no), F, Gb? No—let's list all notes in order: 
C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

So: 
C - Db (H) 
Db - D (H) — but D natural is next after Db, so H step. 
D - Eb (H) 
Eb - F (W) 
F - G (W) 
G - Ab (H) 
Ab - Bb (W) 
Bb - C (W) 

Not consistent. Better to consider the pitch classes: 
0=C, 1=Db, 2=D, 3=Eb, 5=F, 7=G, 8=Ab, 10=Bb. 

So PC set: {0,1,2,3,5,7,8,10}. 

This is the octatonic scale (diminished scale). Specifically, it's the half-whole diminished scale starting on C: 
C, Db, D, Eb, E? No—half-whole is H-W-H-W-etc. 

Standard half-whole diminished from C: C, Db, D#, E, F#, G, A, Bb. 

But our notes are C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 

So: 
C 
H: C-Db 
W: Db-D (but D is natural, yes) 
H: D-Eb 
W: Eb-F 
H: F-Gb? But we have F-G (whole step), not half. 

Actually, from F to G is whole step, G to Ab is half step, Ab to Bb is whole, Bb to C is whole → not matching. 

The set {C,Db,D,Eb,F,G,Ab,Bb} is exactly the C half-whole diminished scale: 
C (root) 
H up: Db 
W up: D (Eb? Wait standard is: C, Db, D#, E, F#, G, A, Bb — so D# is same as Eb? No, D# = Eb, but then E natural is missing. 

Standard C half-whole diminished: 
1. C 
2. Db (H) 
3. D# (W) — but D# = Eb 
4. E (H) — but E natural not in our set! 
Our set has D natural, not E natural. 

We have D natural (from Bbm/F: Bb-D-F), so pitch class 2 (D), not 3 (Eb) for the second note after Db? 

Better: our notes are: 
C (0) 
Db (1) 
D (2) 
Eb (3) 
F (5) 
G (7) 
Ab (8) 
Bb (10) 

Missing E (4) and A (9). 

This is precisely the octatonic scale 8-28 in set theory, specifically the half-whole diminished scale starting on C: 
C, Db, D, Eb, F, Gb? No—standard H/W: start on C: 
Half step: C to Db 
Whole step: Db to D# (Eb) 
Half step: D# to E 
Whole step: E to F# 
Etc. 

But we have C, Db, D (not D#/Eb yet), so it's not matching. 

Alternative: the notes correspond to G half-whole diminished scale. 

G half-whole diminished: 
G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D? Let's see: 
H: G-Ab 
W: Ab-Bb 
H: Bb-B 
W: B-C#? No. 

Standard: 
Start G: 
1. G 
2. Ab (H) 
3. A (W) — but A natural not present; we have Ab and Bb. 

Our notes: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, D, Eb, F. 

So from G: 
G, Ab (H), Bb (W), C (W), Db (H), D (H), Eb (W), F (W). 

Pattern: H, W, W, H, H, W, W — that's two whole steps after Bb? Not standard octatonic. 

Octatonic scales have alternating H and W. The two types: 
- Starting with H: H,W,H,W,H,W,H,W — e.g., C,Db,D#,E,F#,G,A,Bb 
- Starting with W: W,H,W,H,W,H,W,H — e.g., C,D,D#,E,F#,G,A,Bb 

Our set: from C — C,Db,D,Eb,F,G,Ab,Bb 
Intervals: 
C-Db = H 
Db-D = H → two halves, not alternating. 
So not octatonic. 

Could it be a mode of the harmonic minor or something else? 

List all notes: C, Db, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. 
This is 8 notes, but scale degrees for what key? 

Suppose the tonic is G (since bass is mostly G). 
G as root, what scale? 
G to G: G Ab Bb C Db D Eb F G 
That's G diminished scale (half-whole): 
1 G 
b2 Ab 
#2 = Bbb? No—standard G half-whole: 
G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D 
But we have Bb, not A or B. 
Our notes: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, D, Eb, F → so for G: 
G 
Ab (b2) 
Bb (b3) 
C (4) 
Db (b5) 
D (5) — but 5 can't be both Db and D? 
D natural and Db both present — so it's a chromatic scale with alterations. 

This strongly suggests the half-whole diminished scale, but centered on G. 
The G half-whole diminished scale is: G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D — but we have Bb instead of A/B, and C, Db, D, Eb (which is Fb? no). 

Standard G half-whole: 
1. G 
2. Ab (b2) 
3. A (bb3? enharmonic Bbb, but usually called #2) 
4. Bb (b3) 
5. B (3) — but we don't have B natural; we have Bb and C. 
Our set has: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, D, Eb, F. 
So: 
G 
Ab (b2) 
Bb (b3) — but in diminished scale, the third is both minor and major, but here only b3 present. 

Perhaps it's not a standard scale. Let's think functionally. 

Back to chords: the progression keeps returning to Gdim over G bass. Gdim is unusual as a tonic chord—it's dissonant and unstable. But in some contexts, like minor keys, vii° can be prominent, but usually it's leading to i. 

Notice that Eb/G: Eb major over G bass = G7sus♭9? Let's spell the notes: G (bass) + Eb-G-Bb → so pitches: G, Eb, G, Bb. From G: root, minor 7th (F is missing? Bb is the minor 7th? G to Bb is minor 3rd, not 7th. G to F is minor 7th, but F is not in Eb/G chord. 

Eb/G contains: G, Bb, Eb → which is G minor 7th flat 5? G-Bb-Db-F is Gm7♭5, but here it's G-Bb-Eb — no Db or F. G-Bb-Eb is actually a Gsus4? No—G suspended 4th would be G-C-D. G-Bb-Eb: intervals from G: minor 3rd (Bb), perfect 5th (D would be, but it's Eb? G to Eb is minor 6th). So it's ambiguous. 

However, in jazz contexts, Eb major over G bass is often used as a substitute for G7♭9, because the notes Eb, G, Bb = the ♭9, 3rd, and ♭7 of G7♭9? G7♭9 is G-B-D-F-Ab, so ♭9 is Ab, not Eb. Not matching. 

G7 would be G-B-D-F. 
G7♭9 = G-B-D-F-Ab. 
Eb major is Eb-G-Bb. So Eb/G has G-Bb-Eb — which is the b7, root, and b3 of C minor? Not helpful. 

Another idea: the Eb/G chord can be heard as a tritone substitution for A7. Because D7 (V of G) tritone sub is Ab7, but here it's Eb over G. 

Tritone sub: the sub for D7 is Ab7 (since D and Ab are tritone apart). But Eb is a half step below E, which is root of the dominant? Not directly. 

Perhaps it's all built on G minor with borrowed chords. 

Let's assume key is G minor. 
G natural minor: G A Bb C D Eb F G 

Chords: 
- Gdim: this isn't in G minor; scale degrees: 1=G, 2=Ab? No, G minor has G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F. So Gdim (G-Bb-Db) — Db is not in the scale (enharmonic to C#, but G minor has D natural, not Db). So Gdim is foreign. 

G harmonic minor: G A Bb C D Eb F# G — has F#, not F natural. But our chords have F natural (in Bbm/F and Dbmaj7/F), so not harmonic minor. 

G melodic minor ascending: G A Bb C D E F# G — again, F# not present. 

But our progression has F natural (from bass in two places), Bb, Eb, Ab, Db — all flats. 

This suggests G Dorian? G Dorian: G A Bb C D E F G — has F natural and no Gdim. 

Still no Gdim. 

Perhaps the mode is G half-diminished scale? But that's for chords, not a key. 

Let's look at the chord roots: G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. 
These are all minor 3rds apart: G to Eb is minor 3rd down (or major 6th up), Eb to Bb is perfect 4th, not minor 3rd. G-Eb-Bb-Ab-Db: 
G to Eb = minor 3rd (down) 
Eb to Bb = perfect 5th (up) 
Bb to Ab = major 2nd (down) 
Ab to Db = perfect 4th (up) — not consistent. 

But Db to G is augmented 4th (tritone), which resolves outward to Eb and C or inward to D and C# — in the progression, Dbmaj7/F goes to Gdim, which could lead to Ab or something. 

Ah! Dbmaj7/F to Gdim: Db root to G root is tritone, so Db is likely functioning as a tritone substitution. 

In the key of G major, the V chord is D7. The tritone substitution for D7 is Ab7 (since D and Ab are a tritone apart). But here we have Db, not Ab. Db is G#'s tritone? D is V of G, tritone sub is Ab (which is bII major). But Db is a major third below Ab? Not directly. 

Db = enharmonic C#, and C#7 is the tritone sub for G7? Because G7 has tritone B-F, and C#7 has E#-B which is enharmonic F-B, same tritone. So C#7 (or Db7) is tritone sub for G7. 

But in this progression, we have Dbmaj7, not Db7. Dbmaj7 resolves to Gdim — how would that work? 

Dbmaj7 to Gdim: very chromatic. 

Perhaps the key is C minor. Let's try. 

In C minor: 
- i = Cm 
- V = G7 
- bVI = Ab 

But here we have Eb (bIII), Bb (bVII), Ab (bVI), Db (bV? not standard). 

C harmonic minor has G# in the scale, so G#dim chord. But we have Gdim, which is G natural, so not C harmonic minor. 

Another possibility: the progression is in the key of Ab major. 
Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G Ab 

Chords: 
- Gdim: that's vii° of Ab — yes! Gdim (G-Bb-Db) is the leading tone chord in Ab major. 
- Eb/G: Eb major is V in Ab, and Eb/G is first inversion — common. 
- Bbm/F: Bb major is vi in Ab? Ab major: vi is Fm, not Bb. Bb major is bII, not diatonic. 
- Ab/G: Ab major is I, but with G bass — so first inversion? Ab/G would be Ab major over G, which is not standard; I6 in Ab would be Ab/C. 
- Dbmaj7/F: Db major is IV in Ab, and Dbmaj7/F is first inversion. 

Let's check: 
- Gdim = vii° of Ab 
- Eb = V of Ab 
- Bbm: not diatonic; Ab major has Bbm as... no, Bb is natural in Ab, so Bbm would be borrowed. 
- Ab = I 
- Db = IV 

But the progression has Bbm/F and it's Bb major, not minor. In Ab major, ii is Bbm (Bb-Db-F), but here it's Bb major (Bb-D-F). So D natural is not in Ab major (which has Db). 

Ab major has Db, not D natural. Bb major requires D natural, which is outside Ab major. 

So not Ab major. 

But Bb major could be a borrowed chord from Ab mixolydian or something. 

Notice that Bb major is the V of Eb. 
Eb major is in the progression. 

So Eb/G could be part of an Eb key center. 
Eb major: Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb 

Then Eb/G is I6 in Eb. 
Gdim: not diatonic; vii° of Ab, but not for Eb. 

Gdim could relate to C minor or something. 

Let's consider the entire progression as revolving around G as tonic, with chords borrowed from parallel minor and diminished harmony. 

G major: G A B C D E F# 
G minor: G A Bb C D Eb F 

Chords in progression: 
- Gdim: not in G major or minor; would be vii° in Ab, but here it's tonicized. 
- Eb/G: Eb major is bVI in G minor — yes! In G minor, bVI is Eb major. 
- Bbm/F: Bb major is bIII in G minor — G minor has Bb, but as minor chord (Bbm), not major. Bb major is a common borrowed chord (from G Dorian or Phrygian). 
- Ab/G: Ab major is bII in G minor — borrowed from Phrygian. 
- Dbmaj7/F: Db major — not standard; could be tritone sub or from diminished scale. 

So this looks like G minor with extensive modal mixture and chromaticism. 

Specifically: 
- Gdim is emphasized as a tonic substitute or pedal point. In minor keys, the tonic minor chord is Gm, but here they're using Gdim to create tension. But Gdim = G-Bb-Db, while Gm = G-Bb-D. So replacing D natural with Db. 

Ah! That's the key. The tonic chord is being altered between Gm (implied) and Gdim by changing D to Db. 

In the progression: 
- When chords like Eb/G happen, Eb/G = G-Bb-Eb, which contains Bb (minor 3rd of Gm) and Eb (which is the 7th? Gm7 = G-Bb-D-F, so Eb isn't there). 

But let's see the scale implied by the chords: 

For G tonic: 
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db → so minor 3rd (Bb), diminished 5th (Db) 
- Eb/G: G, Bb, Eb → minor 3rd (Bb), minor 6th (Eb) relative to G? G to Eb is minor 6th. 
- Bbm/F: with G pedal, it's F-Bb-D over G bass → so notes G,F,Bb,D → G7 (G-B-D-F) but B is missing; it's G-F-Bb-D = Gm7 (if Bb is 3rd, F is 7th, D is 5th) 
- Ab/G: G bass + Ab chord (Ab-C-Eb) → G,Ab,C,Eb → which is Gm7b5? G-Bb-Db-F is Gm7b5; here it's G-Ab-C-Eb. Ab is b9, C is natural 11, Eb is minor 7. Very altered. 
- Dbmaj7/F: F bass + Dbmaj7 (Db-F-Ab-C) → G is not in it, but with pedal? The chord is F,Db,Ab,C over G bass → so total: G,F,Db,Ab,C. From G: minor 7th (F), b6 (Db), b9 (Ab), 4th (C). 

This is heavily chromatic, suggesting the use of the half-whole diminished scale over a G pedal. 

The G half-whole diminished scale contains: G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D — but in our progression, we have Bb and D natural (from Bbm/F: Bb-D-F), but no A or B natural. Instead, we have Eb and C, which correspond to Ebb and Bbb? Better: the scale degrees from G: 

1. G 
b2. Ab 
#2. Bbb = A (but not used) 
b3. Bb 
3. Cbb = B (not used) 
4. C 
b5. Db 
5. D 
#5. Ebb = D# (not used; we have Eb instead) 
b6. Ebb = D? Confusing. 

Standard G half-whole diminished: 
1. G 
b9. Ab 
#9. Bbb = A 
3. Bb 
#11. B 
5. C 
b13. Db 
13. D 
Back to 7. Eb (which is Fb) 

But in our chord analysis: 
- Ab/G gives Ab (b9), C (4), Eb (b7) 
- Dbmaj7/F gives Db (b5), Ab (b9), C (11), F (b7) 
- Bbm/F with G bass: F (b7), Bb (b3), D (5) 
- Eb/G: Eb (b7), Bb (b3), G (1) 
- Gdim: G, Bb, Db (1, b3, b5) 

So the notes occurring are: 
- Root: G 
- b3: Bb 
- 3: not present (A or B) 
- 4: C 
- b5: Db 
- 5: D 
- b7: F and Eb (Eb = D# = b7? G to Eb is minor 7th? G to F is minor 7th (F), G to Eb is major 6th down, but up it's minor 3rd — no. G to F is minor 7th (10 semitones), G to Eb is minor 6th (8 semitones). 

Gb7 would be G-Bb-Db-Fb, but Fb is E. We have F natural and Eb. 

This is messy. Let's consider jazz harmony: the heavy use of diminished chords and Eb/G, Bb, Ab, Db suggests tritone substitutions and chromatic mediants. 

But the constant G pedal suggests G is the tonal center. The only chords are major or diminished with G in bass (mostly), and the others are slides from F and G. 

Another clue: the progression has Eb/G twice, then later again — and Eb major is the relative major of C minor. But pedal is G, not C. 

Let's try to hear the bass motion from the two F points: 
Position 7: Bbm/F → bass F 
Position 8: Ab/G → bass jumps to G 
Position 15: Dbmaj7/F → bass F 
Position 16: Gdim → bass G 

So it's like F bass chords resolving up to G. Bbm/F to Ab/G: Bb major to Ab major is not standard, but F bass to G bass is whole step up. Similarly Db to G is fifth down (or fourth up), but bass F to G is whole step. 

The movement F to G in bass is common as a subdominant to dominant motion (e.g., F to G in C major), but here no clear key. 

Let's consider G as the dominant of C. 
If G is V of C, then: 
- Gdim = vii° of C — yes, Gdim is standard vii° in C major. 
- Eb/G: Eb is bVI in C minor, but in C major, Eb isn't diatonic. 
- Bbm/F: Bb is bII in C major (borrowed) or diatonic in C Mixolydian. 
- Ab/G: Ab is bVII in C major? C major has Bb, not Ab. 
- Dbmaj7/F: Db is bV in C? Not standard. 

But C harmonic minor has G#dim, not Gdim. 

C major scale: C D E F G A B 
Gdim = G Bb Db — Db not in C major. 

However, Gdim is the vii° chord in Ab major, as I thought earlier. 

Let me check the circle of fifths: the chord roots are G, Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. 
G to Eb is a minor 6th or minor 3rd down. 
In jazz, this could be tritone substitutions: 
- Gdim may be substitute for C7 or something. 

Standard diminished chord usage: Gdim can function as vii°7 of Ab, leading to Ab. 
Similarly, it could lead to A, but A isn't in the progression. 

The progression has Ab/G right after Bbm/F, so Bb to Ab is stepwise down. 

Let's line up the chords that aren't Gdim: 
- Eb/G (which is Eb major harmony) 
- Bbm/F (Bb major harmony) 
- Ab/G (Ab major harmony) 
- Dbmaj7/F (Db major harmony) 

So the non-Gdim chords are Eb, Bb, Ab, Db — all major chords. 

Eb, Bb, Ab, Db — what key has these? 
Eb major: Eb F G Ab Bb C D 
Has Ab and Bb, but not Db (Db would be the #IV or something). 

Relative major/minor: 
Eb major / C minor 
C minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C 
So C minor has Eb (bIII), Bb (bVII), Ab (bVI), but not Db. Db is not in C natural minor. 

C harmonic minor has B natural, so not. 

However, Db major is the Neapolitan chord in C minor! 
In C minor, the Neapolitan is Db major (bII). 

So in C minor: 
- bVI = Ab 
- bVII = Bb 
- bIII = Eb 
- bII = Db (Neapolitan) 

And Gdim: what is Gdim in C minor? 
Gdim = G Bb Db 
In C minor, the diatonic chords: 
i = Cm 
ii° = Ddim 
bIII = Eb 
iv = Fm 
v = Gm 
VI = Ab 
bVII = Bb 

No Gdim. But Gdim is enharmonically equivalent to G#dim, which is the leading tone chord for A major, but not relevant. 

However, Gdim can be seen as an extension of the Neapolitan: Db-Gdim is a common progression (bII - vii°). 

For example, in C minor: 
Db (bII) to Gdim (vii° of Ab, but also can lead to Ab or C). 

Yes! In minor keys, the Neapolitan (bII) often resolves to V or vii°. 

Specifically: in C minor, Db major (bII) to Gdim (which is the vii° of Ab, but Ab is the i chord of the subdominant area). 

Let's see the progression in C minor: 
- Gdim could be the diminished chord on scale degree 5, but C minor has Gm, not Gdim. However, Gdim is used as the dominant of Ab, which is the relative major's tonic? 

Ab major is the relative major of F minor, not C minor. 

C minor and Ab major share the same key signature (4 flats), and Ab is the bVI of C minor. 

So: 
- C minor tonic 
- bVI = Ab 
- But we have Db (bII), Gdim (which is not diatonic), etc. 

Standard progression in minor: i - bVI - bII - V 
In C minor: Cm - Ab - Db - G7 

But in this progression, we have: 
- Gdim (which is part of G7 or Ab tonic area) 
- Eb/G (Eb is bIII) 
- Bbm/F (Bb is bVII) 
- Ab/G (Ab is bVI) 
- Dbmaj7/F (Db is bII) 

The order is: Gdim, Gdim, Eb/G (x2), Gdim (x2), Bbm/F, Ab/G, Gdim (x2), Eb/G (x2), Gdim (x2), Dbmaj7/F, Gdim. 

So the non-Gdim chords are: Eb, Bb, Ab, Db. 

In C minor: 
- Eb = bIII 
- Bb = bVII 
- Ab = bVI 
- Db = bII 

All are characteristic borrowed chords from the minor key. 

The Gdim chords: where do they fit? 

Gdim is G Bb Db. 
In C minor, Db is b2, Bb is b7, G is 5. 
So it contains the b2 (Db), b7 (Bb), and 5 (G) — which is the Neapolitan triad without the root? No. 

G Bb Db = Db G Bb, which is Db6 (Db-F-Ab-Bb) missing the F. 
But it's Gdim (root G). 

However, Gdim is enharmonically equivalent to Bbdim, Dbdim, or F#dim (for example, G Bb Db = Bb Db Fb, but Fb=E), so not helpful. 

But as a leading tone chord: Gdim leads to Ab (since Ab has G# as leading tone, but G is enharmonic to G#, so Gdim = G#dim, leading to A. But here it's leading to Ab in the progression (after Bbm/F comes Ab/G). 

Yes! Sequence: Bbm/F (Bb major) -> Ab/G (Ab major) 
Bb to Ab is a half step down, which is a common chromatic approach. 

Similarly, Dbmaj7/F -> Gdim: Db to G is tritone, but Db to G is not half step; however, after Dbmaj7, it goes to Gdim, which could be leading to Ab. 

In fact, the entire progression might be outlining C minor with the Gdim chords serving as passing or leading to the Ab (bVI) area. 

Let's test: 
- The chords Eb, Bb, Ab, Db are all diatonic to C minor as borrowed chords (bIII, bVII, bVI, bII). 
- Why are the Gdim chords inserted? 

Gdim (G Bb Db) contains Bb (which is b7 of C) and Db (b2 of C), and G (5 of C). 
So it's like a C7b9 chord without root and 3rd: C7b9 = C E G Bb Db, so Gdim = G Bb Db = the b9, 3rd, and b7 without C and E. Not quite. 

But in jazz, diminished chords are often used as dominant substitutes or leading tone chords. 

Specifically, Gdim can function as a dominant for Ab: Gdim = G#dim (enharmonic), which is vii°7 of Ab, resolving to Ab. 

And in the progression: 
- After two Gdim, comes Eb/G — which is not Ab. 
But later: after Bbm/F (position 7), comes Ab/G (position 8) — so Gdim is not immediately before Ab. 

Count the instances: 
- Before the first Eb: two Gdim 
- Before Bb: two Gdim 
- Before Db: two Gdim at the end 

But Bb is followed by Ab, not by Gdim directly. 

Sequence between non-G: 
- ... Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G ... 
So Gdim Gdim - Eb (x2) - Gdim Gdim - Bb - Ab - Gdim... 

So the Gdim chords are coming before the major chords: 
- Before Eb: two Gdim 
- Before Bb: two Gdim? No, after Bb is Ab directly. 

Let's list the chord sequence with labels: 
1-2: Gdim (2x) 
3-4: Eb/G (2x) 
5-6: Gdim (2x) 
7: Bbm/F 
8: Ab/G 
9-10: Gdim (2x) 
11-12: Eb/G (2x) 
13-14: Gdim (2x) 
15: Dbmaj7/F 
16: Gdim 

So the pattern is: 
(Gdim x2, Eb/G x2) repeated, then (Gdim x2, Bbm/F, Ab/G), then (Gdim x2, Eb/G x2) again, then (Gdim x2, Dbmaj7/F, Gdim). 

The Eb/G appears in two segments, and the Dbmaj7 is the climax before the final Gdim. 

Now, if we consider the Gdim as leading to Ab, then: 
- When does Gdim resolve? It often precedes Eb/G or Bbm/F or Dbmaj7/F, which are not Ab. 

But note: 
- Gdim to Eb/G: Gdim has G and Db; Eb/G has G and Bb — common tone G, and Db to Eb is whole step, not leading. 
- Gdim to Bbm/F: Gdim has G, Bb, Db; Bbm/F has F, Bb, D — common tone Bb. 
- Gdim to Ab/G: Gdim has G,Bb,Db; Ab/G has G,Ab,C,Eb — common tone G. 
- Gdim to Dbmaj7/F: Gdim has G,Bb,Db; Dbmaj7/F has F,Db,Ab,C — common tone Db, and Bb to Ab is whole step down. 

Not the typical leading tone resolution (half step up). 

However, in the context of the half-whole diminished scale, Gdim (G Bb Db) is the diminished arpeggio from G, and the scale provides the chromatic harmony. 

Given the prevalence of G in the bass and the chromatic major chords, the most likely tonal center is G, but with the key being G minor, and the scale used is G half-whole diminished for color. 

But diminished scale is usually for passing, not a key. 

Another possibility: the mode is G Locrian. 
G Locrian: G Ab Bb C Db Eb F G 
Chords: 
- i° = Gdim 
- bII = Ab 
- biii = Bbm 
- iv = Cm 
- v° = Ddim 
- bVI = Eb 
- bvii = F 

Check against progression: 
- Gdim = i° — yes! 
- Eb/G = bVI in first inversion — yes, bVI is Eb major. 
- Bbm/F = biii with F bass — but biii should be Bbm (minor), but here it's Bb major. So major instead of minor — not standard Locrian, but could be a variant. 
- Ab/G = bII — yes, but bII is Ab major, and Ab/G is first inversion? Locrian has bII, but typically it's minor or diminished, but in modern contexts, bII is major. 
- Dbmaj7/F = iv chord? In G Locrian, iv would be Cm, not Db. Db is enharmonic to C#, which would be biii# or something — no. In G Locrian, the fourth degree is C, so C diminished or minor. Db is not iv. 

However, Db major is bV in G minor? Let's see the scale: 
G Locrian: 1=G, b2=Ab, b3=Bb, 4=C, b5=Db, b6=Eb, b7=F 

So the chords: 
- i° = G Bb Db 
- bII = Ab C Eb 
- biii = Bb Db F 
- iv° = C Eb Gb (but Gb=F#) — not matching. 

The progression has Bb major (Bb D F), but biii in Locrian should be Bb Db F (Bbm). So it has D natural instead of Db, which is outside the scale. 

Unless it's mixing Locrian with Dorian or something. 

But Bb major (D natural) and Eb major (G natural) both have natural notes where Locrian has flats: 
- Locrian has Db for b5, but Eb major requires G natural (since Eb-G-Bb), and G natural is the root, so it's fine, but for the scale: Eb major has G natural, while G Locrian has G as root, so G natural is present, but the third of Eb is G natural, which is correct. 

G Locrian scale: G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F 
So G natural, A flat, B flat, C, D flat, E flat, F. 

Eb major chord: Eb G Bb — G natural is in the scale (yes, it's the tonic), Bb is in the scale (b3), but Eb is the b7? G to Eb is minor 6th, but in the scale, Eb is the b6? G Locrian: 1, b2, b3, 4, b5, b6, b7. So b6 is Eb. Yes! In G Locrian, the b6 is Eb. 

So Eb major chord: Eb (b6), G (1), Bb (b3) — so it's the b6 major chord, which is diatonic to Locrian if we consider triads. In Locrian, the triad on b6 is Eb G Bb = Eb major (since G is natural, no flat). 

Similarly: 
- Ab major: Ab (b2), C (4), Eb (b6) — in Locrian, Ab to C is minor third? Ab to C is major third (Ab-C is 4 semitones), and Ab to Eb is perfect fifth, so yes, Ab major is diatonic. 
- Bb major: Bb (b3), D natural? In G Locrian, the third scale degree is Bb, which is minor, so the triad is Bb Db F = Bb minor. But we have Bb major (Bb D F), which requires D natural, but Locrian has Db (b5), not D natural. So D natural is outside the scale. 

Similarly, Db major: Db (b5), F (b7), Ab (b2) — Db major, but in Locrian, the b5 degree is Db, so triad is Db F Ab = Db major. Yes, that's diatonic. 

So the only issue is Bb major — should be Bb minor in strict Locrian. But in the progression, it's Bb major (with D natural). 

This could be a modal interchange or a melodic choice to have the major third. In some contexts, Locrian can have alterations. 

Moreover, the bass movement Bbm/F to Ab/G: in the progression it's Bb major/F to Ab/G, so Bb to Ab is down a whole step, which makes sense in Locrian context. 

Now, what about Dbmaj7/F? Dbmaj7 = Db F Ab C — C is the 4th degree of G Locrian, which is diatonic. 

And Gdim = G Bb Db — the i° triad. 

The problem chord is Bbm/F — but if we interpret it as Bb major, it's not diatonic. However, in the bass it's F, which is b7 of G, so F Bb D — but D natural is not in the scale; should be Db. 

Unless this is G super Locrian or something, but super Locrian is the 7th mode of melodic minor, which has a major third. 

G super Locrian (7th mode of Ab melodic minor): 
Ab Bb C Db Eb Fb Gb Ab → enharmonic: G# A# B C# D# E F# G# 
But in flats for G: 
G Ab Bb B C# D E G — not matching. 

G Locrian #2 (which is the 6th mode of Ab melodic minor): 
Ab Bb C D Eb Fb Gb Ab → flats: G Ab Bb C Db Eb F G — wait, that's standard Locrian. 

Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G Ab 
6th mode is F: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb F — which is F Locrian? No, modes: 
1. Ab melodic minor: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G 
2. Bb Dorian: Bb C Db Eb F G Ab 
3. C Phrygian: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb 
4. Db Lydian: Db Eb F G Ab Bb C 
5. Eb Mixolydian: Eb F G Ab Bb C Db 
6. F Aeolian: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb 
7. G Locrian: G Ab Bb C Db Eb F 

Yes! G is the 7th mode of Ab melodic minor, which is G Locrian, and it has the notes G Ab Bb C Db Eb F. 

In this scale: 
- The triad on G is G Bb Db = Gdim — i° 
- Triad on Bb is Bb Db F = Bbm — biii 
- But in the progression, it's Bb major (Bb D F), which has D natural instead of Db. 

D natural is not in the scale; the scale has Db. So Bb major requires a natural D, which is outside. 

However, in jazz, it's common to play major chords on these degrees for color. 
Specifically, Bb major could be borrowed from G minor or Dorian. 

Given that the scale fits except for D natural in Bb major, and the progression is heavily centered on G with Gdim, the most plausible explanation is that the key is G, and the mode is Locrian, with the Bb major chord being a dynamic alteration (melodic choice to raise the D to natural for brightness). 

Moreover, Db major is diatonic (bV), Eb major is diatonic (bVI), Ab major is diatonic (bII). 

C major is missing in the chords? Dbmaj7 has C natural (the 7th), which is the 4th degree of G Locrian, diatonic. 

So overall: 
- Key: G 
- Mode: Locrian (7th mode of Ab melodic minor) 
- With a temporary major alteration on the bIII (Bb) chord for color. 

Therefore, the key is G, and the mode is Locrian. 

To confirm: 
- The tonic chord is Gdim, which is characteristic of Locrian. 
- The bass stays on G for most of the progression, reinforcing G as the tonal center. 
- The other chords (Eb, Bb, Ab, Db major) are all diatonic in Locrian except Bb should be minor, but it's common to use the major variant. 

In educational contexts, this would be identified as G Locrian. 

So final answer: Key = G, Mode = Locrian.

Based on the chord progression provided—**Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Bbm/F Ab/G Gdim Gdim Eb/G Eb/G Gdim Gdim Dbmaj7/F Gdim**—the key and mode can be determined by analyzing the harmonic function, bass movement, and scale degrees. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **1. Harmonic Analysis: Core Observations**
- **Gdim (G-B♭-D♭)** dominates the progression (10 out of 16 chords), functioning as a recurring tonic substitute. This is a strong indicator that **G is the tonal center**.
- **Bass movement is G-centric**: The bass note is **G for 14/16 chords** (all instances except `Bbm/F` and `Dbmaj7/F`, where the bass is F). This G pedal emphasizes G as the root.
- **Other chords are major triads with altered bass**:
  - `Eb/G` = E♭ major over G bass (notes: G, E♭, B♭).
  - `Bbm/F` = B♭ major over F bass (notes: F, B♭, D).
  - `Ab/G` = A♭ major over G bass (notes: G, A♭, C, E♭).
  - `Dbmaj7/F` = D♭ major 7th over F bass (notes: F, D♭, A♭, C).
- **Critical notes in the harmony**:
  - G (tonic emphasis), B♭ (minor 3rd), D♭ (diminished 5th), E♭ (minor 6th), F (minor 7th), A♭ (minor 9th), C (11th), D natural (from `Bbm/F`).

The full note collection is: **G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, D natural, E♭, F**.  
This forms the **G half-whole diminished scale** (a.k.a. **G Locrian ♯2** or the **7th mode of A♭ melodic minor**), but with one alteration: **D natural** instead of D♭ in `Bbm/F`. This D natural is a chromatic inflection (common in jazz/contemporary harmony) but does not change the underlying mode.

---

### **2. Why G Locrian?**
- **Locrian mode** is defined by:  
  **1 (root), ♭2, ♭3, 4, ♭5, ♭6, ♭7**.  
  For **G Locrian**: **G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F**.
- **Chord alignment with G Locrian**:
  | Chord       | Notes       | Function in G Locrian                     | Diatonic? |
  |-------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|
  | **Gdim**    | G-B♭-D♭    | **i°** (tonic diminished triad)           | ✅        |
  | **Eb/G**    | G-E♭-B♭-?  | **♭VI** (E♭ major = b6 triad)             | ✅        |
  | **Bbm/F**   | F-B♭-D     | **♭III** (B♭ triad, *altered to major* via D natural) | ⚠️ (D natural = chromatic inflection; diatonic would be B♭ minor) |
  | **Ab/G**    | G-A♭-C-E♭  | **♭II** (A♭ major = b2 triad)             | ✅        |
  | **Dbmaj7/F**| F-D♭-A♭-C  | **♭V** (D♭ major 7th = b5 triad + diatonic 7th) | ✅        |

- **Gdim as the tonic**: Locrian is the **only mode where the tonic chord is diminished** (i°). This matches the progression's heavy reliance on Gdim as the "home base."
- **G Pedal as reinforcement**: The consistent G bass (even under non-G chords like `Eb/G` and `Ab/G`) anchors G as the tonal center, despite the dissonance of Gdim.
- **Chromatic Bbm/F exception**: The B♭ major chord (`Bbm/F`) uses **D natural** (instead of the diatonic D♭), creating a major triad on ♭III. This is a **common jazz/pop alteration** (e.g., borrowing from G Dorian or harmonic minor for brightness) but doesn't override the Locrian framework. The progression still resolves toward Gdim/G, maintaining tonal gravity.

---

### **3. Why Not Other Keys/Modes?**
- **G Minor (Aeolian)**: 
  - Tonic chord should be **G minor (G-B♭-D)**, not Gdim (G-B♭-D♭). The D♭ (vs. D natural) confirms it's not minor.
  - B♭ major (♭III) is atypical; G minor expects B♭ minor (ii°).
- **G Phrygian**: 
  - Requires E♭ (♭3) but lacks D♭ (♭5) and dominant ♭II (A♭) usage.
  - Tonic chord would be G minor, not diminished.
- **C Minor (relative)**: 
  - Gdim = vii° of C, but C minor's tonic (Cm) is absent. The G pedal contradicts C as the center.
  - B♭ major would be V (but C minor expects Gm or G7 for V).
- **E♭ Major**: 
  - Gdim = vii° of E♭, but E♭ major's tonic (E♭) isn't emphasized (bass is G, not E♭).
  - B♭ major should be V of E♭, but it appears as `Bbm/F` with F bass, not dominant functionality.

---

### **4. How the Progression Works in G Locrian**
- **Tonic instability**: G Locrian's diminished tonic (Gdim) creates inherent tension, common in dark/mysterious jazz, film scores, or metal (e.g., "Crazy Train" riff uses Locrian).
- **Functional harmony**: 
  - `Gdim` → `Eb/G` = i° → ♭VI (submediant descent).
  - `Gdim` → `Bbm/F` → `Ab/G` = i° → ♭III → ♭II (chromatic approach to ♭II).
  - `Dbmaj7/F` → `Gdim` = ♭V → i° (tritone resolution; D♭ to G is a tritone, but the F bass smooths the cadence).
- **Scale usage**: Melodies here would use **G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F** (e.g., G diminished arpeggios or scalar runs), with D natural as a passing tone in the B♭ chord.

---

### **Conclusion: Key and Mode**
- **Key: G**  
  (Tonal center confirmed by pedal tone, chord resolutions, and diminished tonic).
- **Mode: Locrian**  
  (The only mode where the tonic chord is diminished, and all non-Gdim chords fit diatonically except for a jazz-influenced alteration on ♭III).

This progression is a **modern jazz/classical usage of G Locrian** (7th mode of A♭ melodic minor), leveraging chromaticism for color while maintaining G as the unresolved tonic. The D natural in `Bbm/F` is a deliberate major triad substitution but doesn't alter the mode—Locrian is defined by its structure, not rigid chord diatonicy.  

💡 **Listen for**: The "unstable" Gdim tonic and the smooth descent from F bass (`Dbmaj7/F`) back to Gdim, creating a cyclical, unresolved feel.
