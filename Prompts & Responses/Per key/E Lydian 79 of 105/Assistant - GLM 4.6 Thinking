**Assistant - GLM 4.6 Thinking**

### Reasoning

1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user has provided a sequence of chords: `E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E`. They want to know the key and mode.

2.  **Initial Triage & Simplification:**
    *   The chords are repeated a lot. Let's list the unique chords:
        *   E (or E major)
        *   C#m/E
        *   G#m/D#
        *   F#7/E
        *   Bmaj7/D#
    *   The slash chords are important. What do they mean?
        *   `C#m/E`: This is a C# minor triad (C# - E - G#) with an E in the bass. The notes are E, G#, C#. This is an inversion of the C# minor chord, specifically the first inversion.
        *   `G#m/D#`: This is a G# minor triad (G# - B - D#) with a D# in the bass. The notes are D#, G#, B. This is also the first inversion of G# minor.
        *   `F#7/E`: This is an F# dominant 7th chord (F# - A# - C# - E) with an E in the bass. The notes are E, F#, A#, C#. The E is not part of the core F#7 chord, so this is a slash chord, not just a simple inversion. It creates a specific sonority and voice-leading effect.
        *   `Bmaj7/D#`: This is a B major 7th chord (B - D# - F# - A#) with a D# in the bass. The notes are D#, F#, A#, B. This is the third inversion of the Bmaj7 chord.

3.  **Identify the Tonal Center:**
    *   The chord `E` appears most frequently. It starts the progression and ends it. This is a very strong indicator that E is the tonic, or the "home" chord.
    *   The bass note `E` is also very prominent. Let's look at the bass notes of each chord:
        *   E -> E
        *   C#m/E -> E
        *   E -> E
        *   G#m/D# -> D#
        *   F#7/E -> E
        *   E -> E
        *   C#m/E -> E
        *   E -> E
        *   Bmaj7/D# -> D#
        *   E -> E
    *   The bassline is heavily centered on E, with occasional moves to D#. This reinforces the idea of E as the tonal center.

4.  **Hypothesize a Key:** Based on the strong emphasis on E, the most likely key is E major or E minor.

5.  **Test the E Major Hypothesis:**
    *   The key of E major has four sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#. The scale is E - F# - G# - A - B - C# - D#.
    *   Let's analyze the chords in the context of E major:
        *   **E:** The I chord (tonic). Perfect. This is our home base.
        *   **C#m/E:** This is the vi chord (C#m) in first inversion. In E major, C#m is the vi chord (C# - E - G#). The notes fit perfectly. The function is the submediant.
        *   **G#m/D#:** This is the iii chord (G#m) in first inversion. In E major, G#m is the iii chord (G# - B - D#). The notes fit perfectly. The function is the mediant.
        *   **F#7/E:** This is the most interesting one.
            *   The F#7 chord itself is the V7/V (the dominant of the dominant). The dominant of E is B7. The dominant of B is F#7. So F#7 naturally leads to B.
            *   However, the bass note is E. This is not a standard diatonic function. Let's look at the notes: E, F#, A#, C#.
            *   The E is the tonic. The F# and C# are diatonic. The A# is the only non-diatonic note (the raised 4th degree in E major).
            *   An F#7 chord with an E in the bass is often used as a *backdoor dominant* or a *plagal dominant* type of sound, but it's more complex. Let's re-examine. F#7 is V/V. Resolving it to the I chord (E) by keeping the bass note static (E) creates a specific type of cadence, sometimes called a "cadential 6/4" type feel, but not exactly. It's a common device in rock and pop. The F#7 wants to resolve to B, but instead, it resolves to E while the bass stays put. This is a very strong confirmation of E as the tonic. It's a chromatic chord that reinforces the tonic.
        *   **Bmaj7/D#:** Bmaj7 is the IV chord in E major (B - D# - F# - A#). All notes are diatonic. The D# in the bass is the third of the chord. This is a standard IV chord, often called the subdominant.

6.  **Test the E Minor Hypothesis:**
    *   The key of E natural minor has one sharp: F#. The scale is E - F# - G - A - B - C - D.
    *   Let's analyze the chords:
        *   **E:** The i chord. Okay.
        *   **C#m/E:** Contains a C# and a G#. These are not in E natural minor. This chord is not diatonic to E natural minor.
        *   **G#m/D#:** Contains G# and D#. Not diatonic.
        *   **F#7/E:** Contains A# and C#. Not diatonic.
        *   **Bmaj7/D#:** Contains D# and A#. Not diatonic.
    *   Conclusion: The progression is definitely not in E minor.

7.  **Consider Other Keys/Modes:**
    *   Could it be A major? The chords would be I (A), V (E), ii (Bm), vi (F#m). The progression is centered on E, not A. E is the V chord in A major, and it feels like the tonic here.
    *   Could it be B major? The chords would be IV (E), vi (G#m), ii (C#m). This is a possibility. The progression would be IV - vi - IV - V/V - I (in B) ??? No, the progression starts and ends on E. If it were in B, the progression would be `IV - vi - IV - V/V - I - vi - IV - I`. This is a plausible progression, but it feels less likely. The overwhelming emphasis on E makes it the stronger candidate for the tonic. The `F#7/E` chord is also a huge clue. In the key of B, F#7 is the V chord. An F#7/E would be a V/IV (secondary dominant leading to the IV chord, which is E). This is also plausible. Let's re-evaluate the `F#7/E` to Bmaj7/D# resolution. F#7 -> Bmaj7. This is a perfect V -> I resolution *in the key of B major*. The bass notes are E -> D#. This is a descending bassline.
    *   Let's map the whole thing in B major:
        *   E (IV)
        *   C#m/E (ii/IV) - a ii chord in first inversion with a pedal point E (the 4th degree of B). This is a bit unusual but possible.
        *   E (IV)
        *   G#m/D# (vi/iii) - a vi chord in first inversion with a pedal point D# (the 3rd degree of B).
        *   F#7/E (V/IV) - a secondary dominant resolving to the IV chord (E). The E in the bass is the target chord's root.
        *   E (IV)
        *   C#m/E (ii/IV)
        *   E (IV)
        *   Bmaj7/D# (I) - The I chord in third inversion.
        *   E (IV)
    *   So, in B major, the progression is: `IV - ii/IV - IV - vi/iii - V/IV - IV - ii/IV - IV - I - IV`. This is *extremely* convoluted. The relationship to B as a tonic is weak, only appearing at the very end. The overwhelming feeling is "E".

8.  **Revisiting the E Major Hypothesis and Mode:**
    *   We've established E major is the most likely key. Let's look at the chord functions again:
        *   `E`: I (tonic)
        *   `C#m/E`: vi (submediant)
        *   `G#m/D#`: iii (mediant)
        *   `F#7/E`: V/V (secondary dominant) with a pedal point on the tonic (E). This is a very strong confirmation of the tonic.
        *   `Bmaj7/D#`: IV (subdominant)
    *   The progression is: `I - vi - I - iii - V/V (over I) - I - vi - I - IV - I`. This is a very logical and common-sounding progression in modern music. It heavily emphasizes the tonic (I) chord and uses common diatonic and chromatic chords.
    *   Is it a *mode*? The chords are derived from the E major scale (with one chromatic alteration, A# in F#7 and Bmaj7). The F#7 is a secondary dominant, which is a concept from functional harmony (major/minor key system), not modal harmony.
    *   Modal harmony typically avoids secondary dominants and strong V-I cadences because they pull the ear back to the parent major key. This progression, with its strong I chord and the V/V chord pulling towards a B (which is the V of E), is firmly rooted in functional harmony, not modal.
    *   Therefore, the key is **E Major**.

9.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: The key is E Major.
    *   Explain the reasoning step-by-step.
    *   **Step 1: Identify the Tonic.** Point out that the E chord is the most frequent, starts and ends the phrase, and is used as a pedal point in the bass. This establishes E as the tonal center.
    *   **Step 2: Analyze the Chords against the E Major Scale.**
        *   List the notes of the E major scale (E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#).
        *   Go through each unique chord and show how its notes fit within the E major framework.
        *   `E` = I chord (Tonic).
        *   `C#m/E` = vi chord (Submediant). Explain it's just an inversion.
        *   `G#m/D#` = iii chord (Mediant). Explain it's an inversion.
        *   `Bmaj7/D#` = IV chord (Subdominant). Explain it's an inversion.
    *   **Step 3: Address the "Tricky" Chord.** The `F#7/E` is the most important piece of evidence.
        *   Explain that F#7 is the "dominant of the dominant" (V/V or V7/V). In the key of E, the dominant is B7. The dominant of B is F#7.
        *   Explain its function: It creates tension that wants to resolve to B (the V chord). However, by placing the tonic note (E) in the bass, it resolves *deceptively* back to the tonic, creating a strong sense of "home." This is a common and powerful technique in rock, pop, and jazz.
    *   **Step 4: Rule out other possibilities.** Briefly explain why it's not E minor (due to C#, G#, D#, A#) and why it's unlikely to be another key like A or B (the functional pull is towards E, not those other chords).
    *   **Step 5: Conclude on Mode.** Explain that because the progression uses functional harmony concepts like secondary dominants (V/V) and a strong tonic, it is in the traditional major key system, not a mode. A modal piece would avoid these strong functional pulls.
    *   **Final Summary:** Restate the conclusion clearly: The progression is in the key of E Major. Provide a chord-by-chord functional analysis as a final, clear summary. This adds a professional touch and solidifies the explanation.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **E Major**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. Identifying the Tonic (The "Home" Chord)

The strongest indicator of a key is its tonic chord. In this progression, the **E major chord** is overwhelmingly present:

*   It appears most frequently.
*   It starts and ends the sequence.
*   The bass note **E** is used as a pedal point (a sustained bass note under changing harmonies) in three of the five unique chord types (`E`, `C#m/E`, `F#7/E`).

This constant reinforcement of E strongly suggests it is the tonal center.

### 2. Analyzing the Chords in the Context of E Major

The key of E Major has four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#). Let's see how each chord fits into this key.

*   **E**: This is the **I chord** (the tonic) in E Major. **(E - G# - B)**
*   **C#m/E**: This is a C# minor chord with an E in the bass. C# minor is the **vi chord** in E Major. The slash just means it's in the first inversion. **(E - G# - C#)**. All notes are diatonic (belong to the scale).
*   **G#m/D#**: This is a G# minor chord with a D# in the bass. G# minor is the **iii chord** in E Major. This is also in first inversion. **(D# - G# - B)**. All notes are diatonic.
*   **Bmaj7/D#**: This is a B major 7th chord with a D# in the bass. Bmaj7 is the **IV chord** (the subdominant) in E Major. **(D# - F# - A# - B)**. All notes are diatonic.

### 3. The Crucial Chromatic Chord: F#7/E

This chord is the most complex but ultimately confirms the key of E Major.

*   **F#7** is the **dominant of the dominant** (written as **V/V** or "five of five"). In the key of E, the dominant chord is B7. The chord that leads to B7 is F#7.
*   By playing F#7 over an **E bass note**, you create a powerful tension. The F#7 chord wants to resolve to B, but the bass is already sitting on the tonic, E. When the progression resolves back to the E chord, it creates a strong, satisfying confirmation of E as the "home" key. This is a very common device in modern rock, pop, and film music.

### 4. Why It's Not a Mode

While the chords are all derived from the E major scale (with one chromatic note, A#, which is part of the V/V and IV chords), the harmony is **functional**, not modal.

*   **Modal harmony** typically avoids strong functional pulls like V7/V chords. Its goal is to establish a "flavor" or mood, not to create a strong tonic-dominant tension and resolution.
*   This progression is built on functional harmony: it heavily emphasizes the tonic (I), uses the subdominant (IV), and employs a secondary dominant (V/V) to create tension before resolving back to the tonic. This is the hallmark of traditional major/minor key music.

### Summary of Chord Functions in E Major

*   **E**: **I** (Tonic)
*   **C#m/E**: **vi** (Submediant, 1st inversion)
*   **G#m/D#**: **iii** (Mediant, 1st inversion)
*   **F#7/E**: **V/V** (Secondary Dominant) with a tonic pedal
*   **Bmaj7/D#**: **IV** (Subdominant, 3rd inversion)

**Conclusion:** The progression is firmly in the key of **E Major**.
