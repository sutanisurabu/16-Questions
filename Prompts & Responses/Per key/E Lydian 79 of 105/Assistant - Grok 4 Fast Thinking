### Key and Mode Analysis

Based on the given chord progression (E - E - C#m/E - C#m/E - E - E - G#m/D# - F#7/E - E - E - C#m/E - C#m/E - E - E - Bmaj7/D# - E), here's a breakdown of the key and mode. This appears to be a repetitive, pedal-based progression (heavily centered on E in the bass), common in rock/pop songs for creating tension and resolution.

#### Primary Key: **E Major**
- **Why E Major?**
  - The progression strongly revolves around **E major** as the tonic (I chord). It starts and ends on E, and most chords resolve back to it, creating a clear sense of "home."
  - Key diatonic chords present:
    - E: I (tonic)
    - C#m: vi (submediant, functioning as a relative minor)
    - G#m: iii (mediant)
    - Bmaj7: Vmaj7 (approaching dominant, with a major 7th extension for color)
  - The slash chords (e.g., C#m/E, G#m/D#, F#7/E, Bmaj7/D#) use bass pedals on E (the root) or D# (the leading tone, #7 in E major), which reinforces E as the tonal center without shifting keys. This is a classic pedal point technique for emphasis and drive.
  - Non-diatonic elements:
    - F#7: This is a secondary dominant (V7/V), pulling toward B (the V chord) before resolving back to E. It's common in E major for added tension.
    - Bmaj7: The major 7th (A#) introduces a slight chromaticism (borrowed from E Lydian or harmonic minor contexts), but it still functions as the dominant (V) rather than a full key change. In rock/jazz, Vmaj7 is often used instead of V7 for a smoother, less "resolved" sound.
  - No strong evidence of modulation—everything orbits E major. The D# bass notes (in G#m/D# and Bmaj7/D#) act as leading tones, heightening expectation before resolving to E.

- **Chord Functions in E Major (Simplified Roman Numeral Analysis)**:
  - E: I
  - E: I
  - C#m/E: vi⁶ (vi in first inversion, or vi over pedal I)
  - C#m/E: vi⁶
  - E: I
  - E: I
  - G#m/D#: iii⁷ (iii over leading-tone bass)
  - F#7/E: V7/V over I (secondary dominant of V, pedaled)
  - E: I
  - (Repetition follows the same pattern)
  - Bmaj7/D#: Vmaj7⁷ (Vmaj7 over leading-tone bass)
  - E: I

  The progression builds tension via the vi (C#m) and secondary dominants, then releases on I (E). It's repetitive and hypnotic, likely from a verse or intro section.

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major Mode)**
- **Why Ionian?**
  - E major is the Ionian mode (the standard "major" scale: E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D#-E).
  - No flattened 3rd, 6th, or 7th to suggest minor modes (e.g., Aeolian or Dorian).
  - No raised 4th (F## or G natural) to indicate Lydian.
  - The major tonic (E) and dominant (B major family) chords, plus the overall bright, resolved feel, align perfectly with Ionian.
  - Subtle extensions (like the maj7 in Bmaj7) add a modal flavor (hinting at Lydian, which shares chords with Ionian but raises the 4th), but the core structure doesn't alter the mode—it's still Ionian with color.

#### Additional Notes
- **Scale Implied**: E Ionian (E major scale). For soloing/improvisation over this, stick to E major, but watch for the F#7 (briefly implying B major/G# minor) and Bmaj7 (avoiding A natural in favor of A# for smoothness).
- **Song Context?** This progression vaguely resembles elements from classic rock tracks like the Eagles' "Hotel California" (in B minor, but with similar pedal feels) or Boston's "More Than a Feeling" (in D major, with vi-I moves), but it's not an exact match. If this is from a specific song, more context could refine the analysis.
- **Potential Variations**: If played with certain voicings (e.g., emphasizing A# in Bmaj7), it could lean toward E Lydian (#4: A# instead of A), but the chords don't demand it—E major/Ionian is the safest and most straightforward fit.

If you provide more context (e.g., melody, full song, or genre), I can refine this further!
