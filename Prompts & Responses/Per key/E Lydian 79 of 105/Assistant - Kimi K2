To determine the key and mode of this chord progression, let's analyze it step by step:

---

### **Given Chords:**
E E C#m/E C#m/E  
E E G#m/D# F#7/E  
E E C#m/E C#m/E  
E E Bmaj7/D# E  

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Root and Tonic**
The progression starts and ends on **E major**, and **E** is the most frequently occurring chord. This strongly suggests that **E is the tonic**.

---

### **Step 2: Examine the Chords in the Context of E Major**
Let’s list the chords and see how they fit into the E major scale:

- **E major** → I (tonic)
- **C#m** → vi (relative minor)
- **G#m** → iii
- **F#7** → V7 (dominant 7th)
- **Bmaj7** → IVmaj7

All these chords are **diatonic to the E major scale**:
- E major scale: **E F# G# A B C# D# E**
- Chords in E major:
  - I: E major
  - ii: F#m
  - iii: G#m
  - IV: A major
  - V: B major
  - vi: C#m
  - vii°: D#dim

So far, all chords fit **E major (Ionian mode)**.

---

### **Step 3: Check for Mode Indicators**
- **No minor tonic**: Not E minor.
- **No raised 4th (Lydian) or lowered 7th (Mixolydian)**: No modal inflections.
- **F#7** is the **V7**, which is characteristic of **major key functional harmony**.
- **Bmaj7** is the **IVmaj7**, also standard in major keys.

---

### **Step 4: Bass Movement**
The bass notes are:
- E → E → E → E  
- E → E → D# → E  
- E → E → E → E  
- E → E → D# → E  

The bass stays mostly on **E**, with occasional **D#** (the leading tone in E major), reinforcing the **E major tonal center**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
This progression is in **E major (Ionian mode)**.  
There are no modal inflections or chromaticisms that would suggest a mode other than Ionian.
