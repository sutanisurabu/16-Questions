Let’s break this down step by step.  

The chord progression you gave is:  

**E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  G#m/D#  F#7/E  E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  Bmaj7/D#  E**

### 1. Identify the root chords (ignoring bass notes for now)
- **E** major  
- **C#m** (C♯ minor)  
- **G#m** (G♯ minor)  
- **F#7** (F♯ dominant 7)  
- **Bmaj7** (B major 7)  

---

### 2. Look for tonal center
The progression starts and ends on **E**, and E appears frequently.  
The chords **C#m**, **G#m**, **F#7**, and **B** are all diatonic to the key of **E major**:

E major scale: E F♯ G♯ A B C♯ D♯  
Chords in E major:  
- E (I)  
- F♯m (ii) — but here we have F♯7 (V7/V function)  
- G♯m (iii)  
- A (IV) — not present  
- B (V)  
- C♯m (vi)  
- D♯dim (vii°) — not present  

F♯7 is not diatonic to E major — it’s the **V7 of B**, which is the V chord in E major (secondary dominant).  

---

### 3. Check for E minor possibility
E minor scale: E F♯ G A B C D  
Chords in E natural minor:  
- Em (i) — but we have E major, not minor  
- F♯dim (ii°) — not present  
- G (III) — not present  
- Am (iv) — not present  
- Bm (v) — but we have B major (V)  
- C (VI) — not present  
- D (VII) — not present  

The presence of **G♯** (in G♯m) and **D♯** (in Bmaj7) means we’re not in E natural minor.  
Also, E major as tonic and V (B) major instead of B minor suggests **E major**, not minor.

---

### 4. Secondary dominant analysis
F♯7 → B is V7/V → V in E major.  
This is a common progression in major keys.

---

### 5. Bass movement
Many chords have alternate bass notes:  
- C#m/E = C♯m with E bass → still functions as vi chord but with E pedal  
- G#m/D♯ = iii chord with D♯ bass (D♯ is the 7th of E major scale)  
- Bmaj7/D♯ = V chord with D♯ bass (D♯ is leading tone to E)  

The bass often returns to E, reinforcing E as the tonic.

---

### 6. Conclusion
The key is **E major** (Ionian mode).  
The mode is **major** (not minor or other mode), because:
- Tonic chord is E major  
- Diatonic chords except for the secondary dominant F♯7  
- Leading tone D♯ is present in the scale (Bmaj7/D♯)  
- No Aeolian or Dorian flat notes (G♯ not G natural, etc.)

**Final answer:**  
**Key: E**  
**Mode: Major**
