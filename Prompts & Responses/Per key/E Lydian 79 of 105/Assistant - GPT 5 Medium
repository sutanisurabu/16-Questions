### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord notation**

I'm trying to understand the chord notation F#7/E, which means F#7 with E in the bass. I realize that E is included as the dominant 7th. So, it's more like a polychord, or E13b9. It functions as V/V with an E pedal bass common in E major progressions. Bmaj7/D# shows a Vmaj7 in first inversion. But Bmaj7 isn't strongly diatonic in E major, as the diatonic seventh on V is actually B7, which includes a minor seventh.**Exploring Bmaj7 and E major**

I’m looking at Bmaj7, which includes A#, a raised 7th of B that’s not from E major. It seems that A# is borrowed from the Lydian mode. The diatonic seventh chord on scale degree 5 should actually be a dominant seventh, not major. In E major, A is natural, making A# a leading tone in B major. So Bmaj7 might suggest tonicizing B major or Lydian. Bmaj7 over D# fits well in E Lydian, which has A# instead of A natural.**Clarifying Bmaj7 and E Lydian**

I’ve confirmed that Bmaj7 is diatonic in the E Lydian mode, which is exciting! Then there's F#7/E, which contains A# as well, functioning as the Lydian #4 relative to E. Checking other chords, I see E major includes E, G#, and B, while C#m/E uses E in the bass. G#m/D# is also diatonic. The main difference between E Ionian and E Lydian is A natural versus A#. In the progression of E, C#m, G#m, and Bmaj7, there’s no indication of A natural.**Determining key and mode**

The presence of A# in Bmaj7 and F#7, along with the absence of A natural, strongly suggests that the piece is in E Lydian or E major with a borrowed #4. The stable E bass in chords like C#m/E indicates a pedal point on E, establishing the modal center. The Bmaj7/D# acts as the V of E Lydian. Overall, I'd conclude the key center is E, with the mode being Lydian. If asked, I’d summarize that E Lydian is the answer.**Summarizing key center and mode**

I’ve concluded the key center is E and the mode is Lydian, as indicated by the absence of A natural. The A# serves as the hallmark #4 of Lydian. E Lydian is the fourth mode of the B major scale, which contains the notes: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, and D#. Functional analysis reinforces this, with E being tonic and Bmaj7 providing a dominant seventh. Overall, the focus on E and the presence of A# solidify this conclusion.

E Lydian.

- Center: E is reinforced by the pedal E bass and frequent E triad.
- Lydian color: F#7 (with A#) and Bmaj7 (with A#) introduce the #4 (A#) over E, and there’s no A natural.
- Parent scale: B major (E F# G# A# B C# D#).
