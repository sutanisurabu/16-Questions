**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

The given chord progression (E – E – C#m/E – C#m/E – E – E – G#m/D# – F#7/E – E – E – C#m/E – C#m/E – E – E – Bmaj7/D# – E) is in the **key of E Lydian**. 

This fits the Lydian mode due to the consistent use of A# (#4 scale degree) in chords like F#7 and Bmaj7, alongside diatonic Lydian harmony on the other chords (e.g., E as I, C#m as vi, G#m as iii). The progression resolves to E and shows no evidence of the natural 4th (A) or other modal alterations.
