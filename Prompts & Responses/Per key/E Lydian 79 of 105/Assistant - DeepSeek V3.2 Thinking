**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, the user has given me a sequence of chords: E, E, C#m/E, C#m/E, E, E, G#m/D#, F#7/E, E, E, C#m/E, C#m/E, E, E, Bmaj7/D#, E.

I need to determine the key and mode. Key refers to the tonic or home note, and mode refers to whether it's major or minor, or possibly another mode.

Chords are given with slashes, which might indicate inversions or bass notes. For example, C#m/E means a C# minor chord with an E in the bass, so it's an inversion.

To find the key, I should look at the chords and see which notes are emphasized, common progressions, and the overall tonal center.

List out the chords clearly:

- E

- E

- C#m/E (C# minor with E bass)

- C#m/E

- E

- E

- G#m/D# (G# minor with D# bass)

- F#7/E (F#7 with E bass)

- E

- E

- C#m/E

- C#m/E

- E

- E

- Bmaj7/D# (B major 7 with D# bass)

- E

Notice that many chords have E in the bass or are E chords. E appears frequently as the root chord.

Let me extract the root chords without the bass notes for simplicity, as the bass might not change the harmonic function significantly for key determination.

Root chords:

- E (major, I assume, since no specification)

- C#m (C# minor)

- G#m (G# minor)

- F#7 (F# dominant 7)

- Bmaj7 (B major 7)

E is repeated many times, and it starts and ends with E, which might indicate that E is the tonic.

Now, let's think about possible keys.

If E is the tonic, what key could it be?

- E major key: chords would include E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim.

- E minor key: chords would include Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D.

Looking at the chords: we have E (which could be major or minor, but in the sequence, it's likely major since no 'm' is specified, and it's common in chord notation to assume major if not specified), C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7.

In E major:

- E is I

- C#m is vi

- G#m is iii

- F#7 is V7 (dominant 7th)

- Bmaj7 is IVmaj7 (since B is the fourth degree in E major)

In E major, the IV chord is A, not B. E major scale: E F# G# A B C# D# E. So chords:

- I: E

- ii: F#m

- iii: G#m

- IV: A

- V: B

- vi: C#m

- vii: D#dim

But in the sequence, we have Bmaj7, which is B major 7, so in E major, B is V, and V7 would be B7, but here it's Bmaj7, which has a major 7th, not dominant. Bmaj7 in E major would be Vmaj7, but typically V is dominant, so B7 is more common for V7. Bmaj7 might suggest a different function.

Also, we have F#7, which is not in the diatonic chords of E major. In E major, the ii is F#m, not F#7. F#7 is a dominant 7th chord, which could be a secondary dominant.

Similarly, G#m is iii in E major.

But Bmaj7: if in E major, B is V, but V is usually dominant, so B7, not Bmaj7. Bmaj7 has a D# (the major 7th), whereas B7 has D natural (minor 7th). In E major, the seventh note is D#, so for B chord, if it's V, it should be B major with a minor 7th for dominant function, so B7. But Bmaj7 has a major 7th, which is D#.

In E major scale, the notes are E F# G# A B C# D#. So for B chord, the third is D#, fifth is F#, and if it's B7, the seventh should be A, but A is the fourth degree, so B7 would be B D# F# A, but A is not in the E major scale? E major scale has A as fourth, so B D# F# A – A is in the scale, yes. B D# F# A: D# is the third, F# is fifth, A is seventh. In E major, the seventh note is D#, so for B chord, the notes are B, D#, F#, and for B7, it's B, D#, F#, A. A is the fourth degree, so it's diatonic. B7 is V7 in E major.

But in the sequence, it's Bmaj7, which is B, D#, F#, A#? No, Bmaj7 is B major 7th chord: B, D#, F#, A#. A# is not in E major scale; E major has A natural, not A#. So Bmaj7 has A#, which is not diatonic to E major.

Similarly, F#7: F#7 is F# A# C# E? F# dominant 7th: root F#, major third A#, perfect fifth C#, minor seventh E. In E major scale, A# is not present; it has A natural. So F#7 has A#, which is not in E major.

Now, looking at other chords: C#m is vi in E major, which is diatonic. G#m is iii, diatonic. E is I, diatonic.

But F#7 and Bmaj7 are not diatonic to E major.

Perhaps it's in a different key.

Maybe E minor? E minor scale: E F# G A B C D E. Chords: Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D.

But in the sequence, we have E (assumed major), not Em. Also C#m – in E minor, C is natural minor, so C major or C minor? E natural minor has C natural, so chord would be C major, not C#m. C#m has C# and E and G#, but in E minor, G is natural, not G#. So C#m is not in E minor.

Similarly, G#m has G#, not in E minor. F#7 has A#, not in E minor. Bmaj7 has A#, not in E minor.

So probably not E minor.

Perhaps the key is E major, but with some chromaticism or borrowed chords.

But let's list all the root chords: E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7.

E, C#m, G#m are all in E major. F#7 and Bmaj7 are not.

F#7 could be a secondary dominant, perhaps V7 of B, since F#7 is V7 in B major or B minor.

Bmaj7 is a major 7th chord, which might be IV in F# major or something, but let's see the context.

The sequence starts and ends with E, and E is frequent, so likely E is tonic.

Now, F#7: if F#7 is V7 of B, then it resolves to B, but in the sequence, after F#7/E, it goes to E, not directly to B. The sequence is: ... G#m/D# F#7/E E ... so F#7/E to E. F#7/E means F#7 with E bass, so it's an inversion, but harmonically, it might still function as V7 of B, but resolving deceptively or something.

Similarly, Bmaj7/D#: Bmaj7 with D# bass, and then to E.

Bmaj7/D# is essentially Bmaj7 in first inversion, since D# is the third of Bmaj7.

Bmaj7 notes: B, D#, F#, A#. With D# bass, it's first inversion.

Then it goes to E.

In E major, if B is V, it should resolve to E, but Bmaj7 has A#, which is not diatonic, so it might be a different chord.

Perhaps the key is B major? Let's check.

If B is tonic, then in B major: scale B C# D# E F# G# A# B. Chords: I B, ii C#m, iii D#m, IV E, V F#, vi G#m, vii A#dim.

In the sequence, we have E, which could be IV in B major, C#m is ii, G#m is vi, F#7 is V7, Bmaj7 is I maj7.

But the sequence starts and ends with E, not B. It begins with E and ends with E, so E might be the tonic, not B.

In the sequence, E is played many times, and it's the first and last chord, so likely E is home.

Perhaps it's in E mixolydian or something. E mixolydian scale: E F# G# A B C# D E (same as B major scale). Chords in E mixolydian: I E, ii F#m, iii G#dim, IV A, V B, vi C#m, vii Dm.

But in the sequence, we have E (I), C#m (vi), G#m – but in E mixolydian, iii is G#dim, not G#m. G#m has G# B D#, but in E mixolydian, the third degree is G#, but for chord, based on scale, the iii chord would be G# B D, since D is natural in mixolydian? E mixolydian scale: E F# G# A B C# D E. So notes: 1E 2F# 3G# 4A 5B 6C# 7D.

So chords:

- I: E G# B (E major)

- ii: F# A C# (F#m)

- iii: G# B D (G# diminished? G# B D is G# dim)

- IV: A C# E (A major)

- V: B D F# (B minor? B D F# is Bm)

- vi: C# E G# (C# minor? C# E G# is C#m)

- vii: D F# A (D major? D F# A is D major)

In E mixolydian, V is Bm, not B major. But in the sequence, we have Bmaj7, which is B major 7, so B D# F# A#, but in E mixolydian, the fifth degree is B, but the chord should be Bm if diatonic, since the seventh is D natural.

Bmaj7 has D# and A#, while in E mixolydian, the third of B is D natural, and seventh is A natural? Let's clarify.

In E mixolydian, scale degrees: 1E 2F# 3G# 4A 5B 6C# 7D

So for chord on 5: B D F# – B D F# is B minor chord.

But Bmaj7 is B D# F# A#, so it has D# and A#, which are not in the scale; scale has D natural and A natural.

Similarly, F#7: F# A# C# E, but scale has A natural and E, so A# is not present.

So not E mixolydian.

Another idea: perhaps the key is A major or something, but E is frequent.

Let's list the bass notes as well, as they might indicate the root movement.

The chords with slashes: C#m/E means bass is E, so the chord is C#m but bass is E, so it's like an E major with added 6th or something? C#m is C# E G#, so if bass is E, it's E G# C#, which is E major with an added 6th? E major is E G# B, so E G# C# is E6, since C# is the 6th.

Similarly, G#m/D#: G#m is G# B D#, with D# bass, so D# G# B, which is D# diminished? D# G# B is D# dim, but G#m is minor, so G# B D#, with D# bass, it's first inversion of G#m.

G#m chords: root G#, minor third B, perfect fifth D#. So G#m/D# is G#m in first inversion.

Similarly, F#7/E: F#7 is F# A# C# E, with E bass, so E F# A# C#, which is E7#9 or something? E F# A# C# – F# is 9th, A# is #11, C# is 13th, but it's messy. Harmonically, it's F#7 with E in bass, so it might be a passing chord or something.

Bmaj7/D#: Bmaj7 is B D# F# A#, with D# bass, so D# B F# A#, which is D#m7b5 or something? D# F# A# B – F# A# B D# – it's a Bmaj7 in first inversion.

But for key determination, the root chords are important.

Perhaps I should look at the chord functions.

Let me write the sequence with root chords and see the progression.

Sequence: E - E - C#m - C#m - E - E - G#m - F#7 - E - E - C#m - C#m - E - E - Bmaj7 - E

So root chords: E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7, and back to E.

Now, E to C#m: in E major, I to vi, common progression.

C#m to E: vi to I.

G#m to F#7: in E major, iii to ? F#7 is not diatonic.

F#7 to E: V7 of B to E, but V7 of B should resolve to B, but it goes to E, so perhaps deceptive resolution or E is tonic.

Then Bmaj7 to E: if B is V, it should resolve to I, but Bmaj7 has A#, which is not the leading tone in E major; in E major, leading tone is D#, which is in B chord if it's V, but Bmaj7 has D# (third) and A# (seventh), while in E major, for V7, it should be B D# F# A (B7), but here it's Bmaj7 with A#, so A# is the major 7th, not minor.

A# in E major would be the augmented fourth if we think in E, but it's not diatonic.

Perhaps the key is B major, and E is IV.

In B major: I B, ii C#m, iii D#m, IV E, V F#, vi G#m, vii A#dim.

In the sequence, we have E (IV), C#m (ii), G#m (vi), F#7 (V7), Bmaj7 (I maj7), and it starts and ends with E, not B. So if it's in B major, it should start and end with B, but it starts and ends with E, so E might be the tonic, or it's a piece that emphasizes IV.

But in many songs, it can start and end on IV, but it's less common.

Perhaps it's in E major with borrowed chords.

Another thought: look at the bass notes. The bass is often E, as in C#m/E, F#7/E, etc., so E is frequently in the bass, reinforcing E as the tonic.

In C#m/E, the bass is E, so it's like an E chord with color.

Similarly, F#7/E has E bass, so it might be functioning as a dominant with suspension or something.

Let's think about the mode. Perhaps it's E major, but with a raised seventh or something.

List all the notes involved in the chords.

First, E chord: E G# B

C#m: C# E G#

G#m: G# B D#

F#7: F# A# C# E

Bmaj7: B D# F# A#

Now, the scale that fits these notes? E, G#, B, C#, E, G# from C#m, G#, B, D# from G#m, F#, A#, C#, E from F#7, B, D#, F#, A# from Bmaj7.

So notes used: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D# 

From E chord: E, G#, B

C#m: C#, E, G# — so E, G#, B, C#

G#m: G#, B, D# — so add D#

F#7: F#, A#, C#, E — so add F#, A# (A# is new)

Bmaj7: B, D#, F#, A# — D# and F# and A# already, B already.

So all notes: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#

That's all seven notes: E F# G# A# B C# D#

What scale is this? E F# G# A# B C# D# E — that's E major scale? E major is E F# G# A B C# D# E, but here it's A# instead of A natural.

E F# G# A# B C# D# — this is E Lydian mode? Lydian has raised fourth. E Lydian scale: E F# G# A# B C# D# E, yes! Exactly.

E Lydian scale: 1E 2F# 3G# #4A# 5B 6C# 7D# 8E

Now, chords in E Lydian:

- I: E G# B (E major)

- ii: F# A# C# (F# major? F# A# C# is F# major)

- iii: G# B D# (G# minor? G# B D# is G# minor? G# B D# – B is minor third from G#? G# to B is minor third, yes, G# minor chord.

G# to B is minor third, B to D# is major third, so G# B D# is G# minor chord, yes.

- IV: A# C# E (A# diminished? A# C# E is A# dim? A# to C# is minor third, C# to E is minor third, so A# dim)

- V: B D# F# (B major? B D# F# is B major)

- vi: C# E G# (C# minor? C# E G# is C# minor)

- vii: D# F# A# (D# minor? D# F# A# – D# to F# is minor third, F# to A# is major third, so D# minor)

In E Lydian:

- I: E major

- ii: F# major (since A# is major third)

- iii: G# minor

- IV: A# diminished

- V: B major

- vi: C# minor

- vii: D# minor

Now, look at the chords in the sequence: E (I), C#m (vi), G#m (iii), F#7 – F#7 is F# A# C# E, which is F# dominant 7th. In E Lydian, the ii chord is F# major, which is F# A# C#, so F#7 would be F# A# C# E, and E is the seventh, which is minor seventh? F#7 has minor seventh, which is E, and in E Lydian, the seventh note is D#, so for F# chord, if it's ii, it should be F# major, but F#7 has E as seventh, which is not in the scale? E Lydian scale has E F# G# A# B C# D# E, so notes are E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#. So for F# chord, the notes are F#, A#, C#, and if it's F#7, it adds E, but E is the tonic, so it's like F#7 has E, which is the root, so it might be a secondary dominant or something.

In the sequence, F#7 is used, and it has E in the bass for F#7/E, so it's emphasizing E.

Similarly, Bmaj7: B D# F# A#, which in E Lydian, V chord is B major, so B D# F#, and Bmaj7 adds A#, which is the #4 of E, so it's diatonic to E Lydian.

Bmaj7 notes: B D# F# A# – all in E Lydian scale: B, D#, F#, A# are all in the scale.

Similarly, F#7: F# A# C# E – F#, A#, C# are in scale, E is in scale, so F#7 is also diatonic to E Lydian? E Lydian has E F# G# A# B C# D#, so notes F#, A#, C#, E are all in the scale. F#7 is F# A# C# E, which is the ii7 chord in E Lydian? In major scale, ii7 is minor 7th, but here in Lydian, ii is F# major, so F# A# C# is F# major, and if we add the seventh, what is the seventh? In Lydian mode, the chords are based on the scale degrees.

For chord on 2: F# A# C# – since A# is major third, it's F# major chord. The seventh note from F# in the scale: F# to what? The scale is E F# G# A# B C# D# E, so from F#, the notes are F# G# A# B C# D# E, so the seventh above F# is E? In chord terms, for a seventh chord, we take root, third, fifth, seventh.

For F# chord in E Lydian: root F#, third is A# (major third), fifth is C# (perfect fifth), seventh is E? The seventh note from F# in the scale is E, which is a major seventh below? Let's think in terms of intervals from root.

In E Lydian scale, the second degree is F#, so the chord built on F# using scale notes: root F#, third: G#? No, for chord, we take every other note.

Scale degrees: 1E 2F# 3G# 4A# 5B 6C# 7D#

So for chord on 2: notes 2,4,6,8? 2F# , 4A# , 6C# , and 8E? 8E is the same as 1E, so notes F#, A#, C#, E.

F# to A# is major third, A# to C# is minor third? A# to C# is major third? A# to C# is two semitones? A# to C is minor third, but A# to C# is major third? Let's calculate intervals.

F# to A#: F# to G is half, G to G# half, G# to A half, A to A# half, so from F# to A# is three semitones? F# to G:1, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, so F# to A# is four semitones? No:

Standard tuning: F# to G: semitone, G to G#: semitone, so F# to G#: two semitones (whole tone), G# to A: semitone, A to A#: semitone, so from F# to A#: F#-G-G#-A-A#, that's four steps? Let's list semitones.

F# to G: 1 semitone

G to G#: 1 semitone (but G# is same as Ab, but in this context, it's G#)

Easier to use note numbers.

Assume E=0, F#=2, G#=4, A#=6, B=7, C#=9, D#=11, E=12.

So scale: 0,2,4,6,7,9,11

Now, chord on F# (2): root 2, third: which third? Major third is +4 semitones, so 2+4=6, which is A#. Fifth: perfect fifth +7 semitones, 2+7=9, C#. Seventh: for major seventh chord, +11 semitones, 2+11=13 mod 12=1, which is F? No, 13-12=1, which is F, but in scale, the seventh note is D#=11, so for chord, the seventh is the note a seventh above, which in scale is E? Let's think diatonically.

In mode, for a seventh chord, we take the root, third, fifth, and seventh degrees of the scale from that root.

For chord on 2 in E Lydian: scale degrees relative to 2: 2(F#), 3(G#), 4(A#), 5(B), 6(C#), 7(D#), 8(E)

So for chord, we take root (2), third (4), fifth (6), and seventh (8)? Seventh is the note a seventh above, which is 8E.

Interval from F# to E: F# to G#: major second, G# to A#: major second, A# to B: minor second, B to C#: major second, C# to D#: major second, D# to E: minor second, so from F# to E is a minor seventh? F# to E is down a whole step, so minor seventh.

Yes, F# to E is minor seventh interval.

So chord on 2: F# A# C# E — F# to A# is major third, A# to C# is minor third? A# to C#: A# to B is semitone, B to C is semitone, B to C# is whole tone? A# to C: minor third, A# to C#: major third? Let's calculate semitones.

A# to C: A# to B:1, B to C:1, so 2 semitones, minor third.

A# to C#: A# to B:1, B to C:1, C to C#:1, so 3 semitones? A# to B is one semitone (since B is natural), B to C is one semitone, C to C# is one semitone, so from A# to C# is three semitones, which is minor third? No, three semitones is minor third? C to Eb is minor third, three semitones. But A# to C#: A# is same as Bb, so Bb to C# is augmented second, but in equal temperament, it's three semitones, same as minor third.

In terms of chord quality, F# A# C# E: F# to A# is four semitones? F# to G:1, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, so four semitones, which is major third.

A# to C#: A# to B:1, B to C:2, C to C#:3, so three semitones, which is minor third.

So F# A# C# is F# major chord (major third and perfect fifth).

Then adding E: F# to E is ten semitones? F# to E: F# to G:1, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, A# to B:5, B to C:6, C to C#:7, C# to D:8, D to D#:9, D# to E:10, so ten semitones, which is minor seventh (since major seventh is 11 semitones).

So F# A# C# E is F# dominant 7th chord, which is exactly F#7.

And in E Lydian, the ii chord is F# major, but with seventh, it's F#7, which is a dominant 7th chord, but in modal harmony, it's fine.

Similarly, for B chord: in E Lydian, V chord is B major: B D# F#. Bmaj7 adds A#, which is the major seventh, so B D# F# A# is B major 7th chord.

And in E Lydian, the V chord is B major, so Bmaj7 is diatonic.

Now, other chords: C#m is vi, G#m is iii, E is I.

So all chords are diatonic to E Lydian mode.

In the sequence, we have C#m/E, which is C#m with E bass, so in first inversion, but root is still C#m.

Similarly, others.

So the key is E, and the mode is Lydian.

Therefore, key: E, mode: Lydian.

To confirm, the scale is E F# G# A# B C# D# E, which matches all chords.

So for the user's query, I should say the key is E Lydian.

In terms of key and mode, often we say the key is E major, but mode is Lydian, meaning it's E Lydian, so tonic is E, and mode is Lydian.

In music theory, key can be specified with mode, e.g., E Lydian.

So I think that's it.

Based on the chord progression provided:

- **E** (I)
- **C#m/E** (vi in first inversion)
- **G#m/D#** (iii in first inversion)
- **F#7/E** (ii7 in first inversion, functioning as a dominant chord)
- **Bmaj7/D#** (Vmaj7 in first inversion)

The chords are all diatonic to the **E Lydian** mode. The E Lydian scale is: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#. This is consistent with the raised fourth (A#) present in chords like F#7 and Bmaj7, and the overall tonal center emphasizes E as the tonic.

**Key and Mode:** E Lydian (tonic: E, mode: Lydian).

This mode gives the progression its characteristic sound, with the raised fourth (A#) creating a bright, open quality compared to E major.
