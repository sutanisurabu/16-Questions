### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord sequence: E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E Bmaj7/D# E. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to understand the chords. Some have slashes, like C#m/E, which means C# minor with E as the bass note. Similarly, G#m/D# is G# minor over D#, and F#7/E has E as the bass. Bmaj7/D# is B major 7th with D# in the bass. So the actual chords might be different from what they appear at first glance because of the bass notes.

Let me list out the root notes ignoring the slashes for a moment: E, E, C#m, C#m, E, E, G#m, F#7, E, E, Bmaj7, E. But the bass notes complicate things. For example, C#m/E is a C# minor chord but E is in the bass, so the chord might function as an E major or something else? Wait, C#m has notes C#, E, G#. Over E bass, it's E, G#, C#—which is actually E major (E, G#, B) but missing the B. So it's incomplete, but the interval from E to G# is a major third, so it might imply E major even though the fifth (B) is missing. Similarly, G#m/D#: G# minor is G#, B, D#. Over D# bass, the notes are D#, G#, B—so D# to G# is a fourth, but D# to B is a minor sixth? Actually, D# to G# is a perfect fourth, and B is a minor third above G#? Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the bass note defining the chord's root for functional harmony.

The user is probably transcribing a song or analyzing a progression, so they might be confused by the slash chords. They likely want to know the tonal center. The sequence starts and ends on E, which is a strong indicator that E is the tonic. But I need to check the other chords to confirm.

Let me write out the actual bass notes: The bass notes are E, E, E, E, E, E, D#, E, E, E, D#, E. Wait, look at the sequence: First E is E root, then same. C#m/E has E bass, so bass is E. Similarly, G#m/D# has D# bass, F#7/E has E bass, Bmaj7/D# has D# bass. So the bass line is: E, E, E, E, E, E, D#, E, E, E, D#, E.

Hmm, so most of the time the bass is E, except for two instances where it's D#—in the G#m/D# and Bmaj7/D#. That's interesting. The D# appears only as bass notes for those two chords, but the chords themselves are built over G#m and Bmaj7.

Now, let's figure out the actual harmonic function. When a chord has a different bass note, it's often an inversion. But sometimes, the bass note creates a new harmonic implication.

Take C#m/E: Chord symbols suggest C# minor chord in first inversion (since E is the third of C#m). But in functional harmony, inversions don't change the chord's function; it's still C#m. However, the persistent E bass might give it an E major feel since E is the bass and part of the chord (C#m has E as the minor third). But C#m is a minor chord, so it wouldn't function as E major. Wait, actually, C#m with E in bass isn't a standard inversion for E major because E major would require B as the fifth. Here, it's C# and G# instead of B, so it's still C#m but with E in bass. So the chord quality is C# minor, even if the bass is E.

Similarly, G#m/D#: G# minor in second inversion (D# is the fifth of G#m). Bmaj7/D#: B major 7th first inversion (D# is the third of Bmaj7). F#7/E: F# dominant 7th second inversion? F#7 is F#, A#, C#, E. Over E bass, so E is the seventh, making it a third inversion dominant 7th chord.

Now, to find the key, I should look at all the notes used in the chords. Let's list the notes for each chord:

- E: E, G#, B (assuming major triad, as no minor is specified)
- C#m/E: C#, E, G# (so notes C#, E, G#)
- G#m/D#: G#, B, D#
- F#7/E: F#, A#, C#, E
- Bmaj7/D#: B, D#, F#, A#

But since the bass is emphasized, the key might be where E is the tonic. So possible keys: E major or E minor.

Check the chords against E major key. E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So chords in E major would be:

- E (I)
- F#m (ii)
- G#m (iii)
- A (IV)
- B (V)
- C#m (vi)
- D#dim (vii°)

Now, looking at the chords in the sequence:

- E: fits as I
- C#m: that's vi in E major
- G#m: that's iii in E major
- F#7: F#7 isn't diatonic to E major because E major has F# minor (ii), not F# dominant 7th. F#7 would require A# and C#, but E major has G# and D#, so F#7 has A# which is not in E major (E major has A natural). Wait, E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So the fourth scale degree is A natural. F#7 chord would be F#, A#, C#, E. A# is not in E major (it's Gx, but typically we say A natural, so A# is a chromatic note). So F#7 is a secondary dominant, probably V/V (dominant of B major, which is V in E major).

Similarly, Bmaj7: in E major, V is B major, so Bmaj7 is the major 7th version of V, which is common.

But wait, Bmaj7/D#—the chord is Bmaj7 with D# bass. D# is the third of B major, so it's just an inversion.

Now, G#m is iii in E major, which is diatonic.

C#m is vi, diatonic.

F#7 is not diatonic; it's a secondary dominant pointing to B (V).

Also, the progression has E - C#m - E - E - G#m - F#7 - E - E - Bmaj7 - E.

In E major, this makes sense: I - vi - I - I - iii - V/V (F#7) - I - I - V (Bmaj7) - I.

The F#7 is acting as the dominant of B, leading to Bmaj7, which then resolves to E. So the V/V -> V -> I cadence is classic.

But let's check the bass notes. The D# appears in G#m/D# and Bmaj7/D#. In G#m/D#, the notes are D# (bass), G#, B. In E major, D# is the leading tone (vii), but here it's part of G#m chord (which is iii). So G#m/D# is still iii, just in second inversion. Similarly, Bmaj7/D# is V in first inversion.

The only non-diatonic chord here is F#7. F#7 has A# which is not in E major (E major has A natural). But secondary dominants are common, so F#7 is borrowed as V/V.

Therefore, the key is very likely E major.

Now, the user also asks for the mode. Modes are scales like Dorian, Mixolydian, etc. But in this context, since it's a major key with a secondary dominant, it's probably just the Ionian mode (which is the major scale). However, let's see if any chords suggest a mode mixture.

For example, if there was a minor IV chord, it might suggest Mixolydian, but here IV is A major (not present in the progression). The chords used are all diatonic to E major except F#7, which is a secondary dominant, not a modal mixture.

F#7 is standard in major keys for dominant function. So no evidence of a different mode; it's straightforward E major (Ionian).

But let's double-check E minor. E natural minor scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Chords would be Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D. But the progression has E major (not minor), C#m (which isn't in E minor—E minor has C major), G#m (not in E minor—G natural), etc. So it doesn't fit.

E harmonic minor would have G# and D#, so chords: Em, F#dim, G#aug, Am, B, C, D#dim. Still, C#m isn't here; it would be C major in harmonic minor? Wait, E harmonic minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D#. So the sixth is C natural, not C#. So C#m wouldn't fit. Also, the tonic chord is E major in the progression, not minor. So E minor is out.

Therefore, E major is confirmed.

The mode is Ionian, but typically we just say "key of E major" without specifying the mode since major key implies Ionian.

But the user might be expecting a mode if it's not standard major/minor. However, in this case, it's clearly E major.

Another thing: the progression emphasizes E as tonic, with cadences like F#7 (V/V) leading to B (V) leading to E (I). Strong authentic cadence.

Also, the D# in the bass for G#m and Bmaj7: D# is the leading tone in E major (since E major's leading tone is D#), so it's reinforcing the dominant function towards E.

So, final answer: Key is E major, mode is Ionian.

Based on the chord progression you provided—**E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E Bmaj7/D# E**—I'll break down the analysis step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**. The progression heavily implies **E major (Ionian mode)**, but let's examine why.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Chord Functions (Ignoring Bass Notes First)**
List the "true" chords by focusing on their **root notes** (ignoring slash inversions for harmonic analysis):
- **E** (repeated 8 times total)
- **C#m** (appears twice as C#m/E)
- **G#m** (appears once as G#m/D#)
- **F#7** (appears once as F#7/E)
- **Bmaj7** (appears once as Bmaj7/D#)

This simplifies to:  
**E – E – C#m – C#m – E – E – G#m – F#7 – E – E – Bmaj7 – E**

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Chord Relationships Against E Major**
The **E major scale** (Ionian mode) consists of:  
**E F# G# A B C# D#**  

Diatonic chords in E major are:
- **I**: E (E-G#-B)
- **ii**: F#m (F#-A-C#)
- **iii**: G#m (G#-B-D#)
- **IV**: A (A-C#-E)
- **V**: B (B-D#-F#)
- **vi**: C#m (C#-E-G#)
- **vii°**: D#dim (D#-F#-A)

Now, map your chords to this:
- **E** = **I** (tonic, diatonic)
- **C#m** = **vi** (diatonic relative minor)
- **G#m** = **iii** (diatonic)
- **Bmaj7** = **Vmaj7** (diatonic dominant with added 7th)
- **F#7** = **V/V** (secondary dominant, *not diatonic* but functional)

#### **Why F#7 is Key Here**
- **F#7** (F#-A#-C#-E) contains **A#**, which is **not in E major** (E major uses **A natural**).  
- However, F#7 acts as the **dominant of B (V)** → resolving to **Bmaj7** (V) before returning to **E (I)**. This is a classic **V/V → V → I cadence**, common in major keys.  
- In E major:  
  - **F#7 = V/V** (dominant of the dominant, B)  
  - **Bmaj7 = V** (dominant leading back to tonic)  

#### **Bass Note Context (Slash Chords)**
- **C#m/E**: C#m chord with **E in bass** (first inversion). Still functions as **vi**, but emphasizes **E** as a pedal tone.  
- **G#m/D#**: G#m chord with **D# in bass** (second inversion). D# is the **leading tone** to E, reinforcing tonic pull.  
- **F#7/E**: F#7 chord with **E in bass** (third inversion). Creates tension resolving to Bmaj7.  
- **Bmaj7/D#**: Bmaj7 chord with **D# in bass** (first inversion). D# (leading tone) strongly pulls to **E**.  

**The bass line** (E-E-E-E-E-E-**D#**-E-E-E-**D#**-E) uses **D# as a leading tone** to E, confirming **E as the tonal center**. The two D#-bass chords (G#m/D# and Bmaj7/D#) create chromatic motion toward E.

---

### **Step 3: Eliminate Other Keys/Modes**
- **E minor?**  
  E natural minor (E-F#-G-A-B-C-D) has chords like **Em**, **Am**, **Bm**—none match the **major E tonic** or **C#m/G#m** here. E harmonic minor (with D#) has **B major** as V, but lacks **C#m** and **F#7** functionality. **Rejected**.  

- **Other Modes (Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.)?**  
  - **E Dorian** (E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D) would have **D natural** (not D#). Your chords use **D#** (in G#m and Bmaj7), ruling this out.  
  - **E Mixolydian** (E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D) also uses **D natural**—but your progression has **D#**, so **rejected**.  
  - **C# minor?** C#m is present, but the **tonic is clearly E** (starts/ends on E, with strong V-I resolution). **Rejected**.  

---

### **Conclusion: Key and Mode**
- **Key: E major**  
- **Mode: Ionian** (the standard major scale)  

#### **Why?**
- All diatonic chords (**I, iii, vi, V**) align perfectly with **E major**.  
- **F#7** is a functional secondary dominant (**V/V**), not a modal mixture—it’s a common device in major keys to strengthen the V-I resolution.  
- The **tonic (E)** is unambiguous:  
  - Starts/ends on E.  
  - Cadences with **F#7 → Bmaj7 → E** (V/V → V → I).  
  - Bass notes emphasize **E** and its **leading tone D#**.  

This progression is a textbook example of **tonal harmony in E major**, using inversions for smooth voice-leading and a secondary dominant for dramatic resolution. No modal borrowing is present—it’s pure **Ionian**.
