To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

```
E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E
```

### Step 1: List the unique chords

Let’s extract and identify the chords:

| Chord        | Root | Type      | Bass Note |
|--------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| E            | E    | Major     | E         |
| C#m/E        | C#   | Minor     | E         |
| G#m/D#       | G#   | Minor     | D#        |
| F#7/E        | F#   | Dominant 7| E         |
| Bmaj7/D#     | B    | Major 7   | D#        |

Note: Chords like `C#m/E` mean a C# minor chord with E in the bass — so it’s a **C# minor first inversion**. We care about the **harmonic function**, not just the root.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the chord tones in context of E major

Let’s assume the tonal center is **E** (since it starts and ends on E, and appears most frequently). Check if all chords fit into **E major** or a related mode.

#### E Major Scale: E F# G# A B C# D#

Chords built on each degree (triads):

- I: E major ✅
- ii: F#m ❌ (we have F#7 — close)
- iii: G#m ✅
- IV: A major ❌ (not present)
- V: B major ✅ (we have Bmaj7 — close)
- vi: C#m ✅
- vii°: D#dim ❌ (we have D# as bass note, but not as a chord)

Now, we have:

- **E major** → I ✅
- **C#m** → vi ✅
- **G#m** → iii ✅
- **F#7** → ii7? But in E major, ii is F#m — not F#7.
- **Bmaj7** → V7? But in E major, V is B major (or B7), not Bmaj7.

Wait — **Bmaj7** is not in E major.  
→ In E major, the V chord should be **B7** (B-D#-F#-A) to strongly resolve to E.

But we have **Bmaj7** (B-D#-F#-A#). The A# is the **major 7th**, which is **not in E major** — E major has A natural.

So **Bmaj7 contains A#**, which is **not in E major scale**.

Similarly, **F#7** is F#-A#-C#-E — which implies A# again (not in E major).

So the presence of **A#** strongly suggests we are **not** in E major.

---

### Step 3: Look for a key with A#

The note **A#** is the **leading tone** of B major, and the **#4** of E major — which is *outside*.

Let’s consider **E major ↔ E Lydian**?

E Lydian = E F# G# A# B C# D# — yes! That’s the **Lydian mode** of B major.

Wait — **E Lydian** is the **4th mode of B major**:

- B major scale: B C# D# E F# G# A#
- 4th degree = E → E Lydian = E F# G# A# B C# D#

That’s the key! 🚀

Let’s check if all chords fit in **E Lydian**.

**E Lydian scale**: E F# G# A# B C# D#

Now, build diatonic chords:

- I: E major ✅ (E-G#-B)
- ii: F# minor? But we have **F#7** — F#-A#-C#-E → tones: F#, A#, C#, E — all in E Lydian ✅
- iii: G# minor ✅ (G#-B-D#)
- IV: A# minor? Not used
- V: B major? We have **Bmaj7** → B-D#-F#-A# → all notes in E Lydian ✅
- vi: C# minor ✅ (C#-E-G#)
- vii°: D#dim — we have it in bass (G#m/D#, Bmaj7/D#), but not as a chord — fine.

So:

- E → I ✅
- C#m → vi ✅
- G#m → iii ✅
- F#7 → ii7 ✅ (diatonic in Lydian)
- Bmaj7 → Vmaj7 ✅ (in Lydian, the V chord is maj7 because the 7th is A# — the #4 of the mode)

✅ **All chords are diatonic to E Lydian.**

---

### Step 4: Confirm tonal center

- The progression begins and ends on **E**.
- E chords are most frequent.
- The cadence goes: ... Bmaj7/D# → E — this is a **Vmaj7 → I** cadence.

In major keys, we expect V7 → I, but here it’s **Vmaj7 → I**, which is a hallmark of **Lydian** — the #4 (A#) creates a bright, unresolved quality that leans into the maj7.

This chord is **not** borrowed — it’s diatonic.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key:** E  
> **Mode:** Lydian  
>  
> **Full designation: E Lydian**

This progression is firmly in **E Lydian**, using its diatonic chords — most notably **F#7** and **Bmaj7** — which contain the characteristic raised 4th (A#) of the Lydian mode.
