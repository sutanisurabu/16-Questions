### Reasoning

**Examining the Chords**

I've begun dissecting the chord progression, note by note, to get a handle on the relationships. I'm focusing on identifying the root notes and how they progress. The E major chords are obvious, but the secondary chords are providing some more challenge. The slash chords are, of course, the key to unlocking the mode.


**Deciphering Chord Function**

I'm now comparing the chord functions against a basic E major scale, seeking out non-diatonic chords. The F#7 immediately stands out as a secondary dominant, implying a potential modulation, or at least a borrowed chord. The Bmaj7 further solidified my suspicion that borrowed chords will be the key to this understanding.


**Identifying the Mode**

I've been meticulously examining the chord functions, re-evaluating the possibility of a non-diatonic key. Considering the Bmaj7, I'm now leaning towards E Lydian as the most likely mode. I'm focusing on the differences in diatonic chords to confirm my analysis. The F#7 continues to pose an interesting challenge.


**Refining Mode Confirmation**

I'm now cross-referencing my understanding of E Lydian with the actual chords from the progression, re-examining the functions of each chord to solidify my conclusion. Specifically, the presence of the Bmaj7 and the F#7 are still causing me to give this close consideration. I'm focusing on why the F#7 isn't an F#m to either confirm or deny the mode.


**Finalizing the Analysis**

I'm synthesizing all the pieces of the puzzle now, confirming the key and mode. The prevalence of Bmaj7 and F#7 confirms the E Lydian interpretation. Looking closely, I understand why the secondary dominant is used. I am prepared to state my final conclusion.




This chord progression centers heavily on the E chord, establishing it as the tonic.

Here is the functional analysis based on the tonic being E:

| Chord | Function in E | Diatonic to E Major? | Note Implication |
| :---: | :-----------: | :------------------: | :---------------: |
| **E** | I | Yes | |
| **C#m** | vi | Yes | |
| **G#m** | iii | Yes | |
| **F#7** | Secondary Dominant (V7/V or Chromatic ii) | No (expected F#m) | Primarily a tension chord |
| **Bmaj7** | V (Major Seventh) | **No** (Expected B7 or B) | **A#** (Raised 4th degree) |

## Determining the Mode

The presence of the **Bmaj7** chord is the crucial piece of evidence.

1.  **Tonic:** The progression begins and ends on E, and E is the most occurring chord. The overall "key" is **E**.
2.  **The Bmaj7 Chord:** In the key of E, the B chord acts as the dominant (V). Normally, in a major key, this would be a B major triad or a B dominant seventh (B7), which includes the note A natural (the 4th degree of the scale).
3.  **Bmaj7 Notes:** Bmaj7 contains the notes **B - D# - F# - A#**.
4.  **The Raised Fourth:** The note **A#** is the raised 4th degree of the E scale. This note is the definitive characteristic that differentiates the scale from standard Major (Ionian), which uses A natural.

The **E scale with a raised 4th degree (A#)** is the definition of the **Lydian Mode**.

## Conclusion

*   **Key/Tonic:** **E**
*   **Mode:** **Lydian** (E Lydian)
    *(The F#7 chord acts as a chromatic alteration, likely functioning as a dominant leading to B or as a momentary bluesy coloration, but it does not upset the Lydian sound established by the Bmaj7.)*
