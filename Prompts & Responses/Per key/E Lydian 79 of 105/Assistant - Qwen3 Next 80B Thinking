### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to list out all the chords without the bass notes for simplicity. The progression has chords like E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7. But there are also slashes indicating bass notes. For example, C#m/E means C# minor with E in the bass. Similarly, G#m/D# and F#7/E and Bmaj7/D#. I should focus on the chord types first and then see the bass notes, but maybe the bass notes are just part of the voicing. The key might be determined by the root notes of the chords.

So the chord roots are: E (x3), C#m (x2), G#m, F#7, Bmaj7. Let me write them out:

- E (which could be E major)
- C#m (C# minor)
- G#m (G# minor)
- F#7 (F# dominant seventh)
- Bmaj7 (B major seventh)

Now, looking at the key. Common keys have specific chord relationships. Let me think about the notes in each chord.

Starting with E major: notes E, G#, B.

C# minor: C#, E, G#.

G# minor: G#, B, D#.

F#7: F#, A#, C#, E. But F#7 is typically F#, A#, C#, E.

Bmaj7: B, D#, F#, A#.

Now, looking at all these notes together. Let me compile a list of all the notes from the chords.

E major has E, G#, B.

C#m has C#, E, G#.

G#m has G#, B, D#.

F#7 has F#, A#, C#, E.

Bmaj7 has B, D#, F#, A#.

So combining all unique notes: E, G#, B, C#, D#, F#, A#.

Let's see if these fit a particular scale. Let's list them in order:

C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, B.

Wait, that's C# D# E F# G# A# B. Hmm, that's the C# major scale? But C# major would be C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#. Wait, E# is F, but here we have E natural. That doesn't fit. Let's check again.

Wait, C# major scale: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#. So E# is F natural. But in our notes, we have E natural. So that's a problem. So maybe it's not C# major.

Wait, the notes we have: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, B.

That's actually C# natural minor? Let's see. C# natural minor is the same as A# major? Wait, no, natural minor is relative to the major scale. C# minor would be the relative minor of E major? Because E major is the key of 4 sharps (E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#). Wait, E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

Yes! E major has the notes E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

Now let's check the chords we have. Let's see what chords are diatonic to E major.

E major chord: E, G#, B.

C#m: in E major, C# is the 6th note. The chord on 6th is C# minor (C#, E, G#). Yes, that fits.

G#m: the 3rd degree of E major is G#, so G# minor? Wait, no. In E major, the chords are:

I: E major

II: F# minor

III: G# minor

IV: A major

V: B major

VI: C# minor

VII: D# diminished

So G#m would be the III chord. Yes, G# minor is diatonic to E major. Wait, but in E major, the III chord is G# minor? Let's check. The notes for G# minor: G#, B, D#. Yes, because in E major, the notes are E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So the chord built on G# would be G#, B, D# — that's G# minor.

F#7: F# is the second degree. In E major, the II chord is F# minor. But F#7 would have A# instead of A natural. But in E major, the notes don't include A#. Wait, E major has A natural. So F#7 is F#, A#, C#, E. But A# is not in E major; it's A natural. So F#7 is not diatonic to E major. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe the key isn't E major. Let's look at the F#7. If there's an A# in it, then the scale must have A#. So E major has A natural, so it doesn't have A#. So perhaps the key is different.

Maybe the key is B major? Let's see. B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Yes! B major has the notes B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Now, let's check the chords.

Bmaj7: B, D#, F#, A# — that's diatonic to B major.

F#7: F#, A#, C#, E. Wait, E is in B major? B major's notes are B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. Yes, E is there. So F#7 in B major would be the V chord? Because in B major, F# is the fifth degree. The V chord is F# major, which would be F#, A#, C#. But F#7 adds a seventh, which would be E. So F#7 is F#, A#, C#, E. Yes, that's the dominant 7th chord on the fifth, which is common. So F#7 is V7 in B major.

Now, what about G#m? In B major, G# is the third degree. The chord on III is G# minor? Let's check. The notes for G# minor: G#, B, D#. Yes, G# is the root. G#, B, D# — that fits into B major's notes. So G#m is the iii chord.

C#m: C# minor. In B major, C# is the second degree. The chord on II would be C# minor? Wait, the notes of II chord in B major: C#, E, G#. Yes, C# minor, which is diatonic. Because B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So the chords:

I: B major

II: C# minor

III: D# diminished? Wait no. Wait, the chords in B major:

I: B major (B, D#, F#)

II: C# minor (C#, E, G#)

III: D# minor? Wait, no. Wait, building triads on each degree.

In B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Triad on B: B, D#, F# — B major.

Triad on C#: C#, E, G# — yes, C# minor.

Triad on D#: D#, F#, A# — D# minor? Yes, D# minor.

Triad on E: E, G#, B — E major.

Triad on F#: F#, A#, C# — F# major.

But then F#7 would be F#, A#, C#, E. Because seventh chord would include the seventh of the scale. The seventh of F# in the key of B would be... Wait, the V7 chord in major key is built on V, which is F#, and the seventh is E, which is the 7th of the scale (since the key is B major, the 7th is A#, so E is actually the fourth degree? Wait no. Wait, scale degrees for B major:

1: B

2: C#

3: D#

4: E

5: F#

6: G#

7: A#

So the F# (5th) chord, the major triad is F#, A#, C#. To make it a 7th chord, the seventh would be E, which is the 4th scale degree. So the F#7 chord in B major would be F#, A#, C#, E. But wait, in the diatonic seventh chords of B major, the V7 chord is usually F#7 (with E), yes. Because the V7 is built on the fifth scale degree (F#), and the seventh is the fourth note of the scale? Wait, no. Let's see: the seventh chord on F# would be F#, A#, C#, E. Yes, that's called the V7 chord of B major. Wait, yes. Because the dominant seventh chord in a major key is built on V, with the minor seventh interval from the root. So F# to E is a minor seventh (since F# to E is 10 semitones, which is a minor seventh). So yes, F#7 is the V7 chord of B major.

Now, the chords we have in the progression:

E chord: in B major, E is the IV chord. E major (E, G#, B). Yes, diatonic.

C#m/E: C# minor chord with E in the bass. So the root of the chord is C#, but with E as bass note. The chord itself is C# minor, so diatonic.

G#m/D#: G# minor with D# bass. So G#m is the iii chord in B major.

F#7/E: F#7 with E in the bass. So F#7 is the V7 chord in B major.

Bmaj7: B major seventh. Which in B major, the tonic chord. Bmaj7 would be B, D#, F#, A#. Yes, diatonic.

So let's see: the chords are E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7. All these chords are diatonic to B major except...? Let's check:

Bmaj7: tonic chord. Yes.

E major: IV chord. In B major, IV is E major.

C#m: II chord, diatonic.

G#m: iii chord. Wait, in B major, III chord is D# minor. Wait, wait a second. Let's get the diatonic chords right for B major.

The diatonic triads in B major:

1. B major

2. C# minor

3. D# minor

4. E major

5. F# major

6. G# minor

7. A# diminished

Ah! Right. So VI chord is G# minor. Yes. So G#m is the VI chord. Because in B major, the sixth scale degree is G#. So the chord built on G# is G# minor.

Similarly, the IV chord is E major, which is correct.

So the progression has E (IV), C#m (II), G#m (VI), F#7 (V7), Bmaj7 (I). So this progression is in B major. But let's check the exact sequence given.

The user wrote: E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E

So looking at the chords when considering the root chord (ignoring bass): E, E, C#m, C#m, E, E, G#m, F#7, E, E, C#m, C#m, E, E, Bmaj7, E.

So the main chords in order: IV, IV, II, II, IV, IV, VI, V7, IV, IV, II, II, IV, IV, I, IV.

But in the progression, the bass notes are specified. For example, C#m/E means C#m chord with E in the bass. So it's not the root being E, but the chord is C#m and bass note E. So the chord itself is C#m, but with E as the lowest note. So the chord voicing has C#m with E below. Similarly, G#m/D# is G#m chord with D# bass. Etc.

But regardless of the bass notes, the chord types would be based on their quality and root. So C#m/E is a C# minor chord, the slash just indicates the bass note.

So if the chord types are E (maybe E major), C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7, all of which fit B major.

But wait, the F#7 is in the progression. F#7 includes A# and E. B major includes A# and E, so yes.

Bmaj7 includes A# (which is the 7th scale degree), which is in B major.

So the key would be B major. But let's check if there's something else.

Another possibility: maybe B mixolydian? Mixolydian has a flat seventh. But B mixolydian would have A natural. But here the F#7 has an A#? Wait, F#7 chord is F#, A#, C#, E. The A# comes into play. If it's B mixolydian, the scale would be B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A natural. So A natural, but here F#7 has A#? No. Wait, F#7 in B mixolydian would have A natural as the minor seventh? Because F# to E natural is minor seventh. Wait, if B mixolydian has A natural, then F#7 chord would have A natural. Wait, F#7 in B mixolydian: the A natural.

Wait, in B mixolydian, the notes are B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A. So yes, A natural.

But F#7 chord would be F#, A natural, C#, E. Which is actually a common dominant seventh chord. But in the given progression, the F#7 chord — does it have A# or A natural? Because the user didn't specify the exact notes, but F#7 typically implies F#, A#, C#, E. Wait, no. Wait, F#7 as a dominant seventh chord is built as root, major third, perfect fifth, minor seventh. The minor seventh of F# is E natural. Because F# to E is minor seventh interval (10 semitones). Wait, F# to E is a minor seventh. Because from F# up to E: F# to F is a half step, F to E is whole step? Wait, better to count semitones.

F# to G: 1, G to G#: 2, G# to A: 3, A to A#: 4, A# to B: 5, B to C: 6, C to C#: 7, C# to D: 8, D to D#: 9, D# to E: 10. Wait, actually, from F# to E is 10 semitones. Yes, which is a minor seventh. So F#7 chord usually includes E, not E#. So A# would be part of F#7? No. Wait, F# major triad is F#, A#, C#. Then a dominant seventh chord would be F#, A#, C#, E. Because the seventh is minor seventh from F#, which is E. So yes, A# is the major third of F#, so that's correct. So F#7 has E natural as the minor seventh. Which in the key of B major, E natural is part of the scale. Because B major's scale is B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So yes, E is in there. So F#7 in B major uses F#, A#, C#, E. Which are all in B major. Because A# is in B major. Wait, yes. B major has A# as the 7th scale degree. Because B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So yes, A# is there. So F#7 chord has A# (which is the major third of the F# chord) and E natural as the minor seventh.

So all the notes fit. So B major is the key.

But wait, another check: what about other possible keys. Let's see.

If it were G# minor, which is the relative minor of B major. Then the chords would still fit. Because G# minor is the same key signature as B major. But G# minor would have chords like G# minor, A# diminished, B major, etc. Let's see. But the progression ends on a Bmaj7. Typically, if it were in a minor key, it might end on the tonic minor. But here the progression ends with Bmaj7, so that's the tonic major. So B major seems more likely than G# minor. But in the context of minor key, B major could be the III chord. But ending on iii chord is less common. Usually, a piece ending on Bmaj7 would suggest B major is the tonic.

But let's check the progression in terms of mode. If the key is B major, then the mode is Ionian (major scale). But maybe it's Mixolydian or something else. But the presence of the F#7 chord (which is dominant 7th) suggests that it's in a major key where V7 is used. In Ionian mode, that's standard. For example, in B Ionian, V7 is F#7, which is correct.

Alternatively, could it be in E major? Let's check again. Earlier thought that F#7 has A# which isn't in E major. E major's notes are E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So A natural. The F#7 chord's third is A#, which isn't in E major. Because E major only has A natural. So F#7 chord with A# would not be diatonic to E major. Therefore, can't be E major.

Another possibility: A major? Let's see. A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. Then chords:

A major: A, C#, E.

Bm: B, D, F#.

C#m: C#, E, G#.

D major: D, F#, A.

E: E, G#, B.

F#m: F#, A, C#.

G#dim: G#, B, D.

But then in this scale, F#7 chord would be F#, A#, C#, E — but A# is not in A major. So again, F#7 would have A# which isn't in the scale.

So B major seems correct.

Now, checking all the chords:

E: IV in B major.

C#m: II.

G#m: VI.

F#7: V7.

Bmaj7: I.

Yes. So the key is B major, and the mode is Ionian.

Wait, but sometimes people confuse the modes by analyzing the scale. For example, if the progression centers around a different note but still uses the same scale. But here, the progression includes chords building towards Bmaj7, which is the tonic. Also, the progression ends on Bmaj7, which is a strong tonic chord. So B major is the key.

Another check: in G# minor, the scale would be G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. Which is the same notes as B major. So relative minor. But the chord progression ends on Bmaj7, which would be the III chord in G# minor, which is less common. Usually, a piece in minor key would end on G# minor. But here it ends on Bmaj7, so B major is the tonic.

Therefore, the key is B major, mode is Ionian.

But wait, let me check the bass notes. C#m/E: E is the bass note. So C# minor chord with E in bass. That's the same as E major's first inversion? No: E major is E, G#, B. C#m chord is C#, E, G#. So C#m/E is E, C#, G# — so the notes are E as bass, then C# and G#. So in terms of function, in B major's context, E is the IV note, but the C#m chord here is II chord. The bass note E makes it sort of a IV chord maybe? Wait, but the chord type is C# minor. So it's still the II chord. The bass is just a different note.

Similarly, G#m/D#: G#m chord (G#, B, D#) with D# in bass. So notes D#, G#, B. In terms of intervals from D# bass, D# to G# is perfect fourth, D# to B is minor sixth, but chord is G# minor in first inversion? Or it's a second inversion of G#m: the root is G#, but bass is D#, which is the fifth. So D# is fifth of G# minor chord. So that's second inversion.

F#7/E: E is bass note. F#7 chord is F#, A#, C#, E. If bass is E, then it's E, F#, A#, C#. So inversion: root F#, then A#, C#, E. So the bass is E, which is the minor seventh. So it's a third inversion of F#7 chord. But regardless of the inversion, the chord is F#7.

Bmaj7/D#: Bmaj7 chord with D# bass. Bmaj7 is B, D#, F#, A#. So D# is the third of the chord. So that's a first inversion.

But the chord types remain. So the underlying tonality is B major.

Another thing: the presence of F#7 suggests a dominant function. In B major, the dominant chord is F# major, and when we add the seventh (E), it becomes F#7, which is the dominant seventh chord leading to tonic B. So yes, that fits perfectly. It's a V7-I resolution. Although in the progression given, after F#7 comes E, not B. Wait, no. The progression has F#7 followed by E, then E, then C#m, etc. Then later Bmaj7. Let's see the exact sequence again:

E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E

So after F#7/E comes E, then E, then E, etc., then Bmaj7/D# E. So the F#7 leads to E (IV) chord. Which is not a typical dominant resolution. Normally, dominant resolves to tonic. But here, F#7 goes to E, which is the IV. Hmm. So perhaps it's more of a deceptive cadence? But usually, deceptive cadence is V to vi. But here V7 to IV.

But in the context of the key, B major, V7 (F#7) to IV (E major) is a possible progression. For example, V7 to IV is common in rock or blues. Not the usual classical cadence, but still acceptable. So the overall key is still B major.

Alternatively, could it be in G# minor? Let's see. G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. Diatonic chords:

i: G#m

ii°: A#dim

III: B major

iv: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major

VII: F# major

So if the key is G# minor, then the chords:

E major is VI, C#m is iv, G#m is i, F#maj7 would be VII, etc. But in this case, the progression has F#7. In G# minor, F# is the VII chord. F# major chord. F#7 would be F#, A#, C#, E. In the G# natural minor scale, we have A natural? No. Wait, G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So no A#? Wait, G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. The scale degrees:

1: G#

2: A#

3: B

4: C#

5: D#

6: E

7: F#

So yes, F# is 7th, and the VII chord is F# major. But if it's F#7, which has A# (since the major triad of F# is F#, A#, C#), and then the seventh is E natural (for dominant seventh). But in the natural minor scale, the VII chord is major (F#maj), and if we add a seventh, it would normally be F#7, but in harmonic minor? Not sure.

But the main issue here is the chord progressions. If the key is G# minor, then the chords would be:

E is VI, C#m is iv, G#m is i, F#7 would be VII7. But in natural minor, the VII chord is major and sometimes dominant seventh. But the progression ends on Bmaj7? B major would be the III chord. So in G# minor key, ending on III chord is not typical. Usually, minor tunes end on tonic minor. So unless it's an altered cadence or something.

But more importantly, Bmaj7 would be the III chord, which is not the tonic. So unless the song is centered around B major. So probably B major.

Alternatively, maybe the key is B major, and the progression is using the standard chords. Even though F#7 resolves to E, it's still in B major.

Another way: the notes in all chords. Let's list all notes including the bass.

E: notes E, G#, B.

C#m/E: bass E, with chord C#m = C#, E, G#. So notes are E, C#, G#.

G#m/D#: D#, G#, B.

F#7/E: E, F#, A#, C#.

Bmaj7/D#: D#, B, F#, A#.

E: E, G#, B.

So let's list all the notes present across the progression:

From E: E, G#, B.

C#m/E: C#, E, G#.

G#m/D#: D#, G#, B.

F#7/E: E, F#, A#, C#.

Bmaj7/D#: D#, B, F#, A#.

So all unique notes: E, G#, B, C#, D#, F#, A#.

Which exactly fits the B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Yes. So all the notes belong to B major.

Therefore, the key is B major, and the mode is Ionian.

But wait, another possibility: if there's a different key. Let's see. For example, maybe B Mixolydian? But B Mixolydian has A natural instead of A#. So if there were A natural, but in our chord F#7, we have A#. Because F#7 chord has A# (major third), so that's part of the chord. If the scale had A natural, then the third of F# chord would be A natural instead of A#? No. Wait, F# chord as major chord needs A#. So if the scale has A natural, then F# chord would be F# major with A natural? Which is not possible; F# major requires A#.

Wait, F# major is F#, A#, C#. If a scale has A natural, then building a major chord on F# in that scale wouldn't be possible. So F# major chord requires A#; thus, any scale that's in the context of F#7 chord must have A# and E.

And B major has A# and E.

So yes, B major is confirmed.

Another check: in G# minor (natural minor), scale is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So A# is present, but also F# natural. The F#7 chord would require A# and E. In G# minor natural minor, F# is natural, yes. So F#7 = F#, A#, C#, E. Wait, the F# major chord includes A#, but the scale for G# minor natural has F# natural. But the A# is present. So the scale G# natural minor has A#. So yes, A# is part of G# minor scale. Wait, G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So yes, A# is the second scale degree.

Wait, so both B major and G# minor have the same notes. So they are relative major/minor. So the choice between them depends on the tonic. If the piece resolves to B major chord, it's B major. If it resolves to G# minor, then it's G# minor.

Looking at the chord progression: it ends with Bmaj7 and then E. Wait, after Bmaj7/D# comes E. So the last chord is E. But Bmaj7 is before that. So the progression ends on E. Hmm. If it ends with E, but Bmaj7 precedes it. So the final chord is E, which is IV chord of B major.

But typically, pieces end on the tonic. However, in some genres, they do end on other chords. But the question is about determining the key and mode. So even if the progression ends on IV, if the tonal center is B major, then it's still B major.

But how to determine the tonal center. The Bmaj7 chord is used. In fact, in the progression, there's a Bmaj7 chord, which would be the tonic if it's B major. It's the only chord named after B.

But the progression has multiple occurrences of E. Let's see: there are a lot of E chords. But the chords named Bmaj7 would indicate B as a strong candidate.

Another way: in the key of B major, the V chord is F# major. The F#7 is the dominant seventh chord, which leads to the tonic. But in the progression, F#7 goes to E. Which is subdominant. So a plagal cadence or deceptive cadence. But it's still within the B major key.

Alternatively, if the key were E major, but F#7 has A#, which isn't in E major. E major has A natural. So that's out.

So yeah, B major seems correct.

Now, the mode. If it's B major, then the mode is Ionian. Since Ionian is just the major scale.

But let me see if there's a mode that could fit. For example, if the progression starts on B and uses B as a tonal center. But Bmaj7 chord is present, and it's the only B chord. So most likely tonic.

So key is B major, mode is Ionian.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes people confuse with the key being the relative minor. But since the chord progression includes B as a major chord and the tonal center seems to be B. The other chords all fit in the B major scale.

Yes, so I think the key is B major, mode is Ionian.

But wait, the problem says "Determine key and mode". So key is the tonic note and major/minor or mode name.

So in this case, key of B major, mode Ionian. Or key of B major (since Ionian is the mode for major scale).

Alternatively, sometimes people just say key of B major, as opposed to modal key. But technically, the scale is B Ionian.

But in common terminology, we'd say the key is B major. And mode is Ionian.

But maybe the user expects "B major" for the key and "Ionian" for mode.

But let me check again for any contradictions.

C#m/E: C# minor with E bass. Which in B major, E is the fourth. So the chord is II chord with fourth in the bass.

G#m/D#: VI chord in B major (since G# is sixth scale degree), with fifth in bass.

F#7 is V7 in B major.

Yes. All fits.

So conclusion: key is B major, mode is Ionian.

Wait, but another check: in the chord G#m/D#, the D# is the bass. In B major, G#m chord has roots G#, B, D#. So G#m in first inversion would have B as bass, second inversion has D# as bass. So yes. So the G#m with D# bass is second inversion.

All these chords fit in B major.

I think that's solid. So yes, key of B major, mode Ionian.

The chord progression provided is:  
**E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E**

---

### **Step 1: Analyze the Chord Qualities and Notes**
Let's extract the **core chord types** (ignoring bass notes for now) and list all unique notes used:

- **E** (E major): E, G#, B  
- **C#m** (C# minor): C#, E, G#  
- **G#m** (G# minor): G#, B, D#  
- **F#7** (F# dominant 7th): F#, A#, C#, E  
- **Bmaj7** (B major 7th): B, D#, F#, A#  

Now, compiling all unique notes:  
**E, G#, B, C#, D#, F#, A#**

This matches the **B major scale**:  
**B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#**

All notes in the progression are **diatonic to B major**. This confirms that the key is **B major**.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Chord Function in Context**
Let’s map each chord to its function within the **B major scale**:

| Chord       | Root | Function in B Major | Notes             |
|-------------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| E           | E    | IV (Subdominant)    | E, G#, B          |
| C#m         | C#   | ii (Supertonic)     | C#, E, G#         |
| G#m         | G#   | vi (Submediant)     | G#, B, D#         |
| F#7         | F#   | V7 (Dominant 7th)   | F#, A#, C#, E     |
| Bmaj7       | B    | I (Tonic)           | B, D#, F#, A#     |

- The progression includes a **dominant 7th chord (F#7)**, which resolves strongly to the **tonic (Bmaj7)** — a hallmark of **B major**.
- The final chord in the progression is **E**, which is the **IV chord**, but the **presence of Bmaj7** (the tonic chord) and its placement near the end of the progression strongly signal **B major** as the tonal center.
- While the piece ends on **E (IV)**, this is still within the key of B major (common in rock/pop for stylistic reasons), and the repeated use of **Bmaj7** confirms **B as the tonic**.

### **Step 3: Determine the Mode**
The scale used throughout the progression is the **B major scale**, which is also known as the **Ionian mode**. This is the standard major scale mode.

- **Ionian mode = Major key = B major**
- The progression does not emphasize any other mode (e.g., Dorian, Mixolydian), as all chords and notes are strictly diatonic to the **B major/Ionian scale**.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **B major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian**

This is a **major key** progression with the **tonic** clearly centered on **B**, confirmed by the presence of **Bmaj7** (I chord), consistent diatonic harmonies, and the dominant 7th (F#7) resolving toward the tonic. The minor mode (relative minor G# minor) is unlikely because the progression does not center on **G#m** or resolve to it, and the tonic chord is a **B major** chord.
