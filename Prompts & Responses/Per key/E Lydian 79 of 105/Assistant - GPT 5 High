### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I have this sequence of chord symbols: "E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E." It seems like the piece could be in E major. I want to look closer at the chords. The E major triad and C#m/E suggest a tonic prolongation with a 6/1 pedal in the bass. The G#m/D# points to the iii chord in first inversion, and F#7/E indicates a V/V7 chord, which fits with E major.**Examining chord functions**

The F#7/E chord suggests it functions as a V/V with the 7th in the bass, possibly acting as a predominant or secondary dominant leading to B. Then there's E again, followed by Bmaj7/D#. I think of this as a Vmaj7 in first inversion in the key of E major, where Bmaj7 incorporates A#, which isn't diatonic to E major (which has A natural). So, Bmaj7 adds an interesting Lydian implication or suggests borrowing from E Lydian.**Analyzing chord harmonization**

In diatonic major scale harmonization, the V7 chord is B D# F# A, which fits nicely into E major. However, Bmaj7 introduces A#, the major 7 of B, which has a Lydian flavor since A# is the raised 4th scale degree. It’s curious that the chord is labeled Bmaj7/D#. Perhaps it should be B7/D# instead. Overall, the progression revolves around E as tonic, and this suggests that the key is indeed E major. The mode? I'm leaning towards Ionian, but the Bmaj7 hints at a #4, possibly just a color tone.**Examining F#7 and A#**

Let’s look at the F#7 chord: F# A# C# E. A# appears here and also in Bmaj7, but it’s not part of E major, which has A natural. This A# acts as the raised 4th scale degree, typical of the E Lydian mode. Looking at other notes, the G#m (G# B D#) and C#m (C# E G#) triads are diatonic to E major. F#7 is a secondary dominant (V/V), reinforcing that A# serves as a leading tone to B.**Determining key and mode**

In E Ionian, the V7 would typically be B7, containing A natural. However, since the specified chord is Bmaj7 with A#, it’s diatonic to Lydian and not Ionian. Likewise, F#7 fits within Lydian. The G#m and C#m triads are diatonic to both scales, with E being the tonic. This leads me to conclude that the harmonic collection is aligned with E Lydian. So, if asked about the key and mode, I'd say E Lydian, with E as the tonal center, supported by the presence of A# in relevant chords.

E Lydian (tonic = E).

Why: The center is clearly E (lots of E and C#m/E over E pedal). The presence of F#7 and Bmaj7 introduces A# (raised 4), which is diatonic to E Lydian but not to E Ionian. Hence E as key center, Lydian mode.
