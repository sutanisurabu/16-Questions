**Exploring E Lydian chords**

I'm looking at how A# serves as the leading tone to B, but E major uses A natural. I wonder if A# could just be a chromatic color from the E Lydian scale. In E Lydian, the scale has A#, and the V chord is B major, making Bmaj7 diatonic. It looks like F#7 with A# is also diatonic to E Lydian. F# in E Lydian is F# minor too. I'm building diatonic seventh chords in E Lydian now!**Analyzing E Lydian chords**

I’m thinking about the Lydian mode and how it has a major second, which makes the II chord a major triad with a minor seventh—nice! When I check III7 on G#, I see G#m7 (not major 7!). C#m7 on VI fits in, along with Bmaj7 as the V chord. All the chords including A# in F#7 and Bmaj7 are diatonic in E Lydian, with no A major chords. The progression focuses on E and its related chords, showing a strong Lydian key center. The bass notes are often E or D#.**Confirming tonal center**

I see consistency in my analysis, and it suggests that E major is the tonal center with E Lydian as the mode. I briefly consider whether it could also be B major, which has five sharps. In B major, E is the IV chord, and C#m/E would likely be ii with E in the bass. However, the progression keeps returning to E, reinforcing E as the tonal center. The A# presence indicates Lydian rather than Ionian.**Determining key and mode**

I’m concluding that the key center is E and that the mode is E Lydian. While it could also be E major with borrowed chords, the prevalence of Lydian characteristics suggests this interpretation. The question clearly seeks “E Lydian” as the answer. I can justify my choice by noting that all chords—like E, C#m/E, G#m/D#, F#7/E, and Bmaj7/D#—are diatonic to E Lydian. The presence of A# emphasizes the Lydian flavor, so succinctly, I'll stick with E Lydian.**Including Roman numerals**

I'm thinking of how to present the chords with Roman numerals. For E, it’s I; for C#m/E, I can call it vi6 or vi over I pedal; G#m/D# would be iii6; F#7/E can be noted as II7 4-2 (or V/V over 7th); and Bmaj7/D# is Vmaj7/3. Returning to E, that’s I again. I want to make sure my answer is concise and clear! Okay, I’ve got it laid out.

E Lydian.

Tonal center is E, and the presence of A# (in F#7 and Bmaj7) points to a raised 4th degree, which is characteristic of Lydian. Roman numerals in E Lydian:
- E: I
- C#m/E: vi6
- G#m/D#: iii6
- F#7/E: II7 (4-2)
- Bmaj7/D#: Vmaj7/3
- E: I
