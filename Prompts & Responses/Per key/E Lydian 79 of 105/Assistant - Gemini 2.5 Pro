### Reasoning

**Deciphering Chord Sequence**

I've broken down the chord sequence, identifying each chord and its function. Specifically, I'm examining the relationships between the chords to pinpoint potential key signatures and modal variations. I'm focusing on the movement between the chords, looking for tonal centers and any secondary dominant chords.


**Pinpointing Harmonic Context**

I'm now examining the chord relationships within the suspected E major framework. I'm noting that C#m functions as the vi chord, and G#m often appears in minor keys as the iii chord. The F#7 chord is definitely a dominant chord that resolves to E. Finally, the Bmaj7 chord could be a passing chord. The D# bass notes in some chords don't seem to contradict the major key of E.


**Refining Key Signature**

I'm checking that diatonic Bmaj7 chord, as the 7th from E major is D#, and the notes are B-D#-F#-A#. But I'm now realizing this has to be the leading tone which is the 7th. It's close, but there are some non-diatonic chords. It's likely E major, but perhaps with some modal mixture or a secondary dominant.


**Synthesizing Observations**

I'm now integrating the non-diatonic elements. The F#7 chord adds color, with its A# suggesting a borrowing from another key or a secondary dominant function to the E major. I'm noting that the bass notes don't contradict the E major key. The Bmaj7, with A#, could be a temporary modulation, a chromatic alteration leading back to the E major.


**Reflecting on Diatonic Elements**

I'm solidifying my understanding of the diatonic chords in E major and their roles. The vi and iii chords, C#m and G#m, fit well within this key. However, the Bmaj7 and F#7 chords introduce chromatic elements, hinting at altered dominants and potential modal mixture. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic notes in these chords.


**Finalizing Analysis**

I've determined the key is E major. The constant presence of the E chord and its supporting role in the progression firmly establishes it as the tonal center. The modal characteristics of major are present. The F#7 and Bmaj7 chords serve as non-diatonic elements, enriching the harmonic palette.


**Assessing Harmonic Function**

I'm now carefully examining the function of the F#7 and Bmaj7 chords within the context of the E major key. The F#7 chord's role as a secondary dominant, resolving to Bmaj7, is clear. The Bmaj7 provides an interesting chord substitution and adds color. I'm focusing on their relationship to the E major.


**Assessing Chord Substitutions**

I'm now zeroing in on the function of those non-diatonic chords. I can see the substitution of a Bmaj7 adding a distinct color, brightening the V chord. I note that the F#7 chord resolves to Bmaj7, so this indicates a secondary dominant. I'm focusing on the effect of these substitutions.




Based on the analysis of the chord progression, the key is **E Major**.

Here is a breakdown of why:

1.  **Tonal Center (Tonic):** The progression begins on, frequently returns to, and ends on an **E Major** chord. This strongly establishes E as the "home" chord or tonic.

2.  **Diatonic Chords:** Most of the chords fit naturally within the key of E Major:
    *   **E** is the **I** chord.
    *   **C#m** is the **vi** chord.
    *   **G#m** is the **iii** chord.

3.  **The V-I Cadence:** The strongest indicator of a key is the V-I (dominant to tonic) relationship. In this progression, we see **Bmaj7/D#** resolving to **E**.
    *   **B** is the V chord in the key of E.
    *   The bass movement from **D#** (the leading tone) up to **E** (the tonic) creates a powerful and definitive resolution, confirming E as the key center.
    *   (Using Bmaj7 instead of a standard B or B7 is a common stylistic choice in genres like R&B, gospel, and jazz, adding a richer color to the V chord without changing its function.)

4.  **Secondary Dominant:** The **F#7** chord functions as a secondary dominant. It's the V7 of B (the V chord). The sequence **F#7 -> Bmaj7 -> E** is a classic **V7/V -> V -> I** progression, which is a textbook way to strengthen the pull towards the tonic key.
