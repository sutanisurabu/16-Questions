### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I have this sequence of chord symbols: "E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E." It seems like the piece could be in E major. I want to look closer at the chords. The E major triad and C#m/E suggest a tonic prolongation with a 6/1 pedal in the bass. The G#m/D# points to the iii chord in first inversion, and F#7/E indicates a V/V7 chord, which fits with E major.**Examining chord functions**

The F#7/E chord suggests it functions as a V/V with the 7th in the bass, possibly acting as a predominant or secondary dominant leading to B. Then there's E again, followed by Bmaj7/D#. I think of this as a Vmaj7 in first inversion in the key of E major, where Bmaj7 incorporates A#, which isn't diatonic to E major (which has A natural). So, Bmaj7 adds an interesting Lydian implication or suggests borrowing from E Lydian.**Analyzing chord harmonization**

In diatonic major scale harmonization, the V7 chord is B D# F# A, which fits nicely into E major. However, Bmaj7 introduces A#, the major 7 of B, which has a Lydian flavor since A# is the raised 4th scale degree. It’s curious that the chord is labeled Bmaj7/D#. Perhaps it should be B7/D# instead. Overall, the progression revolves around E as tonic, and this suggests that the key is indeed E major. The mode? I'm leaning towards Ionian, but the Bmaj7 hints at a #4, possibly just a color tone.**Examining F#7 and A#**

Let’s look at the F#7 chord: F# A# C# E. A# appears here and also in Bmaj7, but it’s not part of E major, which has A natural. This A# acts as the raised 4th scale degree, typical of the E Lydian mode. Looking at other notes, the G#m (G# B D#) and C#m (C# E G#) triads are diatonic to E major. F#7 is a secondary dominant (V/V), reinforcing that A# serves as a leading tone to B.**Determining key and mode**

In E Ionian, the V7 would typically be B7, containing A natural. However, since the specified chord is Bmaj7 with A#, it’s diatonic to Lydian and not Ionian. Likewise, F#7 fits within Lydian. The G#m and C#m triads are diatonic to both scales, with E being the tonic. This leads me to conclude that the harmonic collection is aligned with E Lydian. So, if asked about the key and mode, I'd say E Lydian, with E as the tonal center, supported by the presence of A# in relevant chords.

E Lydian (tonic = E).

Why: The center is clearly E (lots of E and C#m/E over E pedal). The presence of F#7 and Bmaj7 introduces A# (raised 4), which is diatonic to E Lydian but not to E Ionian. Hence E as key center, Lydian mode.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord notation**

I'm trying to understand the chord notation F#7/E, which means F#7 with E in the bass. I realize that E is included as the dominant 7th. So, it's more like a polychord, or E13b9. It functions as V/V with an E pedal bass common in E major progressions. Bmaj7/D# shows a Vmaj7 in first inversion. But Bmaj7 isn't strongly diatonic in E major, as the diatonic seventh on V is actually B7, which includes a minor seventh.**Exploring Bmaj7 and E major**

I’m looking at Bmaj7, which includes A#, a raised 7th of B that’s not from E major. It seems that A# is borrowed from the Lydian mode. The diatonic seventh chord on scale degree 5 should actually be a dominant seventh, not major. In E major, A is natural, making A# a leading tone in B major. So Bmaj7 might suggest tonicizing B major or Lydian. Bmaj7 over D# fits well in E Lydian, which has A# instead of A natural.**Clarifying Bmaj7 and E Lydian**

I’ve confirmed that Bmaj7 is diatonic in the E Lydian mode, which is exciting! Then there's F#7/E, which contains A# as well, functioning as the Lydian #4 relative to E. Checking other chords, I see E major includes E, G#, and B, while C#m/E uses E in the bass. G#m/D# is also diatonic. The main difference between E Ionian and E Lydian is A natural versus A#. In the progression of E, C#m, G#m, and Bmaj7, there’s no indication of A natural.**Determining key and mode**

The presence of A# in Bmaj7 and F#7, along with the absence of A natural, strongly suggests that the piece is in E Lydian or E major with a borrowed #4. The stable E bass in chords like C#m/E indicates a pedal point on E, establishing the modal center. The Bmaj7/D# acts as the V of E Lydian. Overall, I'd conclude the key center is E, with the mode being Lydian. If asked, I’d summarize that E Lydian is the answer.**Summarizing key center and mode**

I’ve concluded the key center is E and the mode is Lydian, as indicated by the absence of A natural. The A# serves as the hallmark #4 of Lydian. E Lydian is the fourth mode of the B major scale, which contains the notes: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, and D#. Functional analysis reinforces this, with E being tonic and Bmaj7 providing a dominant seventh. Overall, the focus on E and the presence of A# solidify this conclusion.

E Lydian.

- Center: E is reinforced by the pedal E bass and frequent E triad.
- Lydian color: F#7 (with A#) and Bmaj7 (with A#) introduce the #4 (A#) over E, and there’s no A natural.
- Parent scale: B major (E F# G# A# B C# D#).

### Reasoning

**Exploring E Lydian chords**

I'm looking at how A# serves as the leading tone to B, but E major uses A natural. I wonder if A# could just be a chromatic color from the E Lydian scale. In E Lydian, the scale has A#, and the V chord is B major, making Bmaj7 diatonic. It looks like F#7 with A# is also diatonic to E Lydian. F# in E Lydian is F# minor too. I'm building diatonic seventh chords in E Lydian now!**Analyzing E Lydian chords**

I’m thinking about the Lydian mode and how it has a major second, which makes the II chord a major triad with a minor seventh—nice! When I check III7 on G#, I see G#m7 (not major 7!). C#m7 on VI fits in, along with Bmaj7 as the V chord. All the chords including A# in F#7 and Bmaj7 are diatonic in E Lydian, with no A major chords. The progression focuses on E and its related chords, showing a strong Lydian key center. The bass notes are often E or D#.**Confirming tonal center**

I see consistency in my analysis, and it suggests that E major is the tonal center with E Lydian as the mode. I briefly consider whether it could also be B major, which has five sharps. In B major, E is the IV chord, and C#m/E would likely be ii with E in the bass. However, the progression keeps returning to E, reinforcing E as the tonal center. The A# presence indicates Lydian rather than Ionian.**Determining key and mode**

I’m concluding that the key center is E and that the mode is E Lydian. While it could also be E major with borrowed chords, the prevalence of Lydian characteristics suggests this interpretation. The question clearly seeks “E Lydian” as the answer. I can justify my choice by noting that all chords—like E, C#m/E, G#m/D#, F#7/E, and Bmaj7/D#—are diatonic to E Lydian. The presence of A# emphasizes the Lydian flavor, so succinctly, I'll stick with E Lydian.**Including Roman numerals**

I'm thinking of how to present the chords with Roman numerals. For E, it’s I; for C#m/E, I can call it vi6 or vi over I pedal; G#m/D# would be iii6; F#7/E can be noted as II7 4-2 (or V/V over 7th); and Bmaj7/D# is Vmaj7/3. Returning to E, that’s I again. I want to make sure my answer is concise and clear! Okay, I’ve got it laid out.

E Lydian.

Tonal center is E, and the presence of A# (in F#7 and Bmaj7) points to a raised 4th degree, which is characteristic of Lydian. Roman numerals in E Lydian:
- E: I
- C#m/E: vi6
- G#m/D#: iii6
- F#7/E: II7 (4-2)
- Bmaj7/D#: Vmaj7/3
- E: I

### Key and Mode Analysis

Based on the given chord progression (E - E - C#m/E - C#m/E - E - E - G#m/D# - F#7/E - E - E - C#m/E - C#m/E - E - E - Bmaj7/D# - E), here's a breakdown of the key and mode. This appears to be a repetitive, pedal-based progression (heavily centered on E in the bass), common in rock/pop songs for creating tension and resolution.

#### Primary Key: **E Major**
- **Why E Major?**
  - The progression strongly revolves around **E major** as the tonic (I chord). It starts and ends on E, and most chords resolve back to it, creating a clear sense of "home."
  - Key diatonic chords present:
    - E: I (tonic)
    - C#m: vi (submediant, functioning as a relative minor)
    - G#m: iii (mediant)
    - Bmaj7: Vmaj7 (approaching dominant, with a major 7th extension for color)
  - The slash chords (e.g., C#m/E, G#m/D#, F#7/E, Bmaj7/D#) use bass pedals on E (the root) or D# (the leading tone, #7 in E major), which reinforces E as the tonal center without shifting keys. This is a classic pedal point technique for emphasis and drive.
  - Non-diatonic elements:
    - F#7: This is a secondary dominant (V7/V), pulling toward B (the V chord) before resolving back to E. It's common in E major for added tension.
    - Bmaj7: The major 7th (A#) introduces a slight chromaticism (borrowed from E Lydian or harmonic minor contexts), but it still functions as the dominant (V) rather than a full key change. In rock/jazz, Vmaj7 is often used instead of V7 for a smoother, less "resolved" sound.
  - No strong evidence of modulation—everything orbits E major. The D# bass notes (in G#m/D# and Bmaj7/D#) act as leading tones, heightening expectation before resolving to E.

- **Chord Functions in E Major (Simplified Roman Numeral Analysis)**:
  - E: I
  - E: I
  - C#m/E: vi⁶ (vi in first inversion, or vi over pedal I)
  - C#m/E: vi⁶
  - E: I
  - E: I
  - G#m/D#: iii⁷ (iii over leading-tone bass)
  - F#7/E: V7/V over I (secondary dominant of V, pedaled)
  - E: I
  - (Repetition follows the same pattern)
  - Bmaj7/D#: Vmaj7⁷ (Vmaj7 over leading-tone bass)
  - E: I

  The progression builds tension via the vi (C#m) and secondary dominants, then releases on I (E). It's repetitive and hypnotic, likely from a verse or intro section.

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major Mode)**
- **Why Ionian?**
  - E major is the Ionian mode (the standard "major" scale: E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D#-E).
  - No flattened 3rd, 6th, or 7th to suggest minor modes (e.g., Aeolian or Dorian).
  - No raised 4th (F## or G natural) to indicate Lydian.
  - The major tonic (E) and dominant (B major family) chords, plus the overall bright, resolved feel, align perfectly with Ionian.
  - Subtle extensions (like the maj7 in Bmaj7) add a modal flavor (hinting at Lydian, which shares chords with Ionian but raises the 4th), but the core structure doesn't alter the mode—it's still Ionian with color.

#### Additional Notes
- **Scale Implied**: E Ionian (E major scale). For soloing/improvisation over this, stick to E major, but watch for the F#7 (briefly implying B major/G# minor) and Bmaj7 (avoiding A natural in favor of A# for smoothness).
- **Song Context?** This progression vaguely resembles elements from classic rock tracks like the Eagles' "Hotel California" (in B minor, but with similar pedal feels) or Boston's "More Than a Feeling" (in D major, with vi-I moves), but it's not an exact match. If this is from a specific song, more context could refine the analysis.
- **Potential Variations**: If played with certain voicings (e.g., emphasizing A# in Bmaj7), it could lean toward E Lydian (#4: A# instead of A), but the chords don't demand it—E major/Ionian is the safest and most straightforward fit.

If you provide more context (e.g., melody, full song, or genre), I can refine this further!

The given chord progression (E – E – C#m/E – C#m/E – E – E – G#m/D# – F#7/E – E – E – C#m/E – C#m/E – E – E – Bmaj7/D# – E) is in the **key of E Lydian**. 

This fits the Lydian mode due to the consistent use of A# (#4 scale degree) in chords like F#7 and Bmaj7, alongside diatonic Lydian harmony on the other chords (e.g., E as I, C#m as vi, G#m as iii). The progression resolves to E and shows no evidence of the natural 4th (A) or other modal alterations.

### Reasoning

**Deciphering Chord Sequence**

I've broken down the chord sequence, identifying each chord and its function. Specifically, I'm examining the relationships between the chords to pinpoint potential key signatures and modal variations. I'm focusing on the movement between the chords, looking for tonal centers and any secondary dominant chords.


**Pinpointing Harmonic Context**

I'm now examining the chord relationships within the suspected E major framework. I'm noting that C#m functions as the vi chord, and G#m often appears in minor keys as the iii chord. The F#7 chord is definitely a dominant chord that resolves to E. Finally, the Bmaj7 chord could be a passing chord. The D# bass notes in some chords don't seem to contradict the major key of E.


**Refining Key Signature**

I'm checking that diatonic Bmaj7 chord, as the 7th from E major is D#, and the notes are B-D#-F#-A#. But I'm now realizing this has to be the leading tone which is the 7th. It's close, but there are some non-diatonic chords. It's likely E major, but perhaps with some modal mixture or a secondary dominant.


**Synthesizing Observations**

I'm now integrating the non-diatonic elements. The F#7 chord adds color, with its A# suggesting a borrowing from another key or a secondary dominant function to the E major. I'm noting that the bass notes don't contradict the E major key. The Bmaj7, with A#, could be a temporary modulation, a chromatic alteration leading back to the E major.


**Reflecting on Diatonic Elements**

I'm solidifying my understanding of the diatonic chords in E major and their roles. The vi and iii chords, C#m and G#m, fit well within this key. However, the Bmaj7 and F#7 chords introduce chromatic elements, hinting at altered dominants and potential modal mixture. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic notes in these chords.


**Finalizing Analysis**

I've determined the key is E major. The constant presence of the E chord and its supporting role in the progression firmly establishes it as the tonal center. The modal characteristics of major are present. The F#7 and Bmaj7 chords serve as non-diatonic elements, enriching the harmonic palette.


**Assessing Harmonic Function**

I'm now carefully examining the function of the F#7 and Bmaj7 chords within the context of the E major key. The F#7 chord's role as a secondary dominant, resolving to Bmaj7, is clear. The Bmaj7 provides an interesting chord substitution and adds color. I'm focusing on their relationship to the E major.


**Assessing Chord Substitutions**

I'm now zeroing in on the function of those non-diatonic chords. I can see the substitution of a Bmaj7 adding a distinct color, brightening the V chord. I note that the F#7 chord resolves to Bmaj7, so this indicates a secondary dominant. I'm focusing on the effect of these substitutions.




Based on the analysis of the chord progression, the key is **E Major**.

Here is a breakdown of why:

1.  **Tonal Center (Tonic):** The progression begins on, frequently returns to, and ends on an **E Major** chord. This strongly establishes E as the "home" chord or tonic.

2.  **Diatonic Chords:** Most of the chords fit naturally within the key of E Major:
    *   **E** is the **I** chord.
    *   **C#m** is the **vi** chord.
    *   **G#m** is the **iii** chord.

3.  **The V-I Cadence:** The strongest indicator of a key is the V-I (dominant to tonic) relationship. In this progression, we see **Bmaj7/D#** resolving to **E**.
    *   **B** is the V chord in the key of E.
    *   The bass movement from **D#** (the leading tone) up to **E** (the tonic) creates a powerful and definitive resolution, confirming E as the key center.
    *   (Using Bmaj7 instead of a standard B or B7 is a common stylistic choice in genres like R&B, gospel, and jazz, adding a richer color to the V chord without changing its function.)

4.  **Secondary Dominant:** The **F#7** chord functions as a secondary dominant. It's the V7 of B (the V chord). The sequence **F#7 -> Bmaj7 -> E** is a classic **V7/V -> V -> I** progression, which is a textbook way to strengthen the pull towards the tonic key.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord sequence: E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E Bmaj7/D# E. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to understand the chords. Some have slashes, like C#m/E, which means C# minor with E as the bass note. Similarly, G#m/D# is G# minor over D#, and F#7/E has E as the bass. Bmaj7/D# is B major 7th with D# in the bass. So the actual chords might be different from what they appear at first glance because of the bass notes.

Let me list out the root notes ignoring the slashes for a moment: E, E, C#m, C#m, E, E, G#m, F#7, E, E, Bmaj7, E. But the bass notes complicate things. For example, C#m/E is a C# minor chord but E is in the bass, so the chord might function as an E major or something else? Wait, C#m has notes C#, E, G#. Over E bass, it's E, G#, C#—which is actually E major (E, G#, B) but missing the B. So it's incomplete, but the interval from E to G# is a major third, so it might imply E major even though the fifth (B) is missing. Similarly, G#m/D#: G# minor is G#, B, D#. Over D# bass, the notes are D#, G#, B—so D# to G# is a fourth, but D# to B is a minor sixth? Actually, D# to G# is a perfect fourth, and B is a minor third above G#? Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the bass note defining the chord's root for functional harmony.

The user is probably transcribing a song or analyzing a progression, so they might be confused by the slash chords. They likely want to know the tonal center. The sequence starts and ends on E, which is a strong indicator that E is the tonic. But I need to check the other chords to confirm.

Let me write out the actual bass notes: The bass notes are E, E, E, E, E, E, D#, E, E, E, D#, E. Wait, look at the sequence: First E is E root, then same. C#m/E has E bass, so bass is E. Similarly, G#m/D# has D# bass, F#7/E has E bass, Bmaj7/D# has D# bass. So the bass line is: E, E, E, E, E, E, D#, E, E, E, D#, E.

Hmm, so most of the time the bass is E, except for two instances where it's D#—in the G#m/D# and Bmaj7/D#. That's interesting. The D# appears only as bass notes for those two chords, but the chords themselves are built over G#m and Bmaj7.

Now, let's figure out the actual harmonic function. When a chord has a different bass note, it's often an inversion. But sometimes, the bass note creates a new harmonic implication.

Take C#m/E: Chord symbols suggest C# minor chord in first inversion (since E is the third of C#m). But in functional harmony, inversions don't change the chord's function; it's still C#m. However, the persistent E bass might give it an E major feel since E is the bass and part of the chord (C#m has E as the minor third). But C#m is a minor chord, so it wouldn't function as E major. Wait, actually, C#m with E in bass isn't a standard inversion for E major because E major would require B as the fifth. Here, it's C# and G# instead of B, so it's still C#m but with E in bass. So the chord quality is C# minor, even if the bass is E.

Similarly, G#m/D#: G# minor in second inversion (D# is the fifth of G#m). Bmaj7/D#: B major 7th first inversion (D# is the third of Bmaj7). F#7/E: F# dominant 7th second inversion? F#7 is F#, A#, C#, E. Over E bass, so E is the seventh, making it a third inversion dominant 7th chord.

Now, to find the key, I should look at all the notes used in the chords. Let's list the notes for each chord:

- E: E, G#, B (assuming major triad, as no minor is specified)
- C#m/E: C#, E, G# (so notes C#, E, G#)
- G#m/D#: G#, B, D#
- F#7/E: F#, A#, C#, E
- Bmaj7/D#: B, D#, F#, A#

But since the bass is emphasized, the key might be where E is the tonic. So possible keys: E major or E minor.

Check the chords against E major key. E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So chords in E major would be:

- E (I)
- F#m (ii)
- G#m (iii)
- A (IV)
- B (V)
- C#m (vi)
- D#dim (vii°)

Now, looking at the chords in the sequence:

- E: fits as I
- C#m: that's vi in E major
- G#m: that's iii in E major
- F#7: F#7 isn't diatonic to E major because E major has F# minor (ii), not F# dominant 7th. F#7 would require A# and C#, but E major has G# and D#, so F#7 has A# which is not in E major (E major has A natural). Wait, E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So the fourth scale degree is A natural. F#7 chord would be F#, A#, C#, E. A# is not in E major (it's Gx, but typically we say A natural, so A# is a chromatic note). So F#7 is a secondary dominant, probably V/V (dominant of B major, which is V in E major).

Similarly, Bmaj7: in E major, V is B major, so Bmaj7 is the major 7th version of V, which is common.

But wait, Bmaj7/D#—the chord is Bmaj7 with D# bass. D# is the third of B major, so it's just an inversion.

Now, G#m is iii in E major, which is diatonic.

C#m is vi, diatonic.

F#7 is not diatonic; it's a secondary dominant pointing to B (V).

Also, the progression has E - C#m - E - E - G#m - F#7 - E - E - Bmaj7 - E.

In E major, this makes sense: I - vi - I - I - iii - V/V (F#7) - I - I - V (Bmaj7) - I.

The F#7 is acting as the dominant of B, leading to Bmaj7, which then resolves to E. So the V/V -> V -> I cadence is classic.

But let's check the bass notes. The D# appears in G#m/D# and Bmaj7/D#. In G#m/D#, the notes are D# (bass), G#, B. In E major, D# is the leading tone (vii), but here it's part of G#m chord (which is iii). So G#m/D# is still iii, just in second inversion. Similarly, Bmaj7/D# is V in first inversion.

The only non-diatonic chord here is F#7. F#7 has A# which is not in E major (E major has A natural). But secondary dominants are common, so F#7 is borrowed as V/V.

Therefore, the key is very likely E major.

Now, the user also asks for the mode. Modes are scales like Dorian, Mixolydian, etc. But in this context, since it's a major key with a secondary dominant, it's probably just the Ionian mode (which is the major scale). However, let's see if any chords suggest a mode mixture.

For example, if there was a minor IV chord, it might suggest Mixolydian, but here IV is A major (not present in the progression). The chords used are all diatonic to E major except F#7, which is a secondary dominant, not a modal mixture.

F#7 is standard in major keys for dominant function. So no evidence of a different mode; it's straightforward E major (Ionian).

But let's double-check E minor. E natural minor scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Chords would be Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D. But the progression has E major (not minor), C#m (which isn't in E minor—E minor has C major), G#m (not in E minor—G natural), etc. So it doesn't fit.

E harmonic minor would have G# and D#, so chords: Em, F#dim, G#aug, Am, B, C, D#dim. Still, C#m isn't here; it would be C major in harmonic minor? Wait, E harmonic minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D#. So the sixth is C natural, not C#. So C#m wouldn't fit. Also, the tonic chord is E major in the progression, not minor. So E minor is out.

Therefore, E major is confirmed.

The mode is Ionian, but typically we just say "key of E major" without specifying the mode since major key implies Ionian.

But the user might be expecting a mode if it's not standard major/minor. However, in this case, it's clearly E major.

Another thing: the progression emphasizes E as tonic, with cadences like F#7 (V/V) leading to B (V) leading to E (I). Strong authentic cadence.

Also, the D# in the bass for G#m and Bmaj7: D# is the leading tone in E major (since E major's leading tone is D#), so it's reinforcing the dominant function towards E.

So, final answer: Key is E major, mode is Ionian.

Based on the chord progression you provided—**E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E Bmaj7/D# E**—I'll break down the analysis step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**. The progression heavily implies **E major (Ionian mode)**, but let's examine why.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Chord Functions (Ignoring Bass Notes First)**
List the "true" chords by focusing on their **root notes** (ignoring slash inversions for harmonic analysis):
- **E** (repeated 8 times total)
- **C#m** (appears twice as C#m/E)
- **G#m** (appears once as G#m/D#)
- **F#7** (appears once as F#7/E)
- **Bmaj7** (appears once as Bmaj7/D#)

This simplifies to:  
**E – E – C#m – C#m – E – E – G#m – F#7 – E – E – Bmaj7 – E**

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Chord Relationships Against E Major**
The **E major scale** (Ionian mode) consists of:  
**E F# G# A B C# D#**  

Diatonic chords in E major are:
- **I**: E (E-G#-B)
- **ii**: F#m (F#-A-C#)
- **iii**: G#m (G#-B-D#)
- **IV**: A (A-C#-E)
- **V**: B (B-D#-F#)
- **vi**: C#m (C#-E-G#)
- **vii°**: D#dim (D#-F#-A)

Now, map your chords to this:
- **E** = **I** (tonic, diatonic)
- **C#m** = **vi** (diatonic relative minor)
- **G#m** = **iii** (diatonic)
- **Bmaj7** = **Vmaj7** (diatonic dominant with added 7th)
- **F#7** = **V/V** (secondary dominant, *not diatonic* but functional)

#### **Why F#7 is Key Here**
- **F#7** (F#-A#-C#-E) contains **A#**, which is **not in E major** (E major uses **A natural**).  
- However, F#7 acts as the **dominant of B (V)** → resolving to **Bmaj7** (V) before returning to **E (I)**. This is a classic **V/V → V → I cadence**, common in major keys.  
- In E major:  
  - **F#7 = V/V** (dominant of the dominant, B)  
  - **Bmaj7 = V** (dominant leading back to tonic)  

#### **Bass Note Context (Slash Chords)**
- **C#m/E**: C#m chord with **E in bass** (first inversion). Still functions as **vi**, but emphasizes **E** as a pedal tone.  
- **G#m/D#**: G#m chord with **D# in bass** (second inversion). D# is the **leading tone** to E, reinforcing tonic pull.  
- **F#7/E**: F#7 chord with **E in bass** (third inversion). Creates tension resolving to Bmaj7.  
- **Bmaj7/D#**: Bmaj7 chord with **D# in bass** (first inversion). D# (leading tone) strongly pulls to **E**.  

**The bass line** (E-E-E-E-E-E-**D#**-E-E-E-**D#**-E) uses **D# as a leading tone** to E, confirming **E as the tonal center**. The two D#-bass chords (G#m/D# and Bmaj7/D#) create chromatic motion toward E.

---

### **Step 3: Eliminate Other Keys/Modes**
- **E minor?**  
  E natural minor (E-F#-G-A-B-C-D) has chords like **Em**, **Am**, **Bm**—none match the **major E tonic** or **C#m/G#m** here. E harmonic minor (with D#) has **B major** as V, but lacks **C#m** and **F#7** functionality. **Rejected**.  

- **Other Modes (Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.)?**  
  - **E Dorian** (E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D) would have **D natural** (not D#). Your chords use **D#** (in G#m and Bmaj7), ruling this out.  
  - **E Mixolydian** (E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D) also uses **D natural**—but your progression has **D#**, so **rejected**.  
  - **C# minor?** C#m is present, but the **tonic is clearly E** (starts/ends on E, with strong V-I resolution). **Rejected**.  

---

### **Conclusion: Key and Mode**
- **Key: E major**  
- **Mode: Ionian** (the standard major scale)  

#### **Why?**
- All diatonic chords (**I, iii, vi, V**) align perfectly with **E major**.  
- **F#7** is a functional secondary dominant (**V/V**), not a modal mixture—it’s a common device in major keys to strengthen the V-I resolution.  
- The **tonic (E)** is unambiguous:  
  - Starts/ends on E.  
  - Cadences with **F#7 → Bmaj7 → E** (V/V → V → I).  
  - Bass notes emphasize **E** and its **leading tone D#**.  

This progression is a textbook example of **tonal harmony in E major**, using inversions for smooth voice-leading and a secondary dominant for dramatic resolution. No modal borrowing is present—it’s pure **Ionian**.

If you have audio or more context (e.g., melody), I can refine this further! 🎵

Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**
E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  G#m/D#  F#7/E  
E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  Bmaj7/D#  E

---

### Step 1: Identify the Root Chords (Ignoring Inversions)
First, strip away the slash chords (inversions) to see the underlying harmony:

- E
- C#m
- G#m
- F#7
- Bmaj7

So the core chords are: **E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7**

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Key
Now let’s see which key contains these chords.

Look at the notes in the chords:

- **E major scale**: E F# G# A B C# D#
- **E minor scale (natural)**: E F# G A B C D

Now check which chords fit:

1. **E major**: E - G# - B → fits E major (I), or E minor doesn't have G#.
2. **C#m**: C# - E - G# → fits in E major (vi chord)
3. **G#m**: G# - B - D# → in E major, G# is the 3rd, and G#m is the iii chord
4. **F#7**: F# - A# - C# - E → A# is not in E major (E major has A natural). So this is a problem.

Wait — **F#7** has **A#**, but E major has **A natural**, not A#. So F#7 is not diatonic to E major.

But F#7 is the **dominant of B**, and in E major, **B is the V chord**, so **F#7** is **V7/V** — a secondary dominant.

F#7 → B is a **V7 → I** in the key of B, but B is the **V chord** of E.

So: **F#7 → B → E** would be a **V7/V → V → I**, which is a common progression.

Ah, and we have **Bmaj7**, not B7. That’s interesting.

Bmaj7: B - D# - F# - A#

But E major has D#, and F#, but A#? No — E major has A natural. So **A#** is not in E major.

So **Bmaj7** contains A#, which is not in E major. That suggests we’re **not** in E major.

Wait — maybe the key is **B major**?

Let’s test **B major**: B C# D# E F# G# A#

Check the chords:

- **E major** = E G# B → yes, E is IV in B major
- **C#m** = C# E G# → yes, C#m is ii in B major
- **G#m** = G# B D# → G#m is vi in B major
- **F#7** = F# A# C# E → A# is in B major (yes), so F#7 is V7 in B major
- **Bmaj7** = B D# F# A# → this is I in B major (with 7th)

Perfect!

All chords fit in **B major**:

- E → IV
- C#m → ii
- G#m → vi
- F#7 → V7
- Bmaj7 → I

Also, the inversions:

- C#m/E → C#m with E in the bass → E is the third of C#m, common
- G#m/D# → D# is the fifth of G#m, fine
- F#7/E → E is the 7th of F#7, also fine
- Bmaj7/D# → D# is the third of B, standard

So they are just inversions for voice leading.

---

### Step 3: Determine Key and Mode

The tonic chord is **Bmaj7**, which appears at the end and feels like resolution. The progression centers around **B**, with strong pull from F#7 (dominant) to B, and uses primarily diatonic chords from **B major**.

So the **key is B major**.

The **mode** is **Ionian** (since it's the major scale).

---

### Final Answer:
**Key: B major**  
**Mode: Ionian** ✅

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to list out all the chords without the bass notes for simplicity. The progression has chords like E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7. But there are also slashes indicating bass notes. For example, C#m/E means C# minor with E in the bass. Similarly, G#m/D# and F#7/E and Bmaj7/D#. I should focus on the chord types first and then see the bass notes, but maybe the bass notes are just part of the voicing. The key might be determined by the root notes of the chords.

So the chord roots are: E (x3), C#m (x2), G#m, F#7, Bmaj7. Let me write them out:

- E (which could be E major)
- C#m (C# minor)
- G#m (G# minor)
- F#7 (F# dominant seventh)
- Bmaj7 (B major seventh)

Now, looking at the key. Common keys have specific chord relationships. Let me think about the notes in each chord.

Starting with E major: notes E, G#, B.

C# minor: C#, E, G#.

G# minor: G#, B, D#.

F#7: F#, A#, C#, E. But F#7 is typically F#, A#, C#, E.

Bmaj7: B, D#, F#, A#.

Now, looking at all these notes together. Let me compile a list of all the notes from the chords.

E major has E, G#, B.

C#m has C#, E, G#.

G#m has G#, B, D#.

F#7 has F#, A#, C#, E.

Bmaj7 has B, D#, F#, A#.

So combining all unique notes: E, G#, B, C#, D#, F#, A#.

Let's see if these fit a particular scale. Let's list them in order:

C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, B.

Wait, that's C# D# E F# G# A# B. Hmm, that's the C# major scale? But C# major would be C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#. Wait, E# is F, but here we have E natural. That doesn't fit. Let's check again.

Wait, C# major scale: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#. So E# is F natural. But in our notes, we have E natural. So that's a problem. So maybe it's not C# major.

Wait, the notes we have: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, B.

That's actually C# natural minor? Let's see. C# natural minor is the same as A# major? Wait, no, natural minor is relative to the major scale. C# minor would be the relative minor of E major? Because E major is the key of 4 sharps (E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#). Wait, E major: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

Yes! E major has the notes E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.

Now let's check the chords we have. Let's see what chords are diatonic to E major.

E major chord: E, G#, B.

C#m: in E major, C# is the 6th note. The chord on 6th is C# minor (C#, E, G#). Yes, that fits.

G#m: the 3rd degree of E major is G#, so G# minor? Wait, no. In E major, the chords are:

I: E major

II: F# minor

III: G# minor

IV: A major

V: B major

VI: C# minor

VII: D# diminished

So G#m would be the III chord. Yes, G# minor is diatonic to E major. Wait, but in E major, the III chord is G# minor? Let's check. The notes for G# minor: G#, B, D#. Yes, because in E major, the notes are E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So the chord built on G# would be G#, B, D# — that's G# minor.

F#7: F# is the second degree. In E major, the II chord is F# minor. But F#7 would have A# instead of A natural. But in E major, the notes don't include A#. Wait, E major has A natural. So F#7 is F#, A#, C#, E. But A# is not in E major; it's A natural. So F#7 is not diatonic to E major. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe the key isn't E major. Let's look at the F#7. If there's an A# in it, then the scale must have A#. So E major has A natural, so it doesn't have A#. So perhaps the key is different.

Maybe the key is B major? Let's see. B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Yes! B major has the notes B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Now, let's check the chords.

Bmaj7: B, D#, F#, A# — that's diatonic to B major.

F#7: F#, A#, C#, E. Wait, E is in B major? B major's notes are B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. Yes, E is there. So F#7 in B major would be the V chord? Because in B major, F# is the fifth degree. The V chord is F# major, which would be F#, A#, C#. But F#7 adds a seventh, which would be E. So F#7 is F#, A#, C#, E. Yes, that's the dominant 7th chord on the fifth, which is common. So F#7 is V7 in B major.

Now, what about G#m? In B major, G# is the third degree. The chord on III is G# minor? Let's check. The notes for G# minor: G#, B, D#. Yes, G# is the root. G#, B, D# — that fits into B major's notes. So G#m is the iii chord.

C#m: C# minor. In B major, C# is the second degree. The chord on II would be C# minor? Wait, the notes of II chord in B major: C#, E, G#. Yes, C# minor, which is diatonic. Because B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So the chords:

I: B major

II: C# minor

III: D# diminished? Wait no. Wait, the chords in B major:

I: B major (B, D#, F#)

II: C# minor (C#, E, G#)

III: D# minor? Wait, no. Wait, building triads on each degree.

In B major: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Triad on B: B, D#, F# — B major.

Triad on C#: C#, E, G# — yes, C# minor.

Triad on D#: D#, F#, A# — D# minor? Yes, D# minor.

Triad on E: E, G#, B — E major.

Triad on F#: F#, A#, C# — F# major.

But then F#7 would be F#, A#, C#, E. Because seventh chord would include the seventh of the scale. The seventh of F# in the key of B would be... Wait, the V7 chord in major key is built on V, which is F#, and the seventh is E, which is the 7th of the scale (since the key is B major, the 7th is A#, so E is actually the fourth degree? Wait no. Wait, scale degrees for B major:

1: B

2: C#

3: D#

4: E

5: F#

6: G#

7: A#

So the F# (5th) chord, the major triad is F#, A#, C#. To make it a 7th chord, the seventh would be E, which is the 4th scale degree. So the F#7 chord in B major would be F#, A#, C#, E. But wait, in the diatonic seventh chords of B major, the V7 chord is usually F#7 (with E), yes. Because the V7 is built on the fifth scale degree (F#), and the seventh is the fourth note of the scale? Wait, no. Let's see: the seventh chord on F# would be F#, A#, C#, E. Yes, that's called the V7 chord of B major. Wait, yes. Because the dominant seventh chord in a major key is built on V, with the minor seventh interval from the root. So F# to E is a minor seventh (since F# to E is 10 semitones, which is a minor seventh). So yes, F#7 is the V7 chord of B major.

Now, the chords we have in the progression:

E chord: in B major, E is the IV chord. E major (E, G#, B). Yes, diatonic.

C#m/E: C# minor chord with E in the bass. So the root of the chord is C#, but with E as bass note. The chord itself is C# minor, so diatonic.

G#m/D#: G# minor with D# bass. So G#m is the iii chord in B major.

F#7/E: F#7 with E in the bass. So F#7 is the V7 chord in B major.

Bmaj7: B major seventh. Which in B major, the tonic chord. Bmaj7 would be B, D#, F#, A#. Yes, diatonic.

So let's see: the chords are E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7. All these chords are diatonic to B major except...? Let's check:

Bmaj7: tonic chord. Yes.

E major: IV chord. In B major, IV is E major.

C#m: II chord, diatonic.

G#m: iii chord. Wait, in B major, III chord is D# minor. Wait, wait a second. Let's get the diatonic chords right for B major.

The diatonic triads in B major:

1. B major

2. C# minor

3. D# minor

4. E major

5. F# major

6. G# minor

7. A# diminished

Ah! Right. So VI chord is G# minor. Yes. So G#m is the VI chord. Because in B major, the sixth scale degree is G#. So the chord built on G# is G# minor.

Similarly, the IV chord is E major, which is correct.

So the progression has E (IV), C#m (II), G#m (VI), F#7 (V7), Bmaj7 (I). So this progression is in B major. But let's check the exact sequence given.

The user wrote: E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E

So looking at the chords when considering the root chord (ignoring bass): E, E, C#m, C#m, E, E, G#m, F#7, E, E, C#m, C#m, E, E, Bmaj7, E.

So the main chords in order: IV, IV, II, II, IV, IV, VI, V7, IV, IV, II, II, IV, IV, I, IV.

But in the progression, the bass notes are specified. For example, C#m/E means C#m chord with E in the bass. So it's not the root being E, but the chord is C#m and bass note E. So the chord itself is C#m, but with E as the lowest note. So the chord voicing has C#m with E below. Similarly, G#m/D# is G#m chord with D# bass. Etc.

But regardless of the bass notes, the chord types would be based on their quality and root. So C#m/E is a C# minor chord, the slash just indicates the bass note.

So if the chord types are E (maybe E major), C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7, all of which fit B major.

But wait, the F#7 is in the progression. F#7 includes A# and E. B major includes A# and E, so yes.

Bmaj7 includes A# (which is the 7th scale degree), which is in B major.

So the key would be B major. But let's check if there's something else.

Another possibility: maybe B mixolydian? Mixolydian has a flat seventh. But B mixolydian would have A natural. But here the F#7 has an A#? Wait, F#7 chord is F#, A#, C#, E. The A# comes into play. If it's B mixolydian, the scale would be B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A natural. So A natural, but here F#7 has A#? No. Wait, F#7 in B mixolydian would have A natural as the minor seventh? Because F# to E natural is minor seventh. Wait, if B mixolydian has A natural, then F#7 chord would have A natural. Wait, F#7 in B mixolydian: the A natural.

Wait, in B mixolydian, the notes are B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A. So yes, A natural.

But F#7 chord would be F#, A natural, C#, E. Which is actually a common dominant seventh chord. But in the given progression, the F#7 chord — does it have A# or A natural? Because the user didn't specify the exact notes, but F#7 typically implies F#, A#, C#, E. Wait, no. Wait, F#7 as a dominant seventh chord is built as root, major third, perfect fifth, minor seventh. The minor seventh of F# is E natural. Because F# to E is minor seventh interval (10 semitones). Wait, F# to E is a minor seventh. Because from F# up to E: F# to F is a half step, F to E is whole step? Wait, better to count semitones.

F# to G: 1, G to G#: 2, G# to A: 3, A to A#: 4, A# to B: 5, B to C: 6, C to C#: 7, C# to D: 8, D to D#: 9, D# to E: 10. Wait, actually, from F# to E is 10 semitones. Yes, which is a minor seventh. So F#7 chord usually includes E, not E#. So A# would be part of F#7? No. Wait, F# major triad is F#, A#, C#. Then a dominant seventh chord would be F#, A#, C#, E. Because the seventh is minor seventh from F#, which is E. So yes, A# is the major third of F#, so that's correct. So F#7 has E natural as the minor seventh. Which in the key of B major, E natural is part of the scale. Because B major's scale is B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So yes, E is in there. So F#7 in B major uses F#, A#, C#, E. Which are all in B major. Because A# is in B major. Wait, yes. B major has A# as the 7th scale degree. Because B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So yes, A# is there. So F#7 chord has A# (which is the major third of the F# chord) and E natural as the minor seventh.

So all the notes fit. So B major is the key.

But wait, another check: what about other possible keys. Let's see.

If it were G# minor, which is the relative minor of B major. Then the chords would still fit. Because G# minor is the same key signature as B major. But G# minor would have chords like G# minor, A# diminished, B major, etc. Let's see. But the progression ends on a Bmaj7. Typically, if it were in a minor key, it might end on the tonic minor. But here the progression ends with Bmaj7, so that's the tonic major. So B major seems more likely than G# minor. But in the context of minor key, B major could be the III chord. But ending on iii chord is less common. Usually, a piece ending on Bmaj7 would suggest B major is the tonic.

But let's check the progression in terms of mode. If the key is B major, then the mode is Ionian (major scale). But maybe it's Mixolydian or something else. But the presence of the F#7 chord (which is dominant 7th) suggests that it's in a major key where V7 is used. In Ionian mode, that's standard. For example, in B Ionian, V7 is F#7, which is correct.

Alternatively, could it be in E major? Let's check again. Earlier thought that F#7 has A# which isn't in E major. E major's notes are E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. So A natural. The F#7 chord's third is A#, which isn't in E major. Because E major only has A natural. So F#7 chord with A# would not be diatonic to E major. Therefore, can't be E major.

Another possibility: A major? Let's see. A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. Then chords:

A major: A, C#, E.

Bm: B, D, F#.

C#m: C#, E, G#.

D major: D, F#, A.

E: E, G#, B.

F#m: F#, A, C#.

G#dim: G#, B, D.

But then in this scale, F#7 chord would be F#, A#, C#, E — but A# is not in A major. So again, F#7 would have A# which isn't in the scale.

So B major seems correct.

Now, checking all the chords:

E: IV in B major.

C#m: II.

G#m: VI.

F#7: V7.

Bmaj7: I.

Yes. So the key is B major, and the mode is Ionian.

Wait, but sometimes people confuse the modes by analyzing the scale. For example, if the progression centers around a different note but still uses the same scale. But here, the progression includes chords building towards Bmaj7, which is the tonic. Also, the progression ends on Bmaj7, which is a strong tonic chord. So B major is the key.

Another check: in G# minor, the scale would be G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. Which is the same notes as B major. So relative minor. But the chord progression ends on Bmaj7, which would be the III chord in G# minor, which is less common. Usually, a piece in minor key would end on G# minor. But here it ends on Bmaj7, so B major is the tonic.

Therefore, the key is B major, mode is Ionian.

But wait, let me check the bass notes. C#m/E: E is the bass note. So C# minor chord with E in bass. That's the same as E major's first inversion? No: E major is E, G#, B. C#m chord is C#, E, G#. So C#m/E is E, C#, G# — so the notes are E as bass, then C# and G#. So in terms of function, in B major's context, E is the IV note, but the C#m chord here is II chord. The bass note E makes it sort of a IV chord maybe? Wait, but the chord type is C# minor. So it's still the II chord. The bass is just a different note.

Similarly, G#m/D#: G#m chord (G#, B, D#) with D# in bass. So notes D#, G#, B. In terms of intervals from D# bass, D# to G# is perfect fourth, D# to B is minor sixth, but chord is G# minor in first inversion? Or it's a second inversion of G#m: the root is G#, but bass is D#, which is the fifth. So D# is fifth of G# minor chord. So that's second inversion.

F#7/E: E is bass note. F#7 chord is F#, A#, C#, E. If bass is E, then it's E, F#, A#, C#. So inversion: root F#, then A#, C#, E. So the bass is E, which is the minor seventh. So it's a third inversion of F#7 chord. But regardless of the inversion, the chord is F#7.

Bmaj7/D#: Bmaj7 chord with D# bass. Bmaj7 is B, D#, F#, A#. So D# is the third of the chord. So that's a first inversion.

But the chord types remain. So the underlying tonality is B major.

Another thing: the presence of F#7 suggests a dominant function. In B major, the dominant chord is F# major, and when we add the seventh (E), it becomes F#7, which is the dominant seventh chord leading to tonic B. So yes, that fits perfectly. It's a V7-I resolution. Although in the progression given, after F#7 comes E, not B. Wait, no. The progression has F#7 followed by E, then E, then C#m, etc. Then later Bmaj7. Let's see the exact sequence again:

E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E

So after F#7/E comes E, then E, then E, etc., then Bmaj7/D# E. So the F#7 leads to E (IV) chord. Which is not a typical dominant resolution. Normally, dominant resolves to tonic. But here, F#7 goes to E, which is the IV. Hmm. So perhaps it's more of a deceptive cadence? But usually, deceptive cadence is V to vi. But here V7 to IV.

But in the context of the key, B major, V7 (F#7) to IV (E major) is a possible progression. For example, V7 to IV is common in rock or blues. Not the usual classical cadence, but still acceptable. So the overall key is still B major.

Alternatively, could it be in G# minor? Let's see. G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. Diatonic chords:

i: G#m

ii°: A#dim

III: B major

iv: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major

VII: F# major

So if the key is G# minor, then the chords:

E major is VI, C#m is iv, G#m is i, F#maj7 would be VII, etc. But in this case, the progression has F#7. In G# minor, F# is the VII chord. F# major chord. F#7 would be F#, A#, C#, E. In the G# natural minor scale, we have A natural? No. Wait, G# natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So no A#? Wait, G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. The scale degrees:

1: G#

2: A#

3: B

4: C#

5: D#

6: E

7: F#

So yes, F# is 7th, and the VII chord is F# major. But if it's F#7, which has A# (since the major triad of F# is F#, A#, C#), and then the seventh is E natural (for dominant seventh). But in the natural minor scale, the VII chord is major (F#maj), and if we add a seventh, it would normally be F#7, but in harmonic minor? Not sure.

But the main issue here is the chord progressions. If the key is G# minor, then the chords would be:

E is VI, C#m is iv, G#m is i, F#7 would be VII7. But in natural minor, the VII chord is major and sometimes dominant seventh. But the progression ends on Bmaj7? B major would be the III chord. So in G# minor key, ending on III chord is not typical. Usually, minor tunes end on tonic minor. So unless it's an altered cadence or something.

But more importantly, Bmaj7 would be the III chord, which is not the tonic. So unless the song is centered around B major. So probably B major.

Alternatively, maybe the key is B major, and the progression is using the standard chords. Even though F#7 resolves to E, it's still in B major.

Another way: the notes in all chords. Let's list all notes including the bass.

E: notes E, G#, B.

C#m/E: bass E, with chord C#m = C#, E, G#. So notes are E, C#, G#.

G#m/D#: D#, G#, B.

F#7/E: E, F#, A#, C#.

Bmaj7/D#: D#, B, F#, A#.

E: E, G#, B.

So let's list all the notes present across the progression:

From E: E, G#, B.

C#m/E: C#, E, G#.

G#m/D#: D#, G#, B.

F#7/E: E, F#, A#, C#.

Bmaj7/D#: D#, B, F#, A#.

So all unique notes: E, G#, B, C#, D#, F#, A#.

Which exactly fits the B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Yes. So all the notes belong to B major.

Therefore, the key is B major, and the mode is Ionian.

But wait, another possibility: if there's a different key. Let's see. For example, maybe B Mixolydian? But B Mixolydian has A natural instead of A#. So if there were A natural, but in our chord F#7, we have A#. Because F#7 chord has A# (major third), so that's part of the chord. If the scale had A natural, then the third of F# chord would be A natural instead of A#? No. Wait, F# chord as major chord needs A#. So if the scale has A natural, then F# chord would be F# major with A natural? Which is not possible; F# major requires A#.

Wait, F# major is F#, A#, C#. If a scale has A natural, then building a major chord on F# in that scale wouldn't be possible. So F# major chord requires A#; thus, any scale that's in the context of F#7 chord must have A# and E.

And B major has A# and E.

So yes, B major is confirmed.

Another check: in G# minor (natural minor), scale is G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So A# is present, but also F# natural. The F#7 chord would require A# and E. In G# minor natural minor, F# is natural, yes. So F#7 = F#, A#, C#, E. Wait, the F# major chord includes A#, but the scale for G# minor natural has F# natural. But the A# is present. So the scale G# natural minor has A#. So yes, A# is part of G# minor scale. Wait, G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#. So yes, A# is the second scale degree.

Wait, so both B major and G# minor have the same notes. So they are relative major/minor. So the choice between them depends on the tonic. If the piece resolves to B major chord, it's B major. If it resolves to G# minor, then it's G# minor.

Looking at the chord progression: it ends with Bmaj7 and then E. Wait, after Bmaj7/D# comes E. So the last chord is E. But Bmaj7 is before that. So the progression ends on E. Hmm. If it ends with E, but Bmaj7 precedes it. So the final chord is E, which is IV chord of B major.

But typically, pieces end on the tonic. However, in some genres, they do end on other chords. But the question is about determining the key and mode. So even if the progression ends on IV, if the tonal center is B major, then it's still B major.

But how to determine the tonal center. The Bmaj7 chord is used. In fact, in the progression, there's a Bmaj7 chord, which would be the tonic if it's B major. It's the only chord named after B.

But the progression has multiple occurrences of E. Let's see: there are a lot of E chords. But the chords named Bmaj7 would indicate B as a strong candidate.

Another way: in the key of B major, the V chord is F# major. The F#7 is the dominant seventh chord, which leads to the tonic. But in the progression, F#7 goes to E. Which is subdominant. So a plagal cadence or deceptive cadence. But it's still within the B major key.

Alternatively, if the key were E major, but F#7 has A#, which isn't in E major. E major has A natural. So that's out.

So yeah, B major seems correct.

Now, the mode. If it's B major, then the mode is Ionian. Since Ionian is just the major scale.

But let me see if there's a mode that could fit. For example, if the progression starts on B and uses B as a tonal center. But Bmaj7 chord is present, and it's the only B chord. So most likely tonic.

So key is B major, mode is Ionian.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes people confuse with the key being the relative minor. But since the chord progression includes B as a major chord and the tonal center seems to be B. The other chords all fit in the B major scale.

Yes, so I think the key is B major, mode is Ionian.

But wait, the problem says "Determine key and mode". So key is the tonic note and major/minor or mode name.

So in this case, key of B major, mode Ionian. Or key of B major (since Ionian is the mode for major scale).

Alternatively, sometimes people just say key of B major, as opposed to modal key. But technically, the scale is B Ionian.

But in common terminology, we'd say the key is B major. And mode is Ionian.

But maybe the user expects "B major" for the key and "Ionian" for mode.

But let me check again for any contradictions.

C#m/E: C# minor with E bass. Which in B major, E is the fourth. So the chord is II chord with fourth in the bass.

G#m/D#: VI chord in B major (since G# is sixth scale degree), with fifth in bass.

F#7 is V7 in B major.

Yes. All fits.

So conclusion: key is B major, mode is Ionian.

Wait, but another check: in the chord G#m/D#, the D# is the bass. In B major, G#m chord has roots G#, B, D#. So G#m in first inversion would have B as bass, second inversion has D# as bass. So yes. So the G#m with D# bass is second inversion.

All these chords fit in B major.

I think that's solid. So yes, key of B major, mode Ionian.

The chord progression provided is:  
**E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E**

---

### **Step 1: Analyze the Chord Qualities and Notes**
Let's extract the **core chord types** (ignoring bass notes for now) and list all unique notes used:

- **E** (E major): E, G#, B  
- **C#m** (C# minor): C#, E, G#  
- **G#m** (G# minor): G#, B, D#  
- **F#7** (F# dominant 7th): F#, A#, C#, E  
- **Bmaj7** (B major 7th): B, D#, F#, A#  

Now, compiling all unique notes:  
**E, G#, B, C#, D#, F#, A#**

This matches the **B major scale**:  
**B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#**

All notes in the progression are **diatonic to B major**. This confirms that the key is **B major**.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Chord Function in Context**
Let’s map each chord to its function within the **B major scale**:

| Chord       | Root | Function in B Major | Notes             |
|-------------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| E           | E    | IV (Subdominant)    | E, G#, B          |
| C#m         | C#   | ii (Supertonic)     | C#, E, G#         |
| G#m         | G#   | vi (Submediant)     | G#, B, D#         |
| F#7         | F#   | V7 (Dominant 7th)   | F#, A#, C#, E     |
| Bmaj7       | B    | I (Tonic)           | B, D#, F#, A#     |

- The progression includes a **dominant 7th chord (F#7)**, which resolves strongly to the **tonic (Bmaj7)** — a hallmark of **B major**.
- The final chord in the progression is **E**, which is the **IV chord**, but the **presence of Bmaj7** (the tonic chord) and its placement near the end of the progression strongly signal **B major** as the tonal center.
- While the piece ends on **E (IV)**, this is still within the key of B major (common in rock/pop for stylistic reasons), and the repeated use of **Bmaj7** confirms **B as the tonic**.

---

### **Step 3: Determine the Mode**
The scale used throughout the progression is the **B major scale**, which is also known as the **Ionian mode**. This is the standard major scale mode.

- **Ionian mode = Major key = B major**
- The progression does not emphasize any other mode (e.g., Dorian, Mixolydian), as all chords and notes are strictly diatonic to the **B major/Ionian scale**.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **B major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian**

This is a **major key** progression with the **tonic** clearly centered on **B**, confirmed by the presence of **Bmaj7** (I chord), consistent diatonic harmonies, and the dominant 7th (F#7) resolving toward the tonic. The minor mode (relative minor G# minor) is unlikely because the progression does not center on **G#m** or resolve to it, and the tonic chord is a **B major** chord.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

```
E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E
```

---

### Step 1: List the unique chords

Let’s extract and identify the chords:

| Chord        | Root | Type      | Bass Note |
|--------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| E            | E    | Major     | E         |
| C#m/E        | C#   | Minor     | E         |
| G#m/D#       | G#   | Minor     | D#        |
| F#7/E        | F#   | Dominant 7| E         |
| Bmaj7/D#     | B    | Major 7   | D#        |

Note: Chords like `C#m/E` mean a C# minor chord with E in the bass — so it’s a **C# minor first inversion**. We care about the **harmonic function**, not just the root.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the chord tones in context of E major

Let’s assume the tonal center is **E** (since it starts and ends on E, and appears most frequently). Check if all chords fit into **E major** or a related mode.

#### E Major Scale: E F# G# A B C# D#

Chords built on each degree (triads):

- I: E major ✅
- ii: F#m ❌ (we have F#7 — close)
- iii: G#m ✅
- IV: A major ❌ (not present)
- V: B major ✅ (we have Bmaj7 — close)
- vi: C#m ✅
- vii°: D#dim ❌ (we have D# as bass note, but not as a chord)

Now, we have:

- **E major** → I ✅
- **C#m** → vi ✅
- **G#m** → iii ✅
- **F#7** → ii7? But in E major, ii is F#m — not F#7.
- **Bmaj7** → V7? But in E major, V is B major (or B7), not Bmaj7.

Wait — **Bmaj7** is not in E major.  
→ In E major, the V chord should be **B7** (B-D#-F#-A) to strongly resolve to E.

But we have **Bmaj7** (B-D#-F#-A#). The A# is the **major 7th**, which is **not in E major** — E major has A natural.

So **Bmaj7 contains A#**, which is **not in E major scale**.

Similarly, **F#7** is F#-A#-C#-E — which implies A# again (not in E major).

So the presence of **A#** strongly suggests we are **not** in E major.

---

### Step 3: Look for a key with A#

The note **A#** is the **leading tone** of B major, and the **#4** of E major — which is *outside*.

Let’s consider **E major ↔ E Lydian**?

E Lydian = E F# G# A# B C# D# — yes! That’s the **Lydian mode** of B major.

Wait — **E Lydian** is the **4th mode of B major**:

- B major scale: B C# D# E F# G# A#
- 4th degree = E → E Lydian = E F# G# A# B C# D#

That’s the key! 🚀

Let’s check if all chords fit in **E Lydian**.

**E Lydian scale**: E F# G# A# B C# D#

Now, build diatonic chords:

- I: E major ✅ (E-G#-B)
- ii: F# minor? But we have **F#7** — F#-A#-C#-E → tones: F#, A#, C#, E — all in E Lydian ✅
- iii: G# minor ✅ (G#-B-D#)
- IV: A# minor? Not used
- V: B major? We have **Bmaj7** → B-D#-F#-A# → all notes in E Lydian ✅
- vi: C# minor ✅ (C#-E-G#)
- vii°: D#dim — we have it in bass (G#m/D#, Bmaj7/D#), but not as a chord — fine.

So:

- E → I ✅
- C#m → vi ✅
- G#m → iii ✅
- F#7 → ii7 ✅ (diatonic in Lydian)
- Bmaj7 → Vmaj7 ✅ (in Lydian, the V chord is maj7 because the 7th is A# — the #4 of the mode)

✅ **All chords are diatonic to E Lydian.**

---

### Step 4: Confirm tonal center

- The progression begins and ends on **E**.
- E chords are most frequent.
- The cadence goes: ... Bmaj7/D# → E — this is a **Vmaj7 → I** cadence.

In major keys, we expect V7 → I, but here it’s **Vmaj7 → I**, which is a hallmark of **Lydian** — the #4 (A#) creates a bright, unresolved quality that leans into the maj7.

This chord is **not** borrowed — it’s diatonic.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key:** E  
> **Mode:** Lydian  
>  
> **Full designation: E Lydian**

This progression is firmly in **E Lydian**, using its diatonic chords — most notably **F#7** and **Bmaj7** — which contain the characteristic raised 4th (A#) of the Lydian mode.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**  
E – E – C#m/E – C#m/E – E – E – G#m/D# – F#7/E – E – E – C#m/E – C#m/E – E – E – Bmaj7/D# – E

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonic (home chord)
The progression starts and ends on **E major**, and **E** appears very frequently—this strongly suggests **E** is the tonic.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the chords in relation to E major

**Key of E major has the following diatonic chords:**
- E (I)
- F#m (ii)
- G#m (iii)
- A (IV)
- B (V)
- C#m (vi)
- D#dim (vii°)

Now compare the chords used:
- **E** = I → ✅ diatonic  
- **C#m/E** = vi (with E in the bass) → ✅ diatonic  
- **G#m/D#** = iii chord (G#m) with D# in the bass → D# is the 5th of G#m, so it’s a standard inversion; G#m is diatonic → ✅  
- **F#7/E** = F#7 (ii7) with E in the bass → F#7 is **not** diatonic to E major. In E major, the ii chord is **F#m**, not F#7. F#7 implies a **dominant 7th**, which includes **A#** (the major 3rd) and **E** (the minor 7th). So F#7 = F#–A#–C#–E. The **A#** is **not** in E major (E major has A natural).  
- **Bmaj7/D#** = Bmaj7 (Vmaj7) with D# in the bass → Bmaj7 = B–D#–F#–A#. Again, **A#** appears here. In E major, the V chord is **B major** (B–D#–F#), and Bmaj7 would include **A#**, which is **not** in the E major scale (E major has A natural). So Bmaj7 is **not diatonic** to E major.

So we have **two chords containing A#**:  
- F#7 (contains A#)  
- Bmaj7 (contains A#)

The presence of **A#** suggests the use of **E major’s dominant key (B major)** or possible modal/tonal mixture.

---

### Step 3: Consider E Lydian?

E Lydian mode = E–F#–G#–A#–B–C#–D#

This scale includes **A#**, which matches the A# found in F#7 and Bmaj7.

Let’s check if all chords fit **E Lydian**:

- E = I → ✅ (E major)
- C#m = vi → C#–E–G# → all in E Lydian → ✅
- G#m = iii → G#–B–D# → ✅ (all in E Lydian)
- F#7 = II7 → F#–A#–C#–E → all notes in E Lydian → ✅
- Bmaj7 = Vmaj7 → B–D#–F#–A# → all in E Lydian → ✅

So **all chords are diatonic to E Lydian**!

In E major (Ionian), the IV chord is A major. But in this progression, there's **no A major or A natural at all**—instead, we see **A#** consistently, which is the **#4** of E, the hallmark of **Lydian mode**.

Also, the repeated use of **F#7** (II7) and **Bmaj7** (Vmaj7) supports Lydian, where the II chord is major or dominant (because of the #4), and the V chord can be maj7 due to the raised 4th.

---

### Step 4: Confirm mode

- Tonic: E  
- Scale degrees used: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#  
- This is **E Lydian** (1 2 3 #4 5 6 7)

No chords contradict this, and the characteristic #4 (A#) appears in two important chords.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: E  
Mode: Lydian**

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking**

### Reasoning

**Examining the Chords**

I've begun dissecting the chord progression, note by note, to get a handle on the relationships. I'm focusing on identifying the root notes and how they progress. The E major chords are obvious, but the secondary chords are providing some more challenge. The slash chords are, of course, the key to unlocking the mode.


**Deciphering Chord Function**

I'm now comparing the chord functions against a basic E major scale, seeking out non-diatonic chords. The F#7 immediately stands out as a secondary dominant, implying a potential modulation, or at least a borrowed chord. The Bmaj7 further solidified my suspicion that borrowed chords will be the key to this understanding.


**Identifying the Mode**

I've been meticulously examining the chord functions, re-evaluating the possibility of a non-diatonic key. Considering the Bmaj7, I'm now leaning towards E Lydian as the most likely mode. I'm focusing on the differences in diatonic chords to confirm my analysis. The F#7 continues to pose an interesting challenge.


**Refining Mode Confirmation**

I'm now cross-referencing my understanding of E Lydian with the actual chords from the progression, re-examining the functions of each chord to solidify my conclusion. Specifically, the presence of the Bmaj7 and the F#7 are still causing me to give this close consideration. I'm focusing on why the F#7 isn't an F#m to either confirm or deny the mode.


**Finalizing the Analysis**

I'm synthesizing all the pieces of the puzzle now, confirming the key and mode. The prevalence of Bmaj7 and F#7 confirms the E Lydian interpretation. Looking closely, I understand why the secondary dominant is used. I am prepared to state my final conclusion.




This chord progression centers heavily on the E chord, establishing it as the tonic.

Here is the functional analysis based on the tonic being E:

| Chord | Function in E | Diatonic to E Major? | Note Implication |
| :---: | :-----------: | :------------------: | :---------------: |
| **E** | I | Yes | |
| **C#m** | vi | Yes | |
| **G#m** | iii | Yes | |
| **F#7** | Secondary Dominant (V7/V or Chromatic ii) | No (expected F#m) | Primarily a tension chord |
| **Bmaj7** | V (Major Seventh) | **No** (Expected B7 or B) | **A#** (Raised 4th degree) |

## Determining the Mode

The presence of the **Bmaj7** chord is the crucial piece of evidence.

1.  **Tonic:** The progression begins and ends on E, and E is the most occurring chord. The overall "key" is **E**.
2.  **The Bmaj7 Chord:** In the key of E, the B chord acts as the dominant (V). Normally, in a major key, this would be a B major triad or a B dominant seventh (B7), which includes the note A natural (the 4th degree of the scale).
3.  **Bmaj7 Notes:** Bmaj7 contains the notes **B - D# - F# - A#**.
4.  **The Raised Fourth:** The note **A#** is the raised 4th degree of the E scale. This note is the definitive characteristic that differentiates the scale from standard Major (Ionian), which uses A natural.

The **E scale with a raised 4th degree (A#)** is the definition of the **Lydian Mode**.

## Conclusion

*   **Key/Tonic:** **E**
*   **Mode:** **Lydian** (E Lydian)
    *(The F#7 chord acts as a chromatic alteration, likely functioning as a dominant leading to B or as a momentary bluesy coloration, but it does not upset the Lydian sound established by the Bmaj7.)*

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

The provided chord progression is:

**E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E**

Let's analyze the chords:

1. **Root Chord:** The progression starts and ends on **E**. The vast majority of the chords are centered around E (indicated by the "/E" bass in many cases, although the progression analysis typically uses the chord root name).
2. **Diatonic Chords in E Major:**
 Routine chords:
    * E Major (**I**)
    * F# minor (**ii**)
    * G# minor (**iii**)
    * A Major (**IV**)
    * B Major (**V**)
    * C# minor (**vi**)
    * D# diminished (**vii°**)

3. **Chords in the Progression:**
    * **E:** I (E Major) - Fits perfectly.
    * **C#m/E (or just C#m for analysis):** vi (C# minor) - Fits perfectly.
    * **G#m/D# (or just G#m):** iii (G# minor) - Fits perfectly.
    * **F#7/E (or just F#7):** This is the most crucial chord for mode determination.
        * The diatonic chord is **F#m** (ii).
        * **F#7** is a secondary dominant or a non-diatonic V/V chord. In this context, it functions as a dominant chord leading to B (or Bm, though B major is diatonic).
        * However, music often uses F# Major (the chord within F#7) in E Major as a temporary secondary dominant (V/V). It contains the note **A#**.
    * **Bmaj7/D# (or just Bmaj7):** V (B Major) - Fits perfectly, adding the major 7th (A#) which is already present in E Major.

4. **Analysis of Accidentals (from F#7):**
    * E Major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#
    * F#7 chord notes: F#, A#, C#, E
    * The note **A#** is present in the F#7 chord.
    * E Major diatonic contains **A natural**.
    * The presence of **A#** *chromatically* (in the F#7 chord) is standard practice in E Major harmony (V/V).

5. **Modal Conclusion:**
    * All core structural chords (I, vi, iii, V) are diatonic to the **E Major** scale.
    * The progression strongly centers on **E**.
    * The use of F#7 is a common chromatic alteration (secondary dominant) that doesn't push the tonality out of E Major, especially since it doesn't resolve directly to B (though it sets up a tonic feel).

6. **Alternative (Minor) possibility:**
    * Could it be C# Minor (the relative minor)? The tonic (E) is I. No.

**Conclusion:**

The key is clearly **E**. The mode is **Major** (Ionian).

**Key and Mode:** **E Major** (E Ionian)

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

To determine the key and mode of this chord progression, let's analyze it step by step:

---

### **Given Chords:**
E E C#m/E C#m/E  
E E G#m/D# F#7/E  
E E C#m/E C#m/E  
E E Bmaj7/D# E  

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Root and Tonic**
The progression starts and ends on **E major**, and **E** is the most frequently occurring chord. This strongly suggests that **E is the tonic**.

---

### **Step 2: Examine the Chords in the Context of E Major**
Let’s list the chords and see how they fit into the E major scale:

- **E major** → I (tonic)
- **C#m** → vi (relative minor)
- **G#m** → iii
- **F#7** → V7 (dominant 7th)
- **Bmaj7** → IVmaj7

All these chords are **diatonic to the E major scale**:
- E major scale: **E F# G# A B C# D# E**
- Chords in E major:
  - I: E major
  - ii: F#m
  - iii: G#m
  - IV: A major
  - V: B major
  - vi: C#m
  - vii°: D#dim

So far, all chords fit **E major (Ionian mode)**.

---

### **Step 3: Check for Mode Indicators**
- **No minor tonic**: Not E minor.
- **No raised 4th (Lydian) or lowered 7th (Mixolydian)**: No modal inflections.
- **F#7** is the **V7**, which is characteristic of **major key functional harmony**.
- **Bmaj7** is the **IVmaj7**, also standard in major keys.

---

### **Step 4: Bass Movement**
The bass notes are:
- E → E → E → E  
- E → E → D# → E  
- E → E → E → E  
- E → E → D# → E  

The bass stays mostly on **E**, with occasional **D#** (the leading tone in E major), reinforcing the **E major tonal center**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
This progression is in **E major (Ionian mode)**.  
There are no modal inflections or chromaticisms that would suggest a mode other than Ionian.

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze the chords you provided:

```
E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  G#m/D#  F#7/E  E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  Bmaj7/D#  E
```

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their functions in E major
| Chord | Possible Function in E Major | Notes |
|--------|------------------------------|--------|
| E | I | Tonic |
| C#m/E | vi (first inversion, same bass as tonic) | Relative minor of E major |
| G#m/D# | iii (first inversion) | Mediates between E and C#m |
| F#7/E | V7/V (secondary dominant with tonic in bass, mild tension) | Leads naturally to B or back to E |
| Bmaj7/D# | Vmaj7 (first inversion) | Dominant function, soft resolution tendency |

### Step 2: Bass and harmonic context
- The bass note **E** appears throughout (either as a chord root or slash bass).
- This steady **E pedal tone** strongly reinforces E as the tonal center.
- The chords—C#m, G#m, Bmaj7, F#7—are all **diatonic to E major** (except F#7, which is a common secondary dominant of V).

### Step 3: Mode check
- The harmony reflects the **diatonic collection of E major**: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.
- There’s no use of flattened scale degrees or modal mixture suggesting Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.

✅ **Conclusion:**
- **Key:** E major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major scale)

### Additional nuance
The use of slash chords with E in the bass gives a **pedal-tonic** texture—almost like the harmony moves while the tonal grounding stays fixed on E. But functionally, this is all within **E major (Ionian)**.

First, the user has given me a sequence of chords: E, E, C#m/E, C#m/E, E, E, G#m/D#, F#7/E, E, E, C#m/E, C#m/E, E, E, Bmaj7/D#, E.

I need to determine the key and mode. Key refers to the tonic or home note, and mode refers to whether it's major or minor, or possibly another mode.

Chords are given with slashes, which might indicate inversions or bass notes. For example, C#m/E means a C# minor chord with an E in the bass, so it's an inversion.

To find the key, I should look at the chords and see which notes are emphasized, common progressions, and the overall tonal center.

List out the chords clearly:

- E

- E

- C#m/E (C# minor with E bass)

- C#m/E

- E

- E

- G#m/D# (G# minor with D# bass)

- F#7/E (F#7 with E bass)

- E

- E

- C#m/E

- C#m/E

- E

- E

- Bmaj7/D# (B major 7 with D# bass)

- E

Notice that many chords have E in the bass or are E chords. E appears frequently as the root chord.

Let me extract the root chords without the bass notes for simplicity, as the bass might not change the harmonic function significantly for key determination.

Root chords:

- E (major, I assume, since no specification)

- C#m (C# minor)

- G#m (G# minor)

- F#7 (F# dominant 7)

- Bmaj7 (B major 7)

E is repeated many times, and it starts and ends with E, which might indicate that E is the tonic.

Now, let's think about possible keys.

If E is the tonic, what key could it be?

- E major key: chords would include E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim.

- E minor key: chords would include Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D.

Looking at the chords: we have E (which could be major or minor, but in the sequence, it's likely major since no 'm' is specified, and it's common in chord notation to assume major if not specified), C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7.

In E major:

- E is I

- C#m is vi

- G#m is iii

- F#7 is V7 (dominant 7th)

- Bmaj7 is IVmaj7 (since B is the fourth degree in E major)

In E major, the IV chord is A, not B. E major scale: E F# G# A B C# D# E. So chords:

- I: E

- ii: F#m

- iii: G#m

- IV: A

- V: B

- vi: C#m

- vii: D#dim

But in the sequence, we have Bmaj7, which is B major 7, so in E major, B is V, and V7 would be B7, but here it's Bmaj7, which has a major 7th, not dominant. Bmaj7 in E major would be Vmaj7, but typically V is dominant, so B7 is more common for V7. Bmaj7 might suggest a different function.

Also, we have F#7, which is not in the diatonic chords of E major. In E major, the ii is F#m, not F#7. F#7 is a dominant 7th chord, which could be a secondary dominant.

Similarly, G#m is iii in E major.

But Bmaj7: if in E major, B is V, but V is usually dominant, so B7, not Bmaj7. Bmaj7 has a D# (the major 7th), whereas B7 has D natural (minor 7th). In E major, the seventh note is D#, so for B chord, if it's V, it should be B major with a minor 7th for dominant function, so B7. But Bmaj7 has a major 7th, which is D#.

In E major scale, the notes are E F# G# A B C# D#. So for B chord, the third is D#, fifth is F#, and if it's B7, the seventh should be A, but A is the fourth degree, so B7 would be B D# F# A, but A is not in the E major scale? E major scale has A as fourth, so B D# F# A – A is in the scale, yes. B D# F# A: D# is the third, F# is fifth, A is seventh. In E major, the seventh note is D#, so for B chord, the notes are B, D#, F#, and for B7, it's B, D#, F#, A. A is the fourth degree, so it's diatonic. B7 is V7 in E major.

But in the sequence, it's Bmaj7, which is B, D#, F#, A#? No, Bmaj7 is B major 7th chord: B, D#, F#, A#. A# is not in E major scale; E major has A natural, not A#. So Bmaj7 has A#, which is not diatonic to E major.

Similarly, F#7: F#7 is F# A# C# E? F# dominant 7th: root F#, major third A#, perfect fifth C#, minor seventh E. In E major scale, A# is not present; it has A natural. So F#7 has A#, which is not in E major.

Now, looking at other chords: C#m is vi in E major, which is diatonic. G#m is iii, diatonic. E is I, diatonic.

But F#7 and Bmaj7 are not diatonic to E major.

Perhaps it's in a different key.

Maybe E minor? E minor scale: E F# G A B C D E. Chords: Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D.

But in the sequence, we have E (assumed major), not Em. Also C#m – in E minor, C is natural minor, so C major or C minor? E natural minor has C natural, so chord would be C major, not C#m. C#m has C# and E and G#, but in E minor, G is natural, not G#. So C#m is not in E minor.

Similarly, G#m has G#, not in E minor. F#7 has A#, not in E minor. Bmaj7 has A#, not in E minor.

So probably not E minor.

Perhaps the key is E major, but with some chromaticism or borrowed chords.

But let's list all the root chords: E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7.

E, C#m, G#m are all in E major. F#7 and Bmaj7 are not.

F#7 could be a secondary dominant, perhaps V7 of B, since F#7 is V7 in B major or B minor.

Bmaj7 is a major 7th chord, which might be IV in F# major or something, but let's see the context.

The sequence starts and ends with E, and E is frequent, so likely E is tonic.

Now, F#7: if F#7 is V7 of B, then it resolves to B, but in the sequence, after F#7/E, it goes to E, not directly to B. The sequence is: ... G#m/D# F#7/E E ... so F#7/E to E. F#7/E means F#7 with E bass, so it's an inversion, but harmonically, it might still function as V7 of B, but resolving deceptively or something.

Similarly, Bmaj7/D#: Bmaj7 with D# bass, and then to E.

Bmaj7/D# is essentially Bmaj7 in first inversion, since D# is the third of Bmaj7.

Bmaj7 notes: B, D#, F#, A#. With D# bass, it's first inversion.

Then it goes to E.

In E major, if B is V, it should resolve to E, but Bmaj7 has A#, which is not diatonic, so it might be a different chord.

Perhaps the key is B major? Let's check.

If B is tonic, then in B major: scale B C# D# E F# G# A# B. Chords: I B, ii C#m, iii D#m, IV E, V F#, vi G#m, vii A#dim.

In the sequence, we have E, which could be IV in B major, C#m is ii, G#m is vi, F#7 is V7, Bmaj7 is I maj7.

But the sequence starts and ends with E, not B. It begins with E and ends with E, so E might be the tonic, not B.

In the sequence, E is played many times, and it's the first and last chord, so likely E is home.

Perhaps it's in E mixolydian or something. E mixolydian scale: E F# G# A B C# D E (same as B major scale). Chords in E mixolydian: I E, ii F#m, iii G#dim, IV A, V B, vi C#m, vii Dm.

But in the sequence, we have E (I), C#m (vi), G#m – but in E mixolydian, iii is G#dim, not G#m. G#m has G# B D#, but in E mixolydian, the third degree is G#, but for chord, based on scale, the iii chord would be G# B D, since D is natural in mixolydian? E mixolydian scale: E F# G# A B C# D E. So notes: 1E 2F# 3G# 4A 5B 6C# 7D.

So chords:

- I: E G# B (E major)

- ii: F# A C# (F#m)

- iii: G# B D (G# diminished? G# B D is G# dim)

- IV: A C# E (A major)

- V: B D F# (B minor? B D F# is Bm)

- vi: C# E G# (C# minor? C# E G# is C#m)

- vii: D F# A (D major? D F# A is D major)

In E mixolydian, V is Bm, not B major. But in the sequence, we have Bmaj7, which is B major 7, so B D# F# A#, but in E mixolydian, the fifth degree is B, but the chord should be Bm if diatonic, since the seventh is D natural.

Bmaj7 has D# and A#, while in E mixolydian, the third of B is D natural, and seventh is A natural? Let's clarify.

In E mixolydian, scale degrees: 1E 2F# 3G# 4A 5B 6C# 7D

So for chord on 5: B D F# – B D F# is B minor chord.

But Bmaj7 is B D# F# A#, so it has D# and A#, which are not in the scale; scale has D natural and A natural.

Similarly, F#7: F# A# C# E, but scale has A natural and E, so A# is not present.

So not E mixolydian.

Another idea: perhaps the key is A major or something, but E is frequent.

Let's list the bass notes as well, as they might indicate the root movement.

The chords with slashes: C#m/E means bass is E, so the chord is C#m but bass is E, so it's like an E major with added 6th or something? C#m is C# E G#, so if bass is E, it's E G# C#, which is E major with an added 6th? E major is E G# B, so E G# C# is E6, since C# is the 6th.

Similarly, G#m/D#: G#m is G# B D#, with D# bass, so D# G# B, which is D# diminished? D# G# B is D# dim, but G#m is minor, so G# B D#, with D# bass, it's first inversion of G#m.

G#m chords: root G#, minor third B, perfect fifth D#. So G#m/D# is G#m in first inversion.

Similarly, F#7/E: F#7 is F# A# C# E, with E bass, so E F# A# C#, which is E7#9 or something? E F# A# C# – F# is 9th, A# is #11, C# is 13th, but it's messy. Harmonically, it's F#7 with E in bass, so it might be a passing chord or something.

Bmaj7/D#: Bmaj7 is B D# F# A#, with D# bass, so D# B F# A#, which is D#m7b5 or something? D# F# A# B – F# A# B D# – it's a Bmaj7 in first inversion.

But for key determination, the root chords are important.

Perhaps I should look at the chord functions.

Let me write the sequence with root chords and see the progression.

Sequence: E - E - C#m - C#m - E - E - G#m - F#7 - E - E - C#m - C#m - E - E - Bmaj7 - E

So root chords: E, C#m, G#m, F#7, Bmaj7, and back to E.

Now, E to C#m: in E major, I to vi, common progression.

C#m to E: vi to I.

G#m to F#7: in E major, iii to ? F#7 is not diatonic.

F#7 to E: V7 of B to E, but V7 of B should resolve to B, but it goes to E, so perhaps deceptive resolution or E is tonic.

Then Bmaj7 to E: if B is V, it should resolve to I, but Bmaj7 has A#, which is not the leading tone in E major; in E major, leading tone is D#, which is in B chord if it's V, but Bmaj7 has D# (third) and A# (seventh), while in E major, for V7, it should be B D# F# A (B7), but here it's Bmaj7 with A#, so A# is the major 7th, not minor.

A# in E major would be the augmented fourth if we think in E, but it's not diatonic.

Perhaps the key is B major, and E is IV.

In B major: I B, ii C#m, iii D#m, IV E, V F#, vi G#m, vii A#dim.

In the sequence, we have E (IV), C#m (ii), G#m (vi), F#7 (V7), Bmaj7 (I maj7), and it starts and ends with E, not B. So if it's in B major, it should start and end with B, but it starts and ends with E, so E might be the tonic, or it's a piece that emphasizes IV.

But in many songs, it can start and end on IV, but it's less common.

Perhaps it's in E major with borrowed chords.

Another thought: look at the bass notes. The bass is often E, as in C#m/E, F#7/E, etc., so E is frequently in the bass, reinforcing E as the tonic.

In C#m/E, the bass is E, so it's like an E chord with color.

Similarly, F#7/E has E bass, so it might be functioning as a dominant with suspension or something.

Let's think about the mode. Perhaps it's E major, but with a raised seventh or something.

List all the notes involved in the chords.

First, E chord: E G# B

C#m: C# E G#

G#m: G# B D#

F#7: F# A# C# E

Bmaj7: B D# F# A#

Now, the scale that fits these notes? E, G#, B, C#, E, G# from C#m, G#, B, D# from G#m, F#, A#, C#, E from F#7, B, D#, F#, A# from Bmaj7.

So notes used: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D# 

From E chord: E, G#, B

C#m: C#, E, G# — so E, G#, B, C#

G#m: G#, B, D# — so add D#

F#7: F#, A#, C#, E — so add F#, A# (A# is new)

Bmaj7: B, D#, F#, A# — D# and F# and A# already, B already.

So all notes: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#

That's all seven notes: E F# G# A# B C# D#

What scale is this? E F# G# A# B C# D# E — that's E major scale? E major is E F# G# A B C# D# E, but here it's A# instead of A natural.

E F# G# A# B C# D# — this is E Lydian mode? Lydian has raised fourth. E Lydian scale: E F# G# A# B C# D# E, yes! Exactly.

E Lydian scale: 1E 2F# 3G# #4A# 5B 6C# 7D# 8E

Now, chords in E Lydian:

- I: E G# B (E major)

- ii: F# A# C# (F# major? F# A# C# is F# major)

- iii: G# B D# (G# minor? G# B D# is G# minor? G# B D# – B is minor third from G#? G# to B is minor third, yes, G# minor chord.

G# to B is minor third, B to D# is major third, so G# B D# is G# minor chord, yes.

- IV: A# C# E (A# diminished? A# C# E is A# dim? A# to C# is minor third, C# to E is minor third, so A# dim)

- V: B D# F# (B major? B D# F# is B major)

- vi: C# E G# (C# minor? C# E G# is C# minor)

- vii: D# F# A# (D# minor? D# F# A# – D# to F# is minor third, F# to A# is major third, so D# minor)

In E Lydian:

- I: E major

- ii: F# major (since A# is major third)

- iii: G# minor

- IV: A# diminished

- V: B major

- vi: C# minor

- vii: D# minor

Now, look at the chords in the sequence: E (I), C#m (vi), G#m (iii), F#7 – F#7 is F# A# C# E, which is F# dominant 7th. In E Lydian, the ii chord is F# major, which is F# A# C#, so F#7 would be F# A# C# E, and E is the seventh, which is minor seventh? F#7 has minor seventh, which is E, and in E Lydian, the seventh note is D#, so for F# chord, if it's ii, it should be F# major, but F#7 has E as seventh, which is not in the scale? E Lydian scale has E F# G# A# B C# D# E, so notes are E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#. So for F# chord, the notes are F#, A#, C#, and if it's F#7, it adds E, but E is the tonic, so it's like F#7 has E, which is the root, so it might be a secondary dominant or something.

In the sequence, F#7 is used, and it has E in the bass for F#7/E, so it's emphasizing E.

Similarly, Bmaj7: B D# F# A#, which in E Lydian, V chord is B major, so B D# F#, and Bmaj7 adds A#, which is the #4 of E, so it's diatonic to E Lydian.

Bmaj7 notes: B D# F# A# – all in E Lydian scale: B, D#, F#, A# are all in the scale.

Similarly, F#7: F# A# C# E – F#, A#, C# are in scale, E is in scale, so F#7 is also diatonic to E Lydian? E Lydian has E F# G# A# B C# D#, so notes F#, A#, C#, E are all in the scale. F#7 is F# A# C# E, which is the ii7 chord in E Lydian? In major scale, ii7 is minor 7th, but here in Lydian, ii is F# major, so F# A# C# is F# major, and if we add the seventh, what is the seventh? In Lydian mode, the chords are based on the scale degrees.

For chord on 2: F# A# C# – since A# is major third, it's F# major chord. The seventh note from F# in the scale: F# to what? The scale is E F# G# A# B C# D# E, so from F#, the notes are F# G# A# B C# D# E, so the seventh above F# is E? In chord terms, for a seventh chord, we take root, third, fifth, seventh.

For F# chord in E Lydian: root F#, third is A# (major third), fifth is C# (perfect fifth), seventh is E? The seventh note from F# in the scale is E, which is a major seventh below? Let's think in terms of intervals from root.

In E Lydian scale, the second degree is F#, so the chord built on F# using scale notes: root F#, third: G#? No, for chord, we take every other note.

Scale degrees: 1E 2F# 3G# 4A# 5B 6C# 7D#

So for chord on 2: notes 2,4,6,8? 2F# , 4A# , 6C# , and 8E? 8E is the same as 1E, so notes F#, A#, C#, E.

F# to A# is major third, A# to C# is minor third? A# to C# is major third? A# to C# is two semitones? A# to C is minor third, but A# to C# is major third? Let's calculate intervals.

F# to A#: F# to G is half, G to G# half, G# to A half, A to A# half, so from F# to A# is three semitones? F# to G:1, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, so F# to A# is four semitones? No:

Standard tuning: F# to G: semitone, G to G#: semitone, so F# to G#: two semitones (whole tone), G# to A: semitone, A to A#: semitone, so from F# to A#: F#-G-G#-A-A#, that's four steps? Let's list semitones.

F# to G: 1 semitone

G to G#: 1 semitone (but G# is same as Ab, but in this context, it's G#)

Easier to use note numbers.

Assume E=0, F#=2, G#=4, A#=6, B=7, C#=9, D#=11, E=12.

So scale: 0,2,4,6,7,9,11

Now, chord on F# (2): root 2, third: which third? Major third is +4 semitones, so 2+4=6, which is A#. Fifth: perfect fifth +7 semitones, 2+7=9, C#. Seventh: for major seventh chord, +11 semitones, 2+11=13 mod 12=1, which is F? No, 13-12=1, which is F, but in scale, the seventh note is D#=11, so for chord, the seventh is the note a seventh above, which in scale is E? Let's think diatonically.

In mode, for a seventh chord, we take the root, third, fifth, and seventh degrees of the scale from that root.

For chord on 2 in E Lydian: scale degrees relative to 2: 2(F#), 3(G#), 4(A#), 5(B), 6(C#), 7(D#), 8(E)

So for chord, we take root (2), third (4), fifth (6), and seventh (8)? Seventh is the note a seventh above, which is 8E.

Interval from F# to E: F# to G#: major second, G# to A#: major second, A# to B: minor second, B to C#: major second, C# to D#: major second, D# to E: minor second, so from F# to E is a minor seventh? F# to E is down a whole step, so minor seventh.

Yes, F# to E is minor seventh interval.

So chord on 2: F# A# C# E — F# to A# is major third, A# to C# is minor third? A# to C#: A# to B is semitone, B to C is semitone, B to C# is whole tone? A# to C: minor third, A# to C#: major third? Let's calculate semitones.

A# to C: A# to B:1, B to C:1, so 2 semitones, minor third.

A# to C#: A# to B:1, B to C:1, C to C#:1, so 3 semitones? A# to B is one semitone (since B is natural), B to C is one semitone, C to C# is one semitone, so from A# to C# is three semitones, which is minor third? No, three semitones is minor third? C to Eb is minor third, three semitones. But A# to C#: A# is same as Bb, so Bb to C# is augmented second, but in equal temperament, it's three semitones, same as minor third.

In terms of chord quality, F# A# C# E: F# to A# is four semitones? F# to G:1, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, so four semitones, which is major third.

A# to C#: A# to B:1, B to C:2, C to C#:3, so three semitones, which is minor third.

So F# A# C# is F# major chord (major third and perfect fifth).

Then adding E: F# to E is ten semitones? F# to E: F# to G:1, G to G#:2, G# to A:3, A to A#:4, A# to B:5, B to C:6, C to C#:7, C# to D:8, D to D#:9, D# to E:10, so ten semitones, which is minor seventh (since major seventh is 11 semitones).

So F# A# C# E is F# dominant 7th chord, which is exactly F#7.

And in E Lydian, the ii chord is F# major, but with seventh, it's F#7, which is a dominant 7th chord, but in modal harmony, it's fine.

Similarly, for B chord: in E Lydian, V chord is B major: B D# F#. Bmaj7 adds A#, which is the major seventh, so B D# F# A# is B major 7th chord.

And in E Lydian, the V chord is B major, so Bmaj7 is diatonic.

Now, other chords: C#m is vi, G#m is iii, E is I.

So all chords are diatonic to E Lydian mode.

In the sequence, we have C#m/E, which is C#m with E bass, so in first inversion, but root is still C#m.

Similarly, others.

So the key is E, and the mode is Lydian.

Therefore, key: E, mode: Lydian.

To confirm, the scale is E F# G# A# B C# D# E, which matches all chords.

So for the user's query, I should say the key is E Lydian.

In terms of key and mode, often we say the key is E major, but mode is Lydian, meaning it's E Lydian, so tonic is E, and mode is Lydian.

In music theory, key can be specified with mode, e.g., E Lydian.

So I think that's it.

Based on the chord progression provided:

- **E** (I)
- **C#m/E** (vi in first inversion)
- **G#m/D#** (iii in first inversion)
- **F#7/E** (ii7 in first inversion, functioning as a dominant chord)
- **Bmaj7/D#** (Vmaj7 in first inversion)

The chords are all diatonic to the **E Lydian** mode. The E Lydian scale is: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#. This is consistent with the raised fourth (A#) present in chords like F#7 and Bmaj7, and the overall tonal center emphasizes E as the tonic.

**Key and Mode:** E Lydian (tonic: E, mode: Lydian).

This mode gives the progression its characteristic sound, with the raised fourth (A#) creating a bright, open quality compared to E major.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.  

The chord progression you gave is:  

**E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  G#m/D#  F#7/E  E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  Bmaj7/D#  E**

---

### 1. Identify the root chords (ignoring bass notes for now)
- **E** major  
- **C#m** (C♯ minor)  
- **G#m** (G♯ minor)  
- **F#7** (F♯ dominant 7)  
- **Bmaj7** (B major 7)  

---

### 2. Look for tonal center
The progression starts and ends on **E**, and E appears frequently.  
The chords **C#m**, **G#m**, **F#7**, and **B** are all diatonic to the key of **E major**:

E major scale: E F♯ G♯ A B C♯ D♯  
Chords in E major:  
- E (I)  
- F♯m (ii) — but here we have F♯7 (V7/V function)  
- G♯m (iii)  
- A (IV) — not present  
- B (V)  
- C♯m (vi)  
- D♯dim (vii°) — not present  

F♯7 is not diatonic to E major — it’s the **V7 of B**, which is the V chord in E major (secondary dominant).  

---

### 3. Check for E minor possibility
E minor scale: E F♯ G A B C D  
Chords in E natural minor:  
- Em (i) — but we have E major, not minor  
- F♯dim (ii°) — not present  
- G (III) — not present  
- Am (iv) — not present  
- Bm (v) — but we have B major (V)  
- C (VI) — not present  
- D (VII) — not present  

The presence of **G♯** (in G♯m) and **D♯** (in Bmaj7) means we’re not in E natural minor.  
Also, E major as tonic and V (B) major instead of B minor suggests **E major**, not minor.

---

### 4. Secondary dominant analysis
F♯7 → B is V7/V → V in E major.  
This is a common progression in major keys.

---

### 5. Bass movement
Many chords have alternate bass notes:  
- C#m/E = C♯m with E bass → still functions as vi chord but with E pedal  
- G#m/D♯ = iii chord with D♯ bass (D♯ is the 7th of E major scale)  
- Bmaj7/D♯ = V chord with D♯ bass (D♯ is leading tone to E)  

The bass often returns to E, reinforcing E as the tonic.

---

### 6. Conclusion
The key is **E major** (Ionian mode).  
The mode is **major** (not minor or other mode), because:
- Tonic chord is E major  
- Diatonic chords except for the secondary dominant F♯7  
- Leading tone D♯ is present in the scale (Bmaj7/D♯)  
- No Aeolian or Dorian flat notes (G♯ not G natural, etc.)

**Final answer:**  
**Key: E**  
**Mode: Major**

### Reasoning

1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user has provided a sequence of chords: `E E C#m/E C#m/E E E G#m/D# F#7/E E E C#m/E C#m/E E E Bmaj7/D# E`. They want to know the key and mode.

2.  **Initial Triage & Simplification:**
    *   The chords are repeated a lot. Let's list the unique chords:
        *   E (or E major)
        *   C#m/E
        *   G#m/D#
        *   F#7/E
        *   Bmaj7/D#
    *   The slash chords are important. What do they mean?
        *   `C#m/E`: This is a C# minor triad (C# - E - G#) with an E in the bass. The notes are E, G#, C#. This is an inversion of the C# minor chord, specifically the first inversion.
        *   `G#m/D#`: This is a G# minor triad (G# - B - D#) with a D# in the bass. The notes are D#, G#, B. This is also the first inversion of G# minor.
        *   `F#7/E`: This is an F# dominant 7th chord (F# - A# - C# - E) with an E in the bass. The notes are E, F#, A#, C#. The E is not part of the core F#7 chord, so this is a slash chord, not just a simple inversion. It creates a specific sonority and voice-leading effect.
        *   `Bmaj7/D#`: This is a B major 7th chord (B - D# - F# - A#) with a D# in the bass. The notes are D#, F#, A#, B. This is the third inversion of the Bmaj7 chord.

3.  **Identify the Tonal Center:**
    *   The chord `E` appears most frequently. It starts the progression and ends it. This is a very strong indicator that E is the tonic, or the "home" chord.
    *   The bass note `E` is also very prominent. Let's look at the bass notes of each chord:
        *   E -> E
        *   C#m/E -> E
        *   E -> E
        *   G#m/D# -> D#
        *   F#7/E -> E
        *   E -> E
        *   C#m/E -> E
        *   E -> E
        *   Bmaj7/D# -> D#
        *   E -> E
    *   The bassline is heavily centered on E, with occasional moves to D#. This reinforces the idea of E as the tonal center.

4.  **Hypothesize a Key:** Based on the strong emphasis on E, the most likely key is E major or E minor.

5.  **Test the E Major Hypothesis:**
    *   The key of E major has four sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#. The scale is E - F# - G# - A - B - C# - D#.
    *   Let's analyze the chords in the context of E major:
        *   **E:** The I chord (tonic). Perfect. This is our home base.
        *   **C#m/E:** This is the vi chord (C#m) in first inversion. In E major, C#m is the vi chord (C# - E - G#). The notes fit perfectly. The function is the submediant.
        *   **G#m/D#:** This is the iii chord (G#m) in first inversion. In E major, G#m is the iii chord (G# - B - D#). The notes fit perfectly. The function is the mediant.
        *   **F#7/E:** This is the most interesting one.
            *   The F#7 chord itself is the V7/V (the dominant of the dominant). The dominant of E is B7. The dominant of B is F#7. So F#7 naturally leads to B.
            *   However, the bass note is E. This is not a standard diatonic function. Let's look at the notes: E, F#, A#, C#.
            *   The E is the tonic. The F# and C# are diatonic. The A# is the only non-diatonic note (the raised 4th degree in E major).
            *   An F#7 chord with an E in the bass is often used as a *backdoor dominant* or a *plagal dominant* type of sound, but it's more complex. Let's re-examine. F#7 is V/V. Resolving it to the I chord (E) by keeping the bass note static (E) creates a specific type of cadence, sometimes called a "cadential 6/4" type feel, but not exactly. It's a common device in rock and pop. The F#7 wants to resolve to B, but instead, it resolves to E while the bass stays put. This is a very strong confirmation of E as the tonic. It's a chromatic chord that reinforces the tonic.
        *   **Bmaj7/D#:** Bmaj7 is the IV chord in E major (B - D# - F# - A#). All notes are diatonic. The D# in the bass is the third of the chord. This is a standard IV chord, often called the subdominant.

6.  **Test the E Minor Hypothesis:**
    *   The key of E natural minor has one sharp: F#. The scale is E - F# - G - A - B - C - D.
    *   Let's analyze the chords:
        *   **E:** The i chord. Okay.
        *   **C#m/E:** Contains a C# and a G#. These are not in E natural minor. This chord is not diatonic to E natural minor.
        *   **G#m/D#:** Contains G# and D#. Not diatonic.
        *   **F#7/E:** Contains A# and C#. Not diatonic.
        *   **Bmaj7/D#:** Contains D# and A#. Not diatonic.
    *   Conclusion: The progression is definitely not in E minor.

7.  **Consider Other Keys/Modes:**
    *   Could it be A major? The chords would be I (A), V (E), ii (Bm), vi (F#m). The progression is centered on E, not A. E is the V chord in A major, and it feels like the tonic here.
    *   Could it be B major? The chords would be IV (E), vi (G#m), ii (C#m). This is a possibility. The progression would be IV - vi - IV - V/V - I (in B) ??? No, the progression starts and ends on E. If it were in B, the progression would be `IV - vi - IV - V/V - I - vi - IV - I`. This is a plausible progression, but it feels less likely. The overwhelming emphasis on E makes it the stronger candidate for the tonic. The `F#7/E` chord is also a huge clue. In the key of B, F#7 is the V chord. An F#7/E would be a V/IV (secondary dominant leading to the IV chord, which is E). This is also plausible. Let's re-evaluate the `F#7/E` to Bmaj7/D# resolution. F#7 -> Bmaj7. This is a perfect V -> I resolution *in the key of B major*. The bass notes are E -> D#. This is a descending bassline.
    *   Let's map the whole thing in B major:
        *   E (IV)
        *   C#m/E (ii/IV) - a ii chord in first inversion with a pedal point E (the 4th degree of B). This is a bit unusual but possible.
        *   E (IV)
        *   G#m/D# (vi/iii) - a vi chord in first inversion with a pedal point D# (the 3rd degree of B).
        *   F#7/E (V/IV) - a secondary dominant resolving to the IV chord (E). The E in the bass is the target chord's root.
        *   E (IV)
        *   C#m/E (ii/IV)
        *   E (IV)
        *   Bmaj7/D# (I) - The I chord in third inversion.
        *   E (IV)
    *   So, in B major, the progression is: `IV - ii/IV - IV - vi/iii - V/IV - IV - ii/IV - IV - I - IV`. This is *extremely* convoluted. The relationship to B as a tonic is weak, only appearing at the very end. The overwhelming feeling is "E".

8.  **Revisiting the E Major Hypothesis and Mode:**
    *   We've established E major is the most likely key. Let's look at the chord functions again:
        *   `E`: I (tonic)
        *   `C#m/E`: vi (submediant)
        *   `G#m/D#`: iii (mediant)
        *   `F#7/E`: V/V (secondary dominant) with a pedal point on the tonic (E). This is a very strong confirmation of the tonic.
        *   `Bmaj7/D#`: IV (subdominant)
    *   The progression is: `I - vi - I - iii - V/V (over I) - I - vi - I - IV - I`. This is a very logical and common-sounding progression in modern music. It heavily emphasizes the tonic (I) chord and uses common diatonic and chromatic chords.
    *   Is it a *mode*? The chords are derived from the E major scale (with one chromatic alteration, A# in F#7 and Bmaj7). The F#7 is a secondary dominant, which is a concept from functional harmony (major/minor key system), not modal harmony.
    *   Modal harmony typically avoids secondary dominants and strong V-I cadences because they pull the ear back to the parent major key. This progression, with its strong I chord and the V/V chord pulling towards a B (which is the V of E), is firmly rooted in functional harmony, not modal.
    *   Therefore, the key is **E Major**.

9.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: The key is E Major.
    *   Explain the reasoning step-by-step.
    *   **Step 1: Identify the Tonic.** Point out that the E chord is the most frequent, starts and ends the phrase, and is used as a pedal point in the bass. This establishes E as the tonal center.
    *   **Step 2: Analyze the Chords against the E Major Scale.**
        *   List the notes of the E major scale (E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#).
        *   Go through each unique chord and show how its notes fit within the E major framework.
        *   `E` = I chord (Tonic).
        *   `C#m/E` = vi chord (Submediant). Explain it's just an inversion.
        *   `G#m/D#` = iii chord (Mediant). Explain it's an inversion.
        *   `Bmaj7/D#` = IV chord (Subdominant). Explain it's an inversion.
    *   **Step 3: Address the "Tricky" Chord.** The `F#7/E` is the most important piece of evidence.
        *   Explain that F#7 is the "dominant of the dominant" (V/V or V7/V). In the key of E, the dominant is B7. The dominant of B is F#7.
        *   Explain its function: It creates tension that wants to resolve to B (the V chord). However, by placing the tonic note (E) in the bass, it resolves *deceptively* back to the tonic, creating a strong sense of "home." This is a common and powerful technique in rock, pop, and jazz.
    *   **Step 4: Rule out other possibilities.** Briefly explain why it's not E minor (due to C#, G#, D#, A#) and why it's unlikely to be another key like A or B (the functional pull is towards E, not those other chords).
    *   **Step 5: Conclude on Mode.** Explain that because the progression uses functional harmony concepts like secondary dominants (V/V) and a strong tonic, it is in the traditional major key system, not a mode. A modal piece would avoid these strong functional pulls.
    *   **Final Summary:** Restate the conclusion clearly: The progression is in the key of E Major. Provide a chord-by-chord functional analysis as a final, clear summary. This adds a professional touch and solidifies the explanation.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **E Major**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. Identifying the Tonic (The "Home" Chord)

The strongest indicator of a key is its tonic chord. In this progression, the **E major chord** is overwhelmingly present:

*   It appears most frequently.
*   It starts and ends the sequence.
*   The bass note **E** is used as a pedal point (a sustained bass note under changing harmonies) in three of the five unique chord types (`E`, `C#m/E`, `F#7/E`).

This constant reinforcement of E strongly suggests it is the tonal center.

### 2. Analyzing the Chords in the Context of E Major

The key of E Major has four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#). Let's see how each chord fits into this key.

*   **E**: This is the **I chord** (the tonic) in E Major. **(E - G# - B)**
*   **C#m/E**: This is a C# minor chord with an E in the bass. C# minor is the **vi chord** in E Major. The slash just means it's in the first inversion. **(E - G# - C#)**. All notes are diatonic (belong to the scale).
*   **G#m/D#**: This is a G# minor chord with a D# in the bass. G# minor is the **iii chord** in E Major. This is also in first inversion. **(D# - G# - B)**. All notes are diatonic.
*   **Bmaj7/D#**: This is a B major 7th chord with a D# in the bass. Bmaj7 is the **IV chord** (the subdominant) in E Major. **(D# - F# - A# - B)**. All notes are diatonic.

### 3. The Crucial Chromatic Chord: F#7/E

This chord is the most complex but ultimately confirms the key of E Major.

*   **F#7** is the **dominant of the dominant** (written as **V/V** or "five of five"). In the key of E, the dominant chord is B7. The chord that leads to B7 is F#7.
*   By playing F#7 over an **E bass note**, you create a powerful tension. The F#7 chord wants to resolve to B, but the bass is already sitting on the tonic, E. When the progression resolves back to the E chord, it creates a strong, satisfying confirmation of E as the "home" key. This is a very common device in modern rock, pop, and film music.

### 4. Why It's Not a Mode

While the chords are all derived from the E major scale (with one chromatic note, A#, which is part of the V/V and IV chords), the harmony is **functional**, not modal.

*   **Modal harmony** typically avoids strong functional pulls like V7/V chords. Its goal is to establish a "flavor" or mood, not to create a strong tonic-dominant tension and resolution.
*   This progression is built on functional harmony: it heavily emphasizes the tonic (I), uses the subdominant (IV), and employs a secondary dominant (V/V) to create tension before resolving back to the tonic. This is the hallmark of traditional major/minor key music.

### Summary of Chord Functions in E Major

*   **E**: **I** (Tonic)
*   **C#m/E**: **vi** (Submediant, 1st inversion)
*   **G#m/D#**: **iii** (Mediant, 1st inversion)
*   **F#7/E**: **V/V** (Secondary Dominant) with a tonic pedal
*   **Bmaj7/D#**: **IV** (Subdominant, 3rd inversion)

**Conclusion:** The progression is firmly in the key of **E Major**.
