Let's analyze the chords you provided:

```
E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  G#m/D#  F#7/E  E  E  C#m/E  C#m/E  E  E  Bmaj7/D#  E
```

### Step 1: Identify the chords and their functions in E major
| Chord | Possible Function in E Major | Notes |
|--------|------------------------------|--------|
| E | I | Tonic |
| C#m/E | vi (first inversion, same bass as tonic) | Relative minor of E major |
| G#m/D# | iii (first inversion) | Mediates between E and C#m |
| F#7/E | V7/V (secondary dominant with tonic in bass, mild tension) | Leads naturally to B or back to E |
| Bmaj7/D# | Vmaj7 (first inversion) | Dominant function, soft resolution tendency |

### Step 2: Bass and harmonic context
- The bass note **E** appears throughout (either as a chord root or slash bass).
- This steady **E pedal tone** strongly reinforces E as the tonal center.
- The chords—C#m, G#m, Bmaj7, F#7—are all **diatonic to E major** (except F#7, which is a common secondary dominant of V).

### Step 3: Mode check
- The harmony reflects the **diatonic collection of E major**: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#.
- There’s no use of flattened scale degrees or modal mixture suggesting Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.

✅ **Conclusion:**
- **Key:** E major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major scale)

### Additional nuance
The use of slash chords with E in the bass gives a **pedal-tonic** texture—almost like the harmony moves while the tonal grounding stays fixed on E. But functionally, this is all within **E major (Ionian)**.
