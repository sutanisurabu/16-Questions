To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**  
E – E – C#m/E – C#m/E – E – E – G#m/D# – F#7/E – E – E – C#m/E – C#m/E – E – E – Bmaj7/D# – E

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonic (home chord)
The progression starts and ends on **E major**, and **E** appears very frequently—this strongly suggests **E** is the tonic.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the chords in relation to E major

**Key of E major has the following diatonic chords:**
- E (I)
- F#m (ii)
- G#m (iii)
- A (IV)
- B (V)
- C#m (vi)
- D#dim (vii°)

Now compare the chords used:
- **E** = I → ✅ diatonic  
- **C#m/E** = vi (with E in the bass) → ✅ diatonic  
- **G#m/D#** = iii chord (G#m) with D# in the bass → D# is the 5th of G#m, so it’s a standard inversion; G#m is diatonic → ✅  
- **F#7/E** = F#7 (ii7) with E in the bass → F#7 is **not** diatonic to E major. In E major, the ii chord is **F#m**, not F#7. F#7 implies a **dominant 7th**, which includes **A#** (the major 3rd) and **E** (the minor 7th). So F#7 = F#–A#–C#–E. The **A#** is **not** in E major (E major has A natural).  
- **Bmaj7/D#** = Bmaj7 (Vmaj7) with D# in the bass → Bmaj7 = B–D#–F#–A#. Again, **A#** appears here. In E major, the V chord is **B major** (B–D#–F#), and Bmaj7 would include **A#**, which is **not** in the E major scale (E major has A natural). So Bmaj7 is **not diatonic** to E major.

So we have **two chords containing A#**:  
- F#7 (contains A#)  
- Bmaj7 (contains A#)

The presence of **A#** suggests the use of **E major’s dominant key (B major)** or possible modal/tonal mixture.

### Step 3: Consider E Lydian?

E Lydian mode = E–F#–G#–A#–B–C#–D#

This scale includes **A#**, which matches the A# found in F#7 and Bmaj7.

Let’s check if all chords fit **E Lydian**:

- E = I → ✅ (E major)
- C#m = vi → C#–E–G# → all in E Lydian → ✅
- G#m = iii → G#–B–D# → ✅ (all in E Lydian)
- F#7 = II7 → F#–A#–C#–E → all notes in E Lydian → ✅
- Bmaj7 = Vmaj7 → B–D#–F#–A# → all in E Lydian → ✅

So **all chords are diatonic to E Lydian**!

In E major (Ionian), the IV chord is A major. But in this progression, there's **no A major or A natural at all**—instead, we see **A#** consistently, which is the **#4** of E, the hallmark of **Lydian mode**.

Also, the repeated use of **F#7** (II7) and **Bmaj7** (Vmaj7) supports Lydian, where the II chord is major or dominant (because of the #4), and the V chord can be maj7 due to the raised 4th.

---

### Step 4: Confirm mode

- Tonic: E  
- Scale degrees used: E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#  
- This is **E Lydian** (1 2 3 #4 5 6 7)

No chords contradict this, and the characteristic #4 (A#) appears in two important chords.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: E  
Mode: Lydian**
