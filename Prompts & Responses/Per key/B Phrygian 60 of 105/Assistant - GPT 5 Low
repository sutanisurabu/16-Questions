### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I'm exploring chords in B Phrygian, where flat VII (A-C-E) is an A minor chord. Adding F# gives me Am6, which fits since F# is the fifth scale degree. Now, let's consider G major: C/B becomes a passing dominant to Em, acting as C major over a B bass, leading to Bm. In this context, C - C/B - Bm is stepwise bass movement. The repeated Bm positions suggest that B acts as the tonal center. Alternatively, I'm thinking about a B minor key with borrowed bII and bVI.**Verifying B Phrygian mode**

I'm noticing that C natural appears twice, which means G major serves as the VI, fitting both Aeolian and Phrygian modes. D/A is the III, and Am6 also includes C natural, suggesting some modal mixture. I think B Phrygian is the right choice. Notably, flat 2 in Phrygian means I can use C major instead. I checked for violations in B Phrygian and confirmed that all my notes—B, D, F#, G, A, C, E—fit perfectly within this scale. So yes, it's definitely B Phrygian.**Identifying B Phrygian**

Starting with the G major scale (G A B C D E F#), when I reorder it from B, I get the B Phrygian scale: B C D E F# G A. The key signature shows one sharp (F#), confirming that B Phrygian is the mode relative to G major, with the key center being B. To provide some context, the diatonic chords include Bm (i), Am6 (bVII add6), and C/B (bII), highlighting traditional Phrygian characteristics. So, my final answer is: "B Phrygian centered on B, using G major's pitch collection."**Finalizing B Phrygian explanation**

The rationale here is straightforward: all chords come from the G major scale, and the presence of C natural in C/B and Am6 indicates the Phrygian b2. The progression resolves on Bm, which confirms the key center. The answer to "Determine key and mode?" is simply "B Phrygian," derived from G major (which has one sharp). 

So, I’ll summarize: 
- Tonal center: B
- Mode: Phrygian (B Phrygian from G major).

Optionally, I can mention chord functions like Bm = i, G/B = VI6, and D/A = III6/5. But I’ll keep it concise for clarity.

B Phrygian (mode on B from the G major parent scale).

Reason: The pitch collection is G major (G A B C D E F#), centered on B. The C-natural sonorities (C/B and Am6 = A–C–E–F#) give the characteristic Phrygian b2 color, while Bm is the tonic.
