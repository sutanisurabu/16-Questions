Based on the provided chord progression:

$Bm \quad Bm \quad G/B \quad G/B \quad Bm \quad Bm \quad D/A \quad C/B$
$Bm \quad Bm \quad G/B \quad G/B \quad Bm \quad Bm \quad Am6 \quad Bm$

Let's analyze the chords:
* **Bm:** The tonic chord and the starting/ending chord. This strongly suggests B is the tonal center.
* **G:** A major chord. In the key of B minor, G is the $\flat$VI chord (or VI in the natural minor/Aeolian scale).
* **D:** A major chord. In the key of B minor, D is the $\flat$III chord (or III in the natural minor/Aeolian scale).
* **C:** A major chord. In the key of B minor, C is the $\flat$II chord. This characteristic is very typical of the Phrygian mode.
* **Am6:** This chord contains the notes A, C, E, and F\# (since it's typically spelled $A-C-E-F\#$ or $A-C-E-F\natural$ could suggest $\flat$VI or $VI\natural$, but Am is usually the $\text{VII}$ chord in the harmonic minor and $\text{VI}$ chord in the melodic minor). The chord $Am$ itself is the diatonic $\text{vii}$ chord in the B Aeolian/natural minor scale.

If we combine the roots of the diatonic chords present (B, G, D, C, A), and assume B is the tonic, the scale degrees are:
$$1 - \flat 3 - 4 - 5 - \flat 6 - \flat 7$$
The presence of the **C major chord ($\flat$II)** is the most distinguishing feature here.

### Analysis of Possible Keys/Modes with Tonic B:

1. **B Natural Minor (Aeolian):**
   * Scale: B - C\# - D - E - F\# - G - A
   * Diatonic chords: **Bm** (i), C\#dim ($\text{ii}^\circ$), **D** ($\flat$III), Em (iv), **F\#m** (v), **G** ($\flat$VI), **A** ($\flat$VII).
   * **Problem:** The chord **C major** ($\flat$II) is not diatonic to B Aeolian. The $\text{ii}^\circ$ chord is $C\# \text{dim}$.

2. **B Harmonic Minor:**
   * Scale: B - C\# - D - E - F\# - G - A\#
   * Diatonic chords: **Bm** (i), C\#dim ($\text{ii}^\circ$), $\text{D augmented}$ ($\flat III+$), Em (iv), **F\#** (V), **G** ($\flat$VI), $\text{A\# dim}$ ($\text{vii}^\circ$).
   * **Problem:** The chord **C major** ($\flat$II) and **A major/minor** ($\flat$VII or $\text{vii}^\circ$) are not used consistently (we see G and D, which are diatonic, but the C contradicts this).

3. **B Phrygian Mode:**
   * Scale: B - C - D - E - F\# - G - A
   * Intervals: 1 - $\flat 2$ - $\flat 3$ - 4 - 5 - $\flat 6$ - $\flat 7$
   * Diatonic chords:
     * **Bdim** ($\text{i}^\circ$) - *However, it is very common and accepted in minor modal music to use the minor triad (Bm) as the tonic, borrowing the $\text{ii}$ and $\text{iii}$ chords from the corresponding scale (Phrygian)*.
     * **C** ($\flat \text{II}$) - **Matches the chord C.**
     * **Dm** ($\flat \text{III}$) - *The progression uses D major ($\flat \text{III}$)*, which is a common modal alteration (though Dm is diatonic).
     * **Em** (iv)
     * **F\#dim** ($\text{v}^\circ$)
     * **G** ($\flat \text{VI}$) - **Matches the chord G.**
     * **Am** ($\flat \text{VII}$) - **Matches the root of Am6.**

The defining characteristics of the progression are:
* Tonic: **Bm**
* $\flat$VI: **G**
* $\flat$II: **C**

The presence of the $\flat$II chord (C major) alongside a minor tonic (Bm) and a $\flat$VI (G major) is the signature sound of the **Phrygian mode**.

### Conclusion

**Key:** **B**
**Mode:** **Phrygian** (B Phrygian)

*Note on D major ($\flat$III) and B minor (i):* While B Phrygian diatonic chords are $B \text{ dim}$ and $D \text{ minor}$, the substitution of $B \text{ dim}$ for $B \text{ minor}$ and $D \text{ minor}$ for $D \text{ major}$ (often used as a substitute for $\flat \text{III}$) is extremely common in popular, rock, and metal music when utilizing the Phrygian mode. The overwhelming evidence provided by the $\flat \text{II}$ chord (C) confirms B Phrygian.
