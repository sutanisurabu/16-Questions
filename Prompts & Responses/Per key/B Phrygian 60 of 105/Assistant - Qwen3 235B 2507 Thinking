### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given a chord progression: "Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm". They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to understand the chords. Some of them have slashes, like G/B and D/A. Those are slash chords, meaning the bass note is different. For G/B, G major with B in the bass. Similarly, D/A is D major with A in the bass, and C/B is C major with B in the bass. Then there's Am6, which is A minor with an added sixth (F#). 

I should list all the unique chords. So Bm appears a lot, then G/B which is essentially G major, D/A is D major, C/B is C major, and Am6. So the chords are Bm, G, D, C, Am6. Now, I need to figure out what key these chords come from.

Bm is the tonic if we're in B minor. Let me check the natural minor scale for B. B natural minor has notes B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. The chords built on each degree would be: i Bm, ii° C#dim, III D, iv Em, v F#m, VI G, VII A. 

Looking at the progression, we have Bm (i), G (which is VI in B minor), D (III), C? Wait, C isn't in B natural minor. B natural minor has C#, not C. So C major would be a flat VII if we're in B minor. But flat VII isn't in the natural minor scale. Maybe it's the harmonic or melodic minor? 

B harmonic minor has A# instead of A natural, so the chords would be different. B harmonic minor scale: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A#. The v chord would be F# major, not minor. But in the progression, we have C major, which isn't in harmonic minor either. 

Wait, D/A is D major with A bass. A is the fifth of D, so that's just D major. C/B is C major with B bass, so the chord is still C major. Am6: A minor with F#, which is the 6th. In A natural minor, the 6th is F, not F#. So Am6 would have F# instead of F natural. That suggests it's from the harmonic minor scale. 

Am6 is often associated with A harmonic minor, where the raised 7th (G#) isn't directly affecting the 6th, but the 6th can be raised in melodic minor. Wait, in A harmonic minor, the notes are A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. The 6th is F natural. But Am6 requires F#, which is the major sixth. So Am6 implies F#, which is the 6th in A major, but it's minor. So Am6 is the i chord in A melodic minor ascending? A melodic minor ascending is A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#. So the i chord would be Am(maj7), but Am6 is Am with added 6th (F#), so that fits A melodic minor. 

But the progression starts with Bm. So maybe the key is B. Let me list all the chords with their notes.

Bm: B, D, F#
G/B: B, G, B, D (since G major is G, B, D, and bass is B)
D/A: A, D, F#, A (D major: D, F#, A; bass A)
C/B: B, C, E, G (C major: C, E, G; bass B)
Am6: A, C, E, F# (A minor is A, C, E; 6th is F#)

Now, compiling all unique notes from these chords:

Bm: B, D, F#
G/B: G, B, D
D/A: D, F#, A
C/B: C, E, G, B
Am6: A, C, E, F#

So all notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. 

Wait, that's the B Dorian mode. Let's check. B Dorian: B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A? No, that's not right. 

Standard Dorian mode is built on the second degree of the major scale. So for B Dorian, it would be the key of A major. A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. So B Dorian would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. But in our notes, we have C natural, not C#, and G natural, not G#. 

Wait, our notes include C natural and G natural. So the notes are A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. That's the G major scale starting from B? G major is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So the notes B, C, D, E, F#, G, A — that's exactly the G major scale starting on B. So that's B Dorian, which is the second mode of A major? Wait no.

Modes: Dorian is the second mode. So if the key is A major, the modes are:
I: A Ionian
II: B Dorian
III: C# Phrygian
etc.

A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. But our notes have C natural and G natural, not C# and G#. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, the notes we have are A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Let's see which major scale has those notes. The F# is there, but no G#. So if the scale is G major: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. Yes! G major scale is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So the notes we have are all within G major: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Exactly the G major scale.

But the progression starts with Bm. In G major, Bm is the iii chord. But in the progression, Bm is the tonic, as it's repeated many times. So if the tonal center is B, but the notes are from G major, that would make B the tonic of the Dorian mode. 

B Dorian mode: since Dorian is the second mode, B Dorian would be based on A major? Wait no. Let's clarify:

The Dorian mode starts on the second note of the major scale. So if we take G major (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#), the second mode is A Dorian: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. But we need B as the tonic. So what major scale has B as its second degree? That would be A major. Because in A major (A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#), the second degree is B, so B Dorian would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. But our progression has C natural and G natural, not C# and G#. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's the key of D major? D major: D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#. But we have C natural, not C#. Not matching.

Wait, the notes we have: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. That's exactly the G major scale. G major has F# and C natural. Yes, G major: G A B C D E F#. So the notes present are all in G major. 

But the chord progression is centered around Bm. In G major, the chords are:

I: G
ii: Am
iii: Bm
IV: C
V: D
vi: Em
vii°: F#dim

So Bm is the iii chord in G major. But the progression starts and ends on Bm, and it's heavily emphasized. So maybe it's in B Dorian, which is the second mode of A major? Wait, no—B Dorian should be from A major, but A major has C# and G#, which we don't have here.

Wait, if the notes are from G major, then B is the third degree. So the iii chord in G major is Bm. But B Dorian would require the minor scale with a raised sixth. Wait, Dorian mode has a minor third and major sixth. In B Dorian, the notes would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. But we have C natural and G natural, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's B Aeolian (natural minor). B natural minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. But in our progression, we have G major chord (G, B, D), which is fine because G is the VI chord in B minor. But we also have D major (D, F#, A), which is the III chord. And C major (C, E, G), which would be the VII chord in B natural minor? Wait, B natural minor has A as the seventh note, so the VII chord should be A major. But here we have C major. C major in B minor would require a flattened second? Not standard.

Wait, let's list the chords again with possible scales.

The presence of Am6 is interesting. Am6 has F#, which in A minor would be the raised sixth for melodic minor. But A natural minor has F natural, so Am6 (with F#) suggests A melodic minor or harmonic minor variants.

But the progression starts on Bm. Maybe it's in B, but with some chromatic chords.

Another approach: identify the tonic. The progression starts and ends on Bm, and it's repeated often, so Bm is likely the tonic chord. So we're probably in a key where Bm is the i chord.

So possible keys where Bm is tonic: B natural minor, B harmonic minor, B melodic minor.

B natural minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. Chords: i Bm, ii° C#dim, III D, iv Em, v F#m, VI G, VII A.

Look at the progression: G/B (which is G major, so VI), D/A is D major (III), C/B is C major—wait, C natural isn't in B natural minor; it should be C#. So C major would be a bII chord? But that's unusual. And Am6: A minor with F#. In B natural minor, the A chord is VII, which is A major (since the seventh note is A natural in the scale? Wait no—in B natural minor scale, the notes are B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. So the A chord would be A major? Wait, the seventh degree in natural minor is minor? Let's build the VII chord: A, C#, E? No.

Wait, scale degrees for B natural minor:
1: B
2: C#
3: D
4: E
5: F#
6: G
7: A

So triads:
i: B D F# → Bm
ii°: C# E G → C#dim
III: D F# A → D
iv: E G B → Em
v: F# A C# → F#m
VI: G B D → G
VII: A C# E → A major? Wait, A C# E is A major. But in natural minor, the VII chord is major because the 7th scale degree is a whole step below tonic.

But in the progression, we have C major (C, E, G). C natural isn't in B natural minor; it should be C#. So C major would imply a C natural, which is a flattened second (bII) in B minor. But bII is not diatonic; it's a borrowed chord.

Also, Am6: A minor with F#. A minor in B natural minor would be the VII chord, but in natural minor, the VII chord is A major (A, C#, E). To have A minor, we'd need C natural instead of C#, so A, C, E. But Am6 adds F#, so notes A, C, E, F#. So F# is the 6th. In A minor, the natural 6th is F, so F# is raised. This happens in A harmonic minor (where the 7th is raised to G#), but harmonic minor has F natural. Melodic minor ascending has F# and G#. So Am6 (A, C, E, F#) fits A melodic minor ascending.

But how does this relate to the key centered on Bm?

Maybe the key is D major. In D major, Bm is the vi chord. But the progression starts and ends on Bm, so it would be in the relative minor of D major, which is B minor. So B natural minor.

But earlier, we have C major chord, which isn't in B natural minor. Unless it's a modal mixture.

Let's look at the chord progression structure:

Bm Bm G/B G/B | Bm Bm D/A C/B | Bm Bm G/B G/B | Bm Bm Am6 Bm

So grouping:

- First part: Bm, G/B (G major)
- Then: Bm, D/A (D major), C/B (C major)
- Then repeats: Bm, G/B
- Ending with Bm, Am6, Bm

Common minor key progressions often use bVI (G major here in B minor), III (D major), but C major is bVII? Wait, in B minor, bVII would be A major, not C.

Wait, in B natural minor, the chords are:

i: Bm
ii°: C#dim
III: D
iv: Em
v: F#m
VI: G
VII: A

So G major is VI, D major is III, but C major isn't there. C natural would be bII. But in minor keys, sometimes chords are borrowed from other modes. For example, in B Dorian, the notes would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. So the chords would include G#dim, not C major.

Wait, another idea: maybe it's in E minor. E natural minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Chords: i Em, ii° F#dim, III G, iv Am, v Bm, VI C, VII D.

But our progression starts with Bm, which would be the v chord in E minor. Not likely the tonic.

Wait, Bm as tonic. Let's consider the chord C/B. C major over B bass. The notes are B, C, E, G. So the chord is C major, but with B in the bass. This creates a B half-diminished 7th? B, D, F#, A is Bm7b5. But here it's C/B: B, C, E, G. So actually, it's a G9 chord without the root? G9 is G, B, D, F#, A. But here we have C/B: B, C, E, G. So perhaps it's functioning as a dominant chord resolving to Bm? C major to Bm is a semitone resolution, which is common (bII - i in minor).

In minor keys, the bII chord (Neapolitan) is common. So in B minor, bII is C major. Yes! So C major is the Neapolitan chord, flattened second scale degree.

Also, D major: in B minor, III is D major (D, F#, A). That's diatonic in natural minor.

G major: VI in B minor.

Am6: A minor with F#. In B minor, the A chord is usually A major (VII), but here it's A minor. A minor would require C natural instead of C#, so it's a borrowed chord from Dorian mode? B Dorian has C natural. Because B Dorian is the second mode of A major: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. Wait no, that has C#, not C natural.

Wait, B Dorian should have C natural. Let's get this right.

The Dorian mode has a minor third and major sixth. To have C natural in B Dorian, the scale would be B, C, D, E, F#, G, A. Is that a standard mode?

Yes! Let's see: which major scale has B as its second degree? If B is the second note, the major scale starts on A. But A major has C#, so B Dorian would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. Not C natural.

Wait, no: the key of G major has notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So the second mode is A Dorian: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Third mode is B Phrygian: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A. Oh! B Phrygian.

B Phrygian mode: starting on B of G major scale. G major: 1G, 2A, 3B, 4C, 5D, 6E, 7F#. So the third mode is B Phrygian: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A.

Yes! So B Phrygian scale: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A.

Now, let's check the chords in B Phrygian.

The characteristic chords:

i: Bm (B, D, F#)
bII: C (C, E, G) — because the second note is C natural
III: D (D, F#, A)
iv: Em (E, G, B)
v: F#m (F#, A, C#) — but wait, in B Phrygian, the fifth note is F#, sixth is G, seventh is A. So the v chord would be F#, A, C — but C natural, so F# diminished? Let's build triads properly.

B Phrygian notes: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A.

i: B D F# → Bm
bII: C E G → C
III: D F# A → D
iv: E G B → Em
bV: F# A C → F#dim? Or F#m? Wait F# A C is F# diminished (since C is not C#). Normally in major scales, diminished chords are on vii. But here, the fifth degree chord is F# A C, which is F# diminished. But in the progression, we don't have that chord.

Looking at the progression: Bm, G/B, D/A, C/B, Am6.

G/B: G major (G, B, D) — in B Phrygian, G is the bVII degree. The bVII chord is G major (G, B, D), which matches.

D/A: D major over A bass → D major (D, F#, A). This is the III chord in B Phrygian.

C/B: C major over B bass → C major (C, E, G). This is the bII chord.

Am6: A minor with F#. A minor is A, C, E; adding F# makes it A C E F#. In B Phrygian, the notes include A and F#, so A C E F# is Am6. But what degree is that? A is the minor seventh scale degree in B Phrygian. The VII chord would normally be A C E → A minor. But with F# added, it's Am6.

In Phrygian mode, the characteristic feature is the bII (C major here), which we have. Also, the progression starts and ends on Bm, which is the tonic i chord.

Now, checking all chords against B Phrygian:

- Bm: i (tonic) — present
- G/B: bVII (G major) — present
- D/A: III (D major) — present
- C/B: bII (C major) — present
- Am6: vii°? Wait, A minor. In Phrygian, the seventh degree chord is minor (vii), but usually it's diminished? Wait in B Phrygian, the seventh note is A, so the chord built on A is A, C, E — A minor. Yes, and with F# added (the sixth scale degree?), but F# is the fifth note in B Phrygian (B, C, D, E, F#...). So Am6 includes the major sixth relative to A, which is F#.

Yes, so Am6 is the VII chord in B Phrygian but with an added sixth (F#), which is diatonic since F# is in the scale.

This all fits B Phrygian mode perfectly.

Earlier confusion was because I was thinking of minor keys, but this progression heavily features the bII chord (C major), which is characteristic of Phrygian mode. The Neapolitan chord in minor keys is similar, but in Phrygian mode, bII is diatonic.

Additionally, the use of III (D major) and bVII (G major) are common in minor keys, but the presence of bII as a primary chord points strongly to Phrygian.

So the key is B, and the mode is Phrygian.


### **Key and Mode Analysis**  
**Progression:**  
`Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm`  

---

### **1. Core Harmonic Structure**  
- **List of unique chords** (ignoring bass notes for scale analysis):  
  - `Bm` (B, D, F#)  
  - `G` (G, B, D) → from `G/B`  
  - `D` (D, F#, A) → from `D/A`  
  - `C` (C, E, G) → from `C/B`  
  - `Am6` (A, C, E, F#)  

- **Notes used across all chords**:  
  `A, B, C, D, E, F#, G`  
  → This is **exactly the G major scale** (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#).  

---

### **2. Why B Phrygian?**  
The **tonic chord is Bm** (repeated 10 times, starting/ending the progression). For `Bm` to be the tonic, we need to identify the **mode where B is the tonal center** and the notes match `A, B, C, D, E, F#, G`.  

- **B Phrygian** is the **3rd mode of the G major scale**:  
  - G major scale: `G A B C D E F#`  
  - Starting on **B**: `B C D E F# G A` → **B Phrygian**.  

#### **Chord Analysis in B Phrygian**:  
| Chord | Scale Degree | Role in Mode |  
|-------|--------------|-------------|  
| `Bm`  | **i** (tonic) | Primary center |  
| `G`   | **♭VII**      | Common in minor/Phrygian |  
| `D`   | **III**       | Diatonic major chord |  
| `C`   | **♭II**       | **Defining trait of Phrygian** (minor 2nd interval) |  
| `Am6` | **vii** (with added 6th) | `Am6` = `A C E F#` (F# is diatonic to Phrygian) |  

#### **Why Phrygian and not Natural Minor?**  
- In **B natural minor** (Aeolian), the ♭II chord would be `C#°` (not `C major`).  
- The **♭II chord (`C`)** in this progression is **diatonic to Phrygian** (due to the minor 2nd: `B→C`), making it the signature sound.  
- `Am6` (with F#) fits perfectly: F# is the **5th scale degree** in B Phrygian (`B C D E F#`), not borrowed.  

---

### **3. Phrygian vs. Other Modes**  
- **Not Dorian**: B Dorian (from A major) would have `C#` and `G#`, but we have `C` and `G`.  
- **Not Aeolian (natural minor)**: Lacks ♭II (`C`); B minor’s ♭II is `C#°`, not `C`.  
- **Not Harmonic/Melodic Minor**: These alter the 7th degree (e.g., B harmonic minor has `A#`), but we have `A` and `G`.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
- **Tonic**: **B** (all phrases resolve to `Bm`).  
- **Mode**: **Phrygian** (defined by the **♭II chord `C`** and the **B–C half-step**).  
- **Key Context**: B Phrygian is the **3rd mode of G major**, but **tonicized on B**.  

✅ **Final Answer**: **Key of B, Phrygian mode**.  

#### *Why this works*:  
- The ♭II (`C`) creates exotic tension typical of Flamenco, metal, or film scores.  
- `Am6` ≈ `vii` with added 6th (F#), reinforcing the Phrygian color.  
- Classic Phrygian cadence: **♭II → i** (`C/B → Bm`).  

This progression **isn’t** in B minor—it’s **Phrygian** because the ♭II is structural, not borrowed. 🎸
