Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**
> Bm — Bm — G/B — G/B — Bm — Bm — D/A — C/B — Bm — Bm — G/B — G/B — Bm — Bm — Am6 — Bm

---

### Step 1: Identify the root chords (ignoring bass notes for now)

First, simplify by focusing on the **chord qualities and roots**, ignoring the slash bass notes (which are just inversions or bass extensions):

- Bm (x8)
- G (x4)
- D (x1)
- C (x1)
- Am6 (x1)

So the primary chords are:  
**Bm, G, D, C, Am6**

---

### Step 2: Look for a tonal center

We see **Bm appears 8 times** — clearly the **tonic** (home chord). So we're likely in **B minor**.

Let’s check if the other chords fit within the **B minor key**.

#### B natural minor scale (Aeolian):  
B – C# – D – E – F# – G – A

Chords built on each degree (triads):
- i: Bm
- ii°: C#°
- III: D
- iv: Em
- v: F#m
- VI: G
- VII: Am

Wait — we have **G** and **D**, which are **VI and III** — both appear in natural minor.

We also have **C** and **Am6**.

What’s **C**?  
C = C-E-G → Not in B minor scale. The 7th degree should be **A**, not C.

C major is **not diatonic** to B natural minor.

What about **Am6**?  
A minor 6 = A-C-E-F#  
In B minor, A is the 7th scale degree → Am is diatonic (VII degree).  
Adding 6th (F#) — that’s fine, since F# is the 5th of B minor.  
So Am6 = Am with added 6th → **still diatonic** to B minor. The 6th (F#) is the 5th, so it’s just an extension.

But **C major (C-E-G)**?  
C is **not** in the B natural minor scale.  
B minor scale has: B C# D E F# G A → no C natural.

So **C major chord** is **borrowed** — it’s a **chromatic chord**.

---

### Step 3: What key and mode?

We have a strong **Bm** tonic, and chords that mostly belong to **B natural minor** (Aeolian), **except** the **C major chord**.

C major chord (C-E-G) contains **C natural**, which is **not** in B minor (it should be C#).

This C major chord suggests a **borrowed chord** from **B Dorian** or **B Phrygian**, or perhaps **B harmonic minor** — but harmonic minor has C#, not C.

Wait — what key contains **Bm and C major**?

Let’s think differently.

### Consider: Could this be in **D major**?

D major: D E F# G A B C#

Chords: D, Em, F#m, G, Am, Bm, C#°

We have Bm (vi) and G (IV) — both diatonic.

But we also have **C major** → In D major, the VII chord is **C#°**, not C major.

C major would be **borrowed** from D Mixolydian? D Mixolydian has C natural.

D Mixolydian: D E F# G A B C — yes, C natural.

But we have **Bm** as tonic — not D. So this is **not** in D major.

What if **Bm is tonic**, and C is a borrowed chord?

In **B Dorian**, the scale is:  
B C# D E F# G# A → still has C#! So no C natural.

In **B Phrygian**: B C D E F# G A → YES! Here we have **C natural**!

Check B Phrygian scale:
- B (root)
- C (♭2)
- D (m3)
- E (4)
- F# (5)
- G (♭6)
- A (♭7)

So chords built on scale degrees:
- i: Bm
- ii°: C° (we have C major, not C°)
- III: D
- iv: Em
- v: F#m
- VI: G
- vii: Am

Wait! **C major** would be **not diatonic** even in B Phrygian — Phrygian has **C°**, not C major.

But we have **C major** — C-E-G — which is a **major triad on the ♭2**.

This is a **non-diatonic, borrowed chord**.

It’s often called a **"Neapolitan" chord**, but Neapolitan is usually a ♭II *in first inversion* and major triad — yes! That’s it.

In minor keys, the **♭II chord** (major triad on the lowered second scale degree) is common, especially in classical and rock music. It’s borrowed from the **parallel major** or **Phrygian mode**.

So in **B minor**, the **♭II chord** is C major (since ♭2 of B is C).

And we also have:
- G (VI) — diatonic
- D (III) — diatonic
- Am6 (vii6) — diatonic (Am with added 6th = F#)
- Bm (i) — tonic

So we have:
- i (Bm)
- ♭II (C)
- III (D)
- VI (G)
- vii6 (Am6)

All are consistent with **B minor**, with a strong **borrowed ♭II chord** (C major), which is very common in minor keys — especially in rock, pop, and metal.

The progression:
> Bm — Bm — G/B — G/B — Bm — Bm — D/A — C/B — Bm — Bm — G/B — G/B — Bm — Bm — Am6 — Bm

The inversions (G/B, D/A, C/B) are just bass notes — doesn’t change the mode.

### Final Determination

- **Key: B minor**
- **Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)**, **with a borrowed ♭II (C major) chord**

> Some might call it **B Phrygian** because of the C natural, but Phrygian has a **C° chord**, and our bass movement and harmonic context suggest **B minor with chromatic flavor**, not an actual mode change. The **C major** is a **borrowed chord**, not a modal indicator — especially since the scale still otherwise follows natural minor (no G# or other alterations).

The **Am6** also reinforces natural minor — it's just an extended vii chord.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key:** **B minor**  
**Mode:** **Natural minor (Aeolian)** with a **borrowed flat-II chord (C major)** for color.

This progression is **not** in Phrygian, Dorian, or Harmonic minor — the C major is chromatic, not modal. So the underlying mode is **Aeolian**.
