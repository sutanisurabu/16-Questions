### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm looking to determine the key and mode based on the chord progression the user provided: Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm. The key appears to revolve around Bm as the tonic, which might suggest B minor or D major since those are related keys. However, the inclusion of C/B indicates a unique tonal flavor that brings in a Lydian or Phrygian influence. Finally, Am6 adds another layer to consider in understanding the overall tonality.**Examining chord notes and relationships**

I'm analyzing the notes for the Am6 chord: A, C, E, and F#. The presence of F# suggests a connection to G, and in the context of B minor, the scale includes B, C#, D, E, F#, G, and A. However, the Am6 chord introduces C natural, which isn't part of the B natural minor scale, indicating it's borrowing a flat 6. Looking at the Bm and G/B chords further confirms that G serves as a bVI in B minor.**Clarifying triads and chord functions**

I’m realizing that G functions as the b6 in this context, but it's also part of the diatonic triads in B natural minor. The triads include Bm, C#dim, D, Em, F#m, G, and A. So yes, G major is technically VI, and G/B is just its first inversion with B in the bass—B is indeed the third of the G chord.

As for D/A, this is a V chord over A bass that could function in a IV-V context, while C/B is non-diatonic, bringing in some interesting harmonic color.**Understanding chord flavors**

C natural is present in the C/B chord, which is interesting since B minor typically has C#. So, C/B introduces a b2 above B, giving it a Neapolitan flavor. The Neapolitan usually uses C major in first inversion (C/E) as the bII, but C/B adds a unique twist with B as the bass, creating a stepwise semitone motion back to Bm.

Now, for the Am6 chord, it's not fully diatonic since it includes C natural. While A is part of B minor, the Am6 has flat 7 in the mix, making it intriguing!**Determining key and mode**

In considering the Am6 chord, it includes an F#, making it interesting in terms of B Phrygian, which has the notes A, C, E, and F#. I could label it bVII6(add6). The user wants to determine the key and mode, with the answer being B Phrygian, which draws from G major as the parent key. The presence of C natural reinforces this Phrygian aspect. I'll keep it concise and mention that the C/B chord functions as a bII over the tonic pedal.

B Phrygian.

Reason:
- All pitch classes used are B C D E F# G A (no C#), which is the B Phrygian collection (mode 3 of G major).
- The progression centers on Bm and features Phrygian color tones: C/B (bII over tonic pedal) and Am6 (bVII add6), both diatonic to B Phrygian.
- Parent key (collection) is G major; tonal center is B.
