Let's analyze the chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

### Given Chords:
```
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm
```

We can group them for clarity:
```
| Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | D/A | C/B | Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | Am6 | Bm |
```

### Step 1: Look at the Root Notes
Let’s extract the root of each chord:
- Bm → B
- G/B → B (inverted G chord, but bass note is B)
- D/A → A (A is bass, so likely functioning as A-related harmony)
- C/B → B (bass note is B)
- Am6 → A (Am6 is A–C–E–F#)

But let’s list the **chord roots** (not just bass notes):
- Bm → B
- G/B → G (chord is G major, first inversion)
- D/A → D (D major, first inversion)
- C/B → C (C major, first inversion)
- Am6 → A

So chord roots:
```
Bm → B
G   → G
D   → D
C   → C
Am6 → A
```

So the chords used are:
- **Bm**
- **G**
- **D**
- **C**
- **Am6**

### Step 2: Determine Possible Key
Let’s look at the chords and see which key they fit in.

List of chords: Bm, G, D, C, Am6

Am6 adds an F#, which is important.

Am6 = A–C–E–F#
So it includes F♯, not F natural.

Now let’s check possible keys.

#### Try: B minor (natural minor)
B natural minor scale: B C♯ D E F♯ G A B

Chords from B natural minor:
- Bm (i)
- C#dim (ii°)
- D (III)
- Em (iv)
- F#m (v)
- G (VI)
- A (VII)

Compare:
- Bm → i ✅
- G → VI ✅
- D → III ✅
- C → not in key (C natural, but key has C#) ❌
- Am6 → Am would be VII, but Am6 includes F#, which fits (F# is in key). A–C–E–F# is Am6, and all these notes are in B natural minor ✅

But **C major chord** (C–E–G) contains **C natural**, which is **not** in B natural minor (has C#), so C major is **outside** the key.

So if we have a **C major chord**, that’s a chromatic chord in B minor.

But wait — could it be **B Dorian**?

#### Try: B Dorian mode
Dorian is a minor mode with a raised 6th.

B Dorian: B C# D E F# G# A B

Wait — G#? But we have a **G major chord** (G–B–D) — that has **G natural**, not G# — so **G major** doesn't fit B Dorian (needs G#) ❌

How about **B Aeolian**? That’s just natural minor — same issue with C.

Wait — maybe the key is **D major**?

### Try: Key of D major
D major scale: D E F# G A B C#

Chords:
- D (I)
- Em (ii)
- F#m (iii)
- G (IV)
- A (V)
- Bm (vi)
- C#dim (vii°)

Now compare:
- Bm → vi ✅
- G → IV ✅
- D → I ✅
- C → C major — not in key (key has C#) ❌
- Am6 → A–C–E–F# — A is V chord, but Am6 implies a minor v, but in D major, A is major. Also C natural in Am6 — but D major has C# → so **C natural clashes**

Again, **C natural** appears in both C chord and Am6 — but D major has C# — so no.

Wait — **Am6 has C natural**? No!

### Correction: Am6 chord
Am6 = A–C–E–F♯

- A: root
- C: minor third
- E: perfect fifth
- F♯: sixth

So **C is natural minor third** — but the sixth is **F#**, which is **sharp**, not flat.

So pitches: **A, C, E, F#**

So **C natural** is used — but in most keys, you don’t have both C and C#.

But here’s the observation: we have **C natural** in C major chord and in Am6 chord (as minor third), and **no C#** elsewhere.

So likely, the key has **C natural**, not C#.

So the key probably has **B**, **A**, **G**, **F#, E, D, C** — that is: **F# minor**?

Wait — try **G major**?

### Try: G major
G major scale: G A B C D E F#

Chords:
- G (I)
- Am (ii)
- Bm (iii)
- C (IV)
- D (V)
- Em (vi)
- F#dim (vii°)

Now test the chords:
- Bm → iii ✅
- G → I ✅
- D → V ✅ (D major is V in G)
- C → IV ✅
- Am6 → A–C–E–F# — A is ii, but in G major, ii is **Am**, not Am6 — but Am6 uses A, C, E — all in scale — and F# is in G major — so F# is scale degree 7 — so Am6 = Am with added 6th (F#) — which is **diatonic**! ✅

So **Am6** is Am(add6), all notes in G major.

Now check bass notes:
- G/B → B in bass — B is in G chord (G–B–D) so just first inversion — common
- D/A → D major with A in bass — A is fifth of D, so second inversion? D/A = D with A in bass — that’s 2nd inversion of D — also common
- C/B → C major with B in bass — B is major 7th of C — so this is a Cmaj7? C/B suggests a C major chord over B — which implies a Cmaj7/B — which is very common in pop/rock

C/B = C–E–G–B → Cmaj7

In G major, Cmaj7 is IV7 — very common

Now, Bm → B–D–F# — all in G major (iii chord)

So all chords fit G major:

- Bm = iii
- G = I
- D = V
- C = IV
- Am6 = ii6 (or ii(add6))

So progression:
```
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm
iii iii  I     I   iii iii   V    IV   iii iii  I     I   iii iii  ii6  iii
```

Yes — this makes sense.

Now, is Am6 common? Yes — it's just a color version of Am, adding F# (the major sixth above A, hence "add6"). In G major, F# is diatonic.

All chromatic notes? None — all chords are diatonic to G major.

### Final Chord: Bm — ends on iii

Wait — ends on Bm, which is **iii** — not tonic.

But the progression starts and has strong emphasis on Bm — but harmonic function suggests G is tonic.

Let’s count:
- Bm appears 10 times (very frequent)
- G appears 4 times (including G/B)
- D appears once (D/A)
- C appears once (C/B)
- Am6 once

But **most frequent chord is Bm**, but it may not be tonic.

In pop music, sometimes the **tonic is not the most frequent chord**, or the progression is centered elsewhere.

But functionally:
- C/B → Cmaj7/B → moves to Bm — this is IV → iii, which is a common cadence in major keys (weak ending, but valid)
- D/A → V → then C/B → IV — that’s V–IV (a "falling" progression)
- Also G–Bm is I–iii, common submediant move

But let’s look at voice leading and possible resolution.

The sequence: D/A → C/B → Bm

That's V → IV → iii — a descending bass line: D → C → B

Very linear, common in pop/rock.

Also: G/B → Bm? G/B is G major with B in bass → moves to Bm → same bass note (B), so B remains — G–B–D → B–D–F# — so G → F#, D → D, B→B — smooth voice leading.

So it’s plausible.

But **does the piece feel like it’s in B minor or G major**?

Even though Bm is frequent, it functions more like **iii** in G major.

Moreover:
- The chords D, G, C — form a IV–I–V–IV backbone in G
- Am6 is ii chord
- Bm is iii — all diatonic

No accidentals — all fit G major.

Now, the final chord is Bm — ends on iii — which is **not** conclusive, but could be intentional (e.g., a deceptive or floating ending).

But let's consider: could it be **B Aeolian** (B natural minor)?

B minor key: B C# D E F# G A

But:
- G major chord: G–B–D → G is **not** in B minor (B minor has G#) — wait no: **B natural minor** has **G natural**, not G#.

B natural minor: B C# D E F# G A → yes, G is in the scale → so G is ♭VI

D → D is ii° (diminished)? D–F–A → minor chord — Dm

But we have **D major** (D–F#–A) — has F# — so D chord has F# — **D major** is **not** in B natural minor — because B minor has **F#**, yes — but D major is D–F#–A — F# and A are in B minor, yes — but what about the third?

B minor has D and F#, so D–F#–A = **D major** — but in B minor, the ii chord should be D–F–A = Dm — but we have D **major**, which has **F#**, so it's **D major** — which requires **F#**, which is in B minor?

Wait: B natural minor scale: B C# D E F# G A

So:
- D to F# is **major third** — D–F#–A = D major chord

Yes! So D major chord is **not diatonic** to B natural minor — because the ii chord in minor is **diminished** or **minor**, but in natural minor, the ii chord is **D–F–A** — F **natural**.

But in B natural minor: 
- D is the 3rd scale degree
- Scale: B C# D E F# G A
- So triads: 
  - Bm (B–D–F#) → i
  - C#dim (C#–E–G) → ii°
  - Dm? D–F–A → F **natural** — but B minor has **F#**, not F natural → so D–F–A would require F natural — which is **not** in B natural minor.

Wait! **Mistake here.**

B natural minor:
- B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A, B

So the **third note is D**, but interval from D:
- D to F# = major third (D–F#)
- D to A = fifth
- So D–F#–A = **D major chord**

Wait — yes! In B natural minor, the III chord (from 3rd degree) is **D major**, because:
- D–F#–A → F# is in the scale

So chord on D is **D major**, which is **III** in B minor.

Similarly:
- G is on 6th degree → G–B–D → G major → **♭VI**
- C is C–E–G — E and G are in scale, but **C natural** — C is not in B minor (which has C#) → so C major chord has **C natural**, but B minor has **C#** → so C major is **not** in B minor.

Ah — here’s the problem.

C major: C–E–G — requires **C natural**

But B minor has **C#** — so **C natural is outside** the key — so C chord cannot be in B minor.

Similarly, Am6: A–C–E–F# — A is VII in B minor (A–C#–E) — but Am6 has **C natural**, not C# — so again, **C natural** — not in B minor.

So **C natural** appears in both C major and Am6 (as minor third) — but B minor has C# — so this key cannot be B minor.

Back to **G major** — which has **C natural** (IV), F# (leading tone), and A, B, D, E, G — all fit.

And Am6: A–C–E–F# — all in G major.

So everything fits **G major**.

Chords:
- Bm = iii
- G = I
- D = V
- C = IV
- Am6 = ii(add6)

Progression outline:
Lots of iii and I, some IV, V, and a ii6.

Common in pop music to emphasize iii.

Ends on Bm (iii), but that’s fine — doesn't have to end on tonic.

### Final Answer:
- **Key**: G major
- **Mode**: Ionian (major)

But wait — is it possible it's **B Dorian**?

B Dorian: B C# D E F# G# A

But we have G major chord — G–B–D — G **natural**, but Dorian has G# — so no.

How about **E Dorian**? Bm = iv? Unlikely.

No — only **G major** fits all chords.

### Conclusion:
🎵 **Key: G major**  
🎵 **Mode: Ionian**  

All chords are diatonic:
- Bm = iii
- G = I
- D = V
- C = IV
- Am6 = ii(add6) — with F# the added sixth (diatonic)

C/B implies Cmaj7, common in pop.

Final chord Bm doesn't change key — could be an imperfect cadence or stylistic.

✅ **Answer: Key is G major, Mode is Ionian.**
