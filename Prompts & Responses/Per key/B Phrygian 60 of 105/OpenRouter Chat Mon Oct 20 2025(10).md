### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to determine the key and mode from the chord progression: "Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm." The chords include Bm, G/B, D/A, C/B, and Am6. It seems I'm looking at either B Dorian or B Aeolian here. 

In B natural minor, the diatonic chords show that my assumptions about the chords' relationships might lead to misunderstandings regarding their roles in the key. The bII is indeed C natural, which doesn't fit neatly into B minor.**Clarifying chord relationships**

I've got C/B, which is C major with B as the bass, leading to a possible B Phrygian interpretation due to the notes (C E G plus B). However, C# is diatonic in B natural minor, not C natural. 

G major is fine, but includes no C. D major is also correct. The C natural only appears in the C/B chord, and Am6 contributes an F#. 

In B Aeolian, if A is minor, that could suggest a borrowed bVII minor, which brings some confusion around the A major versus A minor context.**Exploring Dorian and Phrygian modes**

If we're in B Dorian, the chords would be: i Bm, ii C#dim, III D, IV E, v F#m, vi G, VII A#dim. But, A minor doesn't fit, and C natural isn't part of B Dorian since it has C#. 

In B Phrygian, C natural is diatonic, and I’m wondering about the relation to D major or D minor. D major fits with F#, while B Phrygian has A natural.

Wait, B Phrygian notes indicate that it might relate to the third mode of G major. Let’s see how this aligns!**Confirming B Phrygian and chords**

So, B Phrygian is indeed the third mode of G major, with notes G A B C D E F#. This confirms that B C D E F# G A matches up. 

The D major chord (D F# A) and G major chord (G B D) fit well into B Phrygian. Am6 adds F#, which works perfectly. 

Now, when I look at the C/B chord (C E G over B bass), it appears to consist entirely of notes from the scale, effectively becoming a Cmaj7/B voicing, adding some interesting harmonic context. This gives B a leading tone to C!**Determining key and mode**

In B Phrygian, C is the b2 scale degree, and Cmaj7 uses B natural, which feels plausible. However, in B natural minor, C natural isn't diatonic. The presence of C natural in chords like C/B and Am6 hints at modal mixture or a key change.

The tonic chord in B Phrygian is B minor. Analyzing the chords shows they fit the B Phrygian framework. Overall, the tonal center is B, with the mode being Phrygian, and it derives from the G major/E minor parent scale. If I had to sum up, I'd say: "B Phrygian, with G major/E minor as the parent scale."

B Phrygian (tonal center B, mode = Phrygian). 
All chords fit B Phrygian: B C D E F# G A (parent key signature: G major / E minor, one sharp).

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I'm looking to determine the key and mode based on the chord progression the user provided: Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm. The key appears to revolve around Bm as the tonic, which might suggest B minor or D major since those are related keys. However, the inclusion of C/B indicates a unique tonal flavor that brings in a Lydian or Phrygian influence. Finally, Am6 adds another layer to consider in understanding the overall tonality.**Examining chord notes and relationships**

I'm analyzing the notes for the Am6 chord: A, C, E, and F#. The presence of F# suggests a connection to G, and in the context of B minor, the scale includes B, C#, D, E, F#, G, and A. However, the Am6 chord introduces C natural, which isn't part of the B natural minor scale, indicating it's borrowing a flat 6. Looking at the Bm and G/B chords further confirms that G serves as a bVI in B minor.**Clarifying triads and chord functions**

I’m realizing that G functions as the b6 in this context, but it's also part of the diatonic triads in B natural minor. The triads include Bm, C#dim, D, Em, F#m, G, and A. So yes, G major is technically VI, and G/B is just its first inversion with B in the bass—B is indeed the third of the G chord.

As for D/A, this is a V chord over A bass that could function in a IV-V context, while C/B is non-diatonic, bringing in some interesting harmonic color.**Understanding chord flavors**

C natural is present in the C/B chord, which is interesting since B minor typically has C#. So, C/B introduces a b2 above B, giving it a Neapolitan flavor. The Neapolitan usually uses C major in first inversion (C/E) as the bII, but C/B adds a unique twist with B as the bass, creating a stepwise semitone motion back to Bm.

Now, for the Am6 chord, it's not fully diatonic since it includes C natural. While A is part of B minor, the Am6 has flat 7 in the mix, making it intriguing!**Determining key and mode**

In considering the Am6 chord, it includes an F#, making it interesting in terms of B Phrygian, which has the notes A, C, E, and F#. I could label it bVII6(add6). The user wants to determine the key and mode, with the answer being B Phrygian, which draws from G major as the parent key. The presence of C natural reinforces this Phrygian aspect. I'll keep it concise and mention that the C/B chord functions as a bII over the tonic pedal.

B Phrygian.

Reason:
- All pitch classes used are B C D E F# G A (no C#), which is the B Phrygian collection (mode 3 of G major).
- The progression centers on Bm and features Phrygian color tones: C/B (bII over tonic pedal) and Am6 (bVII add6), both diatonic to B Phrygian.
- Parent key (collection) is G major; tonal center is B.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I'm exploring chords in B Phrygian, where flat VII (A-C-E) is an A minor chord. Adding F# gives me Am6, which fits since F# is the fifth scale degree. Now, let's consider G major: C/B becomes a passing dominant to Em, acting as C major over a B bass, leading to Bm. In this context, C - C/B - Bm is stepwise bass movement. The repeated Bm positions suggest that B acts as the tonal center. Alternatively, I'm thinking about a B minor key with borrowed bII and bVI.**Verifying B Phrygian mode**

I'm noticing that C natural appears twice, which means G major serves as the VI, fitting both Aeolian and Phrygian modes. D/A is the III, and Am6 also includes C natural, suggesting some modal mixture. I think B Phrygian is the right choice. Notably, flat 2 in Phrygian means I can use C major instead. I checked for violations in B Phrygian and confirmed that all my notes—B, D, F#, G, A, C, E—fit perfectly within this scale. So yes, it's definitely B Phrygian.**Identifying B Phrygian**

Starting with the G major scale (G A B C D E F#), when I reorder it from B, I get the B Phrygian scale: B C D E F# G A. The key signature shows one sharp (F#), confirming that B Phrygian is the mode relative to G major, with the key center being B. To provide some context, the diatonic chords include Bm (i), Am6 (bVII add6), and C/B (bII), highlighting traditional Phrygian characteristics. So, my final answer is: "B Phrygian centered on B, using G major's pitch collection."**Finalizing B Phrygian explanation**

The rationale here is straightforward: all chords come from the G major scale, and the presence of C natural in C/B and Am6 indicates the Phrygian b2. The progression resolves on Bm, which confirms the key center. The answer to "Determine key and mode?" is simply "B Phrygian," derived from G major (which has one sharp). 

So, I’ll summarize: 
- Tonal center: B
- Mode: Phrygian (B Phrygian from G major).

Optionally, I can mention chord functions like Bm = i, G/B = VI6, and D/A = III6/5. But I’ll keep it concise for clarity.

B Phrygian (mode on B from the G major parent scale).

Reason: The pitch collection is G major (G A B C D E F#), centered on B. The C-natural sonorities (C/B and Am6 = A–C–E–F#) give the characteristic Phrygian b2 color, while Bm is the tonic.

B dorian

### Explanation
- **Key/tonic**: B (the progression centers on Bm as the i chord, starting and ending there, with bass emphasis on B).
- **Mode**: Dorian (fits the natural minor family but with characteristic ♭2, ♭3, ♮6, and ♭7 scale degrees: B–C–D–E–F♯–G–A). All chords are diatonic or compatible:
  - Bm (i)
  - G/B (VI / i)
  - D/A (III / VII)
  - C/B (♭VII / i)
  - Am6 (VII6, with ♮6 added)
- This progression evokes a modal folk/rock feel (e.g., reminiscent of some Animals or Doors tunes, though not an exact match). If transposed or interpreted differently (e.g., as modal mixture in B aeolian), it could lean toward B minor, but the C major chords confirm the dorian ♭2.

**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

**Key: B**  
**Mode: Phrygian**

This progression strongly centers on B as the tonic, with a pedal bass on B emphasizing it. The presence of the C major chord (characteristic ♭II) and the overall note collection (A B C D E F♯ G) align with the B Phrygian mode (1 ♭2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7). All chords are diatonic to this mode:

- Bm: i (B D F♯)
- G/B: ♭VII⁶ (G B D, inverted)
- D/A: ♭III⁶ (D F♯ A, inverted; functions as a modal III)
- C/B: ♭II⁶ (C E G, inverted)
- Am6: ♭vii₆ (A C E F♯; ♭vii with added 6th)

The repetitive i–♭VII structure and Phrygian ♭II insertion create a tense, exotic flavor typical of the mode, without accidentals suggesting a shift to parallel major/minor or other modes.

### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Progression**

I've just begun dissecting the request. My initial step involves deconstructing the provided chord progression, focusing on identifying each chord's root, its function within the key, and potential variations. I am now formulating a plan to analyze the harmonic relationships present and to ascertain how the progression could work within a musical context.


**Unraveling Chord Functions**

I'm now deep in the analysis, cross-referencing the chords against the hypothesized B minor key. Specifically, I'm matching each chord to its function within B minor, considering both natural and harmonic minor scales. The G/B and D/A chords are providing useful insights on possible secondary dominant tendencies or voice leading patterns. The Am6 is interesting, too - a chromatic alteration.


**Exploring the Chromaticism**

My investigation deepens. The inclusion of the C/B chord continues to spark my curiosity, pushing me to consider it. The Am6 chord further emphasizes a deeper understanding is required, hinting at possible modal mixture. These require further analysis, and I'm looking into how these chords enrich or deviate from the B minor framework.


**Delving Deeper into Chords**

I'm now fully engrossed in pinpointing the function of each chord, taking into account the B minor hypothesis. Specifically, I'm now contemplating the implications of the C/B chord, pondering its relationship to B Phrygian or possible borrowed chords. The Am6 chord continues to challenge me, leading me to investigate its potential in terms of borrowed harmonies and alternative scales within the tonal framework.


**Synthesizing Findings**

I'm now fully immersed in the process, assessing each chord's role within the framework of B minor, and weighing up the implications of the C/B and Am6 chords. I'm focusing on the effect of the Phrygian harmony and whether there is any modal interchange. The Am6 is continuing to draw me into examining its potential for the final resolution.


**Decoding the Cadences**

I'm now zeroing in on the significance of the Am6 chord and the C/B. While the B minor key seems plausible, the chromatic elements are compelling me to consider Phrygian possibilities, especially given the Am6's resolution. I'm focusing on the effect of the F# note in the Am6 chord and its relation to Bm.


**Synthesizing Findings**

I'm now fully immersed in the process, assessing each chord's role within the framework of B minor, and weighing up the implications of the C/B and Am6 chords. The F# note in the Am6 chord is particularly insightful. The progression seems to lean towards B Phrygian due to chromatic changes.


**Unveiling the Cadences**

I'm now zeroing in on the Am6 chord and the C/B. While the B minor key seems plausible, the chromatic elements are compelling me to consider Phrygian possibilities. The Am6's resolution is also particularly insightful, specifically, I am focusing on the implications of the F# note in the Am6 chord.


**Unpacking the Cadences**

I'm now fully immersed in the thought process, considering the key, mode, and especially the Am6 chord's resolution. I've re-evaluated my initial B minor hypothesis, as the chromatic elements and specifically the Am6's character compels me to investigate a B Phrygian interpretation.


**Revisiting Initial Assumptions**

I'm now moving on to the more difficult chords, specifically focusing on the C/B and Am6. The B minor key still feels like a good starting point, but the unexpected chords, particularly the Am6, are making me question my initial assessment. I'm taking a second look.




Based on the chords provided, here is the analysis of the key and mode.

### **Key: B minor**

The progression firmly establishes **B minor** as its tonal center. The piece begins and ends on a Bm chord, and the Bm chord appears more frequently than any other, functioning as the "home" chord or tonic.

### **Mode: Aeolian (Natural Minor) with Phrygian interchange**

This progression is a great example of modal mixture, where a primary mode is flavored with chords from a parallel mode.

**1. The Aeolian (Natural Minor) Core:**

The main building blocks of the progression come from the **B Aeolian mode** (or B Natural Minor scale: B - C# - D - E - F# - G - A).

- **Bm (i):** The tonic minor chord (B-D-F#).
- **G (VI):** The submediant major chord (G-B-D). The progression Bm - G is a very common i - VI movement in minor keys.
- **D (III):** The mediant major chord (D-F#-A). This is the relative major of B minor.

The recurring `Bm Bm G/B G/B` section is a classic i - VI progression, strongly pointing to B Aeolian.

**2. The Phrygian Influence:**

The progression introduces two chords that are not from the B Natural Minor scale but are characteristic of the **B Phrygian mode** (B - C - D - E - F# - G - A). The defining feature of the Phrygian mode is the lowered second scale degree (a C natural in this key).

- **C/B (bII/i):** This is a C major chord (C-E-G) played over a B in the bass. The C major chord is the bII (flat two) chord in the key of B, a hallmark of the Phrygian mode. Its use creates a dark, dramatic tension that resolves powerfully down by a half-step to the tonic (Bm). This "Phrygian cadence" (bII-i) gives the music a Spanish or flamenco-like flavor.

- **Am6 (vii6):** An A minor chord (A-C-E) is the vii chord in B Phrygian. (In B Natural Minor, the VII chord is A major). The added 6th is an F#, which is the 5th of the Bm chord, creating a smooth voice-leading connection and reinforcing the return to the tonic. The full Am6 chord (A-C-E-F#) functions as a pre-dominant chord, pulling strongly towards the final Bm.

### **Summary:**

- **Key:** **B minor**
- **Primary Mode:** **B Aeolian (Natural Minor)**, established by the strong i - VI - III relationships (Bm - G - D).
- **Modal Interchange:** The progression borrows heavily from the **B Phrygian** mode to create its most distinctive and dramatic moments, specifically with the use of the **C major (bII)** and **A minor (vii)** chords.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given a chord progression: "Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm". They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to understand the chords. Some of them have slashes, like G/B and D/A. Those are slash chords, meaning the bass note is different. For G/B, G major with B in the bass. Similarly, D/A is D major with A in the bass, and C/B is C major with B in the bass. Then there's Am6, which is A minor with an added sixth (F#). 

I should list all the unique chords. So Bm appears a lot, then G/B which is essentially G major, D/A is D major, C/B is C major, and Am6. So the chords are Bm, G, D, C, Am6. Now, I need to figure out what key these chords come from.

Bm is the tonic if we're in B minor. Let me check the natural minor scale for B. B natural minor has notes B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. The chords built on each degree would be: i Bm, ii° C#dim, III D, iv Em, v F#m, VI G, VII A. 

Looking at the progression, we have Bm (i), G (which is VI in B minor), D (III), C? Wait, C isn't in B natural minor. B natural minor has C#, not C. So C major would be a flat VII if we're in B minor. But flat VII isn't in the natural minor scale. Maybe it's the harmonic or melodic minor? 

B harmonic minor has A# instead of A natural, so the chords would be different. B harmonic minor scale: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A#. The v chord would be F# major, not minor. But in the progression, we have C major, which isn't in harmonic minor either. 

Wait, D/A is D major with A bass. A is the fifth of D, so that's just D major. C/B is C major with B bass, so the chord is still C major. Am6: A minor with F#, which is the 6th. In A natural minor, the 6th is F, not F#. So Am6 would have F# instead of F natural. That suggests it's from the harmonic minor scale. 

Am6 is often associated with A harmonic minor, where the raised 7th (G#) isn't directly affecting the 6th, but the 6th can be raised in melodic minor. Wait, in A harmonic minor, the notes are A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. The 6th is F natural. But Am6 requires F#, which is the major sixth. So Am6 implies F#, which is the 6th in A major, but it's minor. So Am6 is the i chord in A melodic minor ascending? A melodic minor ascending is A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#. So the i chord would be Am(maj7), but Am6 is Am with added 6th (F#), so that fits A melodic minor. 

But the progression starts with Bm. So maybe the key is B. Let me list all the chords with their notes.

Bm: B, D, F#
G/B: B, G, B, D (since G major is G, B, D, and bass is B)
D/A: A, D, F#, A (D major: D, F#, A; bass A)
C/B: B, C, E, G (C major: C, E, G; bass B)
Am6: A, C, E, F# (A minor is A, C, E; 6th is F#)

Now, compiling all unique notes from these chords:

Bm: B, D, F#
G/B: G, B, D
D/A: D, F#, A
C/B: C, E, G, B
Am6: A, C, E, F#

So all notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. 

Wait, that's the B Dorian mode. Let's check. B Dorian: B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A? No, that's not right. 

Standard Dorian mode is built on the second degree of the major scale. So for B Dorian, it would be the key of A major. A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. So B Dorian would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. But in our notes, we have C natural, not C#, and G natural, not G#. 

Wait, our notes include C natural and G natural. So the notes are A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. That's the G major scale starting from B? G major is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So the notes B, C, D, E, F#, G, A — that's exactly the G major scale starting on B. So that's B Dorian, which is the second mode of A major? Wait no.

Modes: Dorian is the second mode. So if the key is A major, the modes are:
I: A Ionian
II: B Dorian
III: C# Phrygian
etc.

A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. But our notes have C natural and G natural, not C# and G#. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, the notes we have are A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Let's see which major scale has those notes. The F# is there, but no G#. So if the scale is G major: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. Yes! G major scale is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So the notes we have are all within G major: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Exactly the G major scale.

But the progression starts with Bm. In G major, Bm is the iii chord. But in the progression, Bm is the tonic, as it's repeated many times. So if the tonal center is B, but the notes are from G major, that would make B the tonic of the Dorian mode. 

B Dorian mode: since Dorian is the second mode, B Dorian would be based on A major? Wait no. Let's clarify:

The Dorian mode starts on the second note of the major scale. So if we take G major (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#), the second mode is A Dorian: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. But we need B as the tonic. So what major scale has B as its second degree? That would be A major. Because in A major (A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#), the second degree is B, so B Dorian would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. But our progression has C natural and G natural, not C# and G#. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's the key of D major? D major: D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#. But we have C natural, not C#. Not matching.

Wait, the notes we have: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. That's exactly the G major scale. G major has F# and C natural. Yes, G major: G A B C D E F#. So the notes present are all in G major. 

But the chord progression is centered around Bm. In G major, the chords are:

I: G
ii: Am
iii: Bm
IV: C
V: D
vi: Em
vii°: F#dim

So Bm is the iii chord in G major. But the progression starts and ends on Bm, and it's heavily emphasized. So maybe it's in B Dorian, which is the second mode of A major? Wait, no—B Dorian should be from A major, but A major has C# and G#, which we don't have here.

Wait, if the notes are from G major, then B is the third degree. So the iii chord in G major is Bm. But B Dorian would require the minor scale with a raised sixth. Wait, Dorian mode has a minor third and major sixth. In B Dorian, the notes would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. But we have C natural and G natural, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's B Aeolian (natural minor). B natural minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. But in our progression, we have G major chord (G, B, D), which is fine because G is the VI chord in B minor. But we also have D major (D, F#, A), which is the III chord. And C major (C, E, G), which would be the VII chord in B natural minor? Wait, B natural minor has A as the seventh note, so the VII chord should be A major. But here we have C major. C major in B minor would require a flattened second? Not standard.

Wait, let's list the chords again with possible scales.

The presence of Am6 is interesting. Am6 has F#, which in A minor would be the raised sixth for melodic minor. But A natural minor has F natural, so Am6 (with F#) suggests A melodic minor or harmonic minor variants.

But the progression starts on Bm. Maybe it's in B, but with some chromatic chords.

Another approach: identify the tonic. The progression starts and ends on Bm, and it's repeated often, so Bm is likely the tonic chord. So we're probably in a key where Bm is the i chord.

So possible keys where Bm is tonic: B natural minor, B harmonic minor, B melodic minor.

B natural minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. Chords: i Bm, ii° C#dim, III D, iv Em, v F#m, VI G, VII A.

Look at the progression: G/B (which is G major, so VI), D/A is D major (III), C/B is C major—wait, C natural isn't in B natural minor; it should be C#. So C major would be a bII chord? But that's unusual. And Am6: A minor with F#. In B natural minor, the A chord is VII, which is A major (since the seventh note is A natural in the scale? Wait no—in B natural minor scale, the notes are B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. So the A chord would be A major? Wait, the seventh degree in natural minor is minor? Let's build the VII chord: A, C#, E? No.

Wait, scale degrees for B natural minor:
1: B
2: C#
3: D
4: E
5: F#
6: G
7: A

So triads:
i: B D F# → Bm
ii°: C# E G → C#dim
III: D F# A → D
iv: E G B → Em
v: F# A C# → F#m
VI: G B D → G
VII: A C# E → A major? Wait, A C# E is A major. But in natural minor, the VII chord is major because the 7th scale degree is a whole step below tonic.

But in the progression, we have C major (C, E, G). C natural isn't in B natural minor; it should be C#. So C major would imply a C natural, which is a flattened second (bII) in B minor. But bII is not diatonic; it's a borrowed chord.

Also, Am6: A minor with F#. A minor in B natural minor would be the VII chord, but in natural minor, the VII chord is A major (A, C#, E). To have A minor, we'd need C natural instead of C#, so A, C, E. But Am6 adds F#, so notes A, C, E, F#. So F# is the 6th. In A minor, the natural 6th is F, so F# is raised. This happens in A harmonic minor (where the 7th is raised to G#), but harmonic minor has F natural. Melodic minor ascending has F# and G#. So Am6 (A, C, E, F#) fits A melodic minor ascending.

But how does this relate to the key centered on Bm?

Maybe the key is D major. In D major, Bm is the vi chord. But the progression starts and ends on Bm, so it would be in the relative minor of D major, which is B minor. So B natural minor.

But earlier, we have C major chord, which isn't in B natural minor. Unless it's a modal mixture.

Let's look at the chord progression structure:

Bm Bm G/B G/B | Bm Bm D/A C/B | Bm Bm G/B G/B | Bm Bm Am6 Bm

So grouping:

- First part: Bm, G/B (G major)
- Then: Bm, D/A (D major), C/B (C major)
- Then repeats: Bm, G/B
- Ending with Bm, Am6, Bm

Common minor key progressions often use bVI (G major here in B minor), III (D major), but C major is bVII? Wait, in B minor, bVII would be A major, not C.

Wait, in B natural minor, the chords are:

i: Bm
ii°: C#dim
III: D
iv: Em
v: F#m
VI: G
VII: A

So G major is VI, D major is III, but C major isn't there. C natural would be bII. But in minor keys, sometimes chords are borrowed from other modes. For example, in B Dorian, the notes would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. So the chords would include G#dim, not C major.

Wait, another idea: maybe it's in E minor. E natural minor: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. Chords: i Em, ii° F#dim, III G, iv Am, v Bm, VI C, VII D.

But our progression starts with Bm, which would be the v chord in E minor. Not likely the tonic.

Wait, Bm as tonic. Let's consider the chord C/B. C major over B bass. The notes are B, C, E, G. So the chord is C major, but with B in the bass. This creates a B half-diminished 7th? B, D, F#, A is Bm7b5. But here it's C/B: B, C, E, G. So actually, it's a G9 chord without the root? G9 is G, B, D, F#, A. But here we have C/B: B, C, E, G. So perhaps it's functioning as a dominant chord resolving to Bm? C major to Bm is a semitone resolution, which is common (bII - i in minor).

In minor keys, the bII chord (Neapolitan) is common. So in B minor, bII is C major. Yes! So C major is the Neapolitan chord, flattened second scale degree.

Also, D major: in B minor, III is D major (D, F#, A). That's diatonic in natural minor.

G major: VI in B minor.

Am6: A minor with F#. In B minor, the A chord is usually A major (VII), but here it's A minor. A minor would require C natural instead of C#, so it's a borrowed chord from Dorian mode? B Dorian has C natural. Because B Dorian is the second mode of A major: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. Wait no, that has C#, not C natural.

Wait, B Dorian should have C natural. Let's get this right.

The Dorian mode has a minor third and major sixth. To have C natural in B Dorian, the scale would be B, C, D, E, F#, G, A. Is that a standard mode?

Yes! Let's see: which major scale has B as its second degree? If B is the second note, the major scale starts on A. But A major has C#, so B Dorian would be B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. Not C natural.

Wait, no: the key of G major has notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So the second mode is A Dorian: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Third mode is B Phrygian: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A. Oh! B Phrygian.

B Phrygian mode: starting on B of G major scale. G major: 1G, 2A, 3B, 4C, 5D, 6E, 7F#. So the third mode is B Phrygian: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A.

Yes! So B Phrygian scale: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A.

Now, let's check the chords in B Phrygian.

The characteristic chords:

i: Bm (B, D, F#)
bII: C (C, E, G) — because the second note is C natural
III: D (D, F#, A)
iv: Em (E, G, B)
v: F#m (F#, A, C#) — but wait, in B Phrygian, the fifth note is F#, sixth is G, seventh is A. So the v chord would be F#, A, C — but C natural, so F# diminished? Let's build triads properly.

B Phrygian notes: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A.

i: B D F# → Bm
bII: C E G → C
III: D F# A → D
iv: E G B → Em
bV: F# A C → F#dim? Or F#m? Wait F# A C is F# diminished (since C is not C#). Normally in major scales, diminished chords are on vii. But here, the fifth degree chord is F# A C, which is F# diminished. But in the progression, we don't have that chord.

Looking at the progression: Bm, G/B, D/A, C/B, Am6.

G/B: G major (G, B, D) — in B Phrygian, G is the bVII degree. The bVII chord is G major (G, B, D), which matches.

D/A: D major over A bass → D major (D, F#, A). This is the III chord in B Phrygian.

C/B: C major over B bass → C major (C, E, G). This is the bII chord.

Am6: A minor with F#. A minor is A, C, E; adding F# makes it A C E F#. In B Phrygian, the notes include A and F#, so A C E F# is Am6. But what degree is that? A is the minor seventh scale degree in B Phrygian. The VII chord would normally be A C E → A minor. But with F# added, it's Am6.

In Phrygian mode, the characteristic feature is the bII (C major here), which we have. Also, the progression starts and ends on Bm, which is the tonic i chord.

Now, checking all chords against B Phrygian:

- Bm: i (tonic) — present
- G/B: bVII (G major) — present
- D/A: III (D major) — present
- C/B: bII (C major) — present
- Am6: vii°? Wait, A minor. In Phrygian, the seventh degree chord is minor (vii), but usually it's diminished? Wait in B Phrygian, the seventh note is A, so the chord built on A is A, C, E — A minor. Yes, and with F# added (the sixth scale degree?), but F# is the fifth note in B Phrygian (B, C, D, E, F#...). So Am6 includes the major sixth relative to A, which is F#.

Yes, so Am6 is the VII chord in B Phrygian but with an added sixth (F#), which is diatonic since F# is in the scale.

This all fits B Phrygian mode perfectly.

Earlier confusion was because I was thinking of minor keys, but this progression heavily features the bII chord (C major), which is characteristic of Phrygian mode. The Neapolitan chord in minor keys is similar, but in Phrygian mode, bII is diatonic.

Additionally, the use of III (D major) and bVII (G major) are common in minor keys, but the presence of bII as a primary chord points strongly to Phrygian.

So the key is B, and the mode is Phrygian.


### **Key and Mode Analysis**  
**Progression:**  
`Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm`  

---

### **1. Core Harmonic Structure**  
- **List of unique chords** (ignoring bass notes for scale analysis):  
  - `Bm` (B, D, F#)  
  - `G` (G, B, D) → from `G/B`  
  - `D` (D, F#, A) → from `D/A`  
  - `C` (C, E, G) → from `C/B`  
  - `Am6` (A, C, E, F#)  

- **Notes used across all chords**:  
  `A, B, C, D, E, F#, G`  
  → This is **exactly the G major scale** (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#).  

---

### **2. Why B Phrygian?**  
The **tonic chord is Bm** (repeated 10 times, starting/ending the progression). For `Bm` to be the tonic, we need to identify the **mode where B is the tonal center** and the notes match `A, B, C, D, E, F#, G`.  

- **B Phrygian** is the **3rd mode of the G major scale**:  
  - G major scale: `G A B C D E F#`  
  - Starting on **B**: `B C D E F# G A` → **B Phrygian**.  

#### **Chord Analysis in B Phrygian**:  
| Chord | Scale Degree | Role in Mode |  
|-------|--------------|-------------|  
| `Bm`  | **i** (tonic) | Primary center |  
| `G`   | **♭VII**      | Common in minor/Phrygian |  
| `D`   | **III**       | Diatonic major chord |  
| `C`   | **♭II**       | **Defining trait of Phrygian** (minor 2nd interval) |  
| `Am6` | **vii** (with added 6th) | `Am6` = `A C E F#` (F# is diatonic to Phrygian) |  

#### **Why Phrygian and not Natural Minor?**  
- In **B natural minor** (Aeolian), the ♭II chord would be `C#°` (not `C major`).  
- The **♭II chord (`C`)** in this progression is **diatonic to Phrygian** (due to the minor 2nd: `B→C`), making it the signature sound.  
- `Am6` (with F#) fits perfectly: F# is the **5th scale degree** in B Phrygian (`B C D E F#`), not borrowed.  

---

### **3. Phrygian vs. Other Modes**  
- **Not Dorian**: B Dorian (from A major) would have `C#` and `G#`, but we have `C` and `G`.  
- **Not Aeolian (natural minor)**: Lacks ♭II (`C`); B minor’s ♭II is `C#°`, not `C`.  
- **Not Harmonic/Melodic Minor**: These alter the 7th degree (e.g., B harmonic minor has `A#`), but we have `A` and `G`.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
- **Tonic**: **B** (all phrases resolve to `Bm`).  
- **Mode**: **Phrygian** (defined by the **♭II chord `C`** and the **B–C half-step**).  
- **Key Context**: B Phrygian is the **3rd mode of G major**, but **tonicized on B**.  

✅ **Final Answer**: **Key of B, Phrygian mode**.  

#### *Why this works*:  
- The ♭II (`C`) creates exotic tension typical of Flamenco, metal, or film scores.  
- `Am6` ≈ `vii` with added 6th (F#), reinforcing the Phrygian color.  
- Classic Phrygian cadence: **♭II → i** (`C/B → Bm`).  

This progression **isn’t** in B minor—it’s **Phrygian** because the ♭II is structural, not borrowed. 🎸

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

### Given Chords:
```
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm
```

We can group them for clarity:
```
| Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | D/A | C/B | Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | Am6 | Bm |
```

### Step 1: Look at the Root Notes
Let’s extract the root of each chord:
- Bm → B
- G/B → B (inverted G chord, but bass note is B)
- D/A → A (A is bass, so likely functioning as A-related harmony)
- C/B → B (bass note is B)
- Am6 → A (Am6 is A–C–E–F#)

But let’s list the **chord roots** (not just bass notes):
- Bm → B
- G/B → G (chord is G major, first inversion)
- D/A → D (D major, first inversion)
- C/B → C (C major, first inversion)
- Am6 → A

So chord roots:
```
Bm → B
G   → G
D   → D
C   → C
Am6 → A
```

So the chords used are:
- **Bm**
- **G**
- **D**
- **C**
- **Am6**

### Step 2: Determine Possible Key
Let’s look at the chords and see which key they fit in.

List of chords: Bm, G, D, C, Am6

Am6 adds an F#, which is important.

Am6 = A–C–E–F#
So it includes F♯, not F natural.

Now let’s check possible keys.

#### Try: B minor (natural minor)
B natural minor scale: B C♯ D E F♯ G A B

Chords from B natural minor:
- Bm (i)
- C#dim (ii°)
- D (III)
- Em (iv)
- F#m (v)
- G (VI)
- A (VII)

Compare:
- Bm → i ✅
- G → VI ✅
- D → III ✅
- C → not in key (C natural, but key has C#) ❌
- Am6 → Am would be VII, but Am6 includes F#, which fits (F# is in key). A–C–E–F# is Am6, and all these notes are in B natural minor ✅

But **C major chord** (C–E–G) contains **C natural**, which is **not** in B natural minor (has C#), so C major is **outside** the key.

So if we have a **C major chord**, that’s a chromatic chord in B minor.

But wait — could it be **B Dorian**?

#### Try: B Dorian mode
Dorian is a minor mode with a raised 6th.

B Dorian: B C# D E F# G# A B

Wait — G#? But we have a **G major chord** (G–B–D) — that has **G natural**, not G# — so **G major** doesn't fit B Dorian (needs G#) ❌

How about **B Aeolian**? That’s just natural minor — same issue with C.

Wait — maybe the key is **D major**?

### Try: Key of D major
D major scale: D E F# G A B C#

Chords:
- D (I)
- Em (ii)
- F#m (iii)
- G (IV)
- A (V)
- Bm (vi)
- C#dim (vii°)

Now compare:
- Bm → vi ✅
- G → IV ✅
- D → I ✅
- C → C major — not in key (key has C#) ❌
- Am6 → A–C–E–F# — A is V chord, but Am6 implies a minor v, but in D major, A is major. Also C natural in Am6 — but D major has C# → so **C natural clashes**

Again, **C natural** appears in both C chord and Am6 — but D major has C# — so no.

Wait — **Am6 has C natural**? No!

### Correction: Am6 chord
Am6 = A–C–E–F♯

- A: root
- C: minor third
- E: perfect fifth
- F♯: sixth

So **C is natural minor third** — but the sixth is **F#**, which is **sharp**, not flat.

So pitches: **A, C, E, F#**

So **C natural** is used — but in most keys, you don’t have both C and C#.

But here’s the observation: we have **C natural** in C major chord and in Am6 chord (as minor third), and **no C#** elsewhere.

So likely, the key has **C natural**, not C#.

So the key probably has **B**, **A**, **G**, **F#, E, D, C** — that is: **F# minor**?

Wait — try **G major**?

### Try: G major
G major scale: G A B C D E F#

Chords:
- G (I)
- Am (ii)
- Bm (iii)
- C (IV)
- D (V)
- Em (vi)
- F#dim (vii°)

Now test the chords:
- Bm → iii ✅
- G → I ✅
- D → V ✅ (D major is V in G)
- C → IV ✅
- Am6 → A–C–E–F# — A is ii, but in G major, ii is **Am**, not Am6 — but Am6 uses A, C, E — all in scale — and F# is in G major — so F# is scale degree 7 — so Am6 = Am with added 6th (F#) — which is **diatonic**! ✅

So **Am6** is Am(add6), all notes in G major.

Now check bass notes:
- G/B → B in bass — B is in G chord (G–B–D) so just first inversion — common
- D/A → D major with A in bass — A is fifth of D, so second inversion? D/A = D with A in bass — that’s 2nd inversion of D — also common
- C/B → C major with B in bass — B is major 7th of C — so this is a Cmaj7? C/B suggests a C major chord over B — which implies a Cmaj7/B — which is very common in pop/rock

C/B = C–E–G–B → Cmaj7

In G major, Cmaj7 is IV7 — very common

Now, Bm → B–D–F# — all in G major (iii chord)

So all chords fit G major:

- Bm = iii
- G = I
- D = V
- C = IV
- Am6 = ii6 (or ii(add6))

So progression:
```
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm
iii iii  I     I   iii iii   V    IV   iii iii  I     I   iii iii  ii6  iii
```

Yes — this makes sense.

Now, is Am6 common? Yes — it's just a color version of Am, adding F# (the major sixth above A, hence "add6"). In G major, F# is diatonic.

All chromatic notes? None — all chords are diatonic to G major.

### Final Chord: Bm — ends on iii

Wait — ends on Bm, which is **iii** — not tonic.

But the progression starts and has strong emphasis on Bm — but harmonic function suggests G is tonic.

Let’s count:
- Bm appears 10 times (very frequent)
- G appears 4 times (including G/B)
- D appears once (D/A)
- C appears once (C/B)
- Am6 once

But **most frequent chord is Bm**, but it may not be tonic.

In pop music, sometimes the **tonic is not the most frequent chord**, or the progression is centered elsewhere.

But functionally:
- C/B → Cmaj7/B → moves to Bm — this is IV → iii, which is a common cadence in major keys (weak ending, but valid)
- D/A → V → then C/B → IV — that’s V–IV (a "falling" progression)
- Also G–Bm is I–iii, common submediant move

But let’s look at voice leading and possible resolution.

The sequence: D/A → C/B → Bm

That's V → IV → iii — a descending bass line: D → C → B

Very linear, common in pop/rock.

Also: G/B → Bm? G/B is G major with B in bass → moves to Bm → same bass note (B), so B remains — G–B–D → B–D–F# — so G → F#, D → D, B→B — smooth voice leading.

So it’s plausible.

But **does the piece feel like it’s in B minor or G major**?

Even though Bm is frequent, it functions more like **iii** in G major.

Moreover:
- The chords D, G, C — form a IV–I–V–IV backbone in G
- Am6 is ii chord
- Bm is iii — all diatonic

No accidentals — all fit G major.

Now, the final chord is Bm — ends on iii — which is **not** conclusive, but could be intentional (e.g., a deceptive or floating ending).

But let's consider: could it be **B Aeolian** (B natural minor)?

B minor key: B C# D E F# G A

But:
- G major chord: G–B–D → G is **not** in B minor (B minor has G#) — wait no: **B natural minor** has **G natural**, not G#.

B natural minor: B C# D E F# G A → yes, G is in the scale → so G is ♭VI

D → D is ii° (diminished)? D–F–A → minor chord — Dm

But we have **D major** (D–F#–A) — has F# — so D chord has F# — **D major** is **not** in B natural minor — because B minor has **F#**, yes — but D major is D–F#–A — F# and A are in B minor, yes — but what about the third?

B minor has D and F#, so D–F#–A = **D major** — but in B minor, the ii chord should be D–F–A = Dm — but we have D **major**, which has **F#**, so it's **D major** — which requires **F#**, which is in B minor?

Wait: B natural minor scale: B C# D E F# G A

So:
- D to F# is **major third** — D–F#–A = D major chord

Yes! So D major chord is **not diatonic** to B natural minor — because the ii chord in minor is **diminished** or **minor**, but in natural minor, the ii chord is **D–F–A** — F **natural**.

But in B natural minor: 
- D is the 3rd scale degree
- Scale: B C# D E F# G A
- So triads: 
  - Bm (B–D–F#) → i
  - C#dim (C#–E–G) → ii°
  - Dm? D–F–A → F **natural** — but B minor has **F#**, not F natural → so D–F–A would require F natural — which is **not** in B natural minor.

Wait! **Mistake here.**

B natural minor:
- B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A, B

So the **third note is D**, but interval from D:
- D to F# = major third (D–F#)
- D to A = fifth
- So D–F#–A = **D major chord**

Wait — yes! In B natural minor, the III chord (from 3rd degree) is **D major**, because:
- D–F#–A → F# is in the scale

So chord on D is **D major**, which is **III** in B minor.

Similarly:
- G is on 6th degree → G–B–D → G major → **♭VI**
- C is C–E–G — E and G are in scale, but **C natural** — C is not in B minor (which has C#) → so C major chord has **C natural**, but B minor has **C#** → so C major is **not** in B minor.

Ah — here’s the problem.

C major: C–E–G — requires **C natural**

But B minor has **C#** — so **C natural is outside** the key — so C chord cannot be in B minor.

Similarly, Am6: A–C–E–F# — A is VII in B minor (A–C#–E) — but Am6 has **C natural**, not C# — so again, **C natural** — not in B minor.

So **C natural** appears in both C major and Am6 (as minor third) — but B minor has C# — so this key cannot be B minor.

Back to **G major** — which has **C natural** (IV), F# (leading tone), and A, B, D, E, G — all fit.

And Am6: A–C–E–F# — all in G major.

So everything fits **G major**.

Chords:
- Bm = iii
- G = I
- D = V
- C = IV
- Am6 = ii(add6)

Progression outline:
Lots of iii and I, some IV, V, and a ii6.

Common in pop music to emphasize iii.

Ends on Bm (iii), but that’s fine — doesn't have to end on tonic.

### Final Answer:
- **Key**: G major
- **Mode**: Ionian (major)

But wait — is it possible it's **B Dorian**?

B Dorian: B C# D E F# G# A

But we have G major chord — G–B–D — G **natural**, but Dorian has G# — so no.

How about **E Dorian**? Bm = iv? Unlikely.

No — only **G major** fits all chords.

### Conclusion:
🎵 **Key: G major**  
🎵 **Mode: Ionian**  

All chords are diatonic:
- Bm = iii
- G = I
- D = V
- C = IV
- Am6 = ii(add6) — with F# the added sixth (diatonic)

C/B implies Cmaj7, common in pop.

Final chord Bm doesn't change key — could be an imperfect cadence or stylistic.

✅ **Answer: Key is G major, Mode is Ionian.**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: "Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm". They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to list out all the chords without the bass notes for simplicity. So the progression is: Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, D/A, C/B, Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, Am6, Bm. Now, the slash chords like G/B and D/A mean the bass note is specified, but the chord itself is G major and D major respectively. Similarly, C/B is a C major chord with B in the bass, which is often used as a passing chord or part of a different function.

Let me write down the actual chords ignoring the bass notes for now. So G/B is still G major, D/A is D major, C/B is C major. Am6 is A minor sixth, which is A-C-E-F#. Wait, but in the context of key, maybe it's better to think of the root chords. So the distinct chords are Bm, G, D, C, Am6.

Now, let's look at the root notes: B, G, D, C, A. So the chords are on B, G, D, C, A. But the key might be based on the tonal center. Typically, the key is determined by which chord feels like home, the tonic. Let's see how many times each chord appears. The progression starts and ends with Bm, and there are multiple Bm chords. Let me count:

- Bm appears at the start, then again after the first two G/B, then after D/A and C/B, and so on. Let's count all Bm occurrences: positions 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,16. So that's 9 times. G/B appears twice at start (but that's G), then later twice, so total 4 G chords. D/A is one D chord. C/B is one C chord. Am6 once. So Bm is the most frequent, but is it the tonic?

Wait, B minor. Let's see the notes in B minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. The chords from B minor natural key: i is Bm, ii° is C#dim, III is D, IV is Em, v is F#m, VI is G, VII is A. Wait, but in the progression, we have G major and D major. In B minor, the VI chord is G major, and III is D major. But here, there's also a C chord. C major? In B natural minor, the C would be C#dim, which is C#-E-G. But here we have C major, which is C-E-G. That doesn't fit B natural minor. Similarly, Am6 is A minor sixth, which would be A-C-E-F#. But in B minor, A is the VII chord, which is A major. But here it's Am6, which is minor sixth, so A minor with added sixth.

Wait, maybe it's in D major? Let's check D major key: D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#. Chords: D, Em, F#m, G, Am, Bm, C#dim. If the key is D major, then Bm would be the vi chord. But the chord C is not in D major; D major has C#, so C natural would be from outside the key. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's in G major? G major chords: G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim. Let's see. G major: G is I, A minor is ii, Bm is iii, C is IV, D is V, Em is vi, F#dim is vii°. Now look at the chord progression: Bm (iii), G (I), D (V), C (IV), Am6. Wait, Am6 would be A minor with added sixth, which in G major is the ii chord (Am), but adding the sixth would make it A-C-E-F#. In G major scale, F# is the leading tone, so F natural would be outside. Wait, Am6 would have F# if it's Am6, but in standard, Am6 is A-C-E-F#, which in G major, that's correct because F# is in the scale. Wait G major has F#, so Am6 is A-C-E-F#, which is part of the scale. Let's check.

In G major: scale is G A B C D E F#. So Am6 would be A minor chord with sixth F#, which is correct—A-C-E-F#. But usually, we just say Am, but Am6 specifies the added note. But the presence of A minor chord is okay in G major. Similarly, Bm is iii, G is I, D is V, C is IV. The chords present are Bm, G, D, C, Am6. All of these are diatonic to G major except... Wait, Am6 is still part of G major. Am is the ii chord, and adding the sixth (F#) is still part of the scale.

But looking back at the progression, the main chords are Bm, G, D, C, A minor (with sixth). So if we're in G major, then the tonic would be G. But the progression starts and ends on Bm. However, sometimes songs start on a chord that's not the tonic but still in the key. But if the piece seems to resolve to G, but here the last chord is Bm, which might not be the tonic. Wait, let's see the progression again:

Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, D/A, C/B, Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, Am6, Bm.

So ends on Bm. But if in G major, Bm is iii, so it's not the tonic. But the presence of D major and C major, which in G major are V and IV chords. So it might be in the key of G major, but starting on iii. But maybe the tonal center is G? Let's see the chords: G, C, D are the primary chords in G major: I, IV, V. And Bm is iii, which is a common chord. So even though it starts on Bm, the key could still be G major. Let me check if that fits.

Alternatively, maybe it's B minor. But earlier I thought B natural minor has D major as III, G major as VI, but the chords of C major and D major would conflict. Because in B natural minor, the scale is B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. So chords would be Bm (i), C#dim (ii°), D (III), Em (iv), F#m (v), G (VI), A (VII). So the VII chord is A major. But in the given progression, we have C chord. Wait, C natural major chord. In B natural minor, there is no C natural. The note is C natural? Wait, the scale has C#, so C natural would be a chromatic note, which is possible, but perhaps not diatonic. Similarly, D/A is D major, which in B natural minor is the III chord (D major), which is okay. G major is VI, okay. But C major chord—C-E-G—would require a C natural. But in B natural minor scale, the third note is C#, so C natural is not present. So the C chord would be borrowed. But the chord C/B—C major with B bass, which is often used as a passing chord. But if the key were B natural minor, then having a C major chord would be outside the scale. Unless we're using a different mode.

Wait, maybe B Dorian? Dorian mode has a minor third and major sixth. Let's check. B Dorian scale: B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. Wait no, Dorian mode on B would be B C# D E F# G# A? Wait, no. Let's recall Dorian mode is minor with a raised sixth. So starting on B: B C# D E F# G# A B. The scale has F# and G#, but in the chords we have a C chord, which is C major (C-E-G). In B Dorian, the C would be C# or C natural? The B Dorian scale has C# as the second note. So a C natural chord would not be part of the mode. So probably not.

Wait, let's consider E minor. E natural minor scale: E F# G A B C D. Chords: Em (i), F#dim (ii°), G (III), Am (iv), Bm (v), C (VI), D (VII). So here, C major is VI. So if the key is E minor, then the chords Bm is v, G is III, D is VII, C is VI. Let's see the progression:

Bm is present. G major is III. D major is VII. C major is VI. And then Am6. In E minor, the Am chord would be the iv chord, which is A minor. Am6 would be Am with added F#, but in E natural minor, F# is part of the scale. So Am6 would be A-C-E-F#, which fits because F# is in E minor.

But let's see. The progression has Bm, G, D, C, A minor. If key is E minor, then the V chord would be B major (dominant), but here we have Bm. Which is minor, not major. So that's a problem. In natural minor, the V chord is minor, but usually in classical, it's raised to major for the leading tone. However, if it's purely E natural minor, then V chord is Bm. Then in the progression, D chord is VII (D major), C is VI (C major), etc. Let's see if all chords fit E minor.

E natural minor: E F# G A B C D.

Chords:

i: Em

ii°: F#dim

III: G

iv: Am

v: Bm

VI: C

VII: D

Yes, exactly. So Bm is v chord, G is III, D is VII, C is VI, Am is iv. So the progression has all these chords. But in the progression given, the chords are Bm, G/B (so G major), D/A (D major), C/B (C major), and Am6 (A minor sixth). In E minor, Am6 would be A-C-E-F#, but in the E natural minor scale, the sixth note is C, but the sixth degree is the A note, so A minor chord with added sixth: the sixth above A is F#, which is in the scale. Wait yes, E minor scale has F#. So Am6 would be A-C-E-F#, which fits.

But the tonal center here would be E minor. But the progression starts and ends with Bm. So if it's E minor, then Bm is the v chord. However, the progression is mostly Bm, which might make someone think the tonic is B minor. But if the key is E minor, then the tonic is E. But in the chord progression given, there's no E chord at all. All chords are Bm, G, D, C, Am. So if the key is E minor, then E isn't present, but sometimes pieces don't have the tonic chord all the time. For example, in many songs, the tonic might not be played frequently, or it's implied. Let's check if the chords relate to E.

Another way: let's see the note that seems to be the tonic. Let's list all notes in the chords. Bm is B, D, F#. G/B would be G, B, D but bass on B. D/A is D, F#, A. C/B is C, E, G with bass B. Am6 is A, C, E, F#. Bm again. So the notes present are B, D, F#, G, C, E, A.

If we collect all the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#. Wait, that's the E natural minor scale: E F# G A B C D. Wait, the notes are E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. So the notes in the chords are A, B, C, D, E, F#. So missing E? Wait, E is present in some chords. For example, in the Am6 chord: A, C, E, F#. Yes, E is there. Also, in Bm: B, D, F#; G has G, B, D; D/A has D, F#, A; C/B has C, E, G (wait, C major is C, E, G. C/B would have B in bass, but the chord still has C, E, G). So notes present: A, B, C, D, E, F#. That's exactly the E natural minor scale (E, F#, G, A, B, C, D). So all the notes fit into E natural minor. E minor has exactly those notes. So that's a strong indicator that the key is E minor.

But then why does the progression start and end on Bm? In E minor, Bm is the v chord, which is the dominant chord. But the tonic is E. However, if the song doesn't have E chord but uses the tonic in the melody, maybe it's still in E minor. Alternatively, maybe the piece is in B minor, but we saw that the C chord doesn't fit. Wait, in B natural minor, the scale has B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. But in the notes we have from chords, like C natural (from C major chord), which isn't in B natural minor. So C natural is outside. So if the chords use C natural, which would not be part of B minor. So that suggests that key is not B minor.

But E natural minor has all those notes. So the presence of C natural chord makes sense because in E minor, the C is the VI chord. Similarly, D is the VII chord. So if the key is E minor, then all chords are diatonic.

Wait, but in E natural minor, the chords are Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D. Let's check:

- Bm: yes, that's the v chord.

- G: III

- D: VII

- C: VI

- Am: iv

- Am6: Am with added sixth (F#), which is still within the scale.

So all these chords fit perfectly into E minor. So even though there's no E chord at all, the chords are all part of E natural minor scale. The tonic is E, which isn't present, but that's possible. Sometimes songs don't use the tonic chord. For example, Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" has a section that's in A minor but starts on F chord or something. So the tonic might still be E minor.

But another way to check: what is the most common chord? Bm appears 9 times, which is very frequent. Next is G and D perhaps. But in E natural minor, Bm is the v. But in rock/pop, sometimes the song might be in a minor key where the v chord is used a lot. But usually, the tonic chord would be present at least once, but not always. However, considering that all the chords fit into E minor, and there is no chord with F#, C#, or G#, which would be other modes.

Wait, but in E natural minor, we have no C# in the scale. So if the chords have only these notes, then E minor makes sense. Let's check: in E minor natural scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. All these are natural notes except that it's all white keys if starting from E. Wait, E minor natural has the same key signature as G major: one sharp (F#). So yes, all notes fit.

So the key would be E minor. But why does the progression start and end on Bm? If it's E minor, then the tonic is E, not Bm. But perhaps the melody centers around E, even if the chords avoid E. Alternatively, perhaps the key is B minor, but with accidentals? Let me check another mode.

What about B Aeolian? Wait Aeolian is natural minor, same as B natural minor. But then scale is B C# D E F# G A. But in the progression, there is a C chord, which has C natural. But B natural minor has C#, so C natural would be a chromatic note. So that's inconsistent. Therefore, B minor can't be the key because of the C major chord.

Alternatively, maybe B Dorian? B Dorian mode scale: B C# D E F# G# A. Wait, Dorian has a raised sixth. So B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. So the scale would have G# instead of G. But in our progression, the G chord is mentioned. Wait, the chord G/B is G major, which would be G-B-D. But in B Dorian, the note G is G natural, but Dorian has G# if? Let's see: B Dorian: the mode of A major. A major has F#, C#, G#, D#, etc. Wait, B Dorian would be the second mode of A major. So A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. So the B Dorian scale is B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. So the scale has G#, not G natural. But in the chord G/B, which is G major, that would require G natural. So in B Dorian, G is G#? No, because G# is the seventh note in A major, so in B Dorian, the seventh scale degree is G#.

Wait, let's list B Dorian intervals:

B (root), C# (2), D (3), E (4), F# (5), G# (6), A (7), B.

Wait, no: the Dorian mode is minor third and major sixth. So for B Dorian:

1. B (minor third is D natural, fourth is E, fifth is F#, sixth is G#? Let's see.

Wait, Dorian mode has a minor third and a major sixth. So for example, D Dorian is D E F G A B C D. So D minor third is F natural, but sixth is B natural. So B Dorian would be B C# D E F# G# A. So the sixth note is G#. So in B Dorian, you have G#, not G natural. So having a G major chord (G natural) would not fit because the scale has G#.

Therefore, the presence of G natural suggests that the key isn't Dorian.

What if it's C Lydian? Probably not. Let's think again. The chords have notes A, B, C, D, E, F#. That's exactly the E natural minor scale (since E natural minor is A minor's relative major? Wait, E natural minor shares the same key signature as G major: F# only. So chords have those notes.

So if all the chords are part of E minor, then the key is E minor.

Another check: the common practice is to look at the tonic chord, but if not present, look for which chord provides resolution. But in this progression: it starts on Bm, then goes to G/B (which is G major with B bass), which is a G chord. Then Bm again. Let's see possible cadences. For example, the D chord to G chord: D and G together could be a V-I in C major? Wait, but we're checking E minor.

In E minor, the main chords are Em (i), Am (iv), Bm (v), C (VI), D (VII). So the progression uses v, III, VII, VI. Now, the chord progression sometimes might cycle through these. For example, a common progression in E minor is: Bm - C - D - Em. But in this case, there's no Em. But it has Am6 and Bm.

Alternatively, maybe it's G major, but then the note F# is present. In G major, scale is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So notes: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. Now, check the chords: Bm is iii, G is I, D is V, C is IV, Am6 is A minor sixth (A-C-E-F#), which is diatonic. But in G major, the sixth chord would be Em. Am is the ii chord. So Am6 is A minor with added sixth, which is F#, so yes, fits. But why would the key be G major then? Let's see, the tonic would be G. But the progression does not have a G chord that is resolved to G or something. Wait, the G chords are present: two G/B chords early on, then again later. So G major is present as I. And it starts on Bm (iii), and G is in the progression. But the piece ends on Bm. If in G major, Bm is iii, then it's not the tonic. So the tonic could be G. But again, if there's no clear resolution to G, but Bm is the main chord.

Wait, but in G major, the chords would all fit. However, in B minor context, there were conflicts with the C chord. But if it's E minor vs G major...

Wait, E natural minor and G major share the same key signature: one sharp (F#). They're relative minor and major. So both are possible. How to distinguish between them?

Typically, the key is determined by the tonal center. Which chord feels like home. Let's look at the chord progression: it's mostly Bm. If the music feels like it's resolving to Bm, then perhaps the key is B minor. But earlier we saw that B minor natural doesn't include C natural chord. However, if the piece uses C natural, then it's not B minor. Unless the C chord is borrowed. But let's see if there's another possibility.

Wait, what if it's B minor but with a C major chord as a borrowed chord from the parallel major? B major scale has B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So B major's key signature has five sharps. B minor natural is as before. But if the piece uses C major chord (C-E-G), that would be chromatic.

Alternatively, maybe the key is C major? C major has no sharps. Chords would be C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim. Check the chords in the progression: Bm—that's B minor, which in C major would be the vii° chord? No, C major's vii° is Bdim. But in our chords, it's Bm, which is minor, not diminished. So Bm wouldn't fit in C major because in C major, B is Bdim. So that's not possible.

Back to E minor vs G major. Let's see the notes in all chords. The progression has: Bm = B, D, F#; G is G, B, D; D/A is D, A, F#; C/B is C, E, G (since C/B is C major with bass B); Am6 is A, C, E, F#. So all notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#. Both E minor and G major have all these notes. So which one is it?

The difference is who is the tonic. To determine this, sometimes the presence of a chord that acts as a dominant would help. For example, in G major, the V chord is D major. Which we have. In E minor, the dominant chord (V) would be B major usually (for a strong cadence), but here the v chord is B minor. In E minor, the natural minor has Bm as v, but often the V chord is raised to B major for a stronger cadence. But if the song uses Bm instead, then it could be E natural minor. But if it's using G major, then the D chord is V, so maybe there's a V-I cadence to G. However, in this progression, how often does D resolve to G? Let's look:

Looking at the progression:

Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B,...

So G/B is G major with B bass. Then Bm again. So maybe G to Bm. In G major, that would be I to iii. In E minor, that's III to v.

Not sure. Another way: look for the tonic chord. If there's never an E chord, but in E minor the tonic is E, so if the melody centers on E, but we have no chord. Whereas in G major, the tonic is G. The progression has G chords present. Let's see: G/B appears multiple times. G chord is present. So G is the tonic chord for key of G? But then Bm is iii, which is fine.

But then why would it end on Bm? That's unusual. Usually, a song would end on tonic. But not always. For example, "Hey There Delilah" ends on the subdominant. So maybe.

Wait, let's check the specific progression again. The progression is: Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | D/A | C/B | Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | Am6 | Bm.

Let's see the movement between chords. Starting on Bm, then G (but as G/B, which is G major). So Bm to G. In G major, Bm is iii, G is I. So I to iii is possible. In E minor, G is III and Bm is v. So v to III.

Another spot: D/A is D major with bass A, so D chord. Then C/B, which is C major with bass B. Then Bm. So D to C to Bm. In G major: D is V, C is IV, Bm is iii. So V-IV-iii. In E minor, D is VII, C is VI, Bm is v. VII-VI-v.

The Am6 comes before last Bm. So Am6 to Bm. In E minor: iv to v. In G major: vi to iii.

Another cadence: the D/A followed by C/B then Bm. If it's E minor, VII-VI-v. In some styles, the VII chord can act as a lead-in to V, but here it's going to v. But in minor keys, sometimes VII is used to resolve to i? Let's see.

But without hearing it, it's hard. However, considering that all the chords are diatonic to both G major and E minor, which are relative keys. So the key could be either, but the mode would be minor (E minor) or major (G major), depending on tonic.

To decide between them, we can see which note is the tonal center. For example, if the melody uses the E note a lot, then it's E minor. If it uses G note a lot, then G major. Without hearing the melody, we can look at the chords. But in the progression given, the bass note: for example, G/B means bass is B, so the chord is G, but bass on B. Similarly D/A is D chord with A bass. So the bass notes are: B, B, B, B, B, B, A, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, A, B.

Wait, looking at bass notes: the progression as written: Bm (so bass B?), G/B (bass B), G/B (B), Bm (B), Bm (B), D/A (A), C/B (B), Bm (B), etc. So the bass notes are mostly B and A. So the bass is going between B and A a lot. In G major, the A would be the ii, but not sure. In E minor, the A would be D (wait E minor scale notes: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. So A is the fourth scale degree. So if bass is going between A and B, that could be IV-I or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, the presence of B as frequent bass note could make B the tonal center. But that would be B minor. But again, C chord is a problem. Because in B minor, C is C# in the scale. So having C major chord (C natural) would conflict. Unless it's a chromatic chord.

Wait, if all the chords fit into a single scale, then that scale's tonic is likely the key. Let's find the scale that contains all the chord tones. Chord tones present:

Bm: B, D, F#

G: G, B, D

D: D, F#, A

C: C, E, G

Am6: A, C, E, F#

So all notes: B, D, F#, G, A, C, E. What scale contains all these notes?

List of notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#. That's six notes. Missing G# or G natural? These notes are A, B, C, D, E, F#. So that's the E natural minor scale (E, F#, G, A, B, C, D). Wait, but that includes G natural. Wait, in the list above, G is present in the G chord. Yes. So notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. All seven notes of E natural minor. So all notes in the progression are within the E natural minor scale. The same as G major.

So the key is E minor or G major. To decide between them, we can look at which note is emphasized as the tonic. But without melody, hard to say. However, in the chord progression, the most common chord is Bm. In G major, Bm is iii, which is the mediant chord. In E minor, Bm is v chord. If the song feels like it's in E minor with Bm as the main chord, which is the dominant, then it's E minor. But usually, dominant is the V chord. For example, in E minor, the dominant chord (V) is B major for a strong cadence, but if using B minor, then it's not. However, in natural minor, the v chord is minor, which is common in some genres.

Alternatively, looking at the bass line. The bass notes are mostly B and A. In E minor, E is the tonic. But if the bass is going A to B, that's IV to V in E minor. Because in E minor, A is the IV chord root, B is the V root. Wait, but in E minor, the V chord is usually B major. But here, the B chord is minor. So the bass might be going A (subdominant) to B (but minor). However, the progression has chords like Am6, which is Am with sixth (A minor), so A is the root. Then C/B: C chord with B bass. C is the VI chord. Maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the key based on the last chord. Ending on Bm. If it's E minor, the ending on Bm could be a half cadence (V), which is common. If it's G major, ending on iii would be unusual. Usually songs end on tonic. So ending on Bm (v in E minor) could be a half cadence, but not typical. However, in some songs, they might end on v. But usually it's tonic. However, the question is just about the key and mode. So perhaps E minor.

Wait another way: look at the chords that create a cadence. For example, in the D/A followed by C/B then Bm: D (V in G?), but in G major, D is V. C is IV. So V-IV. Then Bm is iii. Not a standard cadence. In E minor: D is VII, C is VI, then Bm v. VII-VI-v. Not a standard cadence.

Alternatively, when it goes from C/B to Bm: in E minor, C is VI, Bm v. VI to v. Or in G major: C is IV, Bm iii. IV to iii.

Not sure. Another approach: common progression in E minor with these chords is something like v-iv-III-...? Not sure.

Wait, here's another idea. The presence of Am6 (A minor sixth). In E minor, Am is iv chord. In G major, Am is ii chord. So if there's an Am chord, it could be either.

But perhaps we can look for a dominant function. In E minor, the dominant chord would be B major, but here it's B minor. Which means there's no dominant chord. However, in some modes, the dominant is minor. But minor keys usually use dominant major for cadences. So if there's no major V chord, then perhaps it's in natural minor.

But let's think about the chords again. Let's list all chords in their root position for simplicity:

Bm (B, D, F#), G (G, B, D), D (D, F#, A), C (C, E, G), Am (A, C, E), and Am6 adds F# (so A, C, E, F#).

Now, if we look at possible key center. Let's assume the tonic is the note where the other chords resolve. But without melody, hard.

Another method: find all the notes and see if they fit a single key. They do: all in E natural minor and G major. So the key is either E minor or G major. To distinguish, sometimes the presence of a chord like D is V in G major, but in E minor D is VII. But if the song has a cadence using VII-VI-... In E minor, VII is D major. So D major can act as a dominant to E minor? But in natural minor, D major is VII, which typically does not resolve strongly to E minor. However, if the melody uses E notes a lot, then E minor.

Alternatively, considering that G is in the chords a lot. The chord G is present multiple times. In G major, G is tonic. In E minor, G is III. Not sure.

Wait, the progression starts with Bm and then G. If it's G major, then G is tonic, so Bm is iii. Starting on iii chord is possible. If it's E minor, starting on v. But maybe the first chord is tonic. Let's see.

But typically the first chord is the tonic or a subdominant. However, many songs start on any chord.

Alternatively, think of the chord progression as a loop. Another approach: looking for relative major/minor. Since they share notes, but the mode would be minor or major.

Given that the question is to determine key and mode, and considering all chords fit E minor (natural minor mode), or G major (major mode). To distinguish, perhaps look at the most common chord. Bm is most repeated. In E minor, Bm is v. In G major, Bm is iii. But in many cases, the v chord being frequent could point to minor key where the v chord is prominent. However, in rock music, minor keys often have I and v as main chords.

Wait, another clue: the chord C/B. C major with B bass. This is equivalent to a B minor seventh flat five or something? Wait, C major with B bass is B-C-E-G. Which is a Bm7b5 or Bø7 chord. But the root is C, with bass B. So B-C-E-G. Which is B half-diminished. However, in the context of E minor, the vii°7 chord is F#dim. Not matching. In G major, the vii°7 is Bdim. So B-C-E-G would be Bø7 in G major, which is a half-diminished seventh chord. That is, it's the chord built on the seventh of G major. So it might be part of the G major key. But the chord is labeled C/B, which is a C major chord with B bass. Typically C/B would be played as C major chord but with B as lowest note. However, as a chord symbol, it's C major with B bass. So the structure is B, C, E, G. Which is Bm7b5.

If the song is using that chord as a vii half-diminished in G major, that might suggest G major is the key. Because in G major, vii°7 is Bø7. Which is B-D-F-A? Wait no: B half-diminished chord is B, D, F, A. But C/B with bass B would be B, C, E, G. That's not Bø7. Bø7 is B-D-F-A. So C/B chord is C major with bass B, which is B-C-E-G. That's Bm7b5? Bm7b5 would be B-D-F, so A would be the fifth if it's Bm7b5. Wait no, Bm7b5 is B, D, F, A. So root B, minor third D, diminished fifth F, minor seventh A. So if you have a C major chord with B bass, that's B, C, E, G. Which could be interpreted as a C major chord with B in bass, which is a second inversion of C major. But the chord would typically be called C/B.

In the context of G major, the chords are:

I: G

ii: Am

iii: Bm

IV: C

V: D

vi: Em

vii°: Bdim

But here we have C/B, which is part of the IV chord. So not problematic. So if the key is G major, C/B is just a C chord with B bass. No issue.

But if the key is E minor, then all chords fit, and the C/B is C major with B bass. In E minor, C is the VI chord. Also acceptable.

This seems tricky. Another angle: the Am6 chord. In E minor, the iv chord is Am. Adding the sixth (F#) gives Am6. In G major, the ii chord is Am. Adding F# makes it Am6. Both keys allow this.

Wait, perhaps the progression is in the key of E minor with the tonic Em missing. But the chord progression doesn't use Em, which is the tonic. That's odd. Whereas in G major, the tonic G is present. G chord appears multiple times. Let's count G chords: "G/B G/B" twice, then later "G/B G/B", so four times as G/B (so G chord), and no other G chords. So four times. Bm is 9 times. Em is never present. So if it's G major, tonic G is used four times, but Bm is more frequent. If it's E minor, tonic Em not present. So perhaps G major is more likely because the tonic is present.

But sometimes songs in minor keys don't use the tonic chord, but usually they do. But not always. For example, "Wish You Were Here" by Pink Floyd has a progression that doesn't use the tonic until later.

Wait, another thought. Let's look at the bass notes. Most bass notes are B. In a chord progression, the bass line can indicate key. If the bass is going B B B B... but then to A, B, etc. So the bass has B quite a bit. So maybe the key is B something. But B natural minor doesn't fit because of C chord. Unless it's B Dorian? But B Dorian requires G#, which we don't have. B Dorian scale: B C# D E F# G# A. So G# is not present in the chords. In the progression, the G is used (G major), which is G natural. So B Dorian has G#, so no. Not matching.

Another idea: maybe B minor with a borrowed chord for C? Like borrowed from parallel major. B major scale has B C# D# E F# G# A#. So borrowed chord from B major could be C# dim or something. Not sure. C major chord in B minor context... That might be very unusual. Because in B minor, the diatonic scale has C# and A, so a C natural chord would be a chromatic note. Possible but less likely.

Given all that, the most plausible is that it's in the key of G major, because all chords fit, and the tonic G is present multiple times (four times as G/B chord). Also, the progression has chords that are diatonic to G major. Alternatively, E minor. But G major could be considered the key since the tonic is present.

Wait, let's check the chord progression as a whole. Let's map each chord to G major:

- Bm = iii

- G/B = I (since G is the tonic)

- D/A = V (D chord, with A in bass, but still V chord)

- C/B = IV (C chord, B bass)

- Am6 = ii6 or ii with added sixth

So in G major, it's a progression of iii, I, V, IV chords, etc.

In E minor:

- Bm = v

- G = III

- D = VII

- C = VI

- Am6 = iv6

So as a minor key progression. Now, which key do you think? Sometimes the "dominant" chord in minor would be major V, but here there's no B major, so it's natural minor.

But a common progression in minor keys might be I V i, but here it's different.

Alternatively, let's think of common chord sequences.

For example, G major progression often includes I IV V, etc. Here, G major key has G, C, D. So when you have D chord followed by C chord, that could be V-IV. But often V-I.

Alternatively, maybe it's a progression in B minor but using parallel major. Not sure.

Another clue: the Am6 chord. Let's see the notes. Am6: A, C, E, F#. In E minor, this is the iv6 chord. In G major, it's the ii6 chord. If there were an A minor chord without the sixth, it would be more common. But the sixth is added.

Wait, but Am6 could also be called Fmaj7/A, which is F major with A bass. But that seems less likely.

Alternatively, thinking of all the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#. So the scale is A minor? Wait, A natural minor has A, B, C, D, E, F, G. But here we have F# instead of F. So A natural minor has F natural. So not A minor.

Wait, scale with F# and no G: but the presence of G. So we have G natural in there. So scale is A B C D E F# G. That's exactly the G major scale. Because G major is G A B C D E F#. Wait yes! G major scale: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

Yes! So all the notes in the chords match the G major scale. So the notes present are A, B, C, D, E, F#, G—all of them. So the key signature is one sharp (F#), which is G major.

So that would mean the key is G major, and mode is major. But the progression is starting on Bm (iii chord), ending on Bm. But it's still in G major. So key is G major, mode is major.

Wait, but why would the key be G major when the tonic chord isn't the most frequent? But yes, the tonic is still G. Just because it's not used as much as Bm in this progression doesn't mean it's not the key. For instance, "Wonderwall" has a progression in G major that uses Em, C, D, G, but Em is most common in the first part. It's still in G major.

So in summary, all chords are diatonic to G major. Therefore, the key is G major.

But earlier when looking at E minor scale, the notes are the same, but E minor is the relative minor. So if we consider the key as G major, then the mode is Ionian. If as E minor, Dorian? No, E minor is Aeolian mode. But usually, the term "key" would refer to the major for major key, minor for minor.

However, how do we decide between relative major and minor? Typically, the key is called by the major scale if it's a major key, or the minor scale if it's minor.

If the tonal center is G, then it's G major. If E, then E minor.

Since the G chord appears frequently (four times), and it's the tonic for G major, whereas E minor would require the Em chord, which isn't present at all.

That's a strong point: in E minor, the tonic Em is present in the chord list? No, there's no Em chord in the progression. The chords are Bm, G, D, C, Am. No E minor. So the tonic would be absent. Whereas in G major, the tonic G is present multiple times. So it's more likely that the key is G major.

Another point: when you have a progression with mostly chords from the major scale and the tonic appears multiple times, even if not the most frequent chord, it's usually considered the key.

For example, "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" is in G major but uses D, C, Am more often, but it's still G major.

Therefore, despite Bm being the most frequent chord, the presence of G major chord (I) would indicate key is G major.

So key: G major.

Mode: Ionian (but usually just referred to as major key).

Wait, but the question says "key and mode". So key would be G major, mode is Ionian.

But let me double-check: in G major, the chords:

G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), F#dim (vii°).

In this progression, the chords used are Bm, G, D, C, Am (Am6 is Am with sixth). So all are within G major. F#dim chord isn't present here, but that's fine. So key G major, mode Ionian.

Alternatively, since it's a major key, the mode is major. But technically, the mode is Ionian.

Yes. So likely the key is G major, mode Ionian.

But why does the progression have Am6? Am6 is just an Am chord with added sixth (F#), so it's still part of G major. So yes.

Alternatively, if it were E minor, the key would have Em as the tonic, but it's not present. So presence of G chord as the I chord supports G major.

So conclusion: Key is G major, mode Ionian.

But let's check if there's another possibility. Some might say the key is E minor because the tonal center feels like E. Without melody, it's hard to say. But based on chord presence: G is present, E is not. If the music resolves to G, then G major. If to E, then E minor. But since E is not present as a chord, G major seems more likely.

Wait, another check: D/A chord. In G major, D is V. So D/A is fifth chord with sixth in bass. Common. In E minor, D is VII chord. So a bit less common. But still possible.

But in rock/pop, often the G major progression using V chord (D major) going to C or G. Here, D/A is followed by C/B. In G major, D to C would be V to IV. Common move. Whereas in E minor, D to C would be VII to VI. Also common.

But I think the strongest indicator is that the tonic chord (G) is present, whereas in E minor, the tonic (Em) is completely absent. So G major is more accurate.

Therefore, I think the key is G major, mode is Ionian.


### Analysis of the Chord Progression  
The given progression is:  
**Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | D/A | C/B | Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | Am6 | Bm**

---

### Step 1: Identify All Diatonic Chords  
Let’s simplify the chords by ignoring the bass notes (as they are primarily for voice leading or texture) and focus on the **root chords**:

- **Bm** = B minor (B–D–F#)  
- **G/B** = G major (G–B–D)  
- **D/A** = D major (D–F#–A)  
- **C/B** = C major (C–E–G)  
- **Am6** = A minor 6 (A–C–E–F#)  

Now, collect all notes present across all chords:  
**A, B, C, D, E, F#, G**  

This matches the **G major scale**:  
**G – A – B – C – D – E – F#**  

All chords and notes are **diatonic to G major**. No chromatic or foreign notes are present.

---

### Step 2: Determine the Tonal Center  
- **G major (Ionian mode)** has **G as the tonic**.  
- **E minor (Aeolian mode)** shares the same key signature (one sharp: F#), but the **tonic Em (E–G–B)** is **not present in the progression at all**.  

While E minor is the **relative minor** of G major, the **absence of the tonic Em chord** is a strong indicator that **E minor is not the tonal center**. In contrast, **G major is represented by its tonic chord (G)**, which appears **multiple times** (as G/B, which still implies a G major triad). This aligns with typical harmonic behavior: a piece in a major key will almost always include the tonic chord (even if not the most frequent).

---

### Step 3: Key Signature and Mode Confirmation  
- **Key Signature**: 1 sharp (F#).  
- **Tonal Center**: G (the note G appears as the root of the G major chord and is present in all G-based chords like G/B).  
- **Mode**: **Ionian mode** (standard major scale mode).  

Even though Bm is the most frequently used chord, it is the **iii** chord in G major. This is common in songs where the iii chord is emphasized for texture or emotional effect, but the **tonal center remains G**. For example, "Wonderwall" by Oasis uses Am and Em prominently but is still in **G major**.

---

### Step 4: Final Verification  
| Chord | Function in G Major | Function in E Minor |  
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|  
| **Bm** | iii | v |  
| **G**   | I | III |  
| **D**   | V | VII |  
| **C**   | IV | VI |  
| **Am6** | ii6 | iv6 |  

- **G major** is the only key where **all chords are diatonic and the tonic (G) is present**.  
- **E minor** fails because its **tonic (Em)** is missing entirely.  

---

### ✅ Final Answer  
**Key: G major**  
**Mode: Ionian (Major)**  

> 💡 **Why?** All chords fit the G major scale. The tonic (G) is present in the progression, while E minor's tonic (Em) is absent. Even though Bm is frequent, the tonal center firmly resolves around **G**.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**
> Bm — Bm — G/B — G/B — Bm — Bm — D/A — C/B — Bm — Bm — G/B — G/B — Bm — Bm — Am6 — Bm

---

### Step 1: Identify the root chords (ignoring bass notes for now)

First, simplify by focusing on the **chord qualities and roots**, ignoring the slash bass notes (which are just inversions or bass extensions):

- Bm (x8)
- G (x4)
- D (x1)
- C (x1)
- Am6 (x1)

So the primary chords are:  
**Bm, G, D, C, Am6**

---

### Step 2: Look for a tonal center

We see **Bm appears 8 times** — clearly the **tonic** (home chord). So we're likely in **B minor**.

Let’s check if the other chords fit within the **B minor key**.

#### B natural minor scale (Aeolian):  
B – C# – D – E – F# – G – A

Chords built on each degree (triads):
- i: Bm
- ii°: C#°
- III: D
- iv: Em
- v: F#m
- VI: G
- VII: Am

Wait — we have **G** and **D**, which are **VI and III** — both appear in natural minor.

We also have **C** and **Am6**.

What’s **C**?  
C = C-E-G → Not in B minor scale. The 7th degree should be **A**, not C.

C major is **not diatonic** to B natural minor.

What about **Am6**?  
A minor 6 = A-C-E-F#  
In B minor, A is the 7th scale degree → Am is diatonic (VII degree).  
Adding 6th (F#) — that’s fine, since F# is the 5th of B minor.  
So Am6 = Am with added 6th → **still diatonic** to B minor. The 6th (F#) is the 5th, so it’s just an extension.

But **C major (C-E-G)**?  
C is **not** in the B natural minor scale.  
B minor scale has: B C# D E F# G A → no C natural.

So **C major chord** is **borrowed** — it’s a **chromatic chord**.

---

### Step 3: What key and mode?

We have a strong **Bm** tonic, and chords that mostly belong to **B natural minor** (Aeolian), **except** the **C major chord**.

C major chord (C-E-G) contains **C natural**, which is **not** in B minor (it should be C#).

This C major chord suggests a **borrowed chord** from **B Dorian** or **B Phrygian**, or perhaps **B harmonic minor** — but harmonic minor has C#, not C.

Wait — what key contains **Bm and C major**?

Let’s think differently.

### Consider: Could this be in **D major**?

D major: D E F# G A B C#

Chords: D, Em, F#m, G, Am, Bm, C#°

We have Bm (vi) and G (IV) — both diatonic.

But we also have **C major** → In D major, the VII chord is **C#°**, not C major.

C major would be **borrowed** from D Mixolydian? D Mixolydian has C natural.

D Mixolydian: D E F# G A B C — yes, C natural.

But we have **Bm** as tonic — not D. So this is **not** in D major.

What if **Bm is tonic**, and C is a borrowed chord?

In **B Dorian**, the scale is:  
B C# D E F# G# A → still has C#! So no C natural.

In **B Phrygian**: B C D E F# G A → YES! Here we have **C natural**!

Check B Phrygian scale:
- B (root)
- C (♭2)
- D (m3)
- E (4)
- F# (5)
- G (♭6)
- A (♭7)

So chords built on scale degrees:
- i: Bm
- ii°: C° (we have C major, not C°)
- III: D
- iv: Em
- v: F#m
- VI: G
- vii: Am

Wait! **C major** would be **not diatonic** even in B Phrygian — Phrygian has **C°**, not C major.

But we have **C major** — C-E-G — which is a **major triad on the ♭2**.

This is a **non-diatonic, borrowed chord**.

It’s often called a **"Neapolitan" chord**, but Neapolitan is usually a ♭II *in first inversion* and major triad — yes! That’s it.

In minor keys, the **♭II chord** (major triad on the lowered second scale degree) is common, especially in classical and rock music. It’s borrowed from the **parallel major** or **Phrygian mode**.

So in **B minor**, the **♭II chord** is C major (since ♭2 of B is C).

And we also have:
- G (VI) — diatonic
- D (III) — diatonic
- Am6 (vii6) — diatonic (Am with added 6th = F#)
- Bm (i) — tonic

So we have:
- i (Bm)
- ♭II (C)
- III (D)
- VI (G)
- vii6 (Am6)

All are consistent with **B minor**, with a strong **borrowed ♭II chord** (C major), which is very common in minor keys — especially in rock, pop, and metal.

The progression:
> Bm — Bm — G/B — G/B — Bm — Bm — D/A — C/B — Bm — Bm — G/B — G/B — Bm — Bm — Am6 — Bm

The inversions (G/B, D/A, C/B) are just bass notes — doesn’t change the mode.

---

### Final Determination

- **Key: B minor**
- **Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian)**, **with a borrowed ♭II (C major) chord**

> Some might call it **B Phrygian** because of the C natural, but Phrygian has a **C° chord**, and our bass movement and harmonic context suggest **B minor with chromatic flavor**, not an actual mode change. The **C major** is a **borrowed chord**, not a modal indicator — especially since the scale still otherwise follows natural minor (no G# or other alterations).

The **Am6** also reinforces natural minor — it's just an extended vii chord.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key:** **B minor**  
**Mode:** **Natural minor (Aeolian)** with a **borrowed flat-II chord (C major)** for color.

This progression is **not** in Phrygian, Dorian, or Harmonic minor — the C major is chromatic, not modal. So the underlying mode is **Aeolian**.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

Bm Bm G/B G/B  
Bm Bm D/A C/B  
Bm Bm G/B G/B  
Bm Bm Am6 Bm

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center

The progression **starts and ends on Bm**, and Bm appears **very frequently**, suggesting **B minor** as the tonic.

### Step 2: Look at the diatonic chords in B natural minor (Aeolian)

B natural minor scale: **B C# D E F# G A**

Diatonic triads:
- Bm (i)
- C#° (ii°)
- D (III)
- Em (iv)
- F#m (v)
- G (VI)
- A (VII)

Now compare with the chords used:

- **Bm** → i → ✅
- **G/B** → G major with B in the bass → that’s **VI** (G major) in B minor → ✅
- **D/A** → D major with A in the bass → D is **III** in B minor → ✅
- **C/B** → C major with B in the bass → C is **♭II** (or Neapolitan chord) → **outside natural minor**
- **Am6** → A minor with added 6th (F#) → Am6 = A–C–E–F# → This is **v7♭5** or can be seen as **A half-diminished** if we include the F♮, but here it’s **A–C–E–F#**, which implies **A Dorian** or **A melodic minor** influence. Not found in B natural minor.

Wait — Am6 = A–C–E–F#. The F# is the **major 6th** above A. So this chord contains **F#**, which **is** in B natural minor (since B natural minor has F#). But C is **not** in B natural minor — B natural minor has **C#**, not C♮.

So **C/B** and **Am6** both contain **C natural**, which is **not** in B natural minor.

That suggests **modal mixture** or a shift in mode.

### Step 3: Consider B Dorian

B Dorian scale: **B C# D E F# G# A**

Wait — that has **G#**, but we have **G natural** in G major chord. So **not Dorian**.

### Step 4: Consider B melodic minor?

B melodic minor (ascending): **B C# D E F# G# A#** – again, has G#, not matching G major.

### Step 5: Consider B harmonic minor

B harmonic minor: **B C# D E F# G A#**

Still has **A#**, but we have **A natural** in D/A and Am6 — so **not harmonic minor**.

### Step 6: Re-express chords in terms of B Aeolian with borrowed chords

- **C/B** = C major over B → C is **♭II** → common **Neapolitan chord** in minor keys.
- **Am6** = A–C–E–F# → this is **A minor with a major 6th**, which is **v6** in B minor, but the **C natural** is **♭6** scale degree (since B natural minor has G, not G# – wait, correction: in B minor, the 6th scale degree is **G**. C is the **♭2**.)

Hold on — in B minor:
- Scale degrees:  
  1 = B  
  2 = C#  
  ♭2 = C  
  3 = D  
  4 = E  
  5 = F#  
  ♭6 = G  
  6 = G#  
  ♭7 = A  
  7 = A#

So **C natural = ♭2**, **G natural = ♭6**, **A natural = ♭7**

So we are using:
- **♭7** (A) → D chord (III) uses A as 5th → fine in natural minor
- **♭6** (G) → G major chord (VI) → fine in natural minor
- **♭2** (C) → appears in **C/B** and **Am6**

So **C natural** is the outlier — it’s **not in natural, harmonic, or melodic B minor**.

But **C major chord** is common as a **Neapolitan (♭II)** in minor keys — typically used in **first inversion**, but here it's **C/B**, which is **♭II with tonic in the bass** — a variant that smooths voice leading.

**Am6** contains C natural — so again using ♭2.

This suggests **borrowing from Phrygian mode** or using **Phrygian-inflected minor**.

### Step 7: Consider B Phrygian

B Phrygian scale: **B C D E F# G A**

- This has **C natural** (♭2), **D** (♭3), **G** (♭6), **A** (♭7)
- Chords:
  - Bm (i) → B–D–F#
  - C (♭II) → C–E–G → matches C/B
  - D (♭III) → D–F#–A → matches D/A
  - G (♭VI) → G–B–D → matches G/B
  - Am (♭vii) → A–C–E → and with added F# = Am6

**Am6 = A–C–E–F#** — F# is not in B Phrygian! B Phrygian has **F natural**, not F#.

Wait — B Phrygian: B C D E F G A → **F natural**, but our chords contain **F#** (in Bm, D, Am6).

So F# is present → that contradicts Phrygian.

### Step 8: Reconcile F# and C

We have both:
- **F#** → from B minor key signature
- **C natural** → foreign to B minor

This is characteristic of **tonicizing B minor with chromatic alterations**, especially using the **Neapolitan chord (♭II = C)**.

The presence of **Am6** (A–C–E–F#) is interesting: this chord can be viewed as **F# half-diminished 1st inversion**:
- F#–A–C–E = F#m7♭5 → which is **iiø7** in E minor, but here over A, it’s Am6.

But in **B minor**, F#m7♭5 is the **iiø7** chord (if we temporarily treat B as vi of D major?) — maybe not.

Alternatively, **Am6** can be seen as a **subdominant chord** with added 6th, common in minor keys.

### Step 9: Conclusion

The **tonal center is B**, and the **core mode is B natural minor (Aeolian)**.

The chords **C/B** and **Am6** introduce **C natural**, which is **chromatic** — specifically the **♭2 scale degree** — used for expressive color, likely derived from **Phrygian mode** or **Neapolitan function**.

However, the **overall key is B minor**, and the **mode is primarily Aeolian** with **Phrygian-inflected chromaticism**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **Key:** B minor  
- **Mode:** Primarily **Aeolian (natural minor)** with **chromatic alterations** (♭II Neapolitan and related chords), giving it a **Phrygian flavor** in places.

So: **B minor (Aeolian with Phrygian borrowings)**.

### Reasoning

**Identifying the Chords**

I'm currently identifying the chords within the progression. I've noted Bm, G/B, and D/A. Next, I'll analyze the bass notes and root positions to further understand the harmonic structure.


**Assessing the Tonal Center**

I'm solidifying the key as B minor, given the frequent Bm chords. Now I'm meticulously comparing the provided chords to B minor's diatonic chords. G/B and D/A seem to fit, while Am6 presents a bit of a puzzle. I'm considering its implications within the context.


**Considering Mode Implications**

I'm now zeroing in on the mode, evaluating B natural minor (Aeolian) against B Phrygian. While the diatonic chords fit Bm, G/B, and D/A, the presence of Am6 and C/B (both with C natural) leads me toward B Phrygian. This mode aligns with the C natural, which clashes with the C# typically found in B minor. Further evaluation is needed.


**Revising Modal Considerations**

I'm now revising the mode, as my initial thoughts favored B Phrygian due to the C naturals in Am6 and C/B. However, the presence of D/A, which fits a B natural minor, and the overwhelming B minor tonic, are making me lean more toward B natural minor, with some possible modal mixture. The C natural is the most challenging element to fully justify in the original assessment.


**Evaluating the Progression's Core**

I'm now prioritizing the tonic and dominant relationships, as well as the subdominant chords, which I've determined to be the harmonic foundation of this progression. This process helps to determine the core tonality, specifically in relation to the modal variations. My conclusions involve B minor with modal interchange.


**Determining the Verdict**

I'm now prioritizing the most relevant harmonic element: the bII chord from Phrygian, which is the C. Despite the tendency towards B natural minor, the C is decisive. Therefore, the progression is best described as B Phrygian, or more formally, B Minor with Phrygian coloring.


**Revising the Conclusion**

I'm now revising my conclusion, accounting for all analyzed points. While the progression feels largely minor, and my initial analyses favored Bm and its supporting chords, the C natural in the Am6 chord is very prevalent. Therefore, the best descriptive term is B Phrygian, or in a more descriptive tone, B Minor with Phrygian coloring.




This chord progression is excellent for illustrating modal harmony and tonicization.

## 1. Determine the Tonal Center (Key)

The progression starts and ends on **Bm** and Bm is the most frequently repeated chord.

*   **Tonic:** B minor (Bm)

## 2. Analyze the Supporting Chords

The primary chords used are:

*   **Bm** (i)
*   **G** (VI in B minor)
*   **D** (III in B minor)

These chords strongly suggest a standard **B natural minor (Aeolian)** key signature (B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A).

## 3. Analyze the Defining Chords (Modal Mixture)

The chords **C/B** and **Am6** introduce notes that conflict with the B natural minor scale:

*   **B Natural Minor** requires **C#**.
*   **C/B** (C major triad with B in the bass: C-E-G) contains **C natural**.
*   **Am6** (A minor triad with an added 6th: A-C-E-F#) contains **C natural**.

The presence of **C natural**, one half-step above the tonic (B), creates the defining characteristic of the **Phrygian mode** ($\flat$2 degree).

## Conclusion

The tonal center is **B**, and the inclusion of the C natural defines the mode. While the Bm, G, D chords provide the structure of a minor key, the strong use of the $\flat$II (C major, implied by C/B) establishes the scale as Phrygian.

*   **Key:** B
*   **Mode:** Phrygian (B Phrygian: B C D E F# G A)

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

Based on the provided chord progression:

$Bm \quad Bm \quad G/B \quad G/B \quad Bm \quad Bm \quad D/A \quad C/B$
$Bm \quad Bm \quad G/B \quad G/B \quad Bm \quad Bm \quad Am6 \quad Bm$

Let's analyze the chords:
* **Bm:** The tonic chord and the starting/ending chord. This strongly suggests B is the tonal center.
* **G:** A major chord. In the key of B minor, G is the $\flat$VI chord (or VI in the natural minor/Aeolian scale).
* **D:** A major chord. In the key of B minor, D is the $\flat$III chord (or III in the natural minor/Aeolian scale).
* **C:** A major chord. In the key of B minor, C is the $\flat$II chord. This characteristic is very typical of the Phrygian mode.
* **Am6:** This chord contains the notes A, C, E, and F\# (since it's typically spelled $A-C-E-F\#$ or $A-C-E-F\natural$ could suggest $\flat$VI or $VI\natural$, but Am is usually the $\text{VII}$ chord in the harmonic minor and $\text{VI}$ chord in the melodic minor). The chord $Am$ itself is the diatonic $\text{vii}$ chord in the B Aeolian/natural minor scale.

If we combine the roots of the diatonic chords present (B, G, D, C, A), and assume B is the tonic, the scale degrees are:
$$1 - \flat 3 - 4 - 5 - \flat 6 - \flat 7$$
The presence of the **C major chord ($\flat$II)** is the most distinguishing feature here.

### Analysis of Possible Keys/Modes with Tonic B:

1. **B Natural Minor (Aeolian):**
   * Scale: B - C\# - D - E - F\# - G - A
   * Diatonic chords: **Bm** (i), C\#dim ($\text{ii}^\circ$), **D** ($\flat$III), Em (iv), **F\#m** (v), **G** ($\flat$VI), **A** ($\flat$VII).
   * **Problem:** The chord **C major** ($\flat$II) is not diatonic to B Aeolian. The $\text{ii}^\circ$ chord is $C\# \text{dim}$.

2. **B Harmonic Minor:**
   * Scale: B - C\# - D - E - F\# - G - A\#
   * Diatonic chords: **Bm** (i), C\#dim ($\text{ii}^\circ$), $\text{D augmented}$ ($\flat III+$), Em (iv), **F\#** (V), **G** ($\flat$VI), $\text{A\# dim}$ ($\text{vii}^\circ$).
   * **Problem:** The chord **C major** ($\flat$II) and **A major/minor** ($\flat$VII or $\text{vii}^\circ$) are not used consistently (we see G and D, which are diatonic, but the C contradicts this).

3. **B Phrygian Mode:**
   * Scale: B - C - D - E - F\# - G - A
   * Intervals: 1 - $\flat 2$ - $\flat 3$ - 4 - 5 - $\flat 6$ - $\flat 7$
   * Diatonic chords:
     * **Bdim** ($\text{i}^\circ$) - *However, it is very common and accepted in minor modal music to use the minor triad (Bm) as the tonic, borrowing the $\text{ii}$ and $\text{iii}$ chords from the corresponding scale (Phrygian)*.
     * **C** ($\flat \text{II}$) - **Matches the chord C.**
     * **Dm** ($\flat \text{III}$) - *The progression uses D major ($\flat \text{III}$)*, which is a common modal alteration (though Dm is diatonic).
     * **Em** (iv)
     * **F\#dim** ($\text{v}^\circ$)
     * **G** ($\flat \text{VI}$) - **Matches the chord G.**
     * **Am** ($\flat \text{VII}$) - **Matches the root of Am6.**

The defining characteristics of the progression are:
* Tonic: **Bm**
* $\flat$VI: **G**
* $\flat$II: **C**

The presence of the $\flat$II chord (C major) alongside a minor tonic (Bm) and a $\flat$VI (G major) is the signature sound of the **Phrygian mode**.

### Conclusion

**Key:** **B**
**Mode:** **Phrygian** (B Phrygian)

*Note on D major ($\flat$III) and B minor (i):* While B Phrygian diatonic chords are $B \text{ dim}$ and $D \text{ minor}$, the substitution of $B \text{ dim}$ for $B \text{ minor}$ and $D \text{ minor}$ for $D \text{ major}$ (often used as a substitute for $\flat \text{III}$) is extremely common in popular, rock, and metal music when utilizing the Phrygian mode. The overwhelming evidence provided by the $\flat \text{II}$ chord (C) confirms B Phrygian.

### Step 1: Look at the overall tonic
- The progression **starts and ends on Bm**.
- **Bm** is the most frequent chord.
- The final resolution is to **Bm**, suggesting **B** is the tonal center.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the chord qualities and notes

Let’s list the notes in each chord:

- **Bm**: B D F#
- **G/B**: G B D (G major in first inversion)
- **D/A**: D F# A (D major in first inversion)
- **C/B**: C E G B (C major with B in bass – effectively Cmaj7/B)
- **Am6**: A C E F# (this is an **F#ø7** in first inversion, or Am6)

---

### Step 3: Look at the scale implied

From the chords, the unique pitches are:

**B C D E F# G A**

This is the **B natural minor scale**:
- B C♯ D E F♯ G A → but **C natural** appears (in C/B and Am6), **not C♯**.

So this is **B minor with a lowered 6th scale degree** — that is:

> **B Aeolian** (natural minor), **not harmonic or melodic minor**.

---

### Step 4: Check for modal mixture or color

- The **Am6** chord (A C E F#) includes **F#**, the major 6th above A, but in the key of B minor, **F# is the natural 3rd**, so this is **not unusual**.
- The **C/B** chord is a **Cmaj7/B**, which is a **borrowed chord** or **passing color**, not a modulator.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: B minor**  
> **Mode: B Aeolian (natural minor)**

No strong evidence of modal mixture or mode change — just chromatic voice leading and inversions.

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze the progression:

**Chord progression:**

```
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  
Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  
Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm
```

---

### Step 1: Identify key candidates
The chord **Bm (B–D–F#)** appears repeatedly and clearly functions as a tonal center. So, B minor is our first likely candidate.

Other chords:

- **G/B (G–B–D)** → G major chord in first inversion  
- **D/A (D–F#–A)** → D major chord, V in G major, III in B minor  
- **C/B (C–E–G with B in bass)** → an interesting borrowed or chromatic chord  
- **Am6 (A–C–E–F#)** → contains F#, implying a borrowed color chord (A Dorian flavor)

These chords all fit reasonably well within a **B minor tonality**, with **C/B** adding a bit of chromatic color (flat II relative to B, similar to a Neapolitan-type inflection if heard as a B pedal).

---

### Step 2: Check scale consistency

B natural minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A  
Compare chords:

| Chord | Notes | Fit in B minor? |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Bm | B D F# | ✓ |
| G/B | G B D | ✓ |
| D/A | D F# A | ✓ |
| C/B | C E G B | ✗ (C natural → minor flat II color) |
| Am6 | A C E F# | partially (C natural not diatonic, F# fits) |

So, overall it’s **B minor** with **borrowed chromatic chords** (C/B and Am6).

---

### Step 3: Mode characterization

Because of the recurring **C natural** (instead of C#), the mode leans toward **B Aeolian (natural minor)** rather than B Dorian or harmonic minor.  
The **Am6** chord reinforces the Aeolian (natural) mode too.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**
- **Key:** B minor  
- **Mode:** B **Aeolian** (natural minor)  
- **Comments:** Occasional chromatic color (C natural, Am6) enriches the harmonic palette, but the tonal center and general modal flavor remain in B minor (Aeolian).

### Reasoning

First, the user has given a sequence of chords: Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, D/A, C/B, Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, Am6, Bm. I need to determine the key and mode from this.

I recall that in music theory, the key is determined by the chords that are used, and especially by the tonic chord, which feels like home. The mode might be minor or major, depending on the scale.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- Bm

- Bm

- G/B

- G/B

- Bm

- Bm

- D/A

- C/B

- Bm

- Bm

- G/B

- G/B

- Bm

- Bm

- Am6

- Bm

I see that Bm appears very frequently, which suggests that B minor might be the key. But let's check the other chords.

G/B is a G major chord with a B in the bass. Since B is the root of Bm, this might be a chord inversion.

D/A is a D major chord with an A in the bass.

C/B is a C major chord with a B in the bass.

Am6 is an A minor chord with a sixth, which is essentially an A minor chord with an added F#? Wait, Am6 typically means A minor sixth chord, which consists of A, C, E, and F#. But in terms of scale, let's see.

Now, to find the key, I should look at the chord progression and see which chord feels like the tonic. Bm is repeated often and starts and ends the sequence, so it's likely the tonic.

But let's consider the scale. In B minor, the chords would be based on the B natural minor scale: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A.

The diatonic chords in B minor are:

- i: Bm

- ii°: C#dim

- III: D major

- iv: Em

- v: F#m

- VI: G major

- VII: A major

Now, looking at the chords in the progression:

- Bm (i)

- G/B (which is G major with B bass, so G major is VI)

- D/A (D major with A bass, D major is III)

- C/B (C major with B bass, but C major is not diatonic to B minor because in B minor, the chord on C# is diminished, not C major. C major would be a flat VII? Wait, in natural minor, the VII chord is A major, not C major. C major would imply a different scale.)

C major is not in the B natural minor scale. The note C is not in B minor; B minor has C#. So C major has C natural, which is flat compared to C#. So this might be borrowing from another mode.

Similarly, Am6: A minor with sixth. In B minor, the chord on A should be A major (VII), but here it's A minor, which has a C natural instead of C#. So again, C natural is involved.

So, let's list all the chords and their roots:

- Bm: root B

- G/B: chord G major, root G, but bass B

- D/A: chord D major, root D, bass A

- C/B: chord C major, root C, bass B

- Am6: chord A minor with sixth, root A

The bass notes are sometimes different, but for key determination, we care about the chord qualities.

The chords are: Bm, G major, D major, C major, Am.

Bm is minor, G major, D major, C major, Am is minor.

In B minor, we expect G major and D major as VI and III, which fit, but C major and A minor do not fit the natural minor scale.

C major has C natural, and A minor has C natural, so both have C natural instead of C#.

This suggests that the key might be B minor but with a borrowed chord from the parallel major or from Dorian mode.

Another thought: perhaps the key is B Dorian. Dorian mode has a raised sixth compared to natural minor. In B natural minor, the sixth is G, but in B Dorian, the sixth is G#? Let's recall modes.

Ionian (major): whole whole half whole whole whole half

Dorian: whole half whole whole whole half whole

So for B Dorian, the notes would be: B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A? Let's calculate.

If Dorian is a minor mode with raised sixth, so from B natural minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A → to raise the sixth, G becomes G#. So B Dorian: B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A.

But in the chords, we have G major, which has G natural, not G#. G major chord has G, B, D. So if we have G natural, that would be the flat sixth in B minor, which is natural minor.

But we also have C major, which has C natural. In B natural minor, we have C#, so C natural is flat second? No, in natural minor, the second is C#, so C natural is a flat second, which is characteristic of Phrygian mode.

Let's think about Phrygian mode. Phrygian is: half whole whole whole half whole whole. So for B Phrygian: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A. That seems to fit because we have C natural and G natural.

In B Phrygian, the chords would be:

- i: Bm

- II: C major

- III: D major

- iv: Em

- v: F#m? But v in Phrygian is diminished? Let's see the diatonic chords in Phrygian mode.

The Phrygian scale: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A

Chords:

- Bm: B, D, F#? Wait, B minor chord is B, D, F#. But in Phrygian, the third is D, which is minor third, so yes, Bm.

- Chord on C: C, E, G → C major? But in Phrygian, the second degree is minor? No, the chord built on the second degree: C, E, G. E is the third of C, and since the scale has E, which is major third from C? C to E is a major third, so C major chord. Yes.

- Chord on D: D, F#, A → D major? D to F# is major third, so D major.

- Chord on E: E, G, B → E minor? E to G is minor third, so Em.

- Chord on F#: F#, A, C → F# diminished? F# to A is minor third, A to C is minor third, so diminished chord.

- Chord on G: G, B, D → G major? G to B is major third, so G major.

- Chord on A: A, C, E → A minor? A to C is minor third, so Am.

So in B Phrygian, we have chords: Bm, C major, D major, Em, F#dim, G major, Am.

Now, looking at the progression: we have Bm, G major, D major, C major, Am. So all these chords are diatonic to B Phrygian except that we have Am6 instead of Am, but Am6 is essentially Am with an added sixth, which in this case would be F#? Am6 chord is A, C, E, F#. But in B Phrygian, the note F# is in the scale, so Am6 is still diatonic because it has A, C, E, F# and all these notes are in B Phrygian: A, C, E, F# are all in the scale? B Phrygian has B, C, D, E, F#, G, A. So yes, A, C, E, F# are all in the scale, so Am6 is diatonic to B Phrygian.

In the progression, we have D/A, which is D major with A bass, so it's still D major chord, and C/B is C major with B bass, so still C major chord. So all chords fit perfectly in B Phrygian.

Also, the progression starts and ends on Bm, which is the tonic of B Phrygian.

Therefore, the key is B Phrygian.

But let's confirm the mode. Phrygian mode is a minor mode, so the key is B minor with Phrygian flavor, but specifically, the mode is Phrygian.

In the chord progression, we have Am6, which is the vii chord in Phrygian, and it resolves to Bm, which is common.

So, I think this is B Phrygian.

But just to be thorough, is there any other possibility? For example, if it were B natural minor, we would have C#dim instead of C major, and A major instead of A minor, but here we have C major and A minor, so it must be Phrygian.

Another mode: B Aeolian? Aeolian is natural minor, so same as natural minor, which has C#dim and A major, so not matching.

B Dorian would have G# and thus G#dim chord? No, in B Dorian, the chord on G would be G# diminished? Let's see B Dorian: B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. Chord on G: G#, B, D? But G# to B is minor third? G# to B is actually a major third? G# to B is two whole steps? G# to A# is whole, A# to B is half? No, intervals: from G# to B is two semitones? G# to A is half, A to A# is half, A# to B is half? No, G# to A is one semitone, A to A# is one semitone, A# to B is one semitone, so from G# to B is three semitones, which is a minor third? But in terms of chord, if we take G# and B and D, G# to B is minor third, but B to D is minor third, so G# diminished chord? But in the progression, we have G major, which has G natural, so not G#. So B Dorian is not possible.

Therefore, B Phrygian is the only mode that fits.

So, key: B minor mode? But specifically, mode: Phrygian.

In terms of key signature, B Phrygian has the same key signature as G major or E minor? No, Phrygian mode is not standard in key signatures. But since it's a mode, we can say the key is B Phrygian.

Often, in modern music, we just say the key based on the tonic and mode.

So, for this progression, the key is B Phrygian.

But let's see the chord C/B: that is C major with B bass, which emphasizes the B, so it's like a dominant function or something, but in Phrygian, the II chord (C major) is often used.

Also, D/A is D major with A bass, which is the III chord.

And Am6 is the vii chord.

So, I think it's clear.

Therefore, the key is B Phrygian.

Based on the chord progression provided (Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, D/A, C/B, Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, Am6, Bm), the key is **B Phrygian**.

### Explanation:
- The progression centers around Bm as the tonic chord, indicating a key based on B.
- The chords used (Bm, G, D, C, Am) are all diatonic to the B Phrygian mode:
  - B Phrygian scale: B, C, D, E, F#, G, A
  - Diatonic chords in B Phrygian:
    - i: Bm
    - II: C major
    - III: D major
    - iv: Em (not used, but implied)
    - v°: F#dim (not used)
    - VI: G major
    - vii: Am
- The presence of C major (instead of C#dim in B natural minor) and Am (instead of A major in B natural minor) confirms the Phrygian mode, which features a flattened second (C natural) and a flattened seventh (A natural) compared to the natural minor scale.
- The Am6 chord (A, C, E, F#) is also diatonic to B Phrygian, as all notes belong to the scale.

Thus, the mode is Phrygian, giving the progression a distinct character with a minor tonality and a characteristic semitone between the tonic and second scale degrees.

**1. Identify the chords and their likely functions**

The progression is:

Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  
Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  
Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm

---

**2. Look at the bass movement**

- Bm = B–D–F♯  
- G/B = G–B–D with bass B  
- D/A = D–F♯–A with bass A  
- C/B = C–E–G with bass B  
- Am6 = A–C–E–F♯ (Am6 = F♯m7♭5 / A? Actually Am6 = A–C–E–F♯, yes)

Bass line in order:  
B B B B | B B A B | B B B B | B B A B

---

**3. Determine possible key from chord roots and common progressions**

Chords: Bm, G, D, C, Am6

Bm is clearly the tonic candidate — starts and ends phrases, begins and ends the progression.

Possible keys containing Bm:  
- B minor (B Aeolian / natural minor)  
- B Dorian  
- D major (relative major of B minor) — but then Bm would be vi, not tonic.

---

**4. Check scale compatibility**

B natural minor scale: B C♯ D E F♯ G A  
Chords:  
- Bm = B–D–F♯ ✅  
- G = G–B–D ✅ (in B natural minor, G is ♭VI)  
- D = D–F♯–A ✅ (in B natural minor, D is i♭III? Actually D is D major = D–F♯–A — F♯ is in B minor, A is in B natural minor, so D major is the III chord in B melodic minor ascending, but in natural minor D is D–F♯–A? Wait, check: B natural minor: B C♯ D E F♯ G A — D–F♯–A = D major, yes. So D major is native to B natural minor as the III chord.)  
- C = C–E–G ❌ (C♯ is in B natural minor, so C natural is ♭VII? No, C natural is not in B natural minor scale — B natural minor has C♯. So C major implies either B Dorian or borrowing from B Phrygian? Let’s check: C major = C–E–G; in B Dorian (B C♯ D E F♯ G♯ A) the G♯ makes G major, not C major. Actually C major in B Dorian? C–E–G: E is in B Dorian, G is not (G♯ is). So C major is not in B Dorian either. So C major is a borrowed chord — maybe from B Phrygian (B C D E F♯ G A) — yes! B Phrygian has C major as ♭II.)

So C major is the ♭II (Neapolitan) in B Phrygian or B minor borrowing from Phrygian.

Am6 = A–C–E–F♯ — in B natural minor: A–C–E–F♯: A is in scale, C is not (C♯ is), E is in scale, F♯ is in scale. So C natural again — same Phrygian borrowing.

---

**5. Mode determination**

We have:  
- Bm = i  
- G = ♭VI (native to B natural minor)  
- D = III (native to B natural minor)  
- C = ♭II (borrowed from Phrygian)  
- Am6 = ♭VIIm6 (also from Phrygian: A–C–E–F♯ is actually F♯m7♭5 / A? Wait, Am6 = A–C–E–F♯ = F♯m7♭5? No, F♯m7♭5 = F♯–A–C–E, yes that’s the same notes as Am6. So Am6 is just first inversion of F♯m7♭5. F♯m7♭5 in B natural minor? F♯–A–C–E: A is in B natural minor, C is not (C♯ is), so it’s F♯ half-diminished from B harmonic minor (F♯–A–C–E). So Am6 is a common substitution for F♯ø in a minor key.)

So the C major and F♯ø (as Am6) suggest B **harmonic minor** influence (F♯ø is viiø7 in B harmonic minor) and also Phrygian ♭II (C major).

But overall, the tonic is Bm, the presence of D major (III) and G major (♭VI) points to **B natural minor / Aeolian** as the primary scale, with occasional borrowed chords (C from Phrygian, F♯ø from harmonic minor).

---

**6. Conclusion**

Key: **B minor** (Aeolian mode as the primary sound, with modal mixture).

Mode: **B Aeolian** (natural minor), with borrowed ♭II (C) from Phrygian and viiø7 (F♯ø) from harmonic minor.

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{B \ \text{minor} \ (\text{Aeolian})}

### Reasoning

1.  **Initial Scan & First Impressions:**
    *   The chords are: Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, D/A, C/B, Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, Am6, Bm.
    *   There are a lot of Bm chords. This is a strong indicator that B is the tonic or at least a very important tonal center.
    *   I see a lot of slash chords: G/B, D/A, C/B. These are important.
        *   G/B is a G major triad with B in the bass. This is the first inversion of G major. What's the relationship between G and B? G is the ♭6 (flat six) of B minor. This is a very common "borrowed chord" from the B natural minor scale (or its parallel major, B major). It often functions as a pre-dominant or a way to add color.
        *   D/A is a D major triad with A in the bass. First inversion of D major. D is the dominant of G major, but what's its relationship to Bm? D is the IV (four) chord of B minor (B-C#-D). So, a D/A chord is a IV chord in first inversion. This is a very standard functional chord.
        *   C/B is a C major triad with B in the bass. What's C's relationship to Bm? C is the ♭II (flat two) of B minor. This is a Neapolitan chord! Specifically, a Neapolitan sixth chord (N6) because it's in first inversion. This is a *huge* clue. The Neapolitan chord almost always resolves to the dominant (or a cadential 6/4). In B minor, the dominant is F#7 or just F# major.
        *   Am6 is an A minor sixth chord. The notes are A-C-E-F#. What's its relationship to Bm? A is the ♭VII (flat seven) of B minor. Am6 is a common way to voice a ♭VII chord in minor keys, often leading to the tonic (Bm). The F# in the Am6 chord is the leading tone to B. This is another strong pointer.

2.  **Synthesizing the Clues & Building a Picture:**

    *   **Tonic:** B minor seems overwhelmingly likely. The progression starts and ends on Bm, and it's the most frequent chord.
    *   **Diatonic Chords in B minor:**
        *   B minor: `i`
        *   C# diminished: `ii°`
        *   D major: `III` (or `iv` in natural minor)
        *   E minor: `iv` (or `IV` in Dorian)
        *   F# major: `V` (or `v` in natural minor)
        *   G major: `VI` (or `♭VI` in harmonic/melodic minor)
        *   A major: `VII` (or `♭VII` in natural minor)

3.  **Analyzing the Non-Diatonic/Borrowed Chords:**

    *   **G/B (♭VI):** As mentioned, this is a borrowed chord. It comes from the B natural minor scale. The sound of `i` -> `♭VI` is very common and has a distinct, often "darker" or more "rock" feel than a standard diatonic progression.
    *   **D/A (IV):** This chord is diatonic if we're thinking in terms of B natural minor (where D is the subdominant). In B harmonic minor, the subdominant is minor (Em). But using a major IV chord in a minor key is also a very common borrowing (from the parallel major or the Dorian mode). This is called a "major subdominant" or "Picardy subdominant." It has a bright, hopeful sound. So, D/A functions as a IV chord.
    *   **C/B (♭II6, Neapolitan Sixth):** This is the smoking gun. The Neapolitan chord is a hallmark of the minor key context. It's a chromatically altered supertonic chord (the C#° is lowered to C). It's overwhelmingly used in minor keys to add drama and tension before resolving to the dominant. The fact that it's in first inversion (the "6" in N6) is standard practice. The bass note B acts as a common tone between the tonic (Bm) and the Neapolitan (C/B).
    *   **Am6 (♭VII6):** This is another common minor-key chord. A is the ♭VII. The Am6 spelling (A-C-E-F#) is particularly interesting. The F# is the leading tone, which creates a strong pull back to the tonic Bm. It's a very colorful way to approach the `i` chord.

4.  **Putting it all together into a Roman Numeral Analysis:**

    *   Bm: `i`
    *   Bm: `i`
    *   G/B: `♭VI6` (Flat six in first inversion)
    *   G/B: `♭VI6`
    *   Bm: `i`
    *   Bm: `i`
    *   D/A: `IV6` (Major subdominant in first inversion)
    *   C/B: `N6` (Neapolitan sixth)
    *   Bm: `i`
    *   Bm: `i`
    *   G/B: `♭VI6`
    *   G/B: `♭VI6`
    *   Bm: `i`
    *   Bm: `i`
    *   Am6: `♭VII6` (Flat seven in first inversion, with the 6th giving it the F# leading tone)
    *   Bm: `i`

    *Correction/Refinement during analysis:* Is D/A `IV6` or `III6`? Let's re-evaluate. In B natural minor, the chords are: `i Bm`, `ii° C#°`, `III D`, `iv Em`, `v F#m`, `VI G`, `VII A`. So D is `III`. In B harmonic minor, the chords are: `i Bm`, `ii° C#°`, `III+ Daug`, `iv Em`, `V F#`, `VI G`, `vii° A#°`. So D is `III+` (augmented). In B major, D is `iii`. In B Dorian, D is `IV`. Given the context of other borrowed chords like `♭VI` and `N`, it's most likely functioning as a subdominant (`IV`). The use of a major IV in a minor key is extremely common (borrowed from the major or Dorian). So, `IV6` is the most functionally accurate label. The use of `III` from natural minor is also possible, but feels less strong than the subdominant pull. Let's stick with `IV6` as the primary functional explanation.

5.  **Determining the Mode:**

    *   We've established the key is B minor. Now, which minor mode?
    *   **Natural Minor?** The use of G (♭VI) and A (♭VII) fits perfectly. However, the Am6 chord contains an F#, which is the leading tone from the harmonic/melodic minor scales. The Neapolitan chord (C/B) is also a hallmark of the harmonic minor context, as it's typically used to lead to the dominant chord (which would be F# major, containing the leading tone). So, it's not *just* natural minor.
    *   **Harmonic Minor?** The F# in the Am6 chord and the presence of the Neapolitan (which resolves to the dominant, F#) strongly point towards the harmonic minor scale's influence. However, we don't see an F# or F#7 chord explicitly. We also see a G major chord (♭VI), which is diatonic to natural minor but chromatic to harmonic minor (where the 6th degree, G, is raised to G#). So, it's not *strictly* harmonic minor.
    *   **Melodic Minor?** The melodic minor scale (ascending) has a raised 6th and 7th (G# and F#). We have G natural and F#. This doesn't fit.
    *   **Dorian?** The Dorian mode has a raised 6th (G#). We have G natural. So, it's not Dorian.

6.  **Conclusion on Mode:**

    *   The progression is firmly in **B minor**.
    *   It is not strictly one of the "three" minor scales. It's a **minor key progression that borrows chords**.
    *   The primary flavor is **B Natural Minor**, because of the prominent use of the diatonic chords `i` (Bm), `♭VI` (G), and `♭VII` (A).
    *   However, it's heavily colored by chromatic harmony borrowed from the **harmonic minor** tradition, most notably the **Neapolitan chord (C/B)** and the leading tone (F#) found in the **Am6** chord.
    *   This is very common in film scores, classical music, and more sophisticated rock/pop music. The tonality is "minor," but it uses a palette of chords from both the natural and harmonic minor worlds to create a specific mood.

7.  **Final Answer Formulation:**

    *   Start with the clear answer: Key is B minor.
    *   Explain the evidence: The tonic is Bm, and the progression starts and ends there.
    *   Break down the chords and explain their function.
    *   Address the "mode" question directly. Explain that it's not a simple one-to-one mapping to a standard mode.
    *   Use the term "minor key" instead of just "minor mode."
    *   Explain the blend of Natural Minor and Harmonic Minor characteristics.
    *   Provide the Roman Numeral analysis as a clear, technical summary.
    *   Describe the overall "vibe" or "feel" of the progression (e.g., dramatic, cinematic, melancholic but with strong forward motion). This adds a qualitative layer to the technical analysis.


This is a fantastic and intriguing chord progression. Let's break it down.

### The Key

The key is **B minor**.

**Evidence:**
1.  **Tonic Center:** The progression begins and ends on B minor, and it's the most frequently occurring chord. This firmly establishes B as the tonal center.
2.  **Functional Harmony:** The other chords, while some are borrowed, function in relation to B minor.

### The Mode / Analysis

This progression is not strictly in a single "mode" like Dorian or Aeolian. It's best described as being in the **minor key** with a heavy use of borrowed and chromatic chords, creating a dramatic, cinematic feel.

The primary flavor is **B Natural Minor**, but it's colored heavily by chords associated with the **Harmonic Minor**.

Let's analyze the chords by their function in B minor (B - C# - D - E - F# - G - A):

*   **Bm (i):** The tonic chord. Our home base.
*   **G/B (♭VI6):** This is a G major chord with B in the bass. G is the flatted sixth degree of B minor. This is a very common borrowed chord (from the natural minor scale) that creates a rich, melancholic sound. The "6" indicates it's in first inversion.
*   **D/A (IV6):** This is a D major chord with A in the bass. D is the fourth degree of B minor. Using a **major** IV chord in a minor key is a very common technique (borrowed from the parallel major or Dorian mode). It provides a moment of lift or hope before returning to the minor tonic.
*   **C/B (N6):** This is the most telling chord. It's a C major chord with B in the bass. This is a **Neapolitan Sixth Chord**. The Neapolitan is a chromatically altered chord (♭II) used almost exclusively in minor keys to create powerful tension that leads to the dominant. Its presence strongly confirms the minor key context.
*   **Am6 (♭VII6):** This is an A minor sixth chord. The notes are A-C-E-F#. A is the flatted seventh degree of B minor. The chord is a very colorful way to approach the tonic. The inclusion of the F# (the leading tone from the harmonic minor scale) in the Am6 chord creates a strong pull back to the Bm.

Here is the functional analysis of the progression:

`i`   | `i`   | `♭VI6` | `♭VI6` | `i`   | `i`
---|---|---|---|---|---
Bm   | Bm   | G/B   | G/B   | Bm   | Bm

`IV6` | `N6`  | `i`   | `i`   | `♭VI6` | `♭VI6`
---|---|---|---|---|---
D/A  | C/B   | Bm   | Bm   | G/B   | G/B

`i`   | `i`   | `♭VII6`| `i`
---|---|---|---
Bm   | Bm   | Am6   | Bm

### Summary

*   **Key:** **B Minor**
*   **Mode/Style:** A minor key progression that blends diatonic chords from the **Natural Minor** scale (i, ♭VI, ♭VII) with chromatic chords from the **Harmonic Minor** tradition (the Neapolitan N6 and the leading tone F#). This is a sound very characteristic of film scores, classical music, and sophisticated rock/pop. It avoids the simple V-i cadence in favor of more colorful and dramatic harmonic motion like `N6 - i` and `♭VII6 - i`.
