### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to determine the key and mode from the chord progression: "Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm." The chords include Bm, G/B, D/A, C/B, and Am6. It seems I'm looking at either B Dorian or B Aeolian here. 

In B natural minor, the diatonic chords show that my assumptions about the chords' relationships might lead to misunderstandings regarding their roles in the key. The bII is indeed C natural, which doesn't fit neatly into B minor.**Clarifying chord relationships**

I've got C/B, which is C major with B as the bass, leading to a possible B Phrygian interpretation due to the notes (C E G plus B). However, C# is diatonic in B natural minor, not C natural. 

G major is fine, but includes no C. D major is also correct. The C natural only appears in the C/B chord, and Am6 contributes an F#. 

In B Aeolian, if A is minor, that could suggest a borrowed bVII minor, which brings some confusion around the A major versus A minor context.**Exploring Dorian and Phrygian modes**

If we're in B Dorian, the chords would be: i Bm, ii C#dim, III D, IV E, v F#m, vi G, VII A#dim. But, A minor doesn't fit, and C natural isn't part of B Dorian since it has C#. 

In B Phrygian, C natural is diatonic, and I’m wondering about the relation to D major or D minor. D major fits with F#, while B Phrygian has A natural.

Wait, B Phrygian notes indicate that it might relate to the third mode of G major. Let’s see how this aligns!**Confirming B Phrygian and chords**

So, B Phrygian is indeed the third mode of G major, with notes G A B C D E F#. This confirms that B C D E F# G A matches up. 

The D major chord (D F# A) and G major chord (G B D) fit well into B Phrygian. Am6 adds F#, which works perfectly. 

Now, when I look at the C/B chord (C E G over B bass), it appears to consist entirely of notes from the scale, effectively becoming a Cmaj7/B voicing, adding some interesting harmonic context. This gives B a leading tone to C!**Determining key and mode**

In B Phrygian, C is the b2 scale degree, and Cmaj7 uses B natural, which feels plausible. However, in B natural minor, C natural isn't diatonic. The presence of C natural in chords like C/B and Am6 hints at modal mixture or a key change.

The tonic chord in B Phrygian is B minor. Analyzing the chords shows they fit the B Phrygian framework. Overall, the tonal center is B, with the mode being Phrygian, and it derives from the G major/E minor parent scale. If I had to sum up, I'd say: "B Phrygian, with G major/E minor as the parent scale."

B Phrygian (tonal center B, mode = Phrygian). 
All chords fit B Phrygian: B C D E F# G A (parent key signature: G major / E minor, one sharp).
