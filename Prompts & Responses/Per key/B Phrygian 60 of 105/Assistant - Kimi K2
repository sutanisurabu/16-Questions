To determine the **key and mode** of this chord progression:

**Chord progression:**
```
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm
```

---

### Step 1: Look at the overall tonic
- The progression **starts and ends on Bm**.
- **Bm** is the most frequent chord.
- The final resolution is to **Bm**, suggesting **B** is the tonal center.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the chord qualities and notes

Let’s list the notes in each chord:

- **Bm**: B D F#
- **G/B**: G B D (G major in first inversion)
- **D/A**: D F# A (D major in first inversion)
- **C/B**: C E G B (C major with B in bass – effectively Cmaj7/B)
- **Am6**: A C E F# (this is an **F#ø7** in first inversion, or Am6)

---

### Step 3: Look at the scale implied

From the chords, the unique pitches are:

**B C D E F# G A**

This is the **B natural minor scale**:
- B C♯ D E F♯ G A → but **C natural** appears (in C/B and Am6), **not C♯**.

So this is **B minor with a lowered 6th scale degree** — that is:

> **B Aeolian** (natural minor), **not harmonic or melodic minor**.

---

### Step 4: Check for modal mixture or color

- The **Am6** chord (A C E F#) includes **F#**, the major 6th above A, but in the key of B minor, **F# is the natural 3rd**, so this is **not unusual**.
- The **C/B** chord is a **Cmaj7/B**, which is a **borrowed chord** or **passing color**, not a modulator.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: B minor**  
> **Mode: B Aeolian (natural minor)**

No strong evidence of modal mixture or mode change — just chromatic voice leading and inversions.
