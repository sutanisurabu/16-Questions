B dorian

### Explanation
- **Key/tonic**: B (the progression centers on Bm as the i chord, starting and ending there, with bass emphasis on B).
- **Mode**: Dorian (fits the natural minor family but with characteristic ♭2, ♭3, ♮6, and ♭7 scale degrees: B–C–D–E–F♯–G–A). All chords are diatonic or compatible:
  - Bm (i)
  - G/B (VI / i)
  - D/A (III / VII)
  - C/B (♭VII / i)
  - Am6 (VII6, with ♮6 added)
- This progression evokes a modal folk/rock feel (e.g., reminiscent of some Animals or Doors tunes, though not an exact match). If transposed or interpreted differently (e.g., as modal mixture in B aeolian), it could lean toward B minor, but the C major chords confirm the dorian ♭2.
