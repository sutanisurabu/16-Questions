Let’s break this down step by step.

**1. Identify the chords and their likely functions**

The progression is:

Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  
Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  
Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm

---

**2. Look at the bass movement**

- Bm = B–D–F♯  
- G/B = G–B–D with bass B  
- D/A = D–F♯–A with bass A  
- C/B = C–E–G with bass B  
- Am6 = A–C–E–F♯ (Am6 = F♯m7♭5 / A? Actually Am6 = A–C–E–F♯, yes)

Bass line in order:  
B B B B | B B A B | B B B B | B B A B

---

**3. Determine possible key from chord roots and common progressions**

Chords: Bm, G, D, C, Am6

Bm is clearly the tonic candidate — starts and ends phrases, begins and ends the progression.

Possible keys containing Bm:  
- B minor (B Aeolian / natural minor)  
- B Dorian  
- D major (relative major of B minor) — but then Bm would be vi, not tonic.

**4. Check scale compatibility**

B natural minor scale: B C♯ D E F♯ G A  
Chords:  
- Bm = B–D–F♯ ✅  
- G = G–B–D ✅ (in B natural minor, G is ♭VI)  
- D = D–F♯–A ✅ (in B natural minor, D is i♭III? Actually D is D major = D–F♯–A — F♯ is in B minor, A is in B natural minor, so D major is the III chord in B melodic minor ascending, but in natural minor D is D–F♯–A? Wait, check: B natural minor: B C♯ D E F♯ G A — D–F♯–A = D major, yes. So D major is native to B natural minor as the III chord.)  
- C = C–E–G ❌ (C♯ is in B natural minor, so C natural is ♭VII? No, C natural is not in B natural minor scale — B natural minor has C♯. So C major implies either B Dorian or borrowing from B Phrygian? Let’s check: C major = C–E–G; in B Dorian (B C♯ D E F♯ G♯ A) the G♯ makes G major, not C major. Actually C major in B Dorian? C–E–G: E is in B Dorian, G is not (G♯ is). So C major is not in B Dorian either. So C major is a borrowed chord — maybe from B Phrygian (B C D E F♯ G A) — yes! B Phrygian has C major as ♭II.)

So C major is the ♭II (Neapolitan) in B Phrygian or B minor borrowing from Phrygian.

Am6 = A–C–E–F♯ — in B natural minor: A–C–E–F♯: A is in scale, C is not (C♯ is), E is in scale, F♯ is in scale. So C natural again — same Phrygian borrowing.

**5. Mode determination**

We have:  
- Bm = i  
- G = ♭VI (native to B natural minor)  
- D = III (native to B natural minor)  
- C = ♭II (borrowed from Phrygian)  
- Am6 = ♭VIIm6 (also from Phrygian: A–C–E–F♯ is actually F♯m7♭5 / A? Wait, Am6 = A–C–E–F♯ = F♯m7♭5? No, F♯m7♭5 = F♯–A–C–E, yes that’s the same notes as Am6. So Am6 is just first inversion of F♯m7♭5. F♯m7♭5 in B natural minor? F♯–A–C–E: A is in B natural minor, C is not (C♯ is), so it’s F♯ half-diminished from B harmonic minor (F♯–A–C–E). So Am6 is a common substitution for F♯ø in a minor key.)

So the C major and F♯ø (as Am6) suggest B **harmonic minor** influence (F♯ø is viiø7 in B harmonic minor) and also Phrygian ♭II (C major).

But overall, the tonic is Bm, the presence of D major (III) and G major (♭VI) points to **B natural minor / Aeolian** as the primary scale, with occasional borrowed chords (C from Phrygian, F♯ø from harmonic minor).

---

**6. Conclusion**

Key: **B minor** (Aeolian mode as the primary sound, with modal mixture).

Mode: **B Aeolian** (natural minor), with borrowed ♭II (C) from Phrygian and viiø7 (F♯ø) from harmonic minor.

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{B \ \text{minor} \ (\text{Aeolian})}
\]
