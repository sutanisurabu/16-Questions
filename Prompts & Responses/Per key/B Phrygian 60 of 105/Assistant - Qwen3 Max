Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chord Sequence:**

Bm Bm G/B G/B  
Bm Bm D/A C/B  
Bm Bm G/B G/B  
Bm Bm Am6 Bm

---

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center

The progression **starts and ends on Bm**, and Bm appears **very frequently**, suggesting **B minor** as the tonic.

### Step 2: Look at the diatonic chords in B natural minor (Aeolian)

B natural minor scale: **B C# D E F# G A**

Diatonic triads:
- Bm (i)
- C#° (ii°)
- D (III)
- Em (iv)
- F#m (v)
- G (VI)
- A (VII)

Now compare with the chords used:

- **Bm** → i → ✅
- **G/B** → G major with B in the bass → that’s **VI** (G major) in B minor → ✅
- **D/A** → D major with A in the bass → D is **III** in B minor → ✅
- **C/B** → C major with B in the bass → C is **♭II** (or Neapolitan chord) → **outside natural minor**
- **Am6** → A minor with added 6th (F#) → Am6 = A–C–E–F# → This is **v7♭5** or can be seen as **A half-diminished** if we include the F♮, but here it’s **A–C–E–F#**, which implies **A Dorian** or **A melodic minor** influence. Not found in B natural minor.

Wait — Am6 = A–C–E–F#. The F# is the **major 6th** above A. So this chord contains **F#**, which **is** in B natural minor (since B natural minor has F#). But C is **not** in B natural minor — B natural minor has **C#**, not C♮.

So **C/B** and **Am6** both contain **C natural**, which is **not** in B natural minor.

That suggests **modal mixture** or a shift in mode.

### Step 3: Consider B Dorian

B Dorian scale: **B C# D E F# G# A**

Wait — that has **G#**, but we have **G natural** in G major chord. So **not Dorian**.

### Step 4: Consider B melodic minor?

B melodic minor (ascending): **B C# D E F# G# A#** – again, has G#, not matching G major.

### Step 5: Consider B harmonic minor

B harmonic minor: **B C# D E F# G A#**

Still has **A#**, but we have **A natural** in D/A and Am6 — so **not harmonic minor**.

### Step 6: Re-express chords in terms of B Aeolian with borrowed chords

- **C/B** = C major over B → C is **♭II** → common **Neapolitan chord** in minor keys.
- **Am6** = A–C–E–F# → this is **A minor with a major 6th**, which is **v6** in B minor, but the **C natural** is **♭6** scale degree (since B natural minor has G, not G# – wait, correction: in B minor, the 6th scale degree is **G**. C is the **♭2**.)

Hold on — in B minor:
- Scale degrees:  
  1 = B  
  2 = C#  
  ♭2 = C  
  3 = D  
  4 = E  
  5 = F#  
  ♭6 = G  
  6 = G#  
  ♭7 = A  
  7 = A#

So **C natural = ♭2**, **G natural = ♭6**, **A natural = ♭7**

So we are using:
- **♭7** (A) → D chord (III) uses A as 5th → fine in natural minor
- **♭6** (G) → G major chord (VI) → fine in natural minor
- **♭2** (C) → appears in **C/B** and **Am6**

So **C natural** is the outlier — it’s **not in natural, harmonic, or melodic B minor**.

But **C major chord** is common as a **Neapolitan (♭II)** in minor keys — typically used in **first inversion**, but here it's **C/B**, which is **♭II with tonic in the bass** — a variant that smooths voice leading.

**Am6** contains C natural — so again using ♭2.

This suggests **borrowing from Phrygian mode** or using **Phrygian-inflected minor**.

### Step 7: Consider B Phrygian

B Phrygian scale: **B C D E F# G A**

- This has **C natural** (♭2), **D** (♭3), **G** (♭6), **A** (♭7)
- Chords:
  - Bm (i) → B–D–F#
  - C (♭II) → C–E–G → matches C/B
  - D (♭III) → D–F#–A → matches D/A
  - G (♭VI) → G–B–D → matches G/B
  - Am (♭vii) → A–C–E → and with added F# = Am6

**Am6 = A–C–E–F#** — F# is not in B Phrygian! B Phrygian has **F natural**, not F#.

Wait — B Phrygian: B C D E F G A → **F natural**, but our chords contain **F#** (in Bm, D, Am6).

So F# is present → that contradicts Phrygian.

### Step 8: Reconcile F# and C

We have both:
- **F#** → from B minor key signature
- **C natural** → foreign to B minor

This is characteristic of **tonicizing B minor with chromatic alterations**, especially using the **Neapolitan chord (♭II = C)**.

The presence of **Am6** (A–C–E–F#) is interesting: this chord can be viewed as **F# half-diminished 1st inversion**:
- F#–A–C–E = F#m7♭5 → which is **iiø7** in E minor, but here over A, it’s Am6.

But in **B minor**, F#m7♭5 is the **iiø7** chord (if we temporarily treat B as vi of D major?) — maybe not.

Alternatively, **Am6** can be seen as a **subdominant chord** with added 6th, common in minor keys.

### Step 9: Conclusion

The **tonal center is B**, and the **core mode is B natural minor (Aeolian)**.

The chords **C/B** and **Am6** introduce **C natural**, which is **chromatic** — specifically the **♭2 scale degree** — used for expressive color, likely derived from **Phrygian mode** or **Neapolitan function**.

However, the **overall key is B minor**, and the **mode is primarily Aeolian** with **Phrygian-inflected chromaticism**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **Key:** B minor  
- **Mode:** Primarily **Aeolian (natural minor)** with **chromatic alterations** (♭II Neapolitan and related chords), giving it a **Phrygian flavor** in places.

So: **B minor (Aeolian with Phrygian borrowings)**.
