### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: "Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm D/A C/B Bm Bm G/B G/B Bm Bm Am6 Bm". They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to list out all the chords without the bass notes for simplicity. So the progression is: Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, D/A, C/B, Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, Am6, Bm. Now, the slash chords like G/B and D/A mean the bass note is specified, but the chord itself is G major and D major respectively. Similarly, C/B is a C major chord with B in the bass, which is often used as a passing chord or part of a different function.

Let me write down the actual chords ignoring the bass notes for now. So G/B is still G major, D/A is D major, C/B is C major. Am6 is A minor sixth, which is A-C-E-F#. Wait, but in the context of key, maybe it's better to think of the root chords. So the distinct chords are Bm, G, D, C, Am6.

Now, let's look at the root notes: B, G, D, C, A. So the chords are on B, G, D, C, A. But the key might be based on the tonal center. Typically, the key is determined by which chord feels like home, the tonic. Let's see how many times each chord appears. The progression starts and ends with Bm, and there are multiple Bm chords. Let me count:

- Bm appears at the start, then again after the first two G/B, then after D/A and C/B, and so on. Let's count all Bm occurrences: positions 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,16. So that's 9 times. G/B appears twice at start (but that's G), then later twice, so total 4 G chords. D/A is one D chord. C/B is one C chord. Am6 once. So Bm is the most frequent, but is it the tonic?

Wait, B minor. Let's see the notes in B minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. The chords from B minor natural key: i is Bm, ii° is C#dim, III is D, IV is Em, v is F#m, VI is G, VII is A. Wait, but in the progression, we have G major and D major. In B minor, the VI chord is G major, and III is D major. But here, there's also a C chord. C major? In B natural minor, the C would be C#dim, which is C#-E-G. But here we have C major, which is C-E-G. That doesn't fit B natural minor. Similarly, Am6 is A minor sixth, which would be A-C-E-F#. But in B minor, A is the VII chord, which is A major. But here it's Am6, which is minor sixth, so A minor with added sixth.

Wait, maybe it's in D major? Let's check D major key: D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#. Chords: D, Em, F#m, G, Am, Bm, C#dim. If the key is D major, then Bm would be the vi chord. But the chord C is not in D major; D major has C#, so C natural would be from outside the key. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's in G major? G major chords: G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim. Let's see. G major: G is I, A minor is ii, Bm is iii, C is IV, D is V, Em is vi, F#dim is vii°. Now look at the chord progression: Bm (iii), G (I), D (V), C (IV), Am6. Wait, Am6 would be A minor with added sixth, which in G major is the ii chord (Am), but adding the sixth would make it A-C-E-F#. In G major scale, F# is the leading tone, so F natural would be outside. Wait, Am6 would have F# if it's Am6, but in standard, Am6 is A-C-E-F#, which in G major, that's correct because F# is in the scale. Wait G major has F#, so Am6 is A-C-E-F#, which is part of the scale. Let's check.

In G major: scale is G A B C D E F#. So Am6 would be A minor chord with sixth F#, which is correct—A-C-E-F#. But usually, we just say Am, but Am6 specifies the added note. But the presence of A minor chord is okay in G major. Similarly, Bm is iii, G is I, D is V, C is IV. The chords present are Bm, G, D, C, Am6. All of these are diatonic to G major except... Wait, Am6 is still part of G major. Am is the ii chord, and adding the sixth (F#) is still part of the scale.

But looking back at the progression, the main chords are Bm, G, D, C, A minor (with sixth). So if we're in G major, then the tonic would be G. But the progression starts and ends on Bm. However, sometimes songs start on a chord that's not the tonic but still in the key. But if the piece seems to resolve to G, but here the last chord is Bm, which might not be the tonic. Wait, let's see the progression again:

Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, D/A, C/B, Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B, Bm, Bm, Am6, Bm.

So ends on Bm. But if in G major, Bm is iii, so it's not the tonic. But the presence of D major and C major, which in G major are V and IV chords. So it might be in the key of G major, but starting on iii. But maybe the tonal center is G? Let's see the chords: G, C, D are the primary chords in G major: I, IV, V. And Bm is iii, which is a common chord. So even though it starts on Bm, the key could still be G major. Let me check if that fits.

Alternatively, maybe it's B minor. But earlier I thought B natural minor has D major as III, G major as VI, but the chords of C major and D major would conflict. Because in B natural minor, the scale is B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. So chords would be Bm (i), C#dim (ii°), D (III), Em (iv), F#m (v), G (VI), A (VII). So the VII chord is A major. But in the given progression, we have C chord. Wait, C natural major chord. In B natural minor, there is no C natural. The note is C natural? Wait, the scale has C#, so C natural would be a chromatic note, which is possible, but perhaps not diatonic. Similarly, D/A is D major, which in B natural minor is the III chord (D major), which is okay. G major is VI, okay. But C major chord—C-E-G—would require a C natural. But in B natural minor scale, the third note is C#, so C natural is not present. So the C chord would be borrowed. But the chord C/B—C major with B bass, which is often used as a passing chord. But if the key were B natural minor, then having a C major chord would be outside the scale. Unless we're using a different mode.

Wait, maybe B Dorian? Dorian mode has a minor third and major sixth. Let's check. B Dorian scale: B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. Wait no, Dorian mode on B would be B C# D E F# G# A? Wait, no. Let's recall Dorian mode is minor with a raised sixth. So starting on B: B C# D E F# G# A B. The scale has F# and G#, but in the chords we have a C chord, which is C major (C-E-G). In B Dorian, the C would be C# or C natural? The B Dorian scale has C# as the second note. So a C natural chord would not be part of the mode. So probably not.

Wait, let's consider E minor. E natural minor scale: E F# G A B C D. Chords: Em (i), F#dim (ii°), G (III), Am (iv), Bm (v), C (VI), D (VII). So here, C major is VI. So if the key is E minor, then the chords Bm is v, G is III, D is VII, C is VI. Let's see the progression:

Bm is present. G major is III. D major is VII. C major is VI. And then Am6. In E minor, the Am chord would be the iv chord, which is A minor. Am6 would be Am with added F#, but in E natural minor, F# is part of the scale. So Am6 would be A-C-E-F#, which fits because F# is in E minor.

But let's see. The progression has Bm, G, D, C, A minor. If key is E minor, then the V chord would be B major (dominant), but here we have Bm. Which is minor, not major. So that's a problem. In natural minor, the V chord is minor, but usually in classical, it's raised to major for the leading tone. However, if it's purely E natural minor, then V chord is Bm. Then in the progression, D chord is VII (D major), C is VI (C major), etc. Let's see if all chords fit E minor.

E natural minor: E F# G A B C D.

Chords:

i: Em

ii°: F#dim

III: G

iv: Am

v: Bm

VI: C

VII: D

Yes, exactly. So Bm is v chord, G is III, D is VII, C is VI, Am is iv. So the progression has all these chords. But in the progression given, the chords are Bm, G/B (so G major), D/A (D major), C/B (C major), and Am6 (A minor sixth). In E minor, Am6 would be A-C-E-F#, but in the E natural minor scale, the sixth note is C, but the sixth degree is the A note, so A minor chord with added sixth: the sixth above A is F#, which is in the scale. Wait yes, E minor scale has F#. So Am6 would be A-C-E-F#, which fits.

But the tonal center here would be E minor. But the progression starts and ends with Bm. So if it's E minor, then Bm is the v chord. However, the progression is mostly Bm, which might make someone think the tonic is B minor. But if the key is E minor, then the tonic is E. But in the chord progression given, there's no E chord at all. All chords are Bm, G, D, C, Am. So if the key is E minor, then E isn't present, but sometimes pieces don't have the tonic chord all the time. For example, in many songs, the tonic might not be played frequently, or it's implied. Let's check if the chords relate to E.

Another way: let's see the note that seems to be the tonic. Let's list all notes in the chords. Bm is B, D, F#. G/B would be G, B, D but bass on B. D/A is D, F#, A. C/B is C, E, G with bass B. Am6 is A, C, E, F#. Bm again. So the notes present are B, D, F#, G, C, E, A.

If we collect all the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#. Wait, that's the E natural minor scale: E F# G A B C D. Wait, the notes are E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. So the notes in the chords are A, B, C, D, E, F#. So missing E? Wait, E is present in some chords. For example, in the Am6 chord: A, C, E, F#. Yes, E is there. Also, in Bm: B, D, F#; G has G, B, D; D/A has D, F#, A; C/B has C, E, G (wait, C major is C, E, G. C/B would have B in bass, but the chord still has C, E, G). So notes present: A, B, C, D, E, F#. That's exactly the E natural minor scale (E, F#, G, A, B, C, D). So all the notes fit into E natural minor. E minor has exactly those notes. So that's a strong indicator that the key is E minor.

But then why does the progression start and end on Bm? In E minor, Bm is the v chord, which is the dominant chord. But the tonic is E. However, if the song doesn't have E chord but uses the tonic in the melody, maybe it's still in E minor. Alternatively, maybe the piece is in B minor, but we saw that the C chord doesn't fit. Wait, in B natural minor, the scale has B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A. But in the notes we have from chords, like C natural (from C major chord), which isn't in B natural minor. So C natural is outside. So if the chords use C natural, which would not be part of B minor. So that suggests that key is not B minor.

But E natural minor has all those notes. So the presence of C natural chord makes sense because in E minor, the C is the VI chord. Similarly, D is the VII chord. So if the key is E minor, then all chords are diatonic.

Wait, but in E natural minor, the chords are Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D. Let's check:

- Bm: yes, that's the v chord.

- G: III

- D: VII

- C: VI

- Am: iv

- Am6: Am with added sixth (F#), which is still within the scale.

So all these chords fit perfectly into E minor. So even though there's no E chord at all, the chords are all part of E natural minor scale. The tonic is E, which isn't present, but that's possible. Sometimes songs don't use the tonic chord. For example, Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" has a section that's in A minor but starts on F chord or something. So the tonic might still be E minor.

But another way to check: what is the most common chord? Bm appears 9 times, which is very frequent. Next is G and D perhaps. But in E natural minor, Bm is the v. But in rock/pop, sometimes the song might be in a minor key where the v chord is used a lot. But usually, the tonic chord would be present at least once, but not always. However, considering that all the chords fit into E minor, and there is no chord with F#, C#, or G#, which would be other modes.

Wait, but in E natural minor, we have no C# in the scale. So if the chords have only these notes, then E minor makes sense. Let's check: in E minor natural scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. All these are natural notes except that it's all white keys if starting from E. Wait, E minor natural has the same key signature as G major: one sharp (F#). So yes, all notes fit.

So the key would be E minor. But why does the progression start and end on Bm? If it's E minor, then the tonic is E, not Bm. But perhaps the melody centers around E, even if the chords avoid E. Alternatively, perhaps the key is B minor, but with accidentals? Let me check another mode.

What about B Aeolian? Wait Aeolian is natural minor, same as B natural minor. But then scale is B C# D E F# G A. But in the progression, there is a C chord, which has C natural. But B natural minor has C#, so C natural would be a chromatic note. So that's inconsistent. Therefore, B minor can't be the key because of the C major chord.

Alternatively, maybe B Dorian? B Dorian mode scale: B C# D E F# G# A. Wait, Dorian has a raised sixth. So B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. So the scale would have G# instead of G. But in our progression, the G chord is mentioned. Wait, the chord G/B is G major, which would be G-B-D. But in B Dorian, the note G is G natural, but Dorian has G# if? Let's see: B Dorian: the mode of A major. A major has F#, C#, G#, D#, etc. Wait, B Dorian would be the second mode of A major. So A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. So the B Dorian scale is B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. So the scale has G#, not G natural. But in the chord G/B, which is G major, that would require G natural. So in B Dorian, G is G#? No, because G# is the seventh note in A major, so in B Dorian, the seventh scale degree is G#.

Wait, let's list B Dorian intervals:

B (root), C# (2), D (3), E (4), F# (5), G# (6), A (7), B.

Wait, no: the Dorian mode is minor third and major sixth. So for B Dorian:

1. B (minor third is D natural, fourth is E, fifth is F#, sixth is G#? Let's see.

Wait, Dorian mode has a minor third and a major sixth. So for example, D Dorian is D E F G A B C D. So D minor third is F natural, but sixth is B natural. So B Dorian would be B C# D E F# G# A. So the sixth note is G#. So in B Dorian, you have G#, not G natural. So having a G major chord (G natural) would not fit because the scale has G#.

Therefore, the presence of G natural suggests that the key isn't Dorian.

What if it's C Lydian? Probably not. Let's think again. The chords have notes A, B, C, D, E, F#. That's exactly the E natural minor scale (since E natural minor is A minor's relative major? Wait, E natural minor shares the same key signature as G major: F# only. So chords have those notes.

So if all the chords are part of E minor, then the key is E minor.

Another check: the common practice is to look at the tonic chord, but if not present, look for which chord provides resolution. But in this progression: it starts on Bm, then goes to G/B (which is G major with B bass), which is a G chord. Then Bm again. Let's see possible cadences. For example, the D chord to G chord: D and G together could be a V-I in C major? Wait, but we're checking E minor.

In E minor, the main chords are Em (i), Am (iv), Bm (v), C (VI), D (VII). So the progression uses v, III, VII, VI. Now, the chord progression sometimes might cycle through these. For example, a common progression in E minor is: Bm - C - D - Em. But in this case, there's no Em. But it has Am6 and Bm.

Alternatively, maybe it's G major, but then the note F# is present. In G major, scale is G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. So notes: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. Now, check the chords: Bm is iii, G is I, D is V, C is IV, Am6 is A minor sixth (A-C-E-F#), which is diatonic. But in G major, the sixth chord would be Em. Am is the ii chord. So Am6 is A minor with added sixth, which is F#, so yes, fits. But why would the key be G major then? Let's see, the tonic would be G. But the progression does not have a G chord that is resolved to G or something. Wait, the G chords are present: two G/B chords early on, then again later. So G major is present as I. And it starts on Bm (iii), and G is in the progression. But the piece ends on Bm. If in G major, Bm is iii, then it's not the tonic. So the tonic could be G. But again, if there's no clear resolution to G, but Bm is the main chord.

Wait, but in G major, the chords would all fit. However, in B minor context, there were conflicts with the C chord. But if it's E minor vs G major...

Wait, E natural minor and G major share the same key signature: one sharp (F#). They're relative minor and major. So both are possible. How to distinguish between them?

Typically, the key is determined by the tonal center. Which chord feels like home. Let's look at the chord progression: it's mostly Bm. If the music feels like it's resolving to Bm, then perhaps the key is B minor. But earlier we saw that B minor natural doesn't include C natural chord. However, if the piece uses C natural, then it's not B minor. Unless the C chord is borrowed. But let's see if there's another possibility.

Wait, what if it's B minor but with a C major chord as a borrowed chord from the parallel major? B major scale has B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. So B major's key signature has five sharps. B minor natural is as before. But if the piece uses C major chord (C-E-G), that would be chromatic.

Alternatively, maybe the key is C major? C major has no sharps. Chords would be C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim. Check the chords in the progression: Bm—that's B minor, which in C major would be the vii° chord? No, C major's vii° is Bdim. But in our chords, it's Bm, which is minor, not diminished. So Bm wouldn't fit in C major because in C major, B is Bdim. So that's not possible.

Back to E minor vs G major. Let's see the notes in all chords. The progression has: Bm = B, D, F#; G is G, B, D; D/A is D, A, F#; C/B is C, E, G (since C/B is C major with bass B); Am6 is A, C, E, F#. So all notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#. Both E minor and G major have all these notes. So which one is it?

The difference is who is the tonic. To determine this, sometimes the presence of a chord that acts as a dominant would help. For example, in G major, the V chord is D major. Which we have. In E minor, the dominant chord (V) would be B major usually (for a strong cadence), but here the v chord is B minor. In E minor, the natural minor has Bm as v, but often the V chord is raised to B major for a stronger cadence. But if the song uses Bm instead, then it could be E natural minor. But if it's using G major, then the D chord is V, so maybe there's a V-I cadence to G. However, in this progression, how often does D resolve to G? Let's look:

Looking at the progression:

Bm, Bm, G/B, G/B,...

So G/B is G major with B bass. Then Bm again. So maybe G to Bm. In G major, that would be I to iii. In E minor, that's III to v.

Not sure. Another way: look for the tonic chord. If there's never an E chord, but in E minor the tonic is E, so if the melody centers on E, but we have no chord. Whereas in G major, the tonic is G. The progression has G chords present. Let's see: G/B appears multiple times. G chord is present. So G is the tonic chord for key of G? But then Bm is iii, which is fine.

But then why would it end on Bm? That's unusual. Usually, a song would end on tonic. But not always. For example, "Hey There Delilah" ends on the subdominant. So maybe.

Wait, let's check the specific progression again. The progression is: Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | D/A | C/B | Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | Am6 | Bm.

Let's see the movement between chords. Starting on Bm, then G (but as G/B, which is G major). So Bm to G. In G major, Bm is iii, G is I. So I to iii is possible. In E minor, G is III and Bm is v. So v to III.

Another spot: D/A is D major with bass A, so D chord. Then C/B, which is C major with bass B. Then Bm. So D to C to Bm. In G major: D is V, C is IV, Bm is iii. So V-IV-iii. In E minor, D is VII, C is VI, Bm is v. VII-VI-v.

The Am6 comes before last Bm. So Am6 to Bm. In E minor: iv to v. In G major: vi to iii.

Another cadence: the D/A followed by C/B then Bm. If it's E minor, VII-VI-v. In some styles, the VII chord can act as a lead-in to V, but here it's going to v. But in minor keys, sometimes VII is used to resolve to i? Let's see.

But without hearing it, it's hard. However, considering that all the chords are diatonic to both G major and E minor, which are relative keys. So the key could be either, but the mode would be minor (E minor) or major (G major), depending on tonic.

To decide between them, we can see which note is the tonal center. For example, if the melody uses the E note a lot, then it's E minor. If it uses G note a lot, then G major. Without hearing the melody, we can look at the chords. But in the progression given, the bass note: for example, G/B means bass is B, so the chord is G, but bass on B. Similarly D/A is D chord with A bass. So the bass notes are: B, B, B, B, B, B, A, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, A, B.

Wait, looking at bass notes: the progression as written: Bm (so bass B?), G/B (bass B), G/B (B), Bm (B), Bm (B), D/A (A), C/B (B), Bm (B), etc. So the bass notes are mostly B and A. So the bass is going between B and A a lot. In G major, the A would be the ii, but not sure. In E minor, the A would be D (wait E minor scale notes: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D. So A is the fourth scale degree. So if bass is going between A and B, that could be IV-I or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, the presence of B as frequent bass note could make B the tonal center. But that would be B minor. But again, C chord is a problem. Because in B minor, C is C# in the scale. So having C major chord (C natural) would conflict. Unless it's a chromatic chord.

Wait, if all the chords fit into a single scale, then that scale's tonic is likely the key. Let's find the scale that contains all the chord tones. Chord tones present:

Bm: B, D, F#

G: G, B, D

D: D, F#, A

C: C, E, G

Am6: A, C, E, F#

So all notes: B, D, F#, G, A, C, E. What scale contains all these notes?

List of notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#. That's six notes. Missing G# or G natural? These notes are A, B, C, D, E, F#. So that's the E natural minor scale (E, F#, G, A, B, C, D). Wait, but that includes G natural. Wait, in the list above, G is present in the G chord. Yes. So notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. All seven notes of E natural minor. So all notes in the progression are within the E natural minor scale. The same as G major.

So the key is E minor or G major. To decide between them, we can look at which note is emphasized as the tonic. But without melody, hard to say. However, in the chord progression, the most common chord is Bm. In G major, Bm is iii, which is the mediant chord. In E minor, Bm is v chord. If the song feels like it's in E minor with Bm as the main chord, which is the dominant, then it's E minor. But usually, dominant is the V chord. For example, in E minor, the dominant chord (V) is B major for a strong cadence, but if using B minor, then it's not. However, in natural minor, the v chord is minor, which is common in some genres.

Alternatively, looking at the bass line. The bass notes are mostly B and A. In E minor, E is the tonic. But if the bass is going A to B, that's IV to V in E minor. Because in E minor, A is the IV chord root, B is the V root. Wait, but in E minor, the V chord is usually B major. But here, the B chord is minor. So the bass might be going A (subdominant) to B (but minor). However, the progression has chords like Am6, which is Am with sixth (A minor), so A is the root. Then C/B: C chord with B bass. C is the VI chord. Maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the key based on the last chord. Ending on Bm. If it's E minor, the ending on Bm could be a half cadence (V), which is common. If it's G major, ending on iii would be unusual. Usually songs end on tonic. So ending on Bm (v in E minor) could be a half cadence, but not typical. However, in some songs, they might end on v. But usually it's tonic. However, the question is just about the key and mode. So perhaps E minor.

Wait another way: look at the chords that create a cadence. For example, in the D/A followed by C/B then Bm: D (V in G?), but in G major, D is V. C is IV. So V-IV. Then Bm is iii. Not a standard cadence. In E minor: D is VII, C is VI, then Bm v. VII-VI-v. Not a standard cadence.

Alternatively, when it goes from C/B to Bm: in E minor, C is VI, Bm v. VI to v. Or in G major: C is IV, Bm iii. IV to iii.

Not sure. Another approach: common progression in E minor with these chords is something like v-iv-III-...? Not sure.

Wait, here's another idea. The presence of Am6 (A minor sixth). In E minor, Am is iv chord. In G major, Am is ii chord. So if there's an Am chord, it could be either.

But perhaps we can look for a dominant function. In E minor, the dominant chord would be B major, but here it's B minor. Which means there's no dominant chord. However, in some modes, the dominant is minor. But minor keys usually use dominant major for cadences. So if there's no major V chord, then perhaps it's in natural minor.

But let's think about the chords again. Let's list all chords in their root position for simplicity:

Bm (B, D, F#), G (G, B, D), D (D, F#, A), C (C, E, G), Am (A, C, E), and Am6 adds F# (so A, C, E, F#).

Now, if we look at possible key center. Let's assume the tonic is the note where the other chords resolve. But without melody, hard.

Another method: find all the notes and see if they fit a single key. They do: all in E natural minor and G major. So the key is either E minor or G major. To distinguish, sometimes the presence of a chord like D is V in G major, but in E minor D is VII. But if the song has a cadence using VII-VI-... In E minor, VII is D major. So D major can act as a dominant to E minor? But in natural minor, D major is VII, which typically does not resolve strongly to E minor. However, if the melody uses E notes a lot, then E minor.

Alternatively, considering that G is in the chords a lot. The chord G is present multiple times. In G major, G is tonic. In E minor, G is III. Not sure.

Wait, the progression starts with Bm and then G. If it's G major, then G is tonic, so Bm is iii. Starting on iii chord is possible. If it's E minor, starting on v. But maybe the first chord is tonic. Let's see.

But typically the first chord is the tonic or a subdominant. However, many songs start on any chord.

Alternatively, think of the chord progression as a loop. Another approach: looking for relative major/minor. Since they share notes, but the mode would be minor or major.

Given that the question is to determine key and mode, and considering all chords fit E minor (natural minor mode), or G major (major mode). To distinguish, perhaps look at the most common chord. Bm is most repeated. In E minor, Bm is v. In G major, Bm is iii. But in many cases, the v chord being frequent could point to minor key where the v chord is prominent. However, in rock music, minor keys often have I and v as main chords.

Wait, another clue: the chord C/B. C major with B bass. This is equivalent to a B minor seventh flat five or something? Wait, C major with B bass is B-C-E-G. Which is a Bm7b5 or Bø7 chord. But the root is C, with bass B. So B-C-E-G. Which is B half-diminished. However, in the context of E minor, the vii°7 chord is F#dim. Not matching. In G major, the vii°7 is Bdim. So B-C-E-G would be Bø7 in G major, which is a half-diminished seventh chord. That is, it's the chord built on the seventh of G major. So it might be part of the G major key. But the chord is labeled C/B, which is a C major chord with B bass. Typically C/B would be played as C major chord but with B as lowest note. However, as a chord symbol, it's C major with B bass. So the structure is B, C, E, G. Which is Bm7b5.

If the song is using that chord as a vii half-diminished in G major, that might suggest G major is the key. Because in G major, vii°7 is Bø7. Which is B-D-F-A? Wait no: B half-diminished chord is B, D, F, A. But C/B with bass B would be B, C, E, G. That's not Bø7. Bø7 is B-D-F-A. So C/B chord is C major with bass B, which is B-C-E-G. That's Bm7b5? Bm7b5 would be B-D-F, so A would be the fifth if it's Bm7b5. Wait no, Bm7b5 is B, D, F, A. So root B, minor third D, diminished fifth F, minor seventh A. So if you have a C major chord with B bass, that's B, C, E, G. Which could be interpreted as a C major chord with B in bass, which is a second inversion of C major. But the chord would typically be called C/B.

In the context of G major, the chords are:

I: G

ii: Am

iii: Bm

IV: C

V: D

vi: Em

vii°: Bdim

But here we have C/B, which is part of the IV chord. So not problematic. So if the key is G major, C/B is just a C chord with B bass. No issue.

But if the key is E minor, then all chords fit, and the C/B is C major with B bass. In E minor, C is the VI chord. Also acceptable.

This seems tricky. Another angle: the Am6 chord. In E minor, the iv chord is Am. Adding the sixth (F#) gives Am6. In G major, the ii chord is Am. Adding F# makes it Am6. Both keys allow this.

Wait, perhaps the progression is in the key of E minor with the tonic Em missing. But the chord progression doesn't use Em, which is the tonic. That's odd. Whereas in G major, the tonic G is present. G chord appears multiple times. Let's count G chords: "G/B G/B" twice, then later "G/B G/B", so four times as G/B (so G chord), and no other G chords. So four times. Bm is 9 times. Em is never present. So if it's G major, tonic G is used four times, but Bm is more frequent. If it's E minor, tonic Em not present. So perhaps G major is more likely because the tonic is present.

But sometimes songs in minor keys don't use the tonic chord, but usually they do. But not always. For example, "Wish You Were Here" by Pink Floyd has a progression that doesn't use the tonic until later.

Wait, another thought. Let's look at the bass notes. Most bass notes are B. In a chord progression, the bass line can indicate key. If the bass is going B B B B... but then to A, B, etc. So the bass has B quite a bit. So maybe the key is B something. But B natural minor doesn't fit because of C chord. Unless it's B Dorian? But B Dorian requires G#, which we don't have. B Dorian scale: B C# D E F# G# A. So G# is not present in the chords. In the progression, the G is used (G major), which is G natural. So B Dorian has G#, so no. Not matching.

Another idea: maybe B minor with a borrowed chord for C? Like borrowed from parallel major. B major scale has B C# D# E F# G# A#. So borrowed chord from B major could be C# dim or something. Not sure. C major chord in B minor context... That might be very unusual. Because in B minor, the diatonic scale has C# and A, so a C natural chord would be a chromatic note. Possible but less likely.

Given all that, the most plausible is that it's in the key of G major, because all chords fit, and the tonic G is present multiple times (four times as G/B chord). Also, the progression has chords that are diatonic to G major. Alternatively, E minor. But G major could be considered the key since the tonic is present.

Wait, let's check the chord progression as a whole. Let's map each chord to G major:

- Bm = iii

- G/B = I (since G is the tonic)

- D/A = V (D chord, with A in bass, but still V chord)

- C/B = IV (C chord, B bass)

- Am6 = ii6 or ii with added sixth

So in G major, it's a progression of iii, I, V, IV chords, etc.

In E minor:

- Bm = v

- G = III

- D = VII

- C = VI

- Am6 = iv6

So as a minor key progression. Now, which key do you think? Sometimes the "dominant" chord in minor would be major V, but here there's no B major, so it's natural minor.

But a common progression in minor keys might be I V i, but here it's different.

Alternatively, let's think of common chord sequences.

For example, G major progression often includes I IV V, etc. Here, G major key has G, C, D. So when you have D chord followed by C chord, that could be V-IV. But often V-I.

Alternatively, maybe it's a progression in B minor but using parallel major. Not sure.

Another clue: the Am6 chord. Let's see the notes. Am6: A, C, E, F#. In E minor, this is the iv6 chord. In G major, it's the ii6 chord. If there were an A minor chord without the sixth, it would be more common. But the sixth is added.

Wait, but Am6 could also be called Fmaj7/A, which is F major with A bass. But that seems less likely.

Alternatively, thinking of all the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#. So the scale is A minor? Wait, A natural minor has A, B, C, D, E, F, G. But here we have F# instead of F. So A natural minor has F natural. So not A minor.

Wait, scale with F# and no G: but the presence of G. So we have G natural in there. So scale is A B C D E F# G. That's exactly the G major scale. Because G major is G A B C D E F#. Wait yes! G major scale: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

Yes! So all the notes in the chords match the G major scale. So the notes present are A, B, C, D, E, F#, G—all of them. So the key signature is one sharp (F#), which is G major.

So that would mean the key is G major, and mode is major. But the progression is starting on Bm (iii chord), ending on Bm. But it's still in G major. So key is G major, mode is major.

Wait, but why would the key be G major when the tonic chord isn't the most frequent? But yes, the tonic is still G. Just because it's not used as much as Bm in this progression doesn't mean it's not the key. For instance, "Wonderwall" has a progression in G major that uses Em, C, D, G, but Em is most common in the first part. It's still in G major.

So in summary, all chords are diatonic to G major. Therefore, the key is G major.

But earlier when looking at E minor scale, the notes are the same, but E minor is the relative minor. So if we consider the key as G major, then the mode is Ionian. If as E minor, Dorian? No, E minor is Aeolian mode. But usually, the term "key" would refer to the major for major key, minor for minor.

However, how do we decide between relative major and minor? Typically, the key is called by the major scale if it's a major key, or the minor scale if it's minor.

If the tonal center is G, then it's G major. If E, then E minor.

Since the G chord appears frequently (four times), and it's the tonic for G major, whereas E minor would require the Em chord, which isn't present at all.

That's a strong point: in E minor, the tonic Em is present in the chord list? No, there's no Em chord in the progression. The chords are Bm, G, D, C, Am. No E minor. So the tonic would be absent. Whereas in G major, the tonic G is present multiple times. So it's more likely that the key is G major.

Another point: when you have a progression with mostly chords from the major scale and the tonic appears multiple times, even if not the most frequent chord, it's usually considered the key.

For example, "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" is in G major but uses D, C, Am more often, but it's still G major.

Therefore, despite Bm being the most frequent chord, the presence of G major chord (I) would indicate key is G major.

So key: G major.

Mode: Ionian (but usually just referred to as major key).

Wait, but the question says "key and mode". So key would be G major, mode is Ionian.

But let me double-check: in G major, the chords:

G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), F#dim (vii°).

In this progression, the chords used are Bm, G, D, C, Am (Am6 is Am with sixth). So all are within G major. F#dim chord isn't present here, but that's fine. So key G major, mode Ionian.

Alternatively, since it's a major key, the mode is major. But technically, the mode is Ionian.

Yes. So likely the key is G major, mode Ionian.

But why does the progression have Am6? Am6 is just an Am chord with added sixth (F#), so it's still part of G major. So yes.

Alternatively, if it were E minor, the key would have Em as the tonic, but it's not present. So presence of G chord as the I chord supports G major.

So conclusion: Key is G major, mode Ionian.

But let's check if there's another possibility. Some might say the key is E minor because the tonal center feels like E. Without melody, it's hard to say. But based on chord presence: G is present, E is not. If the music resolves to G, then G major. If to E, then E minor. But since E is not present as a chord, G major seems more likely.

Wait, another check: D/A chord. In G major, D is V. So D/A is fifth chord with sixth in bass. Common. In E minor, D is VII chord. So a bit less common. But still possible.

But in rock/pop, often the G major progression using V chord (D major) going to C or G. Here, D/A is followed by C/B. In G major, D to C would be V to IV. Common move. Whereas in E minor, D to C would be VII to VI. Also common.

But I think the strongest indicator is that the tonic chord (G) is present, whereas in E minor, the tonic (Em) is completely absent. So G major is more accurate.

Therefore, I think the key is G major, mode is Ionian.


### Analysis of the Chord Progression  
The given progression is:  
**Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | D/A | C/B | Bm | Bm | G/B | G/B | Bm | Bm | Am6 | Bm**

---

### Step 1: Identify All Diatonic Chords  
Let’s simplify the chords by ignoring the bass notes (as they are primarily for voice leading or texture) and focus on the **root chords**:

- **Bm** = B minor (B–D–F#)  
- **G/B** = G major (G–B–D)  
- **D/A** = D major (D–F#–A)  
- **C/B** = C major (C–E–G)  
- **Am6** = A minor 6 (A–C–E–F#)  

Now, collect all notes present across all chords:  
**A, B, C, D, E, F#, G**  

This matches the **G major scale**:  
**G – A – B – C – D – E – F#**  

All chords and notes are **diatonic to G major**. No chromatic or foreign notes are present.

---

### Step 2: Determine the Tonal Center  
- **G major (Ionian mode)** has **G as the tonic**.  
- **E minor (Aeolian mode)** shares the same key signature (one sharp: F#), but the **tonic Em (E–G–B)** is **not present in the progression at all**.  

While E minor is the **relative minor** of G major, the **absence of the tonic Em chord** is a strong indicator that **E minor is not the tonal center**. In contrast, **G major is represented by its tonic chord (G)**, which appears **multiple times** (as G/B, which still implies a G major triad). This aligns with typical harmonic behavior: a piece in a major key will almost always include the tonic chord (even if not the most frequent).

---

### Step 3: Key Signature and Mode Confirmation  
- **Key Signature**: 1 sharp (F#).  
- **Tonal Center**: G (the note G appears as the root of the G major chord and is present in all G-based chords like G/B).  
- **Mode**: **Ionian mode** (standard major scale mode).  

Even though Bm is the most frequently used chord, it is the **iii** chord in G major. This is common in songs where the iii chord is emphasized for texture or emotional effect, but the **tonal center remains G**. For example, "Wonderwall" by Oasis uses Am and Em prominently but is still in **G major**.

---

### Step 4: Final Verification  
| Chord | Function in G Major | Function in E Minor |  
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|  
| **Bm** | iii | v |  
| **G**   | I | III |  
| **D**   | V | VII |  
| **C**   | IV | VI |  
| **Am6** | ii6 | iv6 |  

- **G major** is the only key where **all chords are diatonic and the tonic (G) is present**.  
- **E minor** fails because its **tonic (Em)** is missing entirely.  

---

### ✅ Final Answer  
**Key: G major**  
**Mode: Ionian (Major)**  

> 💡 **Why?** All chords fit the G major scale. The tonic (G) is present in the progression, while E minor's tonic (Em) is absent. Even though Bm is frequent, the tonal center firmly resolves around **G**.
