Let's analyze the progression:

**Chord progression:**

```
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  
Bm  Bm  D/A  C/B  
Bm  Bm  G/B  G/B  
Bm  Bm  Am6  Bm
```

### Step 1: Identify key candidates
The chord **Bm (B–D–F#)** appears repeatedly and clearly functions as a tonal center. So, B minor is our first likely candidate.

Other chords:

- **G/B (G–B–D)** → G major chord in first inversion  
- **D/A (D–F#–A)** → D major chord, V in G major, III in B minor  
- **C/B (C–E–G with B in bass)** → an interesting borrowed or chromatic chord  
- **Am6 (A–C–E–F#)** → contains F#, implying a borrowed color chord (A Dorian flavor)

These chords all fit reasonably well within a **B minor tonality**, with **C/B** adding a bit of chromatic color (flat II relative to B, similar to a Neapolitan-type inflection if heard as a B pedal).

### Step 2: Check scale consistency

B natural minor: B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A  
Compare chords:

| Chord | Notes | Fit in B minor? |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Bm | B D F# | ✓ |
| G/B | G B D | ✓ |
| D/A | D F# A | ✓ |
| C/B | C E G B | ✗ (C natural → minor flat II color) |
| Am6 | A C E F# | partially (C natural not diatonic, F# fits) |

So, overall it’s **B minor** with **borrowed chromatic chords** (C/B and Am6).

### Step 3: Mode characterization

Because of the recurring **C natural** (instead of C#), the mode leans toward **B Aeolian (natural minor)** rather than B Dorian or harmonic minor.  
The **Am6** chord reinforces the Aeolian (natural) mode too.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**
- **Key:** B minor  
- **Mode:** B **Aeolian** (natural minor)  
- **Comments:** Occasional chromatic color (C natural, Am6) enriches the harmonic palette, but the tonal center and general modal flavor remain in B minor (Aeolian).
