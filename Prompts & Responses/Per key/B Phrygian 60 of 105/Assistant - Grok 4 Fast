**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

**Key: B**  
**Mode: Phrygian**

This progression strongly centers on B as the tonic, with a pedal bass on B emphasizing it. The presence of the C major chord (characteristic ♭II) and the overall note collection (A B C D E F♯ G) align with the B Phrygian mode (1 ♭2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7). All chords are diatonic to this mode:

- Bm: i (B D F♯)
- G/B: ♭VII⁶ (G B D, inverted)
- D/A: ♭III⁶ (D F♯ A, inverted; functions as a modal III)
- C/B: ♭II⁶ (C E G, inverted)
- Am6: ♭vii₆ (A C E F♯; ♭vii with added 6th)

The repetitive i–♭VII structure and Phrygian ♭II insertion create a tense, exotic flavor typical of the mode, without accidentals suggesting a shift to parallel major/minor or other modes.
