### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking closely at the chord progression to determine the key and mode. It features several Am chords alongside F#dim/A, C/G, Bm/A, and G6, so I’m thinking the tonality is likely A minor. 

Breaking it down: the Am chord is the tonic (i) in A minor. The F#dim/A triad includes the notes F# A and C, and I'm questioning how these fit in with A minor. F# isn't part of the natural or harmonic scale. It seems to suggest a Dorian or melodic minor approach, especially since F# appears in melodic minor.**Exploring F#dim triad**

I’m examining the F#dim triad (F# A C) and its relation to the A melodic minor scale. It looks like this triad could work as the vii° of G, but I’m not entirely sure about its derivation. 

In A melodic minor, the diatonic triads are based on the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#. I’m thinking ii is a minor triad, specifically B minor, which has the notes B, D, and F#. While the harmonic implications are complex, it seems that in classical melodic minor, the ii can yield a minor seventh.**Clarifying chord functions**

I want to keep things straightforward. So, let’s break down the triads in A melodic minor: 

The iii is C augmented, iv is D major, v is E major, vi is the correct F# diminished, and vii is G# diminished. This confirms that F#dim is diatonic in A melodic minor and functions as F#dim/A in second inversion.

It seems like F#dim tends to lead to A minor, but I’m questioning its resolution. Typically, E7 (which includes G#) is more common for harmonic minor pieces rather than F#. Still, there’s a complex interplay in its use.**Investigating chord relationships**

I’m realizing that F#dim acts as a leading-tone diminished triad to G, which fits as the vii° of G. In A minor, if there's a G chord, then yes, the G6 appears later. This makes F#dim a secondary leading-tone chord preparing for G, where G is the VII in A natural minor. 

I see that the cadence flows from Am to F#dim/A before G, which could imply it serves as a neighbor leading-tone to the subtonic. Looking at the other chords, C/G indicates C major over a G bass, presenting a bIII chord in A minor. Bm/A is showing B D F# over an A bass.**Defining key and mode**

The B minor chord is diatonic to A melodic minor, not A natural minor, given its F#. With A in the bass, Bm/A could function as a 9sus. This chord includes the notes A, B, D, and F#, which hints at modal mixture. 

Now, the G6 chord indicates that G is the bVII in A minor, suggesting the mix of natural and melodic minor. Overall, these elements lead me to conclude that the key is A and the mode is Dorian. The presence of F# but lack of G# solidifies this.**Summarizing key and mode**

I want to create a clear answer outlining the key and mode. 

The tonal center is A, and the mode is Dorian, which includes the scale A, B, C, D, E, F#, and G. The chord mapping corresponds as follows: Am (i), F#dim (vi°), C/G (bIII in second inversion), Bm/A (ii over i pedal), and G6 (VIIadd6 or Em7/G), resolving to Am. It’s important to note the absence of E major/E7 and G#, alongside the presence of F#. Overall, that gives a complete picture!

A Dorian (tonal center A)

Why:
- Chords are all diatonic to A Dorian (A B C D E F# G): Am (i), F#dim/A (vi° in 2nd inversion), C/G (bIII in 2nd inversion), Bm/A (ii over i pedal), G6 (VII add6 or Em7/G), resolving to Am.
- Presence of F# (raised 6) and G natural, with no G# or E/E7, points to Dorian rather than harmonic/melodic or natural minor.

So the key center is A, and the mode is Dorian.
