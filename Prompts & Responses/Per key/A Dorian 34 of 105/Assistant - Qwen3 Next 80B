To determine the **key** and **mode** of the chord progression:

```
Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am
```

### Step 1: List the chords and their roots (with bass notes if specified)

Let’s write out each chord in root position for analysis, noting the bass note when specified:

1. **Am** – A minor (A-C-E)
2. **Am**
3. **F#dim/A** – F# diminished triad (F#-A-C) with **A in bass** → this is **A diminished 6th** (A C F#), functionally a **first-inversion F#dim**
4. **F#dim/A** – same as above
5. **Am**
6. **Am**
7. **C/G** – C major (C-E-G) with **G in bass** → G-C-E → sounds like G6 or C/G (C major first inversion)
8. **Bm/A** – B minor (B-D-F#) with **A in bass** → A-B-D-F# → this is **A major 7th flat 5?** Wait, no — let’s think functionally.
    - A-B-D-F# → this is actually an **A7#5** or **A7+**?  
    But note: Bm/A is **B minor over A**, so the notes are A, B, D, F# — this is the same as **A major 7th chord without the 5th?** — wait, **A major 7th is A-C#-E-G#** — that’s not it.

Wait — let’s do this properly.

### Think in terms of **scale tones** and **functional harmony**

Let’s assume the key is **A minor** (natural minor, Aeolian) as a starting point.

Chords in **A natural minor (Aeolian)**:
- i: Am
- ii°: Bdim
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

But we have:
- **F#dim** — that’s NOT in A natural minor.
- **C/G** — possible (C major, which is III in A minor)
- **Bm/A** — B minor over A — this is unusual.
- **G6** — G major 6th (G-B-D-E) — G is VII in A minor, but G6 adds E, which is the 6th — E is in A minor (A natural minor has F#? Wait! A natural minor is: A, B, C, D, E, F, G → **no F#**)

Wait — here’s the critical clue:

### We have **F#dim** — that implies **F# is a note**, which is **NOT** in A natural minor (which has F natural).

So if **F# is present**, then we are likely in **A harmonic minor** or **A melodic minor**.

Let’s explore **A harmonic minor**:

**A harmonic minor scale**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#  
→ Chords built on each scale degree:

1. Am (i)
2. Bdim (ii°)
3. C+ (III+) — C-E-G# — augmented!
4. Dm (iv)
5. E (V) — major! (E-G#-B) ← this is crucial
6. F#dim (vi°) — **F#-A-C** ← HERE IT IS!
7. G#dim (vii°) — G#-B-D — but we have **G** (not G#) in the last chord

Wait — we have **G6**, not G#dim.

G6 = G-B-D-E — that’s a **G major 6** chord, which contains **B and E** — both in A harmonic minor?  
A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G# → so **G natural is NOT in the scale!**  
We have **G#**, not G.

So G6 (containing G natural) is **not diatonic** to A harmonic minor.

But we also have **Bm/A** — let’s check that.

### Bm/A = A-B-D-F# — notes: A, B, D, F#

Let’s see if these notes fit a known scale.

A, B, C, D, E, F#, G# → **A melodic minor ascending**!

**A melodic minor ascending**: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#  
Descending: A, G, F, E, D, C, B — but we’re not descending.

So in **ascending melodic minor**, we have:
- F# (6th)
- G# (7th)

But our chord has:
- **F#dim/A** → F#, A, C — F# is in melodic minor
- **G6** → G, B, D, E — G natural is NOT in ascending melodic minor — we have G#!

So again, we have **G natural** — which is only in **A natural minor**, but then we have **F#** — which is not in natural minor.

### So we have both:
- **F#** → suggests harmonic or melodic minor
- **G natural** → suggests natural minor

This is **mixing modes** — classical harmony often does this: **use harmonic minor for the dominant (v) but keep natural minor elsewhere**.

But here, we have **G6**, not G#dim.

Let’s look at the **G6 chord**.  
G6 = G-B-D-E → this is the same as **E minor 7th without the root**?  
E minor 7th: E-G-B-D — so G6 = G-B-D-E = same notes as **Em7**!  
Yes — **G6 = Em7 (inversion)**

So **G6** might be **functioning as Em7**, which is the **vii chord in A major**, or **iio in G major**, but let’s think again.

### Let's look for the **tonic** and **cadence**

The progression ends on **Am**.  
So **Am** is the tonal center.

We have a lot of **Am**, then **F#dim/A**, then **C/G**, **Bm/A**, then **G6**, then resolution to **Am**.

Let’s analyze the last 4 chords:

**C/G → Bm/A → G6 → Am**

- C/G = G major triad with C in bass → G-C-E → **C major over G** — this is **C major, first inversion**, or **G6?** No, G6 is G-B-D-E.

Wait — our chord is written as **C/G**, meaning **C major chord with G in bass** → so inversion: **C major 1st inversion**.

Then **Bm/A**: B minor triad with A in bass → A-B-D-F#

Then **G6**: G-B-D-E

Then **Am**

### Let’s consider this as a **vii° - I - IV - V - i** kind of thing… but we don’t have a strong V chord.

Wait — **F#dim** is **vi°** in A minor — it’s a common chord in harmonic minor.

And in harmonic minor, vi° is **F#dim**, and **V is E major** — but we don’t have E major. We have **G6**.

G6 could be **borrowed from A major**? A major has #4, #5, #7 — G# is #7.

G natural is **not** in A major.

Wait — here’s a better fit:

### What if the key is **C major**?

C major: C, D, E, F, G, A, B  
Chords:
- i: Am? No — Am is vi
- ii: Bm
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

We have:
- Am (vi)
- F#dim — not in C major! (F# isn’t in C major)
- C/G — C major with G bass? Yes, C major is I
- Bm/A — B minor over A — Bm is ii, A = - not a chord tone? A is the 6th of C — so Bm/A is like a D/F# — not standard
- G6 — G major 6 — G is VII in C major

But we have **F#dim** — again, not in C major.

F# is a chromatic note.

### The problem: **F#dim** is **the only non-diatonic chord** that’s repeated, so it’s the key indicator.

F#dim = F#-A-C

In **A minor**, what does this chord function as?

Answer: In **A harmonic minor**, **F#dim** is the **vi° chord** — it’s diatonic!

So **F#dim is vi° in A harmonic minor**.

Now what about **G6**?

G6 = G-B-D-E

In **A harmonic minor**, the scale is: A-B-C-D-E-F-G#

So G is **not** in the scale — we have **G#**, not G.

So **G6** is a **borrowed chord** — most likely from **A natural minor**.

So we have **both A natural minor** and **A harmonic minor** modes used.

This is very common in pop/rock/classical music: use the **leading tone G# in the dominant**, but use **G natural** for modal color.

BUT — we don’t have a **G# chord** at all! We have **G6** — a **G major 6** chord.

So perhaps **G natural** is being used as the **bVII chord** — borrowed from **A Dorian** or **A Phrygian**?

Wait — let’s consider **A Dorian**:

A Dorian: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G# — again G#.

Same problem.

A **A natural minor** (Aeolian) has G natural — and we get G natural in G6.

But natural minor has F natural — we have **F#** in F#dim.

So we have **F#** from harmonic minor, and **G natural** from natural minor.

This is **modal mixture** or **borrowing**.

It’s not strictly in one mode — it's in **A minor**, with **borrowed chords from harmonic and natural minors**.

But the **tonic is clearly A**, and **Am** is the home chord.

And the most important chromatic note is **F#** — which is the **raised 6th** — hallmark of **harmonic minor**.

So the **key** is **A minor**, and the **mode is primarily harmonic minor**, but with **borrowed G natural** from natural minor.

The G6 chord is likely a **modal mixture** chord — borrowed from **A natural minor**, where G is the natural 7th.

In harmonic minor, the 7th is G#, but you often downgrade it to G natural for intermediate chords to avoid the tritone or for color.

So overall:

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key**: **A minor**  
**Mode**: **Primarily A harmonic minor**, but with **borrowed elements from A natural minor** (especially the G natural in G6 chord).

The presence of **F#dim (vi°)** validates the harmonic minor scale, while **G6 (bVII)** is a common modal interchange from natural minor.

These kinds of progressions are **very common in pop, rock, and film music** — a blend of harmonic and natural minor modes.

> So, **key = A minor**, **mode = harmonic minor with natural minor borrowing**.

In common terminology — we’d just say **A minor** and not overthink the mode, but since the question asks for **mode**, the best labeled answer is:

> **Key: A minor  
> Mode: Harmonic minor (with modal mixture of natural minor)**
