### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by listing out all the chords to see what I'm working with.

First, Am – that's A minor. Then F#dim/A, which is an A diminished chord with A in the bass. Wait, F#dim/A. Diminished chords are usually built on the seventh scale degree, but here it's written with A as the bass note. Let me recall: F#dim is F#-A-C, and when it's F#dim/A, that means A is the lowest note. So the chord would be A, C, F#? But typically, diminished chords are written with the root being the diminished note. So F#dim is F#-A-C, so F#dim/A would still have the notes F#, A, C but with A as the bass note. So the actual notes are A, C, F#.

Next is C/G. C major chord with G in the bass. So G, C, E. Then Bm/A – B minor chord with A bass. B, D, F# with A as the lowest note. Then G6 – G major with a 6th added, so G, B, D, E. And then back to Am.

Let me list all the chords in terms of their notes:

- Am: A, C, E
- F#dim/A: A, C, F# (since F#dim is F#-A-C, bass A makes it A, C, F#)
- C/G: G, C, E
- Bm/A: A, B, D, F#? Wait, Bm is B, D, F#. So Bm/A with A bass – notes are A, B, D, F#? That's a bit odd because typically a chord won't have five notes. Maybe Bm/A means the bass is A, so the notes are A, B, D, F#. But that might be a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, sometimes chords like that are just Bm but with A in the bass, so the actual notes for Bm/A would be A (bass), B, D, F#. So four notes.

G6: G, B, D, E.

So let's list all chords with their notes:

1. Am: A, C, E
2. Am: A, C, E
3. F#dim/A: A, C, F#
4. F#dim/A: A, C, F#
5. Am: A, C, E
6. Am: A, C, E
7. C/G: G, C, E
8. Bm/A: A, B, D, F#
9. Am: A, C, E
10. Am: A, C, E
11. F#dim/A: A, C, F#
12. F#dim/A: A, C, F#
13. Am: A, C, E
14. Am: A, C, E
15. G6: G, B, D, E
16. Am: A, C, E

Now, looking at all the notes involved:

A, C, E from Am – that's the A minor triad.

F#dim/A has A, C, F# – so F# is a note here.

C/G: G, C, E – so G is present.

Bm/A: A, B, D, F# – so B, D, F# and A bass.

G6: G, B, D, E.

So the notes used are A, B, C, D, E, F#, G.

Let me see if that fits into a key. The note F# is present, which is sharp. So if we look at A minor natural: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#? No. Wait, natural minor has F natural, but here we have F#, so maybe harmonic minor? Let's check.

A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G# – but wait, harmonic minor has raised 7th, so G#? Wait, no. For A minor, natural minor is A B C D E F G. Harmonic minor is A B C D E F G# – yes. But in our chords, we have F# and G? Wait, looking at the chords: we have F# (from F#dim and Bm), and G is present in C/G and G6. But F# is present, but in A minor harmonic, the 6th is F#? Wait, no. Let's list the notes in A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G# – wait, no. Wait, harmonic minor raises the 7th, so for A minor, the 7th is G, so raised to G#. So A, B, C, D, E, F, G# – so the notes would be A, B, C, D, E, F, G#.

But in our progression, we have F#? Wait, F# is a note here. Let's check: the F#dim chord has F#, and Bm/A has F# as the fifth of B minor. So F# is in there. Also, G is present.

But A harmonic minor has G# not G. So if we have G natural, that doesn't fit harmonic minor. Maybe natural minor? But natural minor has F natural. But here we have F# in the chords – for example, F#dim is F#-A-C. So the F# is there. So F# is present, so natural minor (A minor natural has F natural), so maybe not. Let's check the key of A minor with some alterations.

Wait, let's list all the notes used: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G.

So those notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Now, what key has all these notes? Let's think in terms of major keys.

If it's a major key, the notes would be a major scale. Let's see: if the key is G major, that's G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. Yes! That's exactly the notes: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

G major: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

Yes. The notes are G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

So all the chords have notes from G major. But the progression starts with Am, which is the ii chord in G major.

Let's check the chords in G major:

I: G

ii: Am

iii: Bm

IV: C

V: D

vi: Em

vii°: F#dim

Yes! So F#dim is the vii° chord in G major.

Looking at the progression:

Am (ii), then F#dim/A (which is F#dim with A bass – in G major, F#dim is vii°, and A is the third of the chord. So F#dim/A is the same as F#dim but with A in bass).

C/G would be IV with G in bass – so the I chord? No, wait. C is IV, and C/G is IV with G bass. But G is the root of I.

Wait, the chords in G major:

G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), F#dim (vii°).

Now, the progression: Am (ii), Am (ii), F#dim/A (vii° with A bass), F#dim/A, then Am, Am, then C/G (which is C chord but bass G – so IV with 5th in bass), Bm/A (Bm with A bass, which is iii with root A? Bm is iii, so Bm/A would be iii with A bass).

Wait, but in the context of G major, let's see the function.

G major key:

- Am: ii

- F#dim: vii°

- C: IV

- Bm: iii

- G6: G is I, but G6 would be I6? No, G6 is G, B, D, E. In G major, G major chord is G-B-D; adding the 6th E, so G6.

Now, the progression starts with Am, then Am, then F#dim/A, etc. So mostly Am, F#dim, C, Bm, G6.

So if the key is G major, the chords fit. Let's check the bass notes as well.

Another thing to consider: the mode. Since it's starting on Am, perhaps it's in A Aeolian (natural minor) but wait, A natural minor would have F natural, but here F# is present. So in A natural minor, the chord vii° would be F#dim? Wait, no. A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So the v chord is E minor, or Eo? Wait, the seventh scale degree in A natural minor is G natural. So the vii° chord would be G diminished: G, Bb, Db. But in our progression, we have F#dim, which is F#-A-C, which isn't part of A natural minor.

But in A harmonic minor, the notes are A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. So the vii° would be G#dim. Let's check: G#, B, D. But our chord is F#dim: F#, A, C. So that's not matching.

But in G major, F#dim is the vii° chord: in G major, scale notes G A B C D E F#; so seventh degree is F#, so F# diminished triad (F#, A, C), which is the F#dim. So that fits. Then the ii chord is Am (A, C, E), which is in G major.

So the key is G major. But the progression centers around Am, so it's perhaps in a mode? Let's see. If the song is using a G major scale but starting on A, that's A Aeolian? Wait, A Aeolian is A B C D E F G; but in G major, the notes are G A B C D E F#. A Aeolian would have F natural, but G major has F#. Wait, no. A Aeolian as the relative minor of C major would have A, B, C, D, E, F, G. But G major is G A B C D E F#. So A Aeolian (natural minor) would have no F#; it would have F natural. So if the key is G major, then the natural minor of G major would be E minor. So perhaps this progression is in G major, but starting Am. So maybe it's in Mixolydian or something else? Wait, no.

Wait, let's look at the scale. If the progression is using notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F# (which is exactly G major), then the key is G major. However, the tonic seems to be Am? But Am is not the tonic of G major; G is the tonic.

But sometimes songs are in a different mode. For example, if the progression emphasizes Am, maybe it's in A Dorian? Let's check A Dorian: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Yes! That's exactly the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. So the scale here is A Dorian. Because A Dorian is the second mode of G major. So the notes of G major scale, but starting on A.

So in A Dorian: A B C D E F# G. So the scale has F# and G natural, which matches.

Now, in A Dorian, the chords:

i: Am (A, C, E)

ii: Bm (B, D, F#)

iii: C (C, E, G)

IV: D (D, F#, A)

v: Em (E, G, B)

vi: F#dim (F#, A, C)

vii: G (G, B, D)

Yes. So in A Dorian, the chords:

Am (i), Bm (ii), C (III), D (IV), Em (v), F#dim (vi), G (VII).

So our progression:

Am (i), F#dim/A (vi with A bass), C/G (C chord with G bass – which would be the III in A Dorian), Bm/A (Bm with A bass – Bm is ii, so Bm/A is ii with A in bass), G6 (G major with added 6th. G is VII chord in A Dorian, and G6 would be G-B-D-E, which is VII with 6th).

So if the key is A Dorian, that would fit. Let's check the function.

The progression has Am as the main chord, and F#dim is vi (but in A Dorian, F#dim is vi, which is a diminished chord). But F#dim in A Dorian: F# is scale degree vi (since A Dorian: A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F# (6), G (7)). So F# is 6, so the chord on 6 is F#dim, yes.

In the progression, we also have C/G. C is chord III in A Dorian. C/G would have G as bass, so the bass is G, which is the 7th scale degree. And in terms of A Dorian, the chord C is built on 3rd degree, which is a major chord. So C/G is C with 5th in bass.

Similarly, Bm/A: Bm is ii chord in A Dorian, and with A bass, so it's ii chord with root bass? No: Bm is B-D-F#, so with A bass, it's A-B-D-F#, which is a Bm chord but with A in bass. In terms of A Dorian, the A bass would be the root of the key, so maybe it's emphasizing the root.

G6: G is VII chord, and adding E as 6th would be G6. In A Dorian, VII is a major chord (G major), so G6 is G-B-D-E. Yes.

Now, comparing to G major: the same set of notes. So the key could be G major, but the song is centered on A. So if the tonic is A, then it's in A Dorian mode, because Dorian mode has root A, with the characteristic minor third (C), raised sixth (F#), and natural seventh (G). Yes.

In A Dorian, the 6th note (F#) and 7th (G) are both natural. Whereas natural minor (Aeolian) would have F natural and G natural. But here F# is present, so Aeolian wouldn't fit.

Lydian would have F#, but raised fourth. But the fourth in A Dorian is D, which is natural. In A Lydian, it's A B C# D# E F# G#, so not matching.

So probably A Dorian mode.

Another thing: in G major, the dominant chord is D major (V), but in our progression, there's no D chord. Let's check the chords listed: Am, F#dim, C, Bm, G6 – no D chord. But that's okay, not all chords need to be present. However, in Dorian mode, the VII chord (G major) is major, which in natural minor would be minor.

For example, in A Aeolian (natural minor), the VII chord is G major? No: A Aeolian is A B C D E F G, so the VII chord is G major? Wait, G major chord would be G B D. In A Aeolian scale: degrees are A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F (6), G (7). So chord on VII is G major? Wait, yes. Wait, but in A natural minor, the VII chord is G major, which is a major chord. But the problem is that A Aeolian has F natural, but in our progression, there is F# present. For example Bm chord in A Aeolian would be B, D, F, but in our progression, it's Bm/A which has an F# in it? Wait, no. Bm chord in A Aeolian: B, D, F. But in our chord Bm/A, the notes are A, B, D, F#? Because Bm chord is B, D, F#, right? Because F# is the fifth. Wait! That's the key point. B minor chord is always B-D-F#, regardless of the key. So if the chord is Bm, it necessarily has F#. So that means the key must have F# in it. So A Aeolian only has F natural, so if Bm is present (B, D, F#), then F# is required. So A Aeolian won't work because F natural in A Aeolian. But Bm has F# fifth, so yes, so the scale must have F#.

Similarly, F#dim chord implies there's F# in the scale. So A Aeolian has only F natural, so it can't have F#dim or Bm. So that rules out A Aeolian.

A harmonic minor would have G# and F natural. A Harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#... So Bm chord would be B, D, F natural? But no: Bm is B, D, F#? Wait, no. If the scale has F natural, then the F in Bm chord would be F natural. But Bm chord in harmonic minor might be different. Wait, harmonic minor has F natural, so the triad built on B would be B, D, F (since 7th degree is G#?), no. Let's see: A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. So scale degrees:

1 A, 2 B, 3 C, 4 D, 5 E, 6 F, 7 G#.

So chord on ii: B, D, F – which is a diminished chord (Bdim), because third is D, fifth is F which is minor third from D. Wait, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, so yes, Bdim. But in our progression, we have Bm (B minor), which is B, D, F# – which is a minor chord. But if F is natural, then it would be Bdim. But here the chord is listed as Bm/A, which implies it's a B minor chord, so B, D, F#. So F# must be present. Therefore, harmonic minor won't fit because it has F natural.

Therefore, the only possibility is A Dorian, because A Dorian has F# (scale degree 6), so B minor chord is B, D, F# (since in A Dorian, 6th is F#), which works.

Yes. A Dorian scale: A B C D E F# G. So B is scale degree 2, D is 4, F# is 6. So the triad on B is B, D, F# – Bm. Yes, minor triad. F#dim chord (F#, A, C) is the chord on scale degree 6: F#-A-C (diminished, since F# to A is minor third, A to C is minor third).

G major chord is G, B, D – which in A Dorian is the VII chord, major.

C major chord is C, E, G – which in A Dorian, scale degree III is C.

C/G is C chord with G bass – G is the 7th scale degree.

So all fit. And the song starts with Am (i chord), so the tonic is A. In Dorian mode, the tonic is minor because the 3rd is minor (C natural).

So key would be A minor, but with raised 6th, so Dorian mode. So the key is A Dorian.

Alternatively, some people might consider the key to be G major, and the song is in G major but with a lot of A minor (ii chord), but since the progression centers around Am and the tonic feels like Am (as the first and last chords are Am), it's probably A Dorian.

Let's see the typical cadences. In Dorian mode, common cadences would be i - VII (Am to G major), which is part of the progression. In the progression here, we have G6, which is similar to G major.

Another thing: the F#dim chord – in Dorian mode, the diminished chord is on the vi scale degree. F#dim as the vi chord.

In G major, F#dim is vii°, so in G major the V chord is D major. But in our progression, there is no D major chord. Instead, we have G chord, which would be V in C major, but not relevant here.

But in A Dorian, the chord progression has Am (i), C (III), F#dim (vi), Bm (ii), G major (VII). The G major chord is a characteristic Dorian chord, since in natural minor, VII chord would be G major as well? Wait, no. In A natural minor (Aeolian), VII chord is G major? Wait: natural minor A, B, c, D, E, F, G. So the chord on G is G-B-D, which is G major. Wait, so in both A Aeolian and A Dorian, the VII chord is G major. But the difference between Aeolian and Dorian is the sixth degree: Aeolian has F natural, Dorian has F#.

Ah, yes. So the key indicator is the sixth scale degree. Since Bm chord uses F# (as the fifth), and the F#dim chord is F#, A, C. So the F# is present. In A Aeolian, the sixth is F natural, so Bm chord would be B, D, F natural, which would be a diminished chord (Bdim), but the progression lists Bm, which is minor (so B, D, F#), so must be F#. Therefore, it's not Aeolian; Aeolian would have Bdim, but we have Bm.

So A Dorian has the raised sixth (F#), which allows for Bm chord.

Therefore, the key is A minor with the six scale degree raised, which is Dorian mode.

So key: A Dorian.

Alternatively, sometimes people just say the key is "A minor, Dorian mode" or just "Dorian mode on A".

Another check: C/G. C chord is the III chord in A Dorian. But in terms of function, C is a major chord built on the third scale degree. In A Dorian, yes.

G6: in A Dorian, the VII chord is G major, so G6 is just a dominant chord without the dominant function? In minor modes, the VII chord is major. So in Dorian, it's a common progression to go from Am to G major.

For example, "Scarborough Fair" has a Dorian sound.

So yes, the key is A Dorian.

So to answer: the key is A minor, but the mode is Dorian. So the key signature would be the same as G major, but the tonic is A and it has a raised sixth (F# instead of F natural).

So the final answer is key A Dorian.

Wait, but key signatures: G major has one sharp, F#. So A Dorian has exactly the same key signature (one sharp), but the tonal center is A, not G.

So the key is A Dorian, which uses the key signature of G major (F#).

Yes.

So to put it in words: the key is A Dorian (minor scale with natural sixth and seventh). Wait, no: in Dorian mode, the sixth is raised compared to Aeolian. Aeolian has flat sixth compared to Dorian. So A Dorian: 1A 2B 3c 4D 5E 6F# 7G.

Yes.

So conclusion: key is A Dorian.

Another way to check: the chord progression ends on Am. The last chord is Am. The progression starts and ends with Am.

Also, the G6 chord – while G major in G major is I, but in A Dorian, it's VII. So if the music feels like it's resolving to A, then A Dorian.

Yes.

So I think that's it.

The chord progression **Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am** is in **A Dorian mode**.

### Analysis:
1. **Chords and Notes**:  
   - All chords use notes from the **G major scale** (G, A, B, C, D, E, F♯):  
     - Am (A, C, E)  
     - F#dim/A (A, C, F♯)  
     - C/G (G, C, E)  
     - Bm/A (A, B, D, F♯)  
     - G6 (G, B, D, E)  
   - The consistent presence of **F♯** (not Fnatural) and the structure of chords like **Bm** (B, D, F♯) and **F#dim** (F♯, A, C) rules out natural minor (Aeolian), which would have Fnatural instead of F♯.

2. **Modal Characteristics**:  
   - **A Dorian** mode = A, B, C, D, E, F♯, G.  
     - **Raised 6th** (F♯) compared to natural minor (Aeolian) – this is the defining feature of Dorian.  
     - Minor tonic chord (**Am** = A–C–E) with a **major 2nd (B)** and **major 6th (F♯)**.  
   - The progression centers on **Am** (the i chord in Dorian), not G major (the root of the parent major scale). The final chord is **Am**, emphasizing it as the tonal center.  

3. **Chord Functions in A Dorian**:  
   - **Am** (i) = tonic  
   - **F#dim/A** (vi°) = diminished chord on scale degree 6  
   - **C/G** (III with G bass) = major chord built on scale degree 3  
   - **Bm/A** (ii) = minor chord built on scale degree 2  
   - **G6** (VII) = major chord built on scale degree 7 (a hallmark of Dorian)  

4. **Why Not G Major?**  
   - While the key signature (one sharp: F♯) matches G major, the progression **centers on Am**, not G.  
   - In G major, Am would be the ii chord, but here it functions as the **tonic** (first/last chords are Am), which is more characteristic of **Dorian mode** (where the ii chord becomes the tonic in a Dorian context).  
   - G major would typically feature stronger pull to G (e.g., V–I cadence like D–G), but this progression uses **G (VII)** as a resolution chord to Am (i), not G (I) as the tonic.  

### Conclusion:
- **Key**: A minor (tonal center is A)  
- **Mode**: **Dorian** (due to the F♯ in the scale and minor tonic chord with a raised 6th).  
- **Key Signature**: G major (one sharp: F♯).  

This is a classic Dorian sound (e.g., "Scarborough Fair," "Oye Como Va"), where the natural 6th (F♯) creates a brighter minor flavor compared to natural minor (Aeolian). The progression revolves around Am as the home chord, with G6 (VII) and F#dim (vi°) providing characteristic Dorian colors.
