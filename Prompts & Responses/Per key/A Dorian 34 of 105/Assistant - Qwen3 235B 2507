Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Progression:**
```
Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  C/G  Bm/A  
Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  G6  Am
```

We’ll break this down step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### Step 1: List the Chords (with inversions)

We can simplify by writing the **root of each chord**, noting inversions:

- Am = A–C–E  
- F#dim/A = F#–A–C (diminished triad, with A in the bass) → chord quality: F#dim (F#–A–C)
- C/G = C–E–G (C major with G in bass)
- Bm/A = B–D–F# (B minor with A in bass)
- G6 = G–B–D–E (G major sixth)

So the roots are:
```
Am → Am → F#dim → F#dim → Am → Am → C → Bm  
Am → Am → F#dim → F#dim → Am → Am → G6 → Am
```

Even though some chords are inverted (bass note not root), we focus on **harmonic function** through roots and voice leading.

So the harmonic roots:
```
Am – Am – F#dim – F#dim – Am – Am – C – Bm  
Am – Am – F#dim – F#dim – Am – Am – G6 – Am
```

Final chords: G6 → Am

### Step 2: Determine Possible Key

Let’s look at the chords and see which key they fit into.

Chords used:
- Am (i)
- F#dim (commonly vii° in G major or G minor — since F#dim = F#–A–C)
- C (III in A minor, or V in F major, but here it fits A minor)
- Bm (ii in A minor)
- G6 (G–B–D–E) → G major with added 6th (E). G major is VII in A minor.

All of these chords are **diatonic to A natural minor**:

A natural minor scale: A B C D E F G

Chords in A natural minor:
- i: Am
- ii°: Bdim
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

Wait — we have **Bm**, not Bdim. That’s interesting.

Bm is **B–D–F#**, which includes **F#**, but **F# is not in A natural minor** (which has F natural).

So **Bm suggests F#**, which implies either:
- A **harmonic minor** scale (which raises the 7th: G → G#)
- But harmonic A minor has **E major** (V) and **E°**, not Bm

Hold on.

Bm = B–D–F# → F# is the key clue.

F# is not in A natural minor or A harmonic minor (which has G#, not F#).

Wait — F# is the 7th scale degree in G major.

Let’s consider: **F#dim chord** = F#–A–C

- F#dim is the **vii° chord in G major**.
- Am is the **ii chord in G major**
- C is the **IV chord in G major**
- Bm is the **iii chord in G major**
- G6 is **I6 in G major**

Wait — G6 is G–B–D–E → fits G major (I chord with 6th)

Now check G major scale: G A B C D E F#

Chords in G major:
- I: G
- ii: Am
- iii: Bm
- IV: C
- V: D
- vi: Em
- vii°: F#dim

Perfect!

Now map the chords:

- Am → ii
- F#dim → vii°
- C → IV
- Bm → iii
- G6 → I (with added 6th)

So the progression:
```
Am   Am   F#dim/A   F#dim/A   Am   Am   C/G   Bm/A  
ii   ii   vii°/A     vii°/A     ii   ii   IV/G   iii/A

Am   Am   F#dim/A   F#dim/A   Am   Am   G6    Am
ii   ii   vii°/A     vii°/A     ii   ii   I6    ii
```

The final chord is **Am**, but the penultimate chord is **G6**, which is **I in G major**.

So the progression ends on **Am (ii)**, but moves from **I (G6)** to **ii (Am)** — not a perfect cadence.

However, the **F#dim** leading to Am? That’s unusual because F#dim usually leads to G (tonic), not Am.

But here F#dim/A goes to Am — so F#dim is functioning as a **passing chord** or **deceptive resolution**, or perhaps as a secondary leading-tone chord to **G**.

But the presence of **F#dim**, **C**, **Bm**, **G**, and **Am** — all diatonic to **G major** — is compelling.

But why does it end on **Am**?

Let’s look at the **bass line**:

Bass notes:
- A, A, A, A, A, A, G, A  
- A, A, A, A, A, A, G, A

So: mostly **A** in the bass, with **G** before the final Am.

So the bass emphasizes **A**, suggesting **A** might be the tonic.

But the chords from G major center around **G**.

This is characteristic of a **mode** of G major.

Which mode starts on A?

**Dorian mode**.

G major: G A B C D E F#

A Dorian: A B C D E F# G → same notes.

So **A Dorian** uses:
- i: Am
- ii: Bm
- III+: C? Wait — C major is III, but not augmented.

A Dorian scale: A B C D E F# G

Chords:
- i: Am (A–C–E)
- ii: Bm (B–D–F#)
- III: C (C–E–G)
- IV: D (D–F#–A) — but we don’t have D
- v: Em (E–G–B) — not used
- VI: F#dim? No — F#–A–C♯ — wait no

F# in A Dorian: F#–A–C — A and C are in A Dorian, but C is **C natural**, not C#.

F#–A–C → that’s **F# diminished**, but in A Dorian, the chord on F# would be **F#dim**, yes: F#–A–C (since C is natural in A Dorian? Wait — no!)

Wait!

A Dorian: A B C D E F# G

So:
- F# note is present
- A is present
- C is **C natural**, present

So F# + A + C = F#–A–C → **F#dim** ✅ — yes, **vii° chord in A Dorian**

So in A Dorian:
- i: Am
- ii: Bm
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

Wait — but **F#dim** is not diatonic to A Dorian, because the sixth degree is F#, so chord on F# would use notes from the scale:

F#–A–C — A and C are in A Dorian, and **F# is in**, C is **natural**, so yes — F#–A–C = **F#dim** — that’s **vii°**, which exists in A Dorian.

But in A Dorian, the **VI chord** should be **F major** (F–A–C), but here we have **G6** — G–B–D–E → G major with E (6th). G major is **VII** in A Dorian.

But **F major** (VI) is not used — instead we have **G**.

Also, the **IV chord** in A Dorian is D minor — we don’t have Dm.

But we **do** have: Am, F#dim, C, Bm, G — all diatonic to A Dorian?

Let’s check:

- Am = i → ✅
- F#dim = vii° → F#–A–C → all in A Dorian → ✅
- C = III → C–E–G → E and G are in A Dorian → ✅
- Bm = ii → B–D–F# → D and F# are in → ✅
- G = VII → G–B–D → B and D are in → G6 adds E (6th), which is also in → ✅

So yes — **all chords are diatonic to A Dorian** (2nd mode of G major).

Now, the progression emphasizes **Am** throughout, ends on **Am**, and uses **G6 → Am** at the end — a **plagal cadence** (VII–i), typical in Dorian mode.

Also, the **F#dim/A** is used as a passing chord — likely voice leading from A down to Am via diminished color.

So even though it uses chords from **G major**, the **tonic center is A minor**, and the raised sixth (F#) instead of F natural confirms it's **not natural minor**, which would have F natural.

In A natural minor: A B C D E F G → would have Bdim, not Bm

But here we have **Bm**, which requires F#, so **F# confirms Dorian mode**.

Also, **F#dim** uses F#, present in Dorian.

---

### Final Analysis:

- **Tonic chord**: Am (heard as home)
- **Raised sixth degree**: F# (from Bm and F#dim)
- **Avoids F natural** — no chord requires it
- **Features VII–i cadence** (G → Am), typical Dorian
- All chords diatonic to **A Dorian**

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

**Key: A**  
**Mode: Dorian**

So the progression is in **A Dorian**.

---

### Bonus: Relation to G major

A Dorian is the **2nd mode of G major**, so it uses the same key signature (one sharp: F#), but centers on A.

**Answer: Key — A, Mode — Dorian** ✅
