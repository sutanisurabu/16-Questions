Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**  
Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  C/G  Bm/A  
Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  G6  Am

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center
- The progression begins and ends on **Am**.
- **Am** appears frequently and feels like a point of rest.
- This strongly suggests **A minor** as the tonal center.

### Step 2: Determine the key signature / scale
In **natural A minor**, the notes are:  
**A B C D E F G**

Let’s look at the chords used:

- **Am** = A–C–E → fits A natural minor ✅  
- **F#dim** = F#–A–C → includes **F#**, which is **not** in natural A minor (which has F natural) ❌  
- **C/G** = C–E–G (with G in bass) → C major chord, which is the **♭III** in A minor – common in minor keys ✅  
- **Bm/A** = B–D–F# (with A in bass) → contains **F#** again ❌  
- **G6** = G–B–D–E → G major with added 6th (E); G major is the **♭VII** in A minor ✅  
  - But note: **B natural** appears in G6? No—G6 is G–B–D–E → that **B** is **B natural**, which *is* in A natural minor ✅

Wait—**F#dim** introduces **F#**, and **Bm** introduces **F#** as well (since Bm = B–D–F#).

So where does **F#** come from?

In **A harmonic minor**: A B C D E F G#  
→ No F#

In **A melodic minor (ascending)**: A B C D E F# G#  
→ Yes, **F# and G#**

But we **don’t see G#** anywhere in the chords:
- Am (no G#)
- F#dim = F#–A–C (no G#)
- C/G = C–E–G (G natural)
- Bm/A = B–D–F# (no G#)
- G6 = G–B–D–E (G natural again)

So **G# is absent** – that rules out harmonic and melodic minor (in its ascending form).

However, **F#** appears consistently, suggesting the **Dorian mode**.

### Step 3: Consider A Dorian
**A Dorian** = A B C D E F# G

Compare with chords:

- **Am** = A–C–E → ✅  
- **F#dim** = F#–A–C → all notes in A Dorian ✅  
- **Bm** = B–D–F# → B Dorian chord (ii in A Dorian) ✅  
- **C/G** = C major → this is the **♭III** in A Dorian? Wait—C major = C–E–G  
  - In A Dorian: C is the **♭III degree**, and C major is diatonic to A Dorian?  
    - A Dorian notes: A B C D E F# G  
    - C major = C E G → all present → ✅  
- **G6** = G–B–D–E → G is the **VII** chord in A Dorian; G major is diatonic (G–B–D), and E is the 6th → ✅

So **all chords fit A Dorian**:
- **Am** = i  
- **F#dim** = vii°  
- **Bm** = ii  
- **C** = ♭III  
- **G** = VII

And we **never use G#**, so it’s not harmonic or melodic minor.

### Conclusion:
- **Key center**: A  
- **Mode**: **Dorian**  
- **Key/mode**: **A Dorian**

This is a classic modal progression in **A Dorian**, using characteristic chords like **F#dim** (vii°) and **Bm** (ii), and avoiding the leading tone (G#) that would imply A minor (tonal) harmony.

✅ **Answer: A Dorian**
