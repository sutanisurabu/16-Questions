### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am. They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to parse this progression correctly. It looks messy with all the slashes—probably slash chords indicating bass notes. Let me rewrite it clearly:

Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | C/G | Bm/A | Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | G6 | Am

Hmm, the slash notation is crucial here. F#dim/A means F# diminished with A in the bass—that's actually A minor 7 flat 5 (Am7♭5), since A-C-E-G becomes A-C-E-F#? Wait no... F#dim is F#-A-C, so with A in bass it's A-F#-C. But A-F#-C is actually F# diminished in first inversion, which functions as a chord built on F# but with A bass. In minor keys, this often acts as a iiø7 chord.

Similarly, C/G is C major with G bass—so G-C-E, which is a C/G chord (second inversion C major). Bm/A is B minor with A bass—A-B-D-F#? Wait no, Bm is B-D-F#, so with A bass it's A-B-D-F#? That might be messy. Actually Bm/A is probably just B minor chord over A bass note, so it's functioning as an A7sus4 or something? But let's not overcomplicate.

First step: list all chord roots ignoring bass notes for key analysis, but the bass notes matter for function. 

Chord roots here: A, A, F#, F#, A, A, C, B, A, A, F#, F#, A, A, G, A. 

F#dim/A is tricky—it's a diminished chord on F# but bass is A, so the harmonic root is probably F# (since diminished chords are usually named by root), but in context it might be acting as a chord of A. 

Standard approach: identify the tonic chord. Here Am appears 10 times—definitely the home base. So likely A minor key.

Now let's list all unique chords in the progression in root position where possible:

- Am (A-C-E) appears constantly
- F#dim (F#-A-C) but written as F#dim/A—so bass is A, but chord is F#dim. In music theory, this is often labeled as vii° in minor keys? Wait in A minor: natural minor has G as vii, but harmonic minor has G# as leading tone. 

A minor key has:
- Natural minor: A B C D E F G
- Harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#
- Melodic minor: A B C D E F# G# ascending

F#dim chord: F#-A-C. In A minor, F# is the 6th scale degree. F#-A-C is the diminished triad on F# in harmonic minor (because harmonic minor has G# instead of G natural). 

In A harmonic minor scale: A B C D E F G#? Wait no—harmonic minor raises the 7th to G#, so scale is A B C D E F G#. But F#dim would require F# as root, which isn't in harmonic minor. 

Mistake here: harmonic minor has G#, but natural minor has G natural. For chords: 
- In A natural minor: triads are i (Am), ii° (Bdim), III (C), iv (Dm), v (Em), VI (F), VII (G)
- In A harmonic minor: i (Am), ii° (Bdim), III+ (Caug), iv (Dm), V (E), VI (F), vii° (G#dim)
- In A melodic minor: i (Am), ii (Bm), III+ (Caug), IV (D), V (E), vi° (F#dim), vii° (G#dim)

Ah! Here we have F#dim chord. In A minor, F# is the 6th degree. In melodic minor (ascending), the 6th and 7th are raised, so F# and G#. Thus F#dim would be the vi° chord in A melodic minor minor? Wait: 
- A melodic minor ascending: A B C D E F# G#
- Triads: i (Am), ii (Bm), III+ (Caug), IV (D), V (E), vi° (F#dim), vii° (G#dim)

Yes! So F#dim is vi° in A melodic minor. 

Now looking at the progression: 
- F#dim/A appears—that's F#dim chord with A in bass. Since F#dim is F#-A-C, with A bass it's first inversion. In A minor, this functions as a pre-dominant chord leading to... well, here it goes back to Am? Or sometimes to Dm or other chords. 

But in this progression, it's sandwiched between Am chords. Typical for a iiø7 or something, but here it's diatonic to melodic minor. 

Other chords: 
- C/G: C major over G bass. C major is III chord in A minor. In natural minor, III is major (C), same in harmonic/melodic. 
- Bm/A: B minor over A bass. Bm is ii chord in A minor. 
- G6: G major with 6th (E), so G-B-D-E. In A minor, G major is the VII chord (from natural minor). G6 implies G-B-D-E, so it has E natural.

Now let's map all chords to A minor scales:

- Am: i in all minor variants
- F#dim: vi° only in melodic minor (ascending) — in harmonic minor it's G#dim as vii°, not F#dim
- C: III in all minor variants (C major is diatonic to natural minor)
- Bm: ii in all minor variants (B minor)
- G6: G major is VII in natural minor; G6 adds E which is 5th of A minor, so still natural minor element

The presence of F#dim is critical. In A natural minor, the 6th is F natural, so Fdim would be F-A♭-C♭? No, Fdim isn't diatonic. In natural minor: sixth degree is F, so triad on F is F major (F-A-C) — wait no: 
- A natural minor scale: A B C D E F G
- Chord on F: F-A-C → F major (VI chord)
- Chord on F#: not in scale — F# would be raised 6th

So F#dim only appears if we have F# in the scale, which happens in:
- Harmonic minor? No, harmonic minor has G# but F natural
- Melodic minor ascending: yes, F# and G#

Therefore, F#dim chord strongly suggests A melodic minor. 

Now check other chords for consistency with melodic minor:
- Melodic minor ascending has F# and G#
- Chords: 
  - i: Am (good)
  - ii: Bm (B-D-F#) — yes, and we have Bm/A later
  - iii: C augmented (C-E-G#) — but here we have C major (C/E/G), not augmented. 
  - Wait, progression has C/G (C major), not Caug. 

Problem: in melodic minor, the III chord should be augmented (C-E-G#), but here it's C major (C-E-G natural). So if it were strict melodic minor, we'd expect G# in the chord, but C/G implies G natural. 

Similarly, G6: G-B-D-E — G major with 6th (E). In melodic minor ascending, the 7th is G#, so G major chord (with G natural) would imply natural minor element. 

This suggests mixture of scales — common in practice. 

Key indicators:
- Constant Am tonic
- F#dim chord (requires F#)
- G natural in C and G6 chords (C/G has G natural, G6 has G natural)
- So we have both F# and G natural? But melodic minor has F# and G#, not G natural. 

A ha! This is A Dorian mode. 

Recall Dorian mode: 
- A Dorian: A B C D E F# G (same notes as G major scale)
- Diatonic chords:
  - i: Am
  - ii: Bm
  - III: C major
  - iv: Dm
  - v: Em
  - VI: F# dim? Wait no: 
    - Scale: A B C D E F# G
    - Chord on F#: F#-A-C → F# diminished? But A-C is minor third, F#-A-C is diminished triad (since F#-A is minor third, A-C is minor third, so diminished fifth). Yes! 
    - Chord on G: G-B-D → G major (VII)
    - Chord on C: C-E-G → C major (III)

Perfect match!

Check progression against A Dorian:

Chords:
- Am: i (tonic)
- F#dim/A: This is F#dim chord, which is vi° in Dorian? Wait in A Dorian:
  - Degree 6 is F#, so chord is F#-A-C → yes, diminished triad (vi°)
  - Written as F#dim/A — bass on A, which is the tonic note, so it's first inversion vi° chord. Common in minor-key progressions as a passing chord.
- C/G: C major (III chord), with G bass (second inversion). III is major in Dorian.
- Bm/A: B minor (ii chord), with A bass. ii is minor in Dorian.
- G6: G major (VII chord) with 6th (E). VII is major in Dorian.

All chords fit A Dorian mode perfectly:
- i: Am
- ii: Bm
- III: C
- iv: Dm (not present, but not needed)
- v: Em (not present)
- vi°: F#dim
- VII: G

The chord progression makes sense in Dorian:
- F#dim/A: vi°6 (first inversion) acting as a predominant, often leading to ii or V, but here it's used in a repetitive pattern over Am
- C/G: III (common in Dorian, gives the raised 6th color)
- Bm/A: ii
- G6: VII

Also note the G6 chord: G-B-D-E. In Dorian, the characteristic notes are major 6th (F#) and minor 7th (G). G6 includes E (5th) which is fine, but the 6th in G6 would be E? Wait no—G6 chord is G-B-D-E, so the "6" refers to E (6th above G). But in terms of scale, E is the 5th degree of A Dorian, so it's diatonic. The important thing is the G major chord (B natural) confirms the minor 7th (G natural), not G#.

Contrast with melodic minor: 
- Melodic minor ascending would have G#, so chords would include G#dim or E major, but here we have G major chord (G6), which requires G natural.

Therefore, the key is A minor, but the mode is Dorian.

Wait—is "key" A minor or A Dorian? In modern usage, we'd say the key is A minor but borrowing Dorian mode, or simply the key center is A with Dorian flavor. But technically, Dorian is a mode, not a key—keys are major or minor. Standard practice is to say "in A Dorian" meaning the mode is Dorian with tonic A.

Confirming with the bass notes:
- F#dim/A: A in bass (tonic) with F#dim chord — so the harmonic movement is tonic to vi°, but bass stays on A? In context, it's like Am7♭5 (since F#dim/A = A-C-E-G? Wait no: F#dim is F#-A-C, so F#dim/A is A-C-F# — that's A half-diminished 7th? A-C-E-G is Am7♭5, but here it's A-C-F#, which is missing the E. Actually F#dim/A is A-F#-C — which is the same as Dm7 without root? But in functional harmony, in A minor, F#dim is vii° of G, but here it's not resolving that way.

In Dorian context, it's straightforward: vi° chord (F#dim) functioning as a diatonic chord.

Another clue: The progression has no E major or E7 chord (which would be V in harmonic minor), and no G#dim. Instead, it uses G major and C major, which are characteristic of Dorian (and natural minor).

Conclusion: The key center is A, and the mode is Dorian.

Final answer should be: A Dorian mode.

But to be precise: 
- Key: A minor is the relative minor, but since it's modal, better to say "A Dorian" as the key/mode.

In music theory terms, we'd say the piece is in A Dorian.

### Key and Mode Analysis: **A Dorian**

#### **Progression Breakdown**  
Your chord progression:  
> **Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | C/G | Bm/A | Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | G6 | Am**

Let's analyze the **root movement** and **diatonic function** in the context of **A minor scales** (natural minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor) vs. **A Dorian mode** (a natural minor variant with a raised 6th).

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Tonic and Key Center**
- **Am (A-C-E)** appears **10 times** (including slash chords like `Bm/A` and `C/G`, which often emphasize Am as the tonal center).  
- **This confirms A as the tonic note** (the "home" chord).  
- The key is centered on **A minor**, but the *scale degrees* (e.g., F vs. F#) determine the **mode**.

---

### **Step 2: Diagnose Critical Chords (Why Dorian?)**
The progression contains **three chords that reveal the mode**:  
1. **`F#dim/A`** (appears 4 times)  
   - Root: **F#** (F#-A-C, with A in the bass).  
   - **F# is the raised 6th scale degree** (A natural minor uses F♮, not F#).  
   - In **A natural minor** (A-B-C-D-E-F-G), F# does *not* exist.  
   - In **A harmonic minor** (A-B-C-D-E-F-G#), F# isn't diatonic (it uses F♮).  
   - **A melodic minor** (ascending: A-B-C-D-E-F#-G#) includes F#, but its III chord is **Caug** (C-E-G#), **not C major** (as in your `C/G` chord).  

2. **`C/G`** (C major with G in the bass = **C-E-G**)  
   - **C major is the III chord** (requires **E natural**, **not E♭**).  
   - This chord **only works in A Dorian or A natural minor** (both have E natural).  

3. **`G6`** (G-B-D-E = **G major with added 6th**)  
   - Root: **G** (scale degree ♭7 in minor keys).  
   - **G major (VII chord) requires G natural**, not G# (which appears in harmonic/melodic minor).  
   - In A natural minor: G is diatonic (VII).  
   - In A Dorian: G is also diatonic (♭7).  

#### **Why A Dorian?**  
- **A Dorian scale: A-B-C-D-E-F#-G**  
  - Contains **F#** (for `F#dim`) and **G natural** (for `G6` and `C/G`).  
  - Diatonic chords:  
    - **i**: Am (tonic)  
    - **ii**: Bm (e.g., `Bm/A`)  
    - **III**: C major (e.g., `C/G`)  
    - **IV**: Dm (not present, but possible)  
    - **v**: Em (not present)  
    - **vi°**: F#dim (e.g., `F#dim/A`)  
    - **VII**: G major (e.g., `G6`)  

- **Why not other minor variants?**  
  | Mode          | 6th Degree | 7th Degree | Fixes `F#dim`? | Fixes `C/G`? | Fixes `G6`? |  
  |---------------|------------|------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|  
  | **A Dorian**  | **F#**     | **G**      | Yes (vi°)      | Yes (III)    | Yes (VII)   |  
  | A Natural Min | F          | G          | ❌ (no F#)      | Yes (III)    | Yes (VII)   |  
  | A Harmonic Min| F          | **G#**     | ❌ (no F#)      | ❌ (III = Caug)| ❌ (no G nat)|  
  | A Melodic Min | **F#**     | **G#**     | Yes (vi°)      | ❌ (III = Caug)| ❌ (no G nat)|  

- **The `F#dim` chord requires F#**, **`G6` requires G natural**, and **`C/G` requires C major** → **only A Dorian satisfies all three**.  
- **Melodic minor is ruled out** because it uses **G#** (e.g., G#dim or E major chords), but `G6` confirms G natural.  
- **Natural minor is ruled out** because it uses **F natural** (no `F#dim` chord).

---

### **Step 3: Functional Harmony in A Dorian**
- **`Am` (i)**: Tonic (safe harbor).  
- **`F#dim/A` (vi°)**: Chromatic predominant chord. In Dorian, this creates tension toward the tonic (common in jazzy/minor-key progressions).  
- **`C/G` (III)**: Bright, modal "lift" (characteristic of Dorian; sounds hopeful/mystical vs. natural minor's darker III+).  
- **`Bm/A` (ii)**: Subdominant function (leads to tonic).  
- **`G6` (VII)**: Sustained minor 7th (G), giving the Dorian "vibe" (e.g., "Scarborough Fair," "So What").  

> 💡 **Why does it sound "minor" but not "sad"?**  
> Dorian has a **minor 3rd (C)** like natural minor but a **major 6th (F#)** → brighter than natural minor. The F# in `F#dim/A` creates movement without the tension of harmonic minor's G#.

---

### **Final Answer**  
- **Key Center**: **A**  
- **Mode**: **Dorian**  
- **Full Identification**: **A Dorian**  

This progression is a **classic Dorian cadence**:  
> **i - vi° - i // i - III - ii - i // i - vi° - i // i - VII - i**  

#### Bonus: Genre Context  
- Common in **folk, jazz, rock, and film scores** (e.g., Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall," Santana's "Oye Como Va").  
- The **F#dim/A → Am** creates a smooth, descending bass line (A → A → G♯? Wait no—F#dim/A is A-C-F#, so bass stays on A with inner movement). Actually, the bass here often emphasizes A (as in `F#dim/A` and `Bm/A`), creating a **pedal point** effect common in Dorian.
