### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking closely at the chord progression to determine the key and mode. It features several Am chords alongside F#dim/A, C/G, Bm/A, and G6, so I’m thinking the tonality is likely A minor. 

Breaking it down: the Am chord is the tonic (i) in A minor. The F#dim/A triad includes the notes F# A and C, and I'm questioning how these fit in with A minor. F# isn't part of the natural or harmonic scale. It seems to suggest a Dorian or melodic minor approach, especially since F# appears in melodic minor.**Exploring F#dim triad**

I’m examining the F#dim triad (F# A C) and its relation to the A melodic minor scale. It looks like this triad could work as the vii° of G, but I’m not entirely sure about its derivation. 

In A melodic minor, the diatonic triads are based on the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#. I’m thinking ii is a minor triad, specifically B minor, which has the notes B, D, and F#. While the harmonic implications are complex, it seems that in classical melodic minor, the ii can yield a minor seventh.**Clarifying chord functions**

I want to keep things straightforward. So, let’s break down the triads in A melodic minor: 

The iii is C augmented, iv is D major, v is E major, vi is the correct F# diminished, and vii is G# diminished. This confirms that F#dim is diatonic in A melodic minor and functions as F#dim/A in second inversion.

It seems like F#dim tends to lead to A minor, but I’m questioning its resolution. Typically, E7 (which includes G#) is more common for harmonic minor pieces rather than F#. Still, there’s a complex interplay in its use.**Investigating chord relationships**

I’m realizing that F#dim acts as a leading-tone diminished triad to G, which fits as the vii° of G. In A minor, if there's a G chord, then yes, the G6 appears later. This makes F#dim a secondary leading-tone chord preparing for G, where G is the VII in A natural minor. 

I see that the cadence flows from Am to F#dim/A before G, which could imply it serves as a neighbor leading-tone to the subtonic. Looking at the other chords, C/G indicates C major over a G bass, presenting a bIII chord in A minor. Bm/A is showing B D F# over an A bass.**Defining key and mode**

The B minor chord is diatonic to A melodic minor, not A natural minor, given its F#. With A in the bass, Bm/A could function as a 9sus. This chord includes the notes A, B, D, and F#, which hints at modal mixture. 

Now, the G6 chord indicates that G is the bVII in A minor, suggesting the mix of natural and melodic minor. Overall, these elements lead me to conclude that the key is A and the mode is Dorian. The presence of F# but lack of G# solidifies this.**Summarizing key and mode**

I want to create a clear answer outlining the key and mode. 

The tonal center is A, and the mode is Dorian, which includes the scale A, B, C, D, E, F#, and G. The chord mapping corresponds as follows: Am (i), F#dim (vi°), C/G (bIII in second inversion), Bm/A (ii over i pedal), and G6 (VIIadd6 or Em7/G), resolving to Am. It’s important to note the absence of E major/E7 and G#, alongside the presence of F#. Overall, that gives a complete picture!

A Dorian (tonal center A)

Why:
- Chords are all diatonic to A Dorian (A B C D E F# G): Am (i), F#dim/A (vi° in 2nd inversion), C/G (bIII in 2nd inversion), Bm/A (ii over i pedal), G6 (VII add6 or Em7/G), resolving to Am.
- Presence of F# (raised 6) and G natural, with no G# or E/E7, points to Dorian rather than harmonic/melodic or natural minor.

So the key center is A, and the mode is Dorian.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to figure out the key and mode from the chord progression, which includes several Am chords, F#dim/A, C/G, Bm/A, and G6. Given the frequency of Am chords, A minor seems like the tonic. The F#dim chord, with A in the bass, could be the vii° in G major, but in A minor, it acts as a leading-tone diminished chord. In the A natural minor scale, F# isn't present, indicating the raised second in harmonic minor is relevant here.**Clarifying melodic minor chords**

I’m working with A melodic minor, which has the notes A, B, C, D, E, F#, and G#. This scale includes F# and G#. When I look at the F#dim chord (F#-A-C), I realize it's the ii° chord in A melodic minor. So, let's clarify: the scale degrees tell me that the triad on the second degree is indeed B minor (B-D-F#) rather than diminished. The triad built on F# (F#-A-C) confirms that it’s a diminished triad.**Examining F# diminished in A minor**

I realized that F#dim serves as the vi° triad in A melodic minor. The presence of F# suggests a melodic form, and in a typical progression, F#dim/A can lead to Am. Since it shares two notes with Am, it might function as a leading-tone to G. F#dim often resolves to G major, making it a vii°/G chord. In A minor, G major acts as the VII degree, showing the connection back to the G6 chord later in the progression.**Analyzing G6 and other chords**

G6 simply adds an E, which is a common tone in Am. However, looking at the progression, I see C/G and Bm/A as well. C/G is C major with G in the bass, functioning as the III chord in A minor. Bm/A is B minor with A as the bass note. In A melodic minor, B minor acts as the ii chord. I wonder if Bm/A could also imply Bm7/A, yielding an addition of A11. Breaking it down, the Bm triad consists of B-D-F#, and with an A in the bass, the notes include A, B, D, and F#.**Determining key and mode**

The chord Bm/A has A in the bass and includes the notes B, D, and F#. This fits well because it maintains consistency with A melodic minor, featuring F#. I notice the chords used: Am, F#dim/A, C/G, Bm/A, and G6 all include notes A, B, C, D, E, F#, and G. Since there's no G#, we could point toward A Dorian mode instead of melodic minor. 

The A Dorian scale is A B C D E F# G and matches the chords. Thus, the key and mode suggest A Dorian, with G major as the parent scale.

A Dorian (tonic A, mode Dorian).

Reason: The tonal center is A, F# appears (raised 6) while G# never does, and all chords (Am, Bm, C, F#dim, G6) are diatonic to A Dorian, which uses the G major collection: A B C D E F# G.

### Reasoning

**Identifying chords and key**

I need to identify the key and mode from the given chord sequence: 

"Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am." 

Parsing through the chords, it looks like the piece is centered on A minor. The F#dim/A suggests it might function as the leading-tone diminished seventh, but wait — since F# is not diatonic in A minor without the melodic minor, I'm considering how it contrasts with the G major context as well. The center is clearly A minor, though!**Analyzing harmonic minor**

I'm analyzing the chords to see how they fit in harmonic minor. In A harmonic minor, the leading tone is G#, which isn’t present. The F# diminished chord could serve as the ii° of E minor or vii°/G (leading tone to G). I'm noticing that the chords don’t resolve to G but return to Am. 

C/G and Bm/A show interesting relationships, especially the F# presence in Bm. This suggests the key may actually be A Dorian, which fits with the chords I've observed!**Examining triads in A Dorian**

I’m analyzing triads in A Dorian:

- i: Am (A C E)
- ii: Bm (B D F#)
- bIII: C (C E G)
- IV: D (D F# A)
- v: Em (E G B)
- vi°: F#dim (F# A C)
- bVII: G (G B D)

I see that F#dim fits as vi° in A Dorian, and Bm is ii. The G6 chord also works here. Since the notes in C/G remain diatonic, it all aligns with A Dorian. The cadence back to Am affirms that A is the tonal center. The absence of G# and presence of F# confirm I'm in Dorian mode!**Clarifying A Dorian function**

I see that F#dim/A functions as vi°6 in A Dorian, while G6 serves as bVII6. The added 6 in G6 is E, and since G6 isn't diatonic in Aeolian, it all aligns with Dorian instead. 

The presence of Bm also suggests A Dorian because Aeolian would feature F natural. While I can consider the possibility of G major, the sequence mostly revolves around Am. The tonal center being A reinforces that the key is A with Dorian mode. So there’s my concise reasoning!**Summarizing A Dorian relationships**

I also see that this setup is equivalent to G major but with A as the modal center, using the same pitch collection. I want to deliver a succinct final answer, possibly with Roman numerals indicating the chords in A Dorian: i, vi°6, i, and bIII6/5. 

C/G and Bm/A are interesting; I think Bm/A might serve as ii6/5 in second inversion, which gives it a suspended feel. But I don’t need to romanize everything—just highlighting its diatonic nature in A Dorian is enough!

A Dorian (A as tonal center, Dorian mode)

Why:
- The harmony clearly centers on Am (begins/ends on Am).
- Presence of F# (in F#dim and Bm) rules out A natural minor (Aeolian), which would have F natural.
- No G# appears, so it’s not A harmonic/melodic minor.
- All chords fit A Dorian’s pitch set (A B C D E F# G): Am, F#dim (vi°), C, Bm (ii), G(6).

Equivalently: the collection is G major, but with A as the modal center (A Dorian).

### Analysis of Chord Progression

The given progression is:  
**Am - Am - F#dim/A - F#dim/A - Am - Am - C/G - Bm/A - Am - Am - F#dim/A - F#dim/A - Am - Am - G6 - Am**

This is a repeating, vamp-like structure that strongly emphasizes tension and resolution around A minor. I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step, based on standard music theory (diatonic harmony, chord functions, and scale degrees).

#### Step 1: Identifying the Tonal Center
- The progression **starts and ends on Am** (four times in total), which acts as the clear tonic (home base).
- It resolves back to Am repeatedly, creating a sense of closure.
- No other chord feels like a stronger gravitational pull; everything orbits around A as the root note.
- Bass lines (e.g., /A in F#dim/A and Bm/A, /G in C/G) reinforce A and its relatives without shifting the center.

**Tonal center: A**

#### Step 2: Determining the Key (Scale Fit)
Let's map the chords to potential scales in A:
- **Core chords**:
  - Am (A-C-E): i (tonic) in A minor.
  - F#dim/A (F#-A-C, over A bass): vii° (leading-tone diminished) in A (harmonic) minor. This is a classic tension-builder resolving to i.
  - C/G (C-E-G over G bass): III (mediant) in A minor, functioning like a subdominant or pivot. The G bass adds a VII feel.
  - Bm/A (B-D-F# over A bass): This implies ii° or a secondary dominant, but B-D-F# requires the raised 7th (G#) from A harmonic minor for diatonic fit. It's non-diatonic in natural minor but common in harmonic minor contexts.
  - G6 (G-B-D-E): VII6 (subtonic with added 6th) in A minor, providing a plagal (iv-like) resolution to Am.

- **Scale compatibility**:
  - **A natural minor (Aeolian: A-B-C-D-E-F-G)**: Fits Am, C, and G6 perfectly. But F#dim and Bm introduce F# (not in the scale), so it's not a pure fit.
  - **A harmonic minor (A-B-C-D-E-F-G#)**: Perfect fit for all chords. The G# allows F# (leading tone/enharmonic to G#) in F#dim and Bm, which act as vii° and ii. This is common in progressions needing tension (e.g., the dim chord pulls strongly to Am).
  - **A major**: Unlikely—predominantly minor tonic (Am) and no strong major III (C#) or V (E major). Chords like F#dim feel unstable in major.

- No evidence of modulation (e.g., no pivot to relative major C or dominant E major). The slash chords (/A, /G) add color but stay within A minor's orbit.

**Key: A minor** (specifically leaning on the harmonic minor variant for the F#-containing chords).

#### Step 3: Determining the Mode
- **Mode: Minor** (dark, introspective tonality from the minor tonic and prevalent minor/diminished chords).
  - It's not major (lacks brightness from major tonic or Lydian/Mixolydian flavors).
  - Sub-mode nuance: Primarily **harmonic minor** due to the vii° (F#dim) and implied raised 7th (G#) for tension/resolution. This gives it a more "classical" or dramatic feel than pure natural minor (Aeolian), but it doesn't fully commit to melodic minor (which would raise the 6th for ascending lines, not evident here).
- Overall mood: Somber and cyclic, with the F#dim creating suspense before returning to Am—evocative of ballads or film noir soundtracks.

#### Additional Notes
- This progression resembles vamps in songs like "Summertime" (Gershwin, in minor) or Spanish/flamenco influences, where harmonic minor adds exotic tension.
- If this is from a specific song (e.g., it echoes parts of "Hotel California" or similar A minor tunes), the key/mode aligns with those analyses.
- To confirm in practice: Play it over an A minor scale (harmonic variant). It should feel resolved. Transposing to another key (e.g., up a half-step to A#m) would break the diatonic flow.

If you provide more context (e.g., melody notes, song title, or full arrangement), I can refine this further!

### Key and Mode Analysis

The chord progression you provided (Am - Am - F#dim/A - F#dim/A - Am - Am - C/G - Bm/A - Am - Am - F#dim/A - F#dim/A - Am - Am - G6 - Am) is a classic example of a progression in **A minor** (the relative minor of C major). This exact sequence is famously used in Radiohead's "Karma Police" from their album *OK Computer* (1997), which centers on A as the tonal root.

#### Key: A Minor
- **Tonal Center**: A. The progression repeatedly resolves to and emphasizes Am (the i chord), creating a clear sense of A as home base. It avoids any strong pull toward the parallel major (A major) by not using chords that tonicize A major (e.g., no A major chord or heavy V7 resolution like E7).
- **Scale Basis**: Derived from the A natural minor scale (A B C D E F G), which fits most chords here without accidentals.
  - Am: i (root minor triad)
  - F#dim/A: Functions as a passing or tension-building chord (like a vii°7 borrowing from A harmonic minor, where F# is the #6/leading tone; the /A bass keeps it grounded in the key).
  - C/G: iv6 (C major triad over G bass; C is the iv in A minor).
  - Bm/A: v6/iv or passing (B minor over A; Bm is like a borrowed v from A major, but contextualized as tension leading back to Am).
  - G6: VII6 (G major with added 6th—A; common in minor keys for a subtonic feel, adding color without resolving to major).

No modulations or pivot chords suggest a shift away from A minor. The overall mood is melancholic and introspective, typical of minor-key progressions.

#### Mode: Aeolian (Natural Minor)
- **Why Aeolian?** This is the "pure" natural minor mode (no raised 7th like in harmonic or melodic minor). The key signature implies 0 sharps/flats for A minor, matching the Aeolian mode of the C major scale (6th mode: A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A).
  - No consistent use of the raised 7th (G#) to create a dominant V chord (E major or E7), which would lean toward harmonic minor or suggest a Phrygian/Spanish flavor.
  - The F# in F#dim/A introduces a brief chromatic tension (from harmonic minor), but it's not structural enough to change the mode—it's more of a color note for dissonance.
  - Avoids Dorian traits (raised 6th, like F# major chords) or Phrygian (lowered 2nd, like Bb chords) as dominant elements.
- **Modal Feel**: Static and brooding, with the repeated Am blocks and the G6 ending providing a subtle plagal (iv-i or VII-i) resolution rather than a strong authentic cadence.

If this is from a specific song or context (e.g., "Karma Police"), it reinforces A Aeolian—the melody (if present) would likely outline the natural minor scale. If you have more details like melody notes or tempo, I could refine this further!

### Reasoning

**Examining Chord Relationships**

I'm starting to build a comprehensive list of all the chords. It's an important first step, and I've got the initial chord inventory down: Am, F#dim/A, and C. Now, I'm thinking about how each chord relates to the others. I'll need to figure out what key or keys this could be in and what the function of each chord is.


**Pinpointing Chord Functions**

I'm now deep in the analysis, classifying each chord's role within the A minor key. I've broken them down into individual notes, which helped confirm A minor as the tonal center. Now, I'm labeling each chord – Am, F#dim/A, C/G, Bm/A, G6 – based on its function: tonic, leading tone, and so on. This will help with the final understanding of the harmonic movement.


**Deciphering the Scale**

I'm now investigating the A minor scale. Analyzing the chords, I've confirmed the key as A minor and am currently considering natural, harmonic, and melodic variations. Identifying F#dim/A as a vi° chord is significant because its presence points toward a utilization of the melodic minor scale. I'm carefully examining the function of each chord, which is crucial for full harmonic understanding.


**Decoding the Harmonic Palette**

I'm now zeroing in on the detailed functions of each chord and its role in creating the overall harmonic color. Examining each chord's relationship within the identified A minor context, I see how they contribute to the progression's character. I'm focusing on the G6 chord, analyzing its specific function.


**Deciding on Minor Scale Forms**

I'm now in the process of determining which forms of A minor are at play. After breaking down the chords to their constituent notes, and now I'm studying the natural, harmonic, and melodic minor scales to determine the best fit for this particular progression. The F# in the F#dim/A points to a utilization of the A melodic minor scale, and I'll analyze how each chord function.


**Synthesizing Harmonic Insights**

I'm now integrating all my findings to define the core harmonic qualities, including the tonal center and modes at play. I've broken down all chords, and analyzed the chords to find which forms of minor scales are being utilized. I am zeroing in on the interaction between A minor's natural and melodic versions to understand the progression's distinctive flavor.


**Synthesizing Harmonic Analysis**

I'm now consolidating all the data from my chord analysis. I can tell now that the key is A minor. Also, I've identified the use of the melodic minor scale through the inclusion of the F# and Bm chords. I'm finalizing my chord-by-chord breakdown, which integrates all insights into a concise final statement about the harmonic character.




Based on the chords provided, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** A
*   **Mode:** Minor

### Detailed Analysis

1.  **Tonal Center (The "Home" Chord):** The progression begins and ends on **Am**. The chord Am also appears more frequently than any other chord in the sequence. This strongly establishes **A minor** as the tonic, or the harmonic center of the piece.

2.  **Use of Different Minor Scales:** The chord progression is not based on a single minor scale (like natural, harmonic, or melodic) but rather mixes them, which is very common in music.

    *   **A Natural Minor (A-B-C-D-E-F-G):** This scale is the foundation. The chords **Am (i)**, **C/G (III)**, and **G6 (VII)** are all derived directly from the A natural minor scale.
    *   **A Melodic Minor (A-B-C-D-E-F#-G#):** The progression borrows the raised 6th degree (F#) from the melodic minor scale. This is seen in the **F#dim/A** and **Bm/A** chords.
        *   **Am (A-C-E):** The tonic **(i)** chord.
        *   **F#dim/A (F#-A-C):** This is the diminished chord built on the raised 6th degree of A minor (vi°). It creates a smooth, chromatic sound leading back to Am.
        *   **C/G (C-E-G):** The relative major **(III)** chord, very common in minor keys.
        *   **Bm/A (B-D-F#):** This is a B minor chord. In natural minor, the chord on B would be a B diminished (B-D-F). The use of **F#** makes it a minor chord, functioning as a pre-dominant **(ii)**, often borrowed from the parallel major key (A Major) or A Dorian mode.
        *   **G6 (G-B-D-E):** This is the subtonic chord **(VII)** with an added 6th (which is the 5th of the key, E). It functions as a pre-dominant, leading back to the tonic Am with a less tense, more "modal" feel than a traditional dominant (E7) chord.

### Summary

The progression is definitively in **A minor**. It creates its unique color by using chords from the natural minor scale as its base while borrowing the F# from the melodic minor scale (or Dorian mode) for chords like **F#dim** and **Bm**. This blending of different minor modes is a sophisticated harmonic technique.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am. They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to parse this progression correctly. It looks messy with all the slashes—probably slash chords indicating bass notes. Let me rewrite it clearly:

Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | C/G | Bm/A | Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | G6 | Am

Hmm, the slash notation is crucial here. F#dim/A means F# diminished with A in the bass—that's actually A minor 7 flat 5 (Am7♭5), since A-C-E-G becomes A-C-E-F#? Wait no... F#dim is F#-A-C, so with A in bass it's A-F#-C. But A-F#-C is actually F# diminished in first inversion, which functions as a chord built on F# but with A bass. In minor keys, this often acts as a iiø7 chord.

Similarly, C/G is C major with G bass—so G-C-E, which is a C/G chord (second inversion C major). Bm/A is B minor with A bass—A-B-D-F#? Wait no, Bm is B-D-F#, so with A bass it's A-B-D-F#? That might be messy. Actually Bm/A is probably just B minor chord over A bass note, so it's functioning as an A7sus4 or something? But let's not overcomplicate.

First step: list all chord roots ignoring bass notes for key analysis, but the bass notes matter for function. 

Chord roots here: A, A, F#, F#, A, A, C, B, A, A, F#, F#, A, A, G, A. 

F#dim/A is tricky—it's a diminished chord on F# but bass is A, so the harmonic root is probably F# (since diminished chords are usually named by root), but in context it might be acting as a chord of A. 

Standard approach: identify the tonic chord. Here Am appears 10 times—definitely the home base. So likely A minor key.

Now let's list all unique chords in the progression in root position where possible:

- Am (A-C-E) appears constantly
- F#dim (F#-A-C) but written as F#dim/A—so bass is A, but chord is F#dim. In music theory, this is often labeled as vii° in minor keys? Wait in A minor: natural minor has G as vii, but harmonic minor has G# as leading tone. 

A minor key has:
- Natural minor: A B C D E F G
- Harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#
- Melodic minor: A B C D E F# G# ascending

F#dim chord: F#-A-C. In A minor, F# is the 6th scale degree. F#-A-C is the diminished triad on F# in harmonic minor (because harmonic minor has G# instead of G natural). 

In A harmonic minor scale: A B C D E F G#? Wait no—harmonic minor raises the 7th to G#, so scale is A B C D E F G#. But F#dim would require F# as root, which isn't in harmonic minor. 

Mistake here: harmonic minor has G#, but natural minor has G natural. For chords: 
- In A natural minor: triads are i (Am), ii° (Bdim), III (C), iv (Dm), v (Em), VI (F), VII (G)
- In A harmonic minor: i (Am), ii° (Bdim), III+ (Caug), iv (Dm), V (E), VI (F), vii° (G#dim)
- In A melodic minor: i (Am), ii (Bm), III+ (Caug), IV (D), V (E), vi° (F#dim), vii° (G#dim)

Ah! Here we have F#dim chord. In A minor, F# is the 6th degree. In melodic minor (ascending), the 6th and 7th are raised, so F# and G#. Thus F#dim would be the vi° chord in A melodic minor minor? Wait: 
- A melodic minor ascending: A B C D E F# G#
- Triads: i (Am), ii (Bm), III+ (Caug), IV (D), V (E), vi° (F#dim), vii° (G#dim)

Yes! So F#dim is vi° in A melodic minor. 

Now looking at the progression: 
- F#dim/A appears—that's F#dim chord with A in bass. Since F#dim is F#-A-C, with A bass it's first inversion. In A minor, this functions as a pre-dominant chord leading to... well, here it goes back to Am? Or sometimes to Dm or other chords. 

But in this progression, it's sandwiched between Am chords. Typical for a iiø7 or something, but here it's diatonic to melodic minor. 

Other chords: 
- C/G: C major over G bass. C major is III chord in A minor. In natural minor, III is major (C), same in harmonic/melodic. 
- Bm/A: B minor over A bass. Bm is ii chord in A minor. 
- G6: G major with 6th (E), so G-B-D-E. In A minor, G major is the VII chord (from natural minor). G6 implies G-B-D-E, so it has E natural.

Now let's map all chords to A minor scales:

- Am: i in all minor variants
- F#dim: vi° only in melodic minor (ascending) — in harmonic minor it's G#dim as vii°, not F#dim
- C: III in all minor variants (C major is diatonic to natural minor)
- Bm: ii in all minor variants (B minor)
- G6: G major is VII in natural minor; G6 adds E which is 5th of A minor, so still natural minor element

The presence of F#dim is critical. In A natural minor, the 6th is F natural, so Fdim would be F-A♭-C♭? No, Fdim isn't diatonic. In natural minor: sixth degree is F, so triad on F is F major (F-A-C) — wait no: 
- A natural minor scale: A B C D E F G
- Chord on F: F-A-C → F major (VI chord)
- Chord on F#: not in scale — F# would be raised 6th

So F#dim only appears if we have F# in the scale, which happens in:
- Harmonic minor? No, harmonic minor has G# but F natural
- Melodic minor ascending: yes, F# and G#

Therefore, F#dim chord strongly suggests A melodic minor. 

Now check other chords for consistency with melodic minor:
- Melodic minor ascending has F# and G#
- Chords: 
  - i: Am (good)
  - ii: Bm (B-D-F#) — yes, and we have Bm/A later
  - iii: C augmented (C-E-G#) — but here we have C major (C/E/G), not augmented. 
  - Wait, progression has C/G (C major), not Caug. 

Problem: in melodic minor, the III chord should be augmented (C-E-G#), but here it's C major (C-E-G natural). So if it were strict melodic minor, we'd expect G# in the chord, but C/G implies G natural. 

Similarly, G6: G-B-D-E — G major with 6th (E). In melodic minor ascending, the 7th is G#, so G major chord (with G natural) would imply natural minor element. 

This suggests mixture of scales — common in practice. 

Key indicators:
- Constant Am tonic
- F#dim chord (requires F#)
- G natural in C and G6 chords (C/G has G natural, G6 has G natural)
- So we have both F# and G natural? But melodic minor has F# and G#, not G natural. 

A ha! This is A Dorian mode. 

Recall Dorian mode: 
- A Dorian: A B C D E F# G (same notes as G major scale)
- Diatonic chords:
  - i: Am
  - ii: Bm
  - III: C major
  - iv: Dm
  - v: Em
  - VI: F# dim? Wait no: 
    - Scale: A B C D E F# G
    - Chord on F#: F#-A-C → F# diminished? But A-C is minor third, F#-A-C is diminished triad (since F#-A is minor third, A-C is minor third, so diminished fifth). Yes! 
    - Chord on G: G-B-D → G major (VII)
    - Chord on C: C-E-G → C major (III)

Perfect match!

Check progression against A Dorian:

Chords:
- Am: i (tonic)
- F#dim/A: This is F#dim chord, which is vi° in Dorian? Wait in A Dorian:
  - Degree 6 is F#, so chord is F#-A-C → yes, diminished triad (vi°)
  - Written as F#dim/A — bass on A, which is the tonic note, so it's first inversion vi° chord. Common in minor-key progressions as a passing chord.
- C/G: C major (III chord), with G bass (second inversion). III is major in Dorian.
- Bm/A: B minor (ii chord), with A bass. ii is minor in Dorian.
- G6: G major (VII chord) with 6th (E). VII is major in Dorian.

All chords fit A Dorian mode perfectly:
- i: Am
- ii: Bm
- III: C
- iv: Dm (not present, but not needed)
- v: Em (not present)
- vi°: F#dim
- VII: G

The chord progression makes sense in Dorian:
- F#dim/A: vi°6 (first inversion) acting as a predominant, often leading to ii or V, but here it's used in a repetitive pattern over Am
- C/G: III (common in Dorian, gives the raised 6th color)
- Bm/A: ii
- G6: VII

Also note the G6 chord: G-B-D-E. In Dorian, the characteristic notes are major 6th (F#) and minor 7th (G). G6 includes E (5th) which is fine, but the 6th in G6 would be E? Wait no—G6 chord is G-B-D-E, so the "6" refers to E (6th above G). But in terms of scale, E is the 5th degree of A Dorian, so it's diatonic. The important thing is the G major chord (B natural) confirms the minor 7th (G natural), not G#.

Contrast with melodic minor: 
- Melodic minor ascending would have G#, so chords would include G#dim or E major, but here we have G major chord (G6), which requires G natural.

Therefore, the key is A minor, but the mode is Dorian.

Wait—is "key" A minor or A Dorian? In modern usage, we'd say the key is A minor but borrowing Dorian mode, or simply the key center is A with Dorian flavor. But technically, Dorian is a mode, not a key—keys are major or minor. Standard practice is to say "in A Dorian" meaning the mode is Dorian with tonic A.

Confirming with the bass notes:
- F#dim/A: A in bass (tonic) with F#dim chord — so the harmonic movement is tonic to vi°, but bass stays on A? In context, it's like Am7♭5 (since F#dim/A = A-C-E-G? Wait no: F#dim is F#-A-C, so F#dim/A is A-C-F# — that's A half-diminished 7th? A-C-E-G is Am7♭5, but here it's A-C-F#, which is missing the E. Actually F#dim/A is A-F#-C — which is the same as Dm7 without root? But in functional harmony, in A minor, F#dim is vii° of G, but here it's not resolving that way.

In Dorian context, it's straightforward: vi° chord (F#dim) functioning as a diatonic chord.

Another clue: The progression has no E major or E7 chord (which would be V in harmonic minor), and no G#dim. Instead, it uses G major and C major, which are characteristic of Dorian (and natural minor).

Conclusion: The key center is A, and the mode is Dorian.

Final answer should be: A Dorian mode.

But to be precise: 
- Key: A minor is the relative minor, but since it's modal, better to say "A Dorian" as the key/mode.

In music theory terms, we'd say the piece is in A Dorian.

### Key and Mode Analysis: **A Dorian**

#### **Progression Breakdown**  
Your chord progression:  
> **Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | C/G | Bm/A | Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | G6 | Am**

Let's analyze the **root movement** and **diatonic function** in the context of **A minor scales** (natural minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor) vs. **A Dorian mode** (a natural minor variant with a raised 6th).

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Tonic and Key Center**
- **Am (A-C-E)** appears **10 times** (including slash chords like `Bm/A` and `C/G`, which often emphasize Am as the tonal center).  
- **This confirms A as the tonic note** (the "home" chord).  
- The key is centered on **A minor**, but the *scale degrees* (e.g., F vs. F#) determine the **mode**.

---

### **Step 2: Diagnose Critical Chords (Why Dorian?)**
The progression contains **three chords that reveal the mode**:  
1. **`F#dim/A`** (appears 4 times)  
   - Root: **F#** (F#-A-C, with A in the bass).  
   - **F# is the raised 6th scale degree** (A natural minor uses F♮, not F#).  
   - In **A natural minor** (A-B-C-D-E-F-G), F# does *not* exist.  
   - In **A harmonic minor** (A-B-C-D-E-F-G#), F# isn't diatonic (it uses F♮).  
   - **A melodic minor** (ascending: A-B-C-D-E-F#-G#) includes F#, but its III chord is **Caug** (C-E-G#), **not C major** (as in your `C/G` chord).  

2. **`C/G`** (C major with G in the bass = **C-E-G**)  
   - **C major is the III chord** (requires **E natural**, **not E♭**).  
   - This chord **only works in A Dorian or A natural minor** (both have E natural).  

3. **`G6`** (G-B-D-E = **G major with added 6th**)  
   - Root: **G** (scale degree ♭7 in minor keys).  
   - **G major (VII chord) requires G natural**, not G# (which appears in harmonic/melodic minor).  
   - In A natural minor: G is diatonic (VII).  
   - In A Dorian: G is also diatonic (♭7).  

#### **Why A Dorian?**  
- **A Dorian scale: A-B-C-D-E-F#-G**  
  - Contains **F#** (for `F#dim`) and **G natural** (for `G6` and `C/G`).  
  - Diatonic chords:  
    - **i**: Am (tonic)  
    - **ii**: Bm (e.g., `Bm/A`)  
    - **III**: C major (e.g., `C/G`)  
    - **IV**: Dm (not present, but possible)  
    - **v**: Em (not present)  
    - **vi°**: F#dim (e.g., `F#dim/A`)  
    - **VII**: G major (e.g., `G6`)  

- **Why not other minor variants?**  
  | Mode          | 6th Degree | 7th Degree | Fixes `F#dim`? | Fixes `C/G`? | Fixes `G6`? |  
  |---------------|------------|------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|  
  | **A Dorian**  | **F#**     | **G**      | Yes (vi°)      | Yes (III)    | Yes (VII)   |  
  | A Natural Min | F          | G          | ❌ (no F#)      | Yes (III)    | Yes (VII)   |  
  | A Harmonic Min| F          | **G#**     | ❌ (no F#)      | ❌ (III = Caug)| ❌ (no G nat)|  
  | A Melodic Min | **F#**     | **G#**     | Yes (vi°)      | ❌ (III = Caug)| ❌ (no G nat)|  

- **The `F#dim` chord requires F#**, **`G6` requires G natural**, and **`C/G` requires C major** → **only A Dorian satisfies all three**.  
- **Melodic minor is ruled out** because it uses **G#** (e.g., G#dim or E major chords), but `G6` confirms G natural.  
- **Natural minor is ruled out** because it uses **F natural** (no `F#dim` chord).

---

### **Step 3: Functional Harmony in A Dorian**
- **`Am` (i)**: Tonic (safe harbor).  
- **`F#dim/A` (vi°)**: Chromatic predominant chord. In Dorian, this creates tension toward the tonic (common in jazzy/minor-key progressions).  
- **`C/G` (III)**: Bright, modal "lift" (characteristic of Dorian; sounds hopeful/mystical vs. natural minor's darker III+).  
- **`Bm/A` (ii)**: Subdominant function (leads to tonic).  
- **`G6` (VII)**: Sustained minor 7th (G), giving the Dorian "vibe" (e.g., "Scarborough Fair," "So What").  

> 💡 **Why does it sound "minor" but not "sad"?**  
> Dorian has a **minor 3rd (C)** like natural minor but a **major 6th (F#)** → brighter than natural minor. The F# in `F#dim/A` creates movement without the tension of harmonic minor's G#.

---

### **Final Answer**  
- **Key Center**: **A**  
- **Mode**: **Dorian**  
- **Full Identification**: **A Dorian**  

This progression is a **classic Dorian cadence**:  
> **i - vi° - i // i - III - ii - i // i - vi° - i // i - VII - i**  

#### Bonus: Genre Context  
- Common in **folk, jazz, rock, and film scores** (e.g., Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall," Santana's "Oye Como Va").  
- The **F#dim/A → Am** creates a smooth, descending bass line (A → A → G♯? Wait no—F#dim/A is A-C-F#, so bass stays on A with inner movement). Actually, the bass here often emphasizes A (as in `F#dim/A` and `Bm/A`), creating a **pedal point** effect common in Dorian.

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Progression:**
```
Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  C/G  Bm/A  
Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  G6  Am
```

We’ll break this down step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**.

---

### Step 1: List the Chords (with inversions)

We can simplify by writing the **root of each chord**, noting inversions:

- Am = A–C–E  
- F#dim/A = F#–A–C (diminished triad, with A in the bass) → chord quality: F#dim (F#–A–C)
- C/G = C–E–G (C major with G in bass)
- Bm/A = B–D–F# (B minor with A in bass)
- G6 = G–B–D–E (G major sixth)

So the roots are:
```
Am → Am → F#dim → F#dim → Am → Am → C → Bm  
Am → Am → F#dim → F#dim → Am → Am → G6 → Am
```

Even though some chords are inverted (bass note not root), we focus on **harmonic function** through roots and voice leading.

So the harmonic roots:
```
Am – Am – F#dim – F#dim – Am – Am – C – Bm  
Am – Am – F#dim – F#dim – Am – Am – G6 – Am
```

Final chords: G6 → Am

---

### Step 2: Determine Possible Key

Let’s look at the chords and see which key they fit into.

Chords used:
- Am (i)
- F#dim (commonly vii° in G major or G minor — since F#dim = F#–A–C)
- C (III in A minor, or V in F major, but here it fits A minor)
- Bm (ii in A minor)
- G6 (G–B–D–E) → G major with added 6th (E). G major is VII in A minor.

All of these chords are **diatonic to A natural minor**:

A natural minor scale: A B C D E F G

Chords in A natural minor:
- i: Am
- ii°: Bdim
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

Wait — we have **Bm**, not Bdim. That’s interesting.

Bm is **B–D–F#**, which includes **F#**, but **F# is not in A natural minor** (which has F natural).

So **Bm suggests F#**, which implies either:
- A **harmonic minor** scale (which raises the 7th: G → G#)
- But harmonic A minor has **E major** (V) and **E°**, not Bm

Hold on.

Bm = B–D–F# → F# is the key clue.

F# is not in A natural minor or A harmonic minor (which has G#, not F#).

Wait — F# is the 7th scale degree in G major.

Let’s consider: **F#dim chord** = F#–A–C

- F#dim is the **vii° chord in G major**.
- Am is the **ii chord in G major**
- C is the **IV chord in G major**
- Bm is the **iii chord in G major**
- G6 is **I6 in G major**

Wait — G6 is G–B–D–E → fits G major (I chord with 6th)

Now check G major scale: G A B C D E F#

Chords in G major:
- I: G
- ii: Am
- iii: Bm
- IV: C
- V: D
- vi: Em
- vii°: F#dim

Perfect!

Now map the chords:

- Am → ii
- F#dim → vii°
- C → IV
- Bm → iii
- G6 → I (with added 6th)

So the progression:
```
Am   Am   F#dim/A   F#dim/A   Am   Am   C/G   Bm/A  
ii   ii   vii°/A     vii°/A     ii   ii   IV/G   iii/A

Am   Am   F#dim/A   F#dim/A   Am   Am   G6    Am
ii   ii   vii°/A     vii°/A     ii   ii   I6    ii
```

The final chord is **Am**, but the penultimate chord is **G6**, which is **I in G major**.

So the progression ends on **Am (ii)**, but moves from **I (G6)** to **ii (Am)** — not a perfect cadence.

However, the **F#dim** leading to Am? That’s unusual because F#dim usually leads to G (tonic), not Am.

But here F#dim/A goes to Am — so F#dim is functioning as a **passing chord** or **deceptive resolution**, or perhaps as a secondary leading-tone chord to **G**.

But the presence of **F#dim**, **C**, **Bm**, **G**, and **Am** — all diatonic to **G major** — is compelling.

But why does it end on **Am**?

Let’s look at the **bass line**:

Bass notes:
- A, A, A, A, A, A, G, A  
- A, A, A, A, A, A, G, A

So: mostly **A** in the bass, with **G** before the final Am.

So the bass emphasizes **A**, suggesting **A** might be the tonic.

But the chords from G major center around **G**.

This is characteristic of a **mode** of G major.

Which mode starts on A?

**Dorian mode**.

G major: G A B C D E F#

A Dorian: A B C D E F# G → same notes.

So **A Dorian** uses:
- i: Am
- ii: Bm
- III+: C? Wait — C major is III, but not augmented.

A Dorian scale: A B C D E F# G

Chords:
- i: Am (A–C–E)
- ii: Bm (B–D–F#)
- III: C (C–E–G)
- IV: D (D–F#–A) — but we don’t have D
- v: Em (E–G–B) — not used
- VI: F#dim? No — F#–A–C♯ — wait no

F# in A Dorian: F#–A–C — A and C are in A Dorian, but C is **C natural**, not C#.

F#–A–C → that’s **F# diminished**, but in A Dorian, the chord on F# would be **F#dim**, yes: F#–A–C (since C is natural in A Dorian? Wait — no!)

Wait!

A Dorian: A B C D E F# G

So:
- F# note is present
- A is present
- C is **C natural**, present

So F# + A + C = F#–A–C → **F#dim** ✅ — yes, **vii° chord in A Dorian**

So in A Dorian:
- i: Am
- ii: Bm
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

Wait — but **F#dim** is not diatonic to A Dorian, because the sixth degree is F#, so chord on F# would use notes from the scale:

F#–A–C — A and C are in A Dorian, and **F# is in**, C is **natural**, so yes — F#–A–C = **F#dim** — that’s **vii°**, which exists in A Dorian.

But in A Dorian, the **VI chord** should be **F major** (F–A–C), but here we have **G6** — G–B–D–E → G major with E (6th). G major is **VII** in A Dorian.

But **F major** (VI) is not used — instead we have **G**.

Also, the **IV chord** in A Dorian is D minor — we don’t have Dm.

But we **do** have: Am, F#dim, C, Bm, G — all diatonic to A Dorian?

Let’s check:

- Am = i → ✅
- F#dim = vii° → F#–A–C → all in A Dorian → ✅
- C = III → C–E–G → E and G are in A Dorian → ✅
- Bm = ii → B–D–F# → D and F# are in → ✅
- G = VII → G–B–D → B and D are in → G6 adds E (6th), which is also in → ✅

So yes — **all chords are diatonic to A Dorian** (2nd mode of G major).

Now, the progression emphasizes **Am** throughout, ends on **Am**, and uses **G6 → Am** at the end — a **plagal cadence** (VII–i), typical in Dorian mode.

Also, the **F#dim/A** is used as a passing chord — likely voice leading from A down to Am via diminished color.

So even though it uses chords from **G major**, the **tonic center is A minor**, and the raised sixth (F#) instead of F natural confirms it's **not natural minor**, which would have F natural.

In A natural minor: A B C D E F G → would have Bdim, not Bm

But here we have **Bm**, which requires F#, so **F# confirms Dorian mode**.

Also, **F#dim** uses F#, present in Dorian.

---

### Final Analysis:

- **Tonic chord**: Am (heard as home)
- **Raised sixth degree**: F# (from Bm and F#dim)
- **Avoids F natural** — no chord requires it
- **Features VII–i cadence** (G → Am), typical Dorian
- All chords diatonic to **A Dorian**

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

**Key: A**  
**Mode: Dorian**

So the progression is in **A Dorian**.

---

### Bonus: Relation to G major

A Dorian is the **2nd mode of G major**, so it uses the same key signature (one sharp: F#), but centers on A.

**Answer: Key — A, Mode — Dorian** ✅

### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by listing out all the chords to see what I'm working with.

First, Am – that's A minor. Then F#dim/A, which is an A diminished chord with A in the bass. Wait, F#dim/A. Diminished chords are usually built on the seventh scale degree, but here it's written with A as the bass note. Let me recall: F#dim is F#-A-C, and when it's F#dim/A, that means A is the lowest note. So the chord would be A, C, F#? But typically, diminished chords are written with the root being the diminished note. So F#dim is F#-A-C, so F#dim/A would still have the notes F#, A, C but with A as the bass note. So the actual notes are A, C, F#.

Next is C/G. C major chord with G in the bass. So G, C, E. Then Bm/A – B minor chord with A bass. B, D, F# with A as the lowest note. Then G6 – G major with a 6th added, so G, B, D, E. And then back to Am.

Let me list all the chords in terms of their notes:

- Am: A, C, E
- F#dim/A: A, C, F# (since F#dim is F#-A-C, bass A makes it A, C, F#)
- C/G: G, C, E
- Bm/A: A, B, D, F#? Wait, Bm is B, D, F#. So Bm/A with A bass – notes are A, B, D, F#? That's a bit odd because typically a chord won't have five notes. Maybe Bm/A means the bass is A, so the notes are A, B, D, F#. But that might be a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, sometimes chords like that are just Bm but with A in the bass, so the actual notes for Bm/A would be A (bass), B, D, F#. So four notes.

G6: G, B, D, E.

So let's list all chords with their notes:

1. Am: A, C, E
2. Am: A, C, E
3. F#dim/A: A, C, F#
4. F#dim/A: A, C, F#
5. Am: A, C, E
6. Am: A, C, E
7. C/G: G, C, E
8. Bm/A: A, B, D, F#
9. Am: A, C, E
10. Am: A, C, E
11. F#dim/A: A, C, F#
12. F#dim/A: A, C, F#
13. Am: A, C, E
14. Am: A, C, E
15. G6: G, B, D, E
16. Am: A, C, E

Now, looking at all the notes involved:

A, C, E from Am – that's the A minor triad.

F#dim/A has A, C, F# – so F# is a note here.

C/G: G, C, E – so G is present.

Bm/A: A, B, D, F# – so B, D, F# and A bass.

G6: G, B, D, E.

So the notes used are A, B, C, D, E, F#, G.

Let me see if that fits into a key. The note F# is present, which is sharp. So if we look at A minor natural: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#? No. Wait, natural minor has F natural, but here we have F#, so maybe harmonic minor? Let's check.

A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G# – but wait, harmonic minor has raised 7th, so G#? Wait, no. For A minor, natural minor is A B C D E F G. Harmonic minor is A B C D E F G# – yes. But in our chords, we have F# and G? Wait, looking at the chords: we have F# (from F#dim and Bm), and G is present in C/G and G6. But F# is present, but in A minor harmonic, the 6th is F#? Wait, no. Let's list the notes in A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G# – wait, no. Wait, harmonic minor raises the 7th, so for A minor, the 7th is G, so raised to G#. So A, B, C, D, E, F, G# – so the notes would be A, B, C, D, E, F, G#.

But in our progression, we have F#? Wait, F# is a note here. Let's check: the F#dim chord has F#, and Bm/A has F# as the fifth of B minor. So F# is in there. Also, G is present.

But A harmonic minor has G# not G. So if we have G natural, that doesn't fit harmonic minor. Maybe natural minor? But natural minor has F natural. But here we have F# in the chords – for example, F#dim is F#-A-C. So the F# is there. So F# is present, so natural minor (A minor natural has F natural), so maybe not. Let's check the key of A minor with some alterations.

Wait, let's list all the notes used: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G.

So those notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Now, what key has all these notes? Let's think in terms of major keys.

If it's a major key, the notes would be a major scale. Let's see: if the key is G major, that's G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. Yes! That's exactly the notes: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

G major: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

Yes. The notes are G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

So all the chords have notes from G major. But the progression starts with Am, which is the ii chord in G major.

Let's check the chords in G major:

I: G

ii: Am

iii: Bm

IV: C

V: D

vi: Em

vii°: F#dim

Yes! So F#dim is the vii° chord in G major.

Looking at the progression:

Am (ii), then F#dim/A (which is F#dim with A bass – in G major, F#dim is vii°, and A is the third of the chord. So F#dim/A is the same as F#dim but with A in bass).

C/G would be IV with G in bass – so the I chord? No, wait. C is IV, and C/G is IV with G bass. But G is the root of I.

Wait, the chords in G major:

G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), F#dim (vii°).

Now, the progression: Am (ii), Am (ii), F#dim/A (vii° with A bass), F#dim/A, then Am, Am, then C/G (which is C chord but bass G – so IV with 5th in bass), Bm/A (Bm with A bass, which is iii with root A? Bm is iii, so Bm/A would be iii with A bass).

Wait, but in the context of G major, let's see the function.

G major key:

- Am: ii

- F#dim: vii°

- C: IV

- Bm: iii

- G6: G is I, but G6 would be I6? No, G6 is G, B, D, E. In G major, G major chord is G-B-D; adding the 6th E, so G6.

Now, the progression starts with Am, then Am, then F#dim/A, etc. So mostly Am, F#dim, C, Bm, G6.

So if the key is G major, the chords fit. Let's check the bass notes as well.

Another thing to consider: the mode. Since it's starting on Am, perhaps it's in A Aeolian (natural minor) but wait, A natural minor would have F natural, but here F# is present. So in A natural minor, the chord vii° would be F#dim? Wait, no. A natural minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So the v chord is E minor, or Eo? Wait, the seventh scale degree in A natural minor is G natural. So the vii° chord would be G diminished: G, Bb, Db. But in our progression, we have F#dim, which is F#-A-C, which isn't part of A natural minor.

But in A harmonic minor, the notes are A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. So the vii° would be G#dim. Let's check: G#, B, D. But our chord is F#dim: F#, A, C. So that's not matching.

But in G major, F#dim is the vii° chord: in G major, scale notes G A B C D E F#; so seventh degree is F#, so F# diminished triad (F#, A, C), which is the F#dim. So that fits. Then the ii chord is Am (A, C, E), which is in G major.

So the key is G major. But the progression centers around Am, so it's perhaps in a mode? Let's see. If the song is using a G major scale but starting on A, that's A Aeolian? Wait, A Aeolian is A B C D E F G; but in G major, the notes are G A B C D E F#. A Aeolian would have F natural, but G major has F#. Wait, no. A Aeolian as the relative minor of C major would have A, B, C, D, E, F, G. But G major is G A B C D E F#. So A Aeolian (natural minor) would have no F#; it would have F natural. So if the key is G major, then the natural minor of G major would be E minor. So perhaps this progression is in G major, but starting Am. So maybe it's in Mixolydian or something else? Wait, no.

Wait, let's look at the scale. If the progression is using notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F# (which is exactly G major), then the key is G major. However, the tonic seems to be Am? But Am is not the tonic of G major; G is the tonic.

But sometimes songs are in a different mode. For example, if the progression emphasizes Am, maybe it's in A Dorian? Let's check A Dorian: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Yes! That's exactly the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. So the scale here is A Dorian. Because A Dorian is the second mode of G major. So the notes of G major scale, but starting on A.

So in A Dorian: A B C D E F# G. So the scale has F# and G natural, which matches.

Now, in A Dorian, the chords:

i: Am (A, C, E)

ii: Bm (B, D, F#)

iii: C (C, E, G)

IV: D (D, F#, A)

v: Em (E, G, B)

vi: F#dim (F#, A, C)

vii: G (G, B, D)

Yes. So in A Dorian, the chords:

Am (i), Bm (ii), C (III), D (IV), Em (v), F#dim (vi), G (VII).

So our progression:

Am (i), F#dim/A (vi with A bass), C/G (C chord with G bass – which would be the III in A Dorian), Bm/A (Bm with A bass – Bm is ii, so Bm/A is ii with A in bass), G6 (G major with added 6th. G is VII chord in A Dorian, and G6 would be G-B-D-E, which is VII with 6th).

So if the key is A Dorian, that would fit. Let's check the function.

The progression has Am as the main chord, and F#dim is vi (but in A Dorian, F#dim is vi, which is a diminished chord). But F#dim in A Dorian: F# is scale degree vi (since A Dorian: A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F# (6), G (7)). So F# is 6, so the chord on 6 is F#dim, yes.

In the progression, we also have C/G. C is chord III in A Dorian. C/G would have G as bass, so the bass is G, which is the 7th scale degree. And in terms of A Dorian, the chord C is built on 3rd degree, which is a major chord. So C/G is C with 5th in bass.

Similarly, Bm/A: Bm is ii chord in A Dorian, and with A bass, so it's ii chord with root bass? No: Bm is B-D-F#, so with A bass, it's A-B-D-F#, which is a Bm chord but with A in bass. In terms of A Dorian, the A bass would be the root of the key, so maybe it's emphasizing the root.

G6: G is VII chord, and adding E as 6th would be G6. In A Dorian, VII is a major chord (G major), so G6 is G-B-D-E. Yes.

Now, comparing to G major: the same set of notes. So the key could be G major, but the song is centered on A. So if the tonic is A, then it's in A Dorian mode, because Dorian mode has root A, with the characteristic minor third (C), raised sixth (F#), and natural seventh (G). Yes.

In A Dorian, the 6th note (F#) and 7th (G) are both natural. Whereas natural minor (Aeolian) would have F natural and G natural. But here F# is present, so Aeolian wouldn't fit.

Lydian would have F#, but raised fourth. But the fourth in A Dorian is D, which is natural. In A Lydian, it's A B C# D# E F# G#, so not matching.

So probably A Dorian mode.

Another thing: in G major, the dominant chord is D major (V), but in our progression, there's no D chord. Let's check the chords listed: Am, F#dim, C, Bm, G6 – no D chord. But that's okay, not all chords need to be present. However, in Dorian mode, the VII chord (G major) is major, which in natural minor would be minor.

For example, in A Aeolian (natural minor), the VII chord is G major? No: A Aeolian is A B C D E F G, so the VII chord is G major? Wait, G major chord would be G B D. In A Aeolian scale: degrees are A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F (6), G (7). So chord on VII is G major? Wait, yes. Wait, but in A natural minor, the VII chord is G major, which is a major chord. But the problem is that A Aeolian has F natural, but in our progression, there is F# present. For example Bm chord in A Aeolian would be B, D, F, but in our progression, it's Bm/A which has an F# in it? Wait, no. Bm chord in A Aeolian: B, D, F. But in our chord Bm/A, the notes are A, B, D, F#? Because Bm chord is B, D, F#, right? Because F# is the fifth. Wait! That's the key point. B minor chord is always B-D-F#, regardless of the key. So if the chord is Bm, it necessarily has F#. So that means the key must have F# in it. So A Aeolian only has F natural, so if Bm is present (B, D, F#), then F# is required. So A Aeolian won't work because F natural in A Aeolian. But Bm has F# fifth, so yes, so the scale must have F#.

Similarly, F#dim chord implies there's F# in the scale. So A Aeolian has only F natural, so it can't have F#dim or Bm. So that rules out A Aeolian.

A harmonic minor would have G# and F natural. A Harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#... So Bm chord would be B, D, F natural? But no: Bm is B, D, F#? Wait, no. If the scale has F natural, then the F in Bm chord would be F natural. But Bm chord in harmonic minor might be different. Wait, harmonic minor has F natural, so the triad built on B would be B, D, F (since 7th degree is G#?), no. Let's see: A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. So scale degrees:

1 A, 2 B, 3 C, 4 D, 5 E, 6 F, 7 G#.

So chord on ii: B, D, F – which is a diminished chord (Bdim), because third is D, fifth is F which is minor third from D. Wait, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, so yes, Bdim. But in our progression, we have Bm (B minor), which is B, D, F# – which is a minor chord. But if F is natural, then it would be Bdim. But here the chord is listed as Bm/A, which implies it's a B minor chord, so B, D, F#. So F# must be present. Therefore, harmonic minor won't fit because it has F natural.

Therefore, the only possibility is A Dorian, because A Dorian has F# (scale degree 6), so B minor chord is B, D, F# (since in A Dorian, 6th is F#), which works.

Yes. A Dorian scale: A B C D E F# G. So B is scale degree 2, D is 4, F# is 6. So the triad on B is B, D, F# – Bm. Yes, minor triad. F#dim chord (F#, A, C) is the chord on scale degree 6: F#-A-C (diminished, since F# to A is minor third, A to C is minor third).

G major chord is G, B, D – which in A Dorian is the VII chord, major.

C major chord is C, E, G – which in A Dorian, scale degree III is C.

C/G is C chord with G bass – G is the 7th scale degree.

So all fit. And the song starts with Am (i chord), so the tonic is A. In Dorian mode, the tonic is minor because the 3rd is minor (C natural).

So key would be A minor, but with raised 6th, so Dorian mode. So the key is A Dorian.

Alternatively, some people might consider the key to be G major, and the song is in G major but with a lot of A minor (ii chord), but since the progression centers around Am and the tonic feels like Am (as the first and last chords are Am), it's probably A Dorian.

Let's see the typical cadences. In Dorian mode, common cadences would be i - VII (Am to G major), which is part of the progression. In the progression here, we have G6, which is similar to G major.

Another thing: the F#dim chord – in Dorian mode, the diminished chord is on the vi scale degree. F#dim as the vi chord.

In G major, F#dim is vii°, so in G major the V chord is D major. But in our progression, there is no D major chord. Instead, we have G chord, which would be V in C major, but not relevant here.

But in A Dorian, the chord progression has Am (i), C (III), F#dim (vi), Bm (ii), G major (VII). The G major chord is a characteristic Dorian chord, since in natural minor, VII chord would be G major as well? Wait, no. In A natural minor (Aeolian), VII chord is G major? Wait: natural minor A, B, c, D, E, F, G. So the chord on G is G-B-D, which is G major. Wait, so in both A Aeolian and A Dorian, the VII chord is G major. But the difference between Aeolian and Dorian is the sixth degree: Aeolian has F natural, Dorian has F#.

Ah, yes. So the key indicator is the sixth scale degree. Since Bm chord uses F# (as the fifth), and the F#dim chord is F#, A, C. So the F# is present. In A Aeolian, the sixth is F natural, so Bm chord would be B, D, F natural, which would be a diminished chord (Bdim), but the progression lists Bm, which is minor (so B, D, F#), so must be F#. Therefore, it's not Aeolian; Aeolian would have Bdim, but we have Bm.

So A Dorian has the raised sixth (F#), which allows for Bm chord.

Therefore, the key is A minor with the six scale degree raised, which is Dorian mode.

So key: A Dorian.

Alternatively, sometimes people just say the key is "A minor, Dorian mode" or just "Dorian mode on A".

Another check: C/G. C chord is the III chord in A Dorian. But in terms of function, C is a major chord built on the third scale degree. In A Dorian, yes.

G6: in A Dorian, the VII chord is G major, so G6 is just a dominant chord without the dominant function? In minor modes, the VII chord is major. So in Dorian, it's a common progression to go from Am to G major.

For example, "Scarborough Fair" has a Dorian sound.

So yes, the key is A Dorian.

So to answer: the key is A minor, but the mode is Dorian. So the key signature would be the same as G major, but the tonic is A and it has a raised sixth (F# instead of F natural).

So the final answer is key A Dorian.

Wait, but key signatures: G major has one sharp, F#. So A Dorian has exactly the same key signature (one sharp), but the tonal center is A, not G.

So the key is A Dorian, which uses the key signature of G major (F#).

Yes.

So to put it in words: the key is A Dorian (minor scale with natural sixth and seventh). Wait, no: in Dorian mode, the sixth is raised compared to Aeolian. Aeolian has flat sixth compared to Dorian. So A Dorian: 1A 2B 3c 4D 5E 6F# 7G.

Yes.

So conclusion: key is A Dorian.

Another way to check: the chord progression ends on Am. The last chord is Am. The progression starts and ends with Am.

Also, the G6 chord – while G major in G major is I, but in A Dorian, it's VII. So if the music feels like it's resolving to A, then A Dorian.

Yes.

So I think that's it.

The chord progression **Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am** is in **A Dorian mode**.

### Analysis:
1. **Chords and Notes**:  
   - All chords use notes from the **G major scale** (G, A, B, C, D, E, F♯):  
     - Am (A, C, E)  
     - F#dim/A (A, C, F♯)  
     - C/G (G, C, E)  
     - Bm/A (A, B, D, F♯)  
     - G6 (G, B, D, E)  
   - The consistent presence of **F♯** (not Fnatural) and the structure of chords like **Bm** (B, D, F♯) and **F#dim** (F♯, A, C) rules out natural minor (Aeolian), which would have Fnatural instead of F♯.

2. **Modal Characteristics**:  
   - **A Dorian** mode = A, B, C, D, E, F♯, G.  
     - **Raised 6th** (F♯) compared to natural minor (Aeolian) – this is the defining feature of Dorian.  
     - Minor tonic chord (**Am** = A–C–E) with a **major 2nd (B)** and **major 6th (F♯)**.  
   - The progression centers on **Am** (the i chord in Dorian), not G major (the root of the parent major scale). The final chord is **Am**, emphasizing it as the tonal center.  

3. **Chord Functions in A Dorian**:  
   - **Am** (i) = tonic  
   - **F#dim/A** (vi°) = diminished chord on scale degree 6  
   - **C/G** (III with G bass) = major chord built on scale degree 3  
   - **Bm/A** (ii) = minor chord built on scale degree 2  
   - **G6** (VII) = major chord built on scale degree 7 (a hallmark of Dorian)  

4. **Why Not G Major?**  
   - While the key signature (one sharp: F♯) matches G major, the progression **centers on Am**, not G.  
   - In G major, Am would be the ii chord, but here it functions as the **tonic** (first/last chords are Am), which is more characteristic of **Dorian mode** (where the ii chord becomes the tonic in a Dorian context).  
   - G major would typically feature stronger pull to G (e.g., V–I cadence like D–G), but this progression uses **G (VII)** as a resolution chord to Am (i), not G (I) as the tonic.  

### Conclusion:
- **Key**: A minor (tonal center is A)  
- **Mode**: **Dorian** (due to the F♯ in the scale and minor tonic chord with a raised 6th).  
- **Key Signature**: G major (one sharp: F♯).  

This is a classic Dorian sound (e.g., "Scarborough Fair," "Oye Como Va"), where the natural 6th (F♯) creates a brighter minor flavor compared to natural minor (Aeolian). The progression revolves around Am as the home chord, with G6 (VII) and F#dim (vi°) providing characteristic Dorian colors.

To determine the **key** and **mode** of the chord progression:

```

---

### Step 1: List the chords and their roots (with bass notes if specified)

Let’s write out each chord in root position for analysis, noting the bass note when specified:

1. **Am** – A minor (A-C-E)
2. **Am**
3. **F#dim/A** – F# diminished triad (F#-A-C) with **A in bass** → this is **A diminished 6th** (A C F#), functionally a **first-inversion F#dim**
4. **F#dim/A** – same as above
5. **Am**
6. **Am**
7. **C/G** – C major (C-E-G) with **G in bass** → G-C-E → sounds like G6 or C/G (C major first inversion)
8. **Bm/A** – B minor (B-D-F#) with **A in bass** → A-B-D-F# → this is **A major 7th flat 5?** Wait, no — let’s think functionally.
    - A-B-D-F# → this is actually an **A7#5** or **A7+**?  
    But note: Bm/A is **B minor over A**, so the notes are A, B, D, F# — this is the same as **A major 7th chord without the 5th?** — wait, **A major 7th is A-C#-E-G#** — that’s not it.

Wait — let’s do this properly.

### Think in terms of **scale tones** and **functional harmony**

Let’s assume the key is **A minor** (natural minor, Aeolian) as a starting point.

Chords in **A natural minor (Aeolian)**:
- i: Am
- ii°: Bdim
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

But we have:
- **F#dim** — that’s NOT in A natural minor.
- **C/G** — possible (C major, which is III in A minor)
- **Bm/A** — B minor over A — this is unusual.
- **G6** — G major 6th (G-B-D-E) — G is VII in A minor, but G6 adds E, which is the 6th — E is in A minor (A natural minor has F#? Wait! A natural minor is: A, B, C, D, E, F, G → **no F#**)

Wait — here’s the critical clue:

### We have **F#dim** — that implies **F# is a note**, which is **NOT** in A natural minor (which has F natural).

So if **F# is present**, then we are likely in **A harmonic minor** or **A melodic minor**.

Let’s explore **A harmonic minor**:

**A harmonic minor scale**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G#  
→ Chords built on each scale degree:

1. Am (i)
2. Bdim (ii°)
3. C+ (III+) — C-E-G# — augmented!
4. Dm (iv)
5. E (V) — major! (E-G#-B) ← this is crucial
6. F#dim (vi°) — **F#-A-C** ← HERE IT IS!
7. G#dim (vii°) — G#-B-D — but we have **G** (not G#) in the last chord

Wait — we have **G6**, not G#dim.

G6 = G-B-D-E — that’s a **G major 6** chord, which contains **B and E** — both in A harmonic minor?  
A harmonic minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G# → so **G natural is NOT in the scale!**  
We have **G#**, not G.

So G6 (containing G natural) is **not diatonic** to A harmonic minor.

But we also have **Bm/A** — let’s check that.

### Bm/A = A-B-D-F# — notes: A, B, D, F#

Let’s see if these notes fit a known scale.

A, B, C, D, E, F#, G# → **A melodic minor ascending**!

**A melodic minor ascending**: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#  
Descending: A, G, F, E, D, C, B — but we’re not descending.

So in **ascending melodic minor**, we have:
- F# (6th)
- G# (7th)

But our chord has:
- **F#dim/A** → F#, A, C — F# is in melodic minor
- **G6** → G, B, D, E — G natural is NOT in ascending melodic minor — we have G#!

So again, we have **G natural** — which is only in **A natural minor**, but then we have **F#** — which is not in natural minor.

### So we have both:
- **F#** → suggests harmonic or melodic minor
- **G natural** → suggests natural minor

This is **mixing modes** — classical harmony often does this: **use harmonic minor for the dominant (v) but keep natural minor elsewhere**.

But here, we have **G6**, not G#dim.

Let’s look at the **G6 chord**.  
G6 = G-B-D-E → this is the same as **E minor 7th without the root**?  
E minor 7th: E-G-B-D — so G6 = G-B-D-E = same notes as **Em7**!  
Yes — **G6 = Em7 (inversion)**

So **G6** might be **functioning as Em7**, which is the **vii chord in A major**, or **iio in G major**, but let’s think again.

### Let's look for the **tonic** and **cadence**

The progression ends on **Am**.  
So **Am** is the tonal center.

We have a lot of **Am**, then **F#dim/A**, then **C/G**, **Bm/A**, then **G6**, then resolution to **Am**.

Let’s analyze the last 4 chords:

**C/G → Bm/A → G6 → Am**

- C/G = G major triad with C in bass → G-C-E → **C major over G** — this is **C major, first inversion**, or **G6?** No, G6 is G-B-D-E.

Wait — our chord is written as **C/G**, meaning **C major chord with G in bass** → so inversion: **C major 1st inversion**.

Then **Bm/A**: B minor triad with A in bass → A-B-D-F#

Then **G6**: G-B-D-E

Then **Am**

### Let’s consider this as a **vii° - I - IV - V - i** kind of thing… but we don’t have a strong V chord.

Wait — **F#dim** is **vi°** in A minor — it’s a common chord in harmonic minor.

And in harmonic minor, vi° is **F#dim**, and **V is E major** — but we don’t have E major. We have **G6**.

G6 could be **borrowed from A major**? A major has #4, #5, #7 — G# is #7.

G natural is **not** in A major.

Wait — here’s a better fit:

### What if the key is **C major**?

C major: C, D, E, F, G, A, B  
Chords:
- i: Am? No — Am is vi
- ii: Bm
- III: C
- iv: Dm
- v: Em
- VI: F
- VII: G

We have:
- Am (vi)
- F#dim — not in C major! (F# isn’t in C major)
- C/G — C major with G bass? Yes, C major is I
- Bm/A — B minor over A — Bm is ii, A = - not a chord tone? A is the 6th of C — so Bm/A is like a D/F# — not standard
- G6 — G major 6 — G is VII in C major

But we have **F#dim** — again, not in C major.

F# is a chromatic note.

### The problem: **F#dim** is **the only non-diatonic chord** that’s repeated, so it’s the key indicator.

F#dim = F#-A-C

In **A minor**, what does this chord function as?

Answer: In **A harmonic minor**, **F#dim** is the **vi° chord** — it’s diatonic!

So **F#dim is vi° in A harmonic minor**.

Now what about **G6**?

G6 = G-B-D-E

In **A harmonic minor**, the scale is: A-B-C-D-E-F-G#

So G is **not** in the scale — we have **G#**, not G.

So **G6** is a **borrowed chord** — most likely from **A natural minor**.

So we have **both A natural minor** and **A harmonic minor** modes used.

This is very common in pop/rock/classical music: use the **leading tone G# in the dominant**, but use **G natural** for modal color.

BUT — we don’t have a **G# chord** at all! We have **G6** — a **G major 6** chord.

So perhaps **G natural** is being used as the **bVII chord** — borrowed from **A Dorian** or **A Phrygian**?

Wait — let’s consider **A Dorian**:

A Dorian: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G# — again G#.

Same problem.

A **A natural minor** (Aeolian) has G natural — and we get G natural in G6.

But natural minor has F natural — we have **F#** in F#dim.

So we have **F#** from harmonic minor, and **G natural** from natural minor.

This is **modal mixture** or **borrowing**.

It’s not strictly in one mode — it's in **A minor**, with **borrowed chords from harmonic and natural minors**.

But the **tonic is clearly A**, and **Am** is the home chord.

And the most important chromatic note is **F#** — which is the **raised 6th** — hallmark of **harmonic minor**.

So the **key** is **A minor**, and the **mode is primarily harmonic minor**, but with **borrowed G natural** from natural minor.

The G6 chord is likely a **modal mixture** chord — borrowed from **A natural minor**, where G is the natural 7th.

In harmonic minor, the 7th is G#, but you often downgrade it to G natural for intermediate chords to avoid the tritone or for color.

So overall:

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key**: **A minor**  
**Mode**: **Primarily A harmonic minor**, but with **borrowed elements from A natural minor** (especially the G natural in G6 chord).

The presence of **F#dim (vi°)** validates the harmonic minor scale, while **G6 (bVII)** is a common modal interchange from natural minor.

These kinds of progressions are **very common in pop, rock, and film music** — a blend of harmonic and natural minor modes.

> So, **key = A minor**, **mode = harmonic minor with natural minor borrowing**.

In common terminology — we’d just say **A minor** and not overthink the mode, but since the question asks for **mode**, the best labeled answer is:

> **Key: A minor  
> Mode: Harmonic minor (with modal mixture of natural minor)**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**  
Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  C/G  Bm/A  
Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  G6  Am

### Step 1: Identify the tonal center
- The progression begins and ends on **Am**.
- **Am** appears frequently and feels like a point of rest.
- This strongly suggests **A minor** as the tonal center.

### Step 2: Determine the key signature / scale
In **natural A minor**, the notes are:  
**A B C D E F G**

Let’s look at the chords used:

- **Am** = A–C–E → fits A natural minor ✅  
- **F#dim** = F#–A–C → includes **F#**, which is **not** in natural A minor (which has F natural) ❌  
- **C/G** = C–E–G (with G in bass) → C major chord, which is the **♭III** in A minor – common in minor keys ✅  
- **Bm/A** = B–D–F# (with A in bass) → contains **F#** again ❌  
- **G6** = G–B–D–E → G major with added 6th (E); G major is the **♭VII** in A minor ✅  
  - But note: **B natural** appears in G6? No—G6 is G–B–D–E → that **B** is **B natural**, which *is* in A natural minor ✅

Wait—**F#dim** introduces **F#**, and **Bm** introduces **F#** as well (since Bm = B–D–F#).

So where does **F#** come from?

In **A harmonic minor**: A B C D E F G#  
→ No F#

In **A melodic minor (ascending)**: A B C D E F# G#  
→ Yes, **F# and G#**

But we **don’t see G#** anywhere in the chords:
- Am (no G#)
- F#dim = F#–A–C (no G#)
- C/G = C–E–G (G natural)
- Bm/A = B–D–F# (no G#)
- G6 = G–B–D–E (G natural again)

So **G# is absent** – that rules out harmonic and melodic minor (in its ascending form).

However, **F#** appears consistently, suggesting the **Dorian mode**.

### Step 3: Consider A Dorian
**A Dorian** = A B C D E F# G

Compare with chords:

- **Am** = A–C–E → ✅  
- **F#dim** = F#–A–C → all notes in A Dorian ✅  
- **Bm** = B–D–F# → B Dorian chord (ii in A Dorian) ✅  
- **C/G** = C major → this is the **♭III** in A Dorian? Wait—C major = C–E–G  
  - In A Dorian: C is the **♭III degree**, and C major is diatonic to A Dorian?  
    - A Dorian notes: A B C D E F# G  
    - C major = C E G → all present → ✅  
- **G6** = G–B–D–E → G is the **VII** chord in A Dorian; G major is diatonic (G–B–D), and E is the 6th → ✅

So **all chords fit A Dorian**:
- **Am** = i  
- **F#dim** = vii°  
- **Bm** = ii  
- **C** = ♭III  
- **G** = VII

And we **never use G#**, so it’s not harmonic or melodic minor.

### Conclusion:
- **Key center**: A  
- **Mode**: **Dorian**  
- **Key/mode**: **A Dorian**

This is a classic modal progression in **A Dorian**, using characteristic chords like **F#dim** (vii°) and **Bm** (ii), and avoiding the leading tone (G#) that would imply A minor (tonal) harmony.

✅ **Answer: A Dorian**

**Exploring the Harmonic Structure**

I'm currently dissecting the chord progression. The diminished chords and inversions immediately caught my ear. The use of bass notes other than the root, such as the A in the F#dim, creates interesting voice leading. I'm focusing on the relationship between the root notes, trying to identify any underlying patterns or tonal centers. The shift to C/G and Bm/A offers a fascinating contrast.


**Dissecting Chord Voicings**

I'm now carefully examining the C/G and Bm/A chords. Initially, the Bm/A seemed out of place. However, given the context, I'm analyzing the voicing, potentially a typo as previously suspected. The bass note, particularly within the diminished context, is key. Re-evaluating the role of the G6 chord and its connection to the overall structure.


**Determining the Overall Tonality**

I'm now integrating the harmonic analysis with the identified tonal center. The consistent Am anchoring the progression confirms A as the tonic. I'm focusing on the melodic minor implications, especially the role of F# and G6. The non-diatonic elements, like F#dim/A, become clear. The presence of G6 further suggests melodic minor influence.


**Revisiting Chord Choices**

I'm now revisiting the initial analysis of Bm/A and C/G. I'm focusing on the voice leading, particularly how F# and G6 interact. The function of these chords in the context of the Am tonic and F#dim becomes clearer. I'm re-evaluating the possibility of a typo. The G6 chord is now suggesting more complex harmonic movement.


**Refining Mode and Key**

I've clarified the mode, now confident it's A Dorian. I'm focusing on the G6 chord, realizing it functions as the bVII in A Dorian, providing further evidence. The analysis is complete, establishing the key and mode with precision.




The key is **A**.
The mode is **Dorian**.

### Analysis:

1.  **Tonic Identification:** The progression starts and ends on **Am** and Am is the most frequent chord, establishing the tonic center as **A**.

2.  **Minor Quality:** The first chord (Am) and the presence of C major (III) confirms a minor key/mode.

3.  **Mode Differentiation (Aeolian vs. Dorian):**
    *   Standard A Minor (Aeolian) uses the natural sixth (F) and the natural seventh (G).
    *   **Dorian Mode** uses a **raised sixth** (F#) and a **natural seventh** (G).

4.  **Characteristic Chords:**
    *   **Am:** Tonic (i).
    *   **G6:** Subtonic (VII). The natural G confirms the natural seventh characteristic of Dorian (and Aeolian).
    *   **F#dim/A:** The notes are F#, A, C. The presence of **F#** strongly indicates the raised sixth scale degree. In A Dorian, F#dim is the vi° chord.
    *   **Bm/A:** The B minor chord (B D F#) is the **ii** chord in A Dorian, again confirming the use of **F#** (the raised sixth).

Since the progression uses both the natural 7th (G) and the raised 6th (F#), this definitively points to the **Dorian mode**.

The chord progression you provided is:

**Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | C/G | Bm/A | Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | G6 | Am**

Let's break down the chords and try to determine the key and mode.

---

### 1. Identify the Tonal Center

The most consistent chord, the one the progression starts and ends on, and the one that appears most frequently, is **Am** (A minor). This strongly suggests that the tonic is **A**.

### 2. Analyze the Chords and Potential Keys

If the tonic is A, the progression likely uses the A minor scale (A-B-C-D-E-F-G).

The chords used are:

| Chord | Notes | Relationship to A (Tonic) | Typical Function in A minor |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Am** | A - C - E | i | Tonic (i) |
| **F#dim/A** | A - F# - A - C | F# - A - C | Submediant (vi°) |
| **C/G** | G - C - E | C - E - G | Mediant (III) |
| **Bm/A** | A - B - D - F# | B - D - F# | Supertonic (ii) / Subdominant (iv) |
| **G6** | G - B - D - E | G - B - D - E | Subtonic (VII) / Dominant (V) |

Now let's examine the three most common minor scales centered on A:

#### A) A Natural Minor (Aeolian Mode):
* **Scale:** A B C D E F G
* **Harmonies:** Am (i), Bdim (ii°), C (III), Dm (iv), Em (v), F (VI), G (VII)

#### B) A Harmonic Minor:
* **Scale:** A B C D E F G#
* **Harmonies:** Am (i), Bdim (ii°), Caug (III+), Dm (iv), E (V), F (VI), G#dim (vii°)

#### C) A Melodic Minor:
* **Scale (Ascending):** A B C D E F# G#
* **Scale (Descending):** A B C D E F G (Same as Natural Minor)

---

### 3. Focus on the Unusual Chords

The chords that conflict with typical A Natural Minor (Aeolian) are:

**1. F#dim/A (F# - A - C):**
* The note **F#** is present.
* F# is the raised 6th degree of A (A Natural Minor has F).
* A chord containing F# at root position would be F#dim (vi° in Harmonic Minor) or a related chord.
* In the scale of **A Melodic Minor (ascending)**, the notes are A B C D E **F#** G#. This **F#** is characteristic.

**2. Bm/A (B - D - F#):**
* This is a B minor chord voiced over A.
* The chord contains the notes **B, D, F#**.
* The **F#** is again the raised 6th degree.
* Bm (ii) is the supertonic chord of A ascending Melodic Minor.

**3. G6 (G - B - D - E):**
* The notes are G, B, D, E.
* This is a non-functional tonic chord passing or a substitute dominant.
* Crucially, the G is **natural** (the lowered 7th degree), which is characteristic of both A Natural Minor and A Melodic Minor (descending).

### 4. Conclusion on Key and Mode

The simultaneous use of the following features points strongly to a specific key and mode:

* **Tonic:** **Am**
* **Raised 6th degree (F#):** Used in the F#dim and Bm chords.
* **Lowered 7th degree (G):** Used in the C/G and G6 chords.

The combination of the raised 6th degree (**F#**) and the lowered 7th degree (**G**) is the definition of the **Dorian Mode** when applied to the minor key structure.

The **A Dorian scale** is A B C D E **F# G** (it is the 2nd mode of G major).

* **A Dorian Harmonies:** Am (i), Bm (ii), C (III), D (IV), Em (v), F#dim (vi°), G (VII).

Let's check the chords against A Dorian:

| Chord | Notes | Fit in A Dorian? (A B C D E F# G) |
|---|---|---|
| **Am** | A - C - E | **Yes** (i) |
| **F#dim/A (F# - A - C)** | F# - A - C | **Yes** (a voicing of vi°) |
| **C/G (G - C - E)** | C - E - G | **Yes** (III) |
| **Bm/A (B - D - F#)** | B - D - F# | **Yes** (ii) |
| **G6 (G - B - D - E)** | G - B - D - E | **Yes** (VII – A typical Dorian dominant substitute) |

Every chord fits perfectly within the A Dorian mode. The F#dim chord is particularly common, often acting as a substitute for vi diminished, and the Bm (ii) chord solidifies the use of F# over F natural.

### Final Determination

**Key:** **A** (Tonic: Am)

**Mode:** **Dorian** (A Dorian)

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

This progression is in **A minor** (natural minor), with a **modal inflection toward A Dorian** due to the inclusion of **F♯** in the F♯dim/A chords and the **B natural** in the Bm/A chord.

- **Key center**: A (tonic is clearly A minor)
- **Mode**: Primarily **A natural minor**, but the **F♯** and **B natural** suggest **A Dorian** coloring, especially in the context of the F♯dim/A and Bm/A chords.

So, **A minor with Dorian inflection** is the most accurate description.

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let’s analyze the chord sequence:  

`Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  C/G  Bm/A  Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  G6  Am`

---

### 1. Identify tonal center
- The strong repetition of **Am** (appearing at beginning, middle, and end) strongly suggests **A** as the tonal center.  
- Cadencing back to **Am** repeatedly reinforces that center.

---

### 2. Examine the chords

| Chord | Notes | Function (if A is tonic) |
|:------|:-------|:-------------------------|
| Am | A–C–E | i |
| F#dim/A | F#–A–C | vii° in A minor |
| C/G | C–E–G | ♭III (C major) |
| Bm/A | B–D–F#–A | implies Bm7/A (B–D–F#–A) – could function as ii°⁷ of A (borrowed) or modal interchange |
| G6 | G–B–D–E | ♭VII6 (G major chord with added 6th) – common in A Aeolian/Dorian mix |

---

### 3. Interpreting the mode

- **Am** and **F#dim** fit perfectly in **A harmonic or natural minor** (they both contain A–C–E and F#–A–C).  
  But wait — F#dim uses **F#**, while natural minor (A Aeolian) has **F natural**, not F#.

So we must check what scale includes both F# and G natural:

| Mode | Notes (around A) |
|:------|:----------------|
| A Aeolian | A B C D E F G |
| A Dorian | A B C D E F# G |
| A harmonic minor | A B C D E F G# |

The presence of **F#** (in F#dim) and **G** (in G6, C/G) points to **A Dorian**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

- **Tonal Center:** A  
- **Mode:** **A Dorian**  
- **Scale:** A–B–C–D–E–F#–G  

The repeated Am chords confirm A as tonic, and the use of F# (from the F#dim chord) instead of F natural confirms the Dorian flavor rather than Aeolian.

### Reasoning

First, the chord progression is: Am, Am, F#dim/A, F#dim/A, Am, Am, C/G, Bm/A, Am, Am, F#dim/A, F#dim/A, Am, Am, G6, Am.

I need to determine the key and mode. Since the progression starts and ends with Am, and Am is a common tonic chord in the key of A minor, it's likely that the key is A minor.

Now, let's list out the chords and see what they imply about the key.

- Am: This is the tonic chord in A minor.

- F#dim/A: This is a diminished chord on F# with an A in the bass. F#dim is often used as a leading tone chord in minor keys. In A minor, the leading tone is G#, but here it's F#dim, which might be related to the harmonic or melodic minor scales.

In A natural minor, the chords are: Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G. But here we have F#dim and G6, which don't fit directly.

F#dim is the vii° chord in G major, but we're in A minor, so let's think about A harmonic minor. In A harmonic minor, the scale is A, B, C, D, E, F, G#. The chords would be: Am, Bdim, Caug, Dm, E, F, G#dim.

G#dim is the vii° chord in A harmonic minor, but here we have F#dim. F#dim would be built on F#, which is not in A harmonic minor; A harmonic minor has F natural and G#.

Perhaps it's A melodic minor? A melodic minor ascending: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#. Then chords: Am, Bm, Caug, D, E, F#dim, G#dim.

But we have F#dim, which fits in A melodic minor ascending. Also, we have C/G and Bm/A.

C/G is a C major chord with G in the bass, which is still C major. Bm/A is B minor with A in the bass.

In A melodic minor, the chord on the 6th degree is F#dim, which is consistent. But let's see the other chords.

We have G6, which is G major with an added 6th? G6 typically means G major triad with an added 6th, so G, B, D, E. In terms of chord quality, G6 is a major chord with a 6th, which often functions as a dominant or subdominant in some contexts.

In A minor, G major is the dominant chord if we use the raised leading tone, but in natural minor, G is minor, but here G6 is major, so it's consistent with harmonic or melodic minor where the V chord is major.

But in A harmonic minor, the V chord is E major, not G major. G major is the VII chord in natural minor, but in harmonic minor, VII is G#dim, so G major doesn't fit.

Perhaps the key is A minor, and the chords are borrowed from other modes.

Let's list all chords without bass notes for simplicity, since the bass notes might be just inversions.

So, chords: Am, F#dim, C, Bm, G6.

Am is i, F#dim is ? , C is III, Bm is ii, G6 is VII6? But in minor, ii is diminished, but here Bm is minor, which suggests Dorian mode.

In A Dorian, the scale is A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. Chords: Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim, G.

Oh, that matches! Let's see:

- Am: i

- Bm: ii

- C: III

- F#dim: vi° (since F#dim is built on the 6th degree of A Dorian)

- G: VII

And we have G6, which is just G with an added 6th, which is fine.

In the progression, we have F#dim/A, which is F#dim with A bass, so it's first inversion, but the chord is still F#dim.

Similarly, C/G is C major with G bass, so it's second inversion C major.

Bm/A is B minor with A bass, so it's first inversion B minor.

So the chord functions in A Dorian:

- Am: i

- F#dim: vi° (which is diminished chord on the 6th degree)

- C: III

- Bm: ii

- G: VII

And the progression ends with G6 to Am, which is VII to i, a common cadence in Dorian mode.

In Dorian, the VII chord is major, and it often resolves to i, so yes.

Now, to confirm, let's see the scale: A Dorian has F# and G natural, so the chords Bm and G major fit perfectly.

F#dim is from the F# in the scale, and since the scale has F# and G, the chord on F# is diminished because F#-A-C is a diminished triad? F# to A is minor third, A to C is minor third, so yes, F#-A-C is diminished.

In A Dorian, the notes are A,B,C,D,E,F#,G. So chord on F#: F#, A, C — that's indeed a diminished triad.

And chord on G: G, B, D — major triad.

So all chords fit.

Therefore, the key is A Dorian.

But is Dorian a mode or a key? In music theory, we often say the key is A minor, but with Dorian mode, meaning the scale has raised 6th.

But in this case, since the chords confirm the Dorian mode, we can say the key is A Dorian.

So, for the answer, I'll say key of A Dorian.

But let's make sure about the progression. The progression has multiple Am chords, and it ends with G6 to Am, which is characteristic of Dorian.

Also, the F#dim appears, which is the vi° in Dorian, and it's used here, probably as a passing chord or something.

So, I think it's clear.

The chord progression provided (Am, Am, F#dim/A, F#dim/A, Am, Am, C/G, Bm/A, Am, Am, F#dim/A, F#dim/A, Am, Am, G6, Am) is in the **key of A Dorian**.

### Explanation:
- **A Dorian** is a mode of the G major scale, with the notes A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. This scale features a raised sixth (F#) compared to the natural minor scale (which has F natural).
- The chords in the progression align with A Dorian:
  - **Am** is the tonic chord (i).
  - **F#dim** is the diminished chord on the sixth degree (vi°), which is characteristic of Dorian mode.
  - **C** (or C/G) is the major chord on the third degree (III).
  - **Bm** (or Bm/A) is the minor chord on the second degree (ii).
  - **G6** is the major chord on the seventh degree (VII) with an added sixth, and its resolution to Am (VII-i) is a common cadence in Dorian mode.
- The use of F#dim and G6 instead of chords from A natural minor (e.g., F major or G minor) confirms the Dorian quality.

This progression has a folk or jazz-like sound due to the Dorian mode's bright and slightly major feel from the raised sixth.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.  

The chord progression you gave is:  

**Am – Am – F#dim/A – F#dim/A – Am – Am – C/G – Bm/A – Am – Am – F#dim/A – F#dim/A – Am – Am – G6 – Am**

---

### 1. Identify the chords and their functions
- **Am** = i chord in A minor  
- **F#dim/A** = This is an F# diminished triad (F#–A–C) over an A bass.  
  - F#dim in A minor = vii° chord (F#–A–C–Eb if F#dim7), but here it’s just F#dim triad (F#–A–C) over A bass, so it’s like **A7(b9) without the 3rd (C)**? Actually, F#dim triad contains A natural, so over A bass it’s A–F#–A–C = A7 missing the E (the 5th) but with a b9 (G natural? No, G not present). Wait, F#dim = F# A C. Over A bass = A F# A C = A + F#dim.  
  - Let’s check: F#dim is F# A C. Over A bass, notes are A F# A C = A, F#, C. That’s A + F#dim. But F#dim is vii° in A minor, so it’s like a rootless A7(b9) if it had Eb (G natural? No, G#? Let’s check A7: A C# E G; A7b9: A C# E G Bb; F#dim7: F# A C Eb; over A bass: A F# A C Eb = A7b9 without C#).  
  - But here it’s F#dim **triad**, not F#dim7, so no Eb. So F#dim triad = F# A C. Over A bass = A A F# C = Asus? No, F# is major 6th? Actually F# is M6 above A, C is m3 above A? That’s odd: A–F# = M6, A–C = m3. So chord is A with m3 and M6 simultaneously? That’s A–C–F# = Am(maj6)? That’s an uncommon sound.  
  - Let’s rename: F#dim/A = A–F#–C = A–C–F# = Am6? Yes! Because Am6 = A C E F#, but here we have A C F# — missing E. So it’s Am6(no5). So F#dim/A is just an inversion of Am6.  
  - So functionally, it’s still a **i chord** in A minor, just a different color (Am6).

- **C/G** = C major with G bass = C/E? No, C/G = G C E = that’s actually an inversion of C major, but in A minor, C major is **III chord** (borrowed from A major if in minor key? Actually in natural minor, III is C major anyway). C/G in bass progression goes to Bm/A.

- **Bm/A** = Bm (B D F#) over A bass = A B D F# = A9sus4? Actually Bm/A = A B D F# = A11(no3, no5)? More simply: it’s like an A major with F# and D and B — that’s Aadd9add11? But functionally, in A minor, Bm is ii chord; over A pedal, it’s a neighbor chord to Am.

- **G6** = G B D E. In A minor, G major is VII in natural minor, G6 adds E (the 9th of G? Actually G6 = G B D E = Em7/G? Yes, Em7). In A minor, Em7 is v7 in natural minor.

---

### 2. Determine key from tonal center
The progression begins and ends on Am, with Am appearing most often.  
The only non-diatonic possibility to check:  
A natural minor scale: A B C D E F G  
Chords:  
- Am = A C E  
- F#dim = F# A C — not in A natural minor (needs F# and C natural — C natural is in A minor, but F# is not; F# is in A harmonic minor).  
So F#dim implies **A harmonic minor** (A B C D E F G#) — but here F#dim is F# A C, which uses F# and C, not G#. Wait, F#dim triad in A harmonic minor would be F# A C — yes, because harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#; F#dim = F# A C — all notes in A harmonic minor? No: C is in A harmonic minor, F# is not — F# is not in A harmonic minor either! Let’s check: A harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#. F# is not there. So F#dim triad uses F# and C — F# is not in natural minor or harmonic minor.  
Actually F#dim is from A **melodic minor** ascending? A melodic minor: A B C D E F# G#. Yes! F# and C are both in A melodic minor ascending. So F#dim triad is diatonic to A melodic minor.

So the presence of F#dim (F# A C) suggests **A melodic minor** (ascending) as the scale source.

---

### 3. Check other chords for mode
A melodic minor: A B C D E F# G#  
Chords:  
- Am = A C E (i)  
- F#dim = F# A C (vii)  
- C = C E G — but G natural is not in A melodic minor (melodic minor has G#). So C major uses G natural, which is from A natural minor.  
- Bm = B D F# — B D F# is in A melodic minor (F# and D are in the scale, B is in the scale). Yes.  
- G6 = G B D E — G natural is not in A melodic minor, E is. So G6 uses G nat, so it’s from natural minor.

So the progression mixes A natural minor (C major, G6) and A melodic minor (F#dim). This is common in minor key progressions.

---

### 4. Conclusion
The **key** is **A minor**.  
The **mode** is **natural minor** with the **leading tone (G#)** not present in the given chords (since F#dim uses F#, not G#), but the F# comes from melodic minor.  
So it’s basically **A natural minor** but borrowing the F#dim chord from A melodic minor.

---

**Final answer:**  
**Key: A minor**  
**Mode: Natural minor with melodic minor borrowings**

### Reasoning


1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user has provided a sequence of chords: `Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am`. The task is to "Determine key and mode."

2.  **First Pass: Analyze the Chords Themselves.**
    *   `Am`: A minor. This is a strong candidate for the tonic or i chord.
    *   `F#dim/A`: This is a bit tricky. Let's break it down.
        *   `F#dim` is an F# diminished triad: F# - A - C.
        *   The `/A` means the note A is in the bass.
        *   So, the notes are A (bass), F#, A, C. This is essentially an F#dim7 chord without the 7th (E), but with an A in the bass. Functionally, `F#dim` is the leading tone chord to G. `F#dim/A` is a common way to voice this, especially in classical or jazz-influenced music. It's a `vii°` chord in the key of G major or G minor, and a `vii°/iii` in the key of C major (leading to Em), or a `vii°/V` in the key of D minor (leading to A). Let's hold this thought.
    *   `C/G`: C major with G in the bass. Notes are C - E - G. This is the IV chord in G major, the bIII chord in A minor, or the VI chord in E minor.
    *   `Bm/A`: B minor with A in the bass.
        *   `Bm` is B - D - F#.
        *   The notes are A (bass), B, D, F#. This is an interesting one. It's not a standard diatonic chord in many common keys. Let's look at its function. It strongly wants to resolve to E minor (the `ii` chord leading to the `v` chord in a minor key context). It could also be seen as a substitution for an F#m7(b5) or an A9sus4 without the 3rd and 9th. The A in the bass makes it feel very grounded in A *something*. It has a strong pull towards E, but in this context, it's followed by `Am`. This is crucial.
    *   `G6`: G major with an added 6th. Notes are G - B - D - E. This is a very common "tonic" sound, but it's also the dominant of C major. In the context of A minor, G is the major dominant chord (the `V` chord). The `6` is just a color tone.

3.  **Synthesize and Look for a Tonal Center.**
    *   The progression starts and ends on `Am`. This is a *huge* clue. `Am` is almost certainly the tonic chord.
    *   Let's assume the key is A minor and see if the other chords fit.

    *   **Key of A Minor (Natural, Harmonic, Melodic):**
        *   Scale degrees: A B C D E F G
        *   Diatonic chords (Natural minor):
            *   i: `Am`
            *   ii°: `Bdim`
            *   III: `C`
            *   iv: `Dm`
            *   v: `Em`
            *   VI: `F`
            *   VII: `G`
        *   Diatonic chords (Harmonic minor - raised 7th, G#):
            *   i: `Am`
            *   ii°: `Bdim`
            *   III+: `Caug`
            *   iv: `Dm`
            *   V: `E` or `E7`
            *   VI: `F`
            *   vii°: `G#dim`

4.  **Test the Chords Against the A Minor Hypothesis.**
    *   `Am`: Perfect fit. The tonic `i`.
    *   `F#dim/A`: This is *not* diatonic to A minor. However, what is its function? `F#` is the leading tone to `G`. This chord is a very common secondary leading-tone chord. It's the `vii°/V` in A minor. The `V` chord in A minor is `E` (or `E7`). The chord leading to `E` would be `D#dim`. So that's not it.
        *   Let's re-evaluate `F#dim/A`. It leads to `G`. `G` is the VII chord in natural minor or the `V/V` (the dominant of the dominant) in harmonic minor. Wait, that's getting too complex.
        *   Let's simplify. `F#` is not in the key of A minor (natural or harmonic). But `F#dim` *is* the `vii°` chord of G major. The progression seems to be using chords from the key of G major *within* the key of A minor. This is called *modal interchange* or *borrowed chords*.
        *   So, we have the tonic `i` (`Am`) and a chord (`F#dim`) that strongly tonicizes the VII chord (`G`). This is a common "backdoor" dominant feel in a minor key.
    *   `C/G`: This is the `III` chord in A minor (from natural minor). Perfect fit.
    *   `Bm/A`: This chord is tricky. `Bm` is not diatonic to A minor. The diatonic ii chord is `Bdim`. Where does `Bm` come from? It comes from the key of D major, A major, or G major. Let's think about its relationship to A. The notes are B, D, F#. The A in the bass makes it feel like it's functioning *in relation to A*. It sounds like a `Phrygian` chord. The ii chord in A Phrygian would be `Bb major`. That's not it. The characteristic chord of Phrygian is `bII` (`Bb` in A Phrygian). This doesn't fit.
        *   Let's reconsider `Bm/A`. Could it be a misreading? What if it's `Bm7b5/A`? No, the user wrote `Bm/A`. Let's stick with that. What if it's part of a larger progression? `Am` -> `Bm/A` -> `C`. This is a common "line cliché" or stepwise bass line: A -> A -> B -> C. But the bass here is A -> A -> A -> A... wait. `Bm/A` has an A in the bass. So the bass is static on A. This is a *pedal point* on the tonic A, with changing harmonies above it.
        *   The harmonies are:
            *   Am (A-C-E)
            *   F#dim/A (A-F#-A-C)
            *   C/G (G-C-E) - Okay, the bass moves here.
            *   Bm/A (A-B-D-F#)
            *   Am (A-C-E)
        *   The `Bm/A` is very interesting. It contains A, B, D, F#. This is an A Lydian sound (A-B-C#-D-E-F#-G#) but with a natural C, not C#. It's also an A Dorian sound (A-B-C-D-E-F#-G). The `Bm` is the `ii` chord in A Dorian. This is a strong possibility.
    *   `G6`: This is the VII chord in A natural minor (`G`). The `6` is just a color. It's a very common way to end a minor phrase, feeling like it's floating or about to resolve back to `i`. It's also the dominant chord of C major. Given that `C/G` appears before it, there's a strong pull towards a temporary C major tonality.

5.  **Re-evaluate with Modal Possibilities.**

    *   **A Natural Minor (Aeolian):**
        *   Chords: `Am` (i), `C` (III), `G` (VII). All fit.
        *   Non-diatonic: `F#dim/A` (borrowed from G major, acting as `vii°` to G), `Bm/A` (borrowed, could be `ii` from Dorian). The presence of these borrowed chords makes it feel like it's *not* purely Aeolian, but Aeolian with borrowings.

    *   **A Dorian:**
        *   Scale: A - B - C - D - E - F# - G
        *   Chords: `Am` (i), `Bm` (ii), `C` (III), `D` (IV), `Em` (v), `F#m` (vi), `G` (VII).
        *   Let's check our chords against this:
            *   `Am`: Perfect fit (i).
            *   `F#dim/A`: This is the problem child. The diatonic `vi` chord is `F#m`. `F#dim` is not in the Dorian mode. `F#dim` is the `vii°` of G major. So it's still a secondary leading-tone chord, leading to the `G` chord.
            *   `C/G`: Perfect fit (III).
            *   `Bm/A`: Perfect fit! This is the `ii` chord of A Dorian, voiced with an A in the bass. This is a *huge* confirmation for Dorian.
            *   `G6`: Perfect fit (VII).

    *   **Comparison: Aeolian vs. Dorian**
        *   The key differentiating chord between A Aeolian and A Dorian is the `IV` chord (`Dm` in Aeolian, `D` major in Dorian) or the `vi` chord (`F` in Aeolian, `F#m` in Dorian).
        *   Our progression doesn't use `D` or `F/F#m`. However, it *does* use `Bm`. `Bm` (the `ii` chord) is diatonic to Dorian but *not* to Aeolian (where it's `Bdim`). The presence of `Bm/A` is a very strong indicator for Dorian.
        *   The `F#` in the `F#dim/A` chord also points towards Dorian, as Dorian has an F# while Aeolian has an F natural. Even though it's a `F#dim` not `F#m`, the presence of that F# note is significant.
        *   The `G` chord acts as the major flat-7 chord, which is characteristic of both Dorian and Aeolian (and Mixolydian).

6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer.**

    *   **Primary Key:** The tonal center is clearly A. The progression starts and ends on `Am`.
    *   **Primary Mode:** The evidence strongly points to **A Dorian**.
        *   The `Bm/A` chord is the diatonic `ii` chord in A Dorian. This is the strongest piece of evidence.
        *   The `F#` in the `F#dim/A` chord aligns with the raised 6th degree of the Dorian mode.
        *   The `G6` chord is the characteristic major flat-7 chord of the Dorian mode.
        *   The `C/G` chord is the diatonic `III` chord.
    *   **Analysis of Non-Diatonic Elements:**
        *   The `F#dim/A` is not a diatonic chord of A Dorian (which would have `F#m`). However, it functions as a secondary leading-tone chord (`vii°/VII`) that leads powerfully to the `G` chord. This is a sophisticated harmonic device used within the modal framework. It reinforces the importance of the `G` chord in the progression.
    *   **Structure the Answer:**
        1.  Start with the direct answer: Key is A, Mode is Dorian.
        2.  Provide a "Short Answer" section for a quick takeaway.
        3.  Create a "Detailed Analysis" section.
        4.  In the detailed analysis, first identify the tonic chord (`Am`).
        5.  Go through each chord and explain how it fits (or doesn't fit) into the A Dorian mode. This is where I'll explain the key evidence (`Bm/A`, `G6`, the F# note).
        6.  Address the "outlier" chord (`F#dim/A`) and explain its function as a secondary leading-tone chord. This shows a deeper understanding.
        7.  Compare Dorian to the other likely candidate, A Aeolian (Natural Minor), and explain why Dorian is a better fit (specifically the `Bm` vs `Bdim`).
        8.  Conclude with a summary of the harmonic feel: It has a "minor" base but with a brighter, more hopeful or "jazzy" feel due to the major 6th (F#) and the overall modal structure. This helps the user understand the *effect* of the harmony.

7.  **Final Review:** Read through the generated answer. Is it clear? Is it accurate? Does it directly answer the user's question while also providing valuable context? The logic seems sound, and the conclusion is well-supported by the evidence in the chord progression. The explanation of the `F#dim/A` as a secondary function within the mode is the key to a sophisticated analysis.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **A** and the mode is **Dorian**.

### Short Answer

**Key/Mode: A Dorian**

The progression is centered on an A minor chord but includes the major 6th degree (F#) and a major IV chord (implied by the G), which are the defining characteristics of the Dorian mode.

---

### Detailed Analysis

Let's break down the chords to see why A Dorian is the best fit. The A Dorian mode consists of the following notes: **A - B - C - D - E - F# - G**.

1.  **Tonic Center: `Am`**
    The progression starts and ends on `Am`, firmly establishing A as the tonic. The quality is minor, so we're looking at a minor mode (Aeolian, Dorian, Phrygian, etc.).

2.  **The Defining Chord: `Bm/A`**
    *   This is a B minor chord with an A in the bass.
    *   In the key of A Natural Minor (Aeolian), the two-chord is `B diminished` (B-D-F).
    *   In the key of A Dorian, the two-chord is `B minor` (B-D-F#).
    *   The presence of a `Bm` chord is the strongest evidence for the Dorian mode, as it uses the raised 6th degree (F#) inherent to Dorian.

3.  **The Characteristic Chords: `G6` and `F#dim/A`**
    *   **`G6` (G-B-D-E):** The `G` major chord is the flat-seventh chord (the `VII` chord) in both A Dorian and A Natural Minor. This is a very common and characteristic sound in minor modes, providing a "less final" and more "open" sound than a dominant V chord. The added 6th (E) is a common color.
    *   **`F#dim/A` (F#-A-C over A):** This chord contains the note **F#**, which is the raised 6th of the A Dorian scale. While the diatonic six-chord in Dorian is `F#m`, this `F#dim` functions as a **secondary leading-tone chord**. It's the `vii°` of G, which means its purpose is to lead strongly into the `G6` chord. This is a sophisticated harmonic device that reinforces the importance of the `G` chord within the Dorian framework.

4.  **The Supporting Chord: `C/G`**
    *   The `C` major chord is the three-chord (`III`) in both A Dorian and A Natural Minor. It fits perfectly in either context and helps confirm the A minor tonality.

### Why Not A Natural Minor (Aeolian)?

The primary reason the key is not A Natural Minor is the **`Bm/A`** chord. A Natural Minor has a `B diminished` chord, not `B minor`. The F# in that chord is the "Dorian note" that gives the mode its distinctive bright, hopeful, or "jazzy" sound, contrasting with the sadder feel of the Natural Minor.

### Conclusion

The progression uses an A minor tonic (`Am`) but borrows chords from the Dorian mode to create a specific flavor.

*   **`Am`**: Establishes the minor tonic (i).
*   **`Bm/A`**: The diatonic `ii` chord of A Dorian.
*   **`C/G`**: The diatonic `III` chord.
*   **`F#dim/A`**: A secondary leading-tone chord (`vii°/VII`) leading to `G`.
*   **`G6`**: The characteristic major `VII` chord.

This combination creates a progression that is harmonically rich and clearly points to the **A Dorian** mode.
