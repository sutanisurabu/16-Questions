### Reasoning

**Examining Chord Relationships**

I'm starting to build a comprehensive list of all the chords. It's an important first step, and I've got the initial chord inventory down: Am, F#dim/A, and C. Now, I'm thinking about how each chord relates to the others. I'll need to figure out what key or keys this could be in and what the function of each chord is.


**Pinpointing Chord Functions**

I'm now deep in the analysis, classifying each chord's role within the A minor key. I've broken them down into individual notes, which helped confirm A minor as the tonal center. Now, I'm labeling each chord – Am, F#dim/A, C/G, Bm/A, G6 – based on its function: tonic, leading tone, and so on. This will help with the final understanding of the harmonic movement.


**Deciphering the Scale**

I'm now investigating the A minor scale. Analyzing the chords, I've confirmed the key as A minor and am currently considering natural, harmonic, and melodic variations. Identifying F#dim/A as a vi° chord is significant because its presence points toward a utilization of the melodic minor scale. I'm carefully examining the function of each chord, which is crucial for full harmonic understanding.


**Decoding the Harmonic Palette**

I'm now zeroing in on the detailed functions of each chord and its role in creating the overall harmonic color. Examining each chord's relationship within the identified A minor context, I see how they contribute to the progression's character. I'm focusing on the G6 chord, analyzing its specific function.


**Deciding on Minor Scale Forms**

I'm now in the process of determining which forms of A minor are at play. After breaking down the chords to their constituent notes, and now I'm studying the natural, harmonic, and melodic minor scales to determine the best fit for this particular progression. The F# in the F#dim/A points to a utilization of the A melodic minor scale, and I'll analyze how each chord function.


**Synthesizing Harmonic Insights**

I'm now integrating all my findings to define the core harmonic qualities, including the tonal center and modes at play. I've broken down all chords, and analyzed the chords to find which forms of minor scales are being utilized. I am zeroing in on the interaction between A minor's natural and melodic versions to understand the progression's distinctive flavor.


**Synthesizing Harmonic Analysis**

I'm now consolidating all the data from my chord analysis. I can tell now that the key is A minor. Also, I've identified the use of the melodic minor scale through the inclusion of the F# and Bm chords. I'm finalizing my chord-by-chord breakdown, which integrates all insights into a concise final statement about the harmonic character.




Based on the chords provided, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** A
*   **Mode:** Minor

### Detailed Analysis

1.  **Tonal Center (The "Home" Chord):** The progression begins and ends on **Am**. The chord Am also appears more frequently than any other chord in the sequence. This strongly establishes **A minor** as the tonic, or the harmonic center of the piece.

2.  **Use of Different Minor Scales:** The chord progression is not based on a single minor scale (like natural, harmonic, or melodic) but rather mixes them, which is very common in music.

    *   **A Natural Minor (A-B-C-D-E-F-G):** This scale is the foundation. The chords **Am (i)**, **C/G (III)**, and **G6 (VII)** are all derived directly from the A natural minor scale.
    *   **A Melodic Minor (A-B-C-D-E-F#-G#):** The progression borrows the raised 6th degree (F#) from the melodic minor scale. This is seen in the **F#dim/A** and **Bm/A** chords.
        *   **Am (A-C-E):** The tonic **(i)** chord.
        *   **F#dim/A (F#-A-C):** This is the diminished chord built on the raised 6th degree of A minor (vi°). It creates a smooth, chromatic sound leading back to Am.
        *   **C/G (C-E-G):** The relative major **(III)** chord, very common in minor keys.
        *   **Bm/A (B-D-F#):** This is a B minor chord. In natural minor, the chord on B would be a B diminished (B-D-F). The use of **F#** makes it a minor chord, functioning as a pre-dominant **(ii)**, often borrowed from the parallel major key (A Major) or A Dorian mode.
        *   **G6 (G-B-D-E):** This is the subtonic chord **(VII)** with an added 6th (which is the 5th of the key, E). It functions as a pre-dominant, leading back to the tonic Am with a less tense, more "modal" feel than a traditional dominant (E7) chord.

### Summary

The progression is definitively in **A minor**. It creates its unique color by using chords from the natural minor scale as its base while borrowing the F# from the melodic minor scale (or Dorian mode) for chords like **F#dim** and **Bm**. This blending of different minor modes is a sophisticated harmonic technique.
