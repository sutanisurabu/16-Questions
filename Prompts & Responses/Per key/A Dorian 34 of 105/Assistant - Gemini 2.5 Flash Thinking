### Reasoning

**Exploring the Harmonic Structure**

I'm currently dissecting the chord progression. The diminished chords and inversions immediately caught my ear. The use of bass notes other than the root, such as the A in the F#dim, creates interesting voice leading. I'm focusing on the relationship between the root notes, trying to identify any underlying patterns or tonal centers. The shift to C/G and Bm/A offers a fascinating contrast.


**Dissecting Chord Voicings**

I'm now carefully examining the C/G and Bm/A chords. Initially, the Bm/A seemed out of place. However, given the context, I'm analyzing the voicing, potentially a typo as previously suspected. The bass note, particularly within the diminished context, is key. Re-evaluating the role of the G6 chord and its connection to the overall structure.


**Determining the Overall Tonality**

I'm now integrating the harmonic analysis with the identified tonal center. The consistent Am anchoring the progression confirms A as the tonic. I'm focusing on the melodic minor implications, especially the role of F# and G6. The non-diatonic elements, like F#dim/A, become clear. The presence of G6 further suggests melodic minor influence.


**Revisiting Chord Choices**

I'm now revisiting the initial analysis of Bm/A and C/G. I'm focusing on the voice leading, particularly how F# and G6 interact. The function of these chords in the context of the Am tonic and F#dim becomes clearer. I'm re-evaluating the possibility of a typo. The G6 chord is now suggesting more complex harmonic movement.


**Refining Mode and Key**

I've clarified the mode, now confident it's A Dorian. I'm focusing on the G6 chord, realizing it functions as the bVII in A Dorian, providing further evidence. The analysis is complete, establishing the key and mode with precision.




The key is **A**.
The mode is **Dorian**.

### Analysis:

1.  **Tonic Identification:** The progression starts and ends on **Am** and Am is the most frequent chord, establishing the tonic center as **A**.

2.  **Minor Quality:** The first chord (Am) and the presence of C major (III) confirms a minor key/mode.

3.  **Mode Differentiation (Aeolian vs. Dorian):**
    *   Standard A Minor (Aeolian) uses the natural sixth (F) and the natural seventh (G).
    *   **Dorian Mode** uses a **raised sixth** (F#) and a **natural seventh** (G).

4.  **Characteristic Chords:**
    *   **Am:** Tonic (i).
    *   **G6:** Subtonic (VII). The natural G confirms the natural seventh characteristic of Dorian (and Aeolian).
    *   **F#dim/A:** The notes are F#, A, C. The presence of **F#** strongly indicates the raised sixth scale degree. In A Dorian, F#dim is the viÂ° chord.
    *   **Bm/A:** The B minor chord (B D F#) is the **ii** chord in A Dorian, again confirming the use of **F#** (the raised sixth).

Since the progression uses both the natural 7th (G) and the raised 6th (F#), this definitively points to the **Dorian mode**.
