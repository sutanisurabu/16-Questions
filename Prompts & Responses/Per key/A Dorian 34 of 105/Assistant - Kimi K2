This progression is in **A minor** (natural minor), with a **modal inflection toward A Dorian** due to the inclusion of **F♯** in the F♯dim/A chords and the **B natural** in the Bm/A chord.

- **Key center**: A (tonic is clearly A minor)
- **Mode**: Primarily **A natural minor**, but the **F♯** and **B natural** suggest **A Dorian** coloring, especially in the context of the F♯dim/A and Bm/A chords.

So, **A minor with Dorian inflection** is the most accurate description.
