### Reasoning

**Identifying chords and key**

I need to identify the key and mode from the given chord sequence: 

"Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am C/G Bm/A Am Am F#dim/A F#dim/A Am Am G6 Am." 

Parsing through the chords, it looks like the piece is centered on A minor. The F#dim/A suggests it might function as the leading-tone diminished seventh, but wait — since F# is not diatonic in A minor without the melodic minor, I'm considering how it contrasts with the G major context as well. The center is clearly A minor, though!**Analyzing harmonic minor**

I'm analyzing the chords to see how they fit in harmonic minor. In A harmonic minor, the leading tone is G#, which isn’t present. The F# diminished chord could serve as the ii° of E minor or vii°/G (leading tone to G). I'm noticing that the chords don’t resolve to G but return to Am. 

C/G and Bm/A show interesting relationships, especially the F# presence in Bm. This suggests the key may actually be A Dorian, which fits with the chords I've observed!**Examining triads in A Dorian**

I’m analyzing triads in A Dorian:

- i: Am (A C E)
- ii: Bm (B D F#)
- bIII: C (C E G)
- IV: D (D F# A)
- v: Em (E G B)
- vi°: F#dim (F# A C)
- bVII: G (G B D)

I see that F#dim fits as vi° in A Dorian, and Bm is ii. The G6 chord also works here. Since the notes in C/G remain diatonic, it all aligns with A Dorian. The cadence back to Am affirms that A is the tonal center. The absence of G# and presence of F# confirm I'm in Dorian mode!**Clarifying A Dorian function**

I see that F#dim/A functions as vi°6 in A Dorian, while G6 serves as bVII6. The added 6 in G6 is E, and since G6 isn't diatonic in Aeolian, it all aligns with Dorian instead. 

The presence of Bm also suggests A Dorian because Aeolian would feature F natural. While I can consider the possibility of G major, the sequence mostly revolves around Am. The tonal center being A reinforces that the key is A with Dorian mode. So there’s my concise reasoning!**Summarizing A Dorian relationships**

I also see that this setup is equivalent to G major but with A as the modal center, using the same pitch collection. I want to deliver a succinct final answer, possibly with Roman numerals indicating the chords in A Dorian: i, vi°6, i, and bIII6/5. 

C/G and Bm/A are interesting; I think Bm/A might serve as ii6/5 in second inversion, which gives it a suspended feel. But I don’t need to romanize everything—just highlighting its diatonic nature in A Dorian is enough!

A Dorian (A as tonal center, Dorian mode)

Why:
- The harmony clearly centers on Am (begins/ends on Am).
- Presence of F# (in F#dim and Bm) rules out A natural minor (Aeolian), which would have F natural.
- No G# appears, so it’s not A harmonic/melodic minor.
- All chords fit A Dorian’s pitch set (A B C D E F# G): Am, F#dim (vi°), C, Bm (ii), G(6).

Equivalently: the collection is G major, but with A as the modal center (A Dorian).
