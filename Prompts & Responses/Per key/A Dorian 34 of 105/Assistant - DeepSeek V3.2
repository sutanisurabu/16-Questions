Let’s break this down step by step.  

The chord progression you gave is:  

**Am – Am – F#dim/A – F#dim/A – Am – Am – C/G – Bm/A – Am – Am – F#dim/A – F#dim/A – Am – Am – G6 – Am**

### 1. Identify the chords and their functions
- **Am** = i chord in A minor  
- **F#dim/A** = This is an F# diminished triad (F#–A–C) over an A bass.  
  - F#dim in A minor = vii° chord (F#–A–C–Eb if F#dim7), but here it’s just F#dim triad (F#–A–C) over A bass, so it’s like **A7(b9) without the 3rd (C)**? Actually, F#dim triad contains A natural, so over A bass it’s A–F#–A–C = A7 missing the E (the 5th) but with a b9 (G natural? No, G not present). Wait, F#dim = F# A C. Over A bass = A F# A C = A + F#dim.  
  - Let’s check: F#dim is F# A C. Over A bass, notes are A F# A C = A, F#, C. That’s A + F#dim. But F#dim is vii° in A minor, so it’s like a rootless A7(b9) if it had Eb (G natural? No, G#? Let’s check A7: A C# E G; A7b9: A C# E G Bb; F#dim7: F# A C Eb; over A bass: A F# A C Eb = A7b9 without C#).  
  - But here it’s F#dim **triad**, not F#dim7, so no Eb. So F#dim triad = F# A C. Over A bass = A A F# C = Asus? No, F# is major 6th? Actually F# is M6 above A, C is m3 above A? That’s odd: A–F# = M6, A–C = m3. So chord is A with m3 and M6 simultaneously? That’s A–C–F# = Am(maj6)? That’s an uncommon sound.  
  - Let’s rename: F#dim/A = A–F#–C = A–C–F# = Am6? Yes! Because Am6 = A C E F#, but here we have A C F# — missing E. So it’s Am6(no5). So F#dim/A is just an inversion of Am6.  
  - So functionally, it’s still a **i chord** in A minor, just a different color (Am6).

- **C/G** = C major with G bass = C/E? No, C/G = G C E = that’s actually an inversion of C major, but in A minor, C major is **III chord** (borrowed from A major if in minor key? Actually in natural minor, III is C major anyway). C/G in bass progression goes to Bm/A.

- **Bm/A** = Bm (B D F#) over A bass = A B D F# = A9sus4? Actually Bm/A = A B D F# = A11(no3, no5)? More simply: it’s like an A major with F# and D and B — that’s Aadd9add11? But functionally, in A minor, Bm is ii chord; over A pedal, it’s a neighbor chord to Am.

- **G6** = G B D E. In A minor, G major is VII in natural minor, G6 adds E (the 9th of G? Actually G6 = G B D E = Em7/G? Yes, Em7). In A minor, Em7 is v7 in natural minor.

### 2. Determine key from tonal center
The progression begins and ends on Am, with Am appearing most often.  
The only non-diatonic possibility to check:  
A natural minor scale: A B C D E F G  
Chords:  
- Am = A C E  
- F#dim = F# A C — not in A natural minor (needs F# and C natural — C natural is in A minor, but F# is not; F# is in A harmonic minor).  
So F#dim implies **A harmonic minor** (A B C D E F G#) — but here F#dim is F# A C, which uses F# and C, not G#. Wait, F#dim triad in A harmonic minor would be F# A C — yes, because harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#; F#dim = F# A C — all notes in A harmonic minor? No: C is in A harmonic minor, F# is not — F# is not in A harmonic minor either! Let’s check: A harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#. F# is not there. So F#dim triad uses F# and C — F# is not in natural minor or harmonic minor.  
Actually F#dim is from A **melodic minor** ascending? A melodic minor: A B C D E F# G#. Yes! F# and C are both in A melodic minor ascending. So F#dim triad is diatonic to A melodic minor.

So the presence of F#dim (F# A C) suggests **A melodic minor** (ascending) as the scale source.

### 3. Check other chords for mode
A melodic minor: A B C D E F# G#  
Chords:  
- Am = A C E (i)  
- F#dim = F# A C (vii)  
- C = C E G — but G natural is not in A melodic minor (melodic minor has G#). So C major uses G natural, which is from A natural minor.  
- Bm = B D F# — B D F# is in A melodic minor (F# and D are in the scale, B is in the scale). Yes.  
- G6 = G B D E — G natural is not in A melodic minor, E is. So G6 uses G nat, so it’s from natural minor.

So the progression mixes A natural minor (C major, G6) and A melodic minor (F#dim). This is common in minor key progressions.

### 4. Conclusion
The **key** is **A minor**.  
The **mode** is **natural minor** with the **leading tone (G#)** not present in the given chords (since F#dim uses F#, not G#), but the F# comes from melodic minor.  
So it’s basically **A natural minor** but borrowing the F#dim chord from A melodic minor.

**Final answer:**  
**Key: A minor**  
**Mode: Natural minor with melodic minor borrowings**
