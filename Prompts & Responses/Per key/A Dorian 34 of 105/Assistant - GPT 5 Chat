Let’s analyze the chord sequence:  

`Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  C/G  Bm/A  Am  Am  F#dim/A  F#dim/A  Am  Am  G6  Am`

---

### 1. Identify tonal center
- The strong repetition of **Am** (appearing at beginning, middle, and end) strongly suggests **A** as the tonal center.  
- Cadencing back to **Am** repeatedly reinforces that center.

### 2. Examine the chords

| Chord | Notes | Function (if A is tonic) |
|:------|:-------|:-------------------------|
| Am | A–C–E | i |
| F#dim/A | F#–A–C | vii° in A minor |
| C/G | C–E–G | ♭III (C major) |
| Bm/A | B–D–F#–A | implies Bm7/A (B–D–F#–A) – could function as ii°⁷ of A (borrowed) or modal interchange |
| G6 | G–B–D–E | ♭VII6 (G major chord with added 6th) – common in A Aeolian/Dorian mix |

---

### 3. Interpreting the mode

- **Am** and **F#dim** fit perfectly in **A harmonic or natural minor** (they both contain A–C–E and F#–A–C).  
  But wait — F#dim uses **F#**, while natural minor (A Aeolian) has **F natural**, not F#.

So we must check what scale includes both F# and G natural:

| Mode | Notes (around A) |
|:------|:----------------|
| A Aeolian | A B C D E F G |
| A Dorian | A B C D E F# G |
| A harmonic minor | A B C D E F G# |

The presence of **F#** (in F#dim) and **G** (in G6, C/G) points to **A Dorian**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

- **Tonal Center:** A  
- **Mode:** **A Dorian**  
- **Scale:** A–B–C–D–E–F#–G  

The repeated Am chords confirm A as tonic, and the use of F# (from the F#dim chord) instead of F natural confirms the Dorian flavor rather than Aeolian.
