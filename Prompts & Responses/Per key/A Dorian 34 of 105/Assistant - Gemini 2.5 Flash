The chord progression you provided is:

**Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | C/G | Bm/A | Am | Am | F#dim/A | F#dim/A | Am | Am | G6 | Am**

Let's break down the chords and try to determine the key and mode.

### 1. Identify the Tonal Center

The most consistent chord, the one the progression starts and ends on, and the one that appears most frequently, is **Am** (A minor). This strongly suggests that the tonic is **A**.

### 2. Analyze the Chords and Potential Keys

If the tonic is A, the progression likely uses the A minor scale (A-B-C-D-E-F-G).

The chords used are:

| Chord | Notes | Relationship to A (Tonic) | Typical Function in A minor |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Am** | A - C - E | i | Tonic (i) |
| **F#dim/A** | A - F# - A - C | F# - A - C | Submediant (vi°) |
| **C/G** | G - C - E | C - E - G | Mediant (III) |
| **Bm/A** | A - B - D - F# | B - D - F# | Supertonic (ii) / Subdominant (iv) |
| **G6** | G - B - D - E | G - B - D - E | Subtonic (VII) / Dominant (V) |

Now let's examine the three most common minor scales centered on A:

#### A) A Natural Minor (Aeolian Mode):
* **Scale:** A B C D E F G
* **Harmonies:** Am (i), Bdim (ii°), C (III), Dm (iv), Em (v), F (VI), G (VII)

#### B) A Harmonic Minor:
* **Scale:** A B C D E F G#
* **Harmonies:** Am (i), Bdim (ii°), Caug (III+), Dm (iv), E (V), F (VI), G#dim (vii°)

#### C) A Melodic Minor:
* **Scale (Ascending):** A B C D E F# G#
* **Scale (Descending):** A B C D E F G (Same as Natural Minor)

### 3. Focus on the Unusual Chords

The chords that conflict with typical A Natural Minor (Aeolian) are:

**1. F#dim/A (F# - A - C):**
* The note **F#** is present.
* F# is the raised 6th degree of A (A Natural Minor has F).
* A chord containing F# at root position would be F#dim (vi° in Harmonic Minor) or a related chord.
* In the scale of **A Melodic Minor (ascending)**, the notes are A B C D E **F#** G#. This **F#** is characteristic.

**2. Bm/A (B - D - F#):**
* This is a B minor chord voiced over A.
* The chord contains the notes **B, D, F#**.
* The **F#** is again the raised 6th degree.
* Bm (ii) is the supertonic chord of A ascending Melodic Minor.

**3. G6 (G - B - D - E):**
* The notes are G, B, D, E.
* This is a non-functional tonic chord passing or a substitute dominant.
* Crucially, the G is **natural** (the lowered 7th degree), which is characteristic of both A Natural Minor and A Melodic Minor (descending).

### 4. Conclusion on Key and Mode

The simultaneous use of the following features points strongly to a specific key and mode:

* **Tonic:** **Am**
* **Raised 6th degree (F#):** Used in the F#dim and Bm chords.
* **Lowered 7th degree (G):** Used in the C/G and G6 chords.

The combination of the raised 6th degree (**F#**) and the lowered 7th degree (**G**) is the definition of the **Dorian Mode** when applied to the minor key structure.

The **A Dorian scale** is A B C D E **F# G** (it is the 2nd mode of G major).

* **A Dorian Harmonies:** Am (i), Bm (ii), C (III), D (IV), Em (v), F#dim (vi°), G (VII).

Let's check the chords against A Dorian:

| Chord | Notes | Fit in A Dorian? (A B C D E F# G) |
|---|---|---|
| **Am** | A - C - E | **Yes** (i) |
| **F#dim/A (F# - A - C)** | F# - A - C | **Yes** (a voicing of vi°) |
| **C/G (G - C - E)** | C - E - G | **Yes** (III) |
| **Bm/A (B - D - F#)** | B - D - F# | **Yes** (ii) |
| **G6 (G - B - D - E)** | G - B - D - E | **Yes** (VII – A typical Dorian dominant substitute) |

Every chord fits perfectly within the A Dorian mode. The F#dim chord is particularly common, often acting as a substitute for vi diminished, and the Bm (ii) chord solidifies the use of F# over F natural.

### Final Determination

**Key:** **A** (Tonic: Am)

**Mode:** **Dorian** (A Dorian)
