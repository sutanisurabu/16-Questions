### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to figure out the key and mode from the chord progression, which includes several Am chords, F#dim/A, C/G, Bm/A, and G6. Given the frequency of Am chords, A minor seems like the tonic. The F#dim chord, with A in the bass, could be the vii° in G major, but in A minor, it acts as a leading-tone diminished chord. In the A natural minor scale, F# isn't present, indicating the raised second in harmonic minor is relevant here.**Clarifying melodic minor chords**

I’m working with A melodic minor, which has the notes A, B, C, D, E, F#, and G#. This scale includes F# and G#. When I look at the F#dim chord (F#-A-C), I realize it's the ii° chord in A melodic minor. So, let's clarify: the scale degrees tell me that the triad on the second degree is indeed B minor (B-D-F#) rather than diminished. The triad built on F# (F#-A-C) confirms that it’s a diminished triad.**Examining F# diminished in A minor**

I realized that F#dim serves as the vi° triad in A melodic minor. The presence of F# suggests a melodic form, and in a typical progression, F#dim/A can lead to Am. Since it shares two notes with Am, it might function as a leading-tone to G. F#dim often resolves to G major, making it a vii°/G chord. In A minor, G major acts as the VII degree, showing the connection back to the G6 chord later in the progression.**Analyzing G6 and other chords**

G6 simply adds an E, which is a common tone in Am. However, looking at the progression, I see C/G and Bm/A as well. C/G is C major with G in the bass, functioning as the III chord in A minor. Bm/A is B minor with A as the bass note. In A melodic minor, B minor acts as the ii chord. I wonder if Bm/A could also imply Bm7/A, yielding an addition of A11. Breaking it down, the Bm triad consists of B-D-F#, and with an A in the bass, the notes include A, B, D, and F#.**Determining key and mode**

The chord Bm/A has A in the bass and includes the notes B, D, and F#. This fits well because it maintains consistency with A melodic minor, featuring F#. I notice the chords used: Am, F#dim/A, C/G, Bm/A, and G6 all include notes A, B, C, D, E, F#, and G. Since there's no G#, we could point toward A Dorian mode instead of melodic minor. 

The A Dorian scale is A B C D E F# G and matches the chords. Thus, the key and mode suggest A Dorian, with G major as the parent scale.

A Dorian (tonic A, mode Dorian).

Reason: The tonal center is A, F# appears (raised 6) while G# never does, and all chords (Am, Bm, C, F#dim, G6) are diatonic to A Dorian, which uses the G major collection: A B C D E F# G.
