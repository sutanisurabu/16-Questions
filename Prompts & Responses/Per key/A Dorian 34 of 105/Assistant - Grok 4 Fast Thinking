### Analysis of Chord Progression

The given progression is:  
**Am - Am - F#dim/A - F#dim/A - Am - Am - C/G - Bm/A - Am - Am - F#dim/A - F#dim/A - Am - Am - G6 - Am**

This is a repeating, vamp-like structure that strongly emphasizes tension and resolution around A minor. I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step, based on standard music theory (diatonic harmony, chord functions, and scale degrees).

#### Step 1: Identifying the Tonal Center
- The progression **starts and ends on Am** (four times in total), which acts as the clear tonic (home base).
- It resolves back to Am repeatedly, creating a sense of closure.
- No other chord feels like a stronger gravitational pull; everything orbits around A as the root note.
- Bass lines (e.g., /A in F#dim/A and Bm/A, /G in C/G) reinforce A and its relatives without shifting the center.

**Tonal center: A**

#### Step 2: Determining the Key (Scale Fit)
Let's map the chords to potential scales in A:
- **Core chords**:
  - Am (A-C-E): i (tonic) in A minor.
  - F#dim/A (F#-A-C, over A bass): vii° (leading-tone diminished) in A (harmonic) minor. This is a classic tension-builder resolving to i.
  - C/G (C-E-G over G bass): III (mediant) in A minor, functioning like a subdominant or pivot. The G bass adds a VII feel.
  - Bm/A (B-D-F# over A bass): This implies ii° or a secondary dominant, but B-D-F# requires the raised 7th (G#) from A harmonic minor for diatonic fit. It's non-diatonic in natural minor but common in harmonic minor contexts.
  - G6 (G-B-D-E): VII6 (subtonic with added 6th) in A minor, providing a plagal (iv-like) resolution to Am.

- **Scale compatibility**:
  - **A natural minor (Aeolian: A-B-C-D-E-F-G)**: Fits Am, C, and G6 perfectly. But F#dim and Bm introduce F# (not in the scale), so it's not a pure fit.
  - **A harmonic minor (A-B-C-D-E-F-G#)**: Perfect fit for all chords. The G# allows F# (leading tone/enharmonic to G#) in F#dim and Bm, which act as vii° and ii. This is common in progressions needing tension (e.g., the dim chord pulls strongly to Am).
  - **A major**: Unlikely—predominantly minor tonic (Am) and no strong major III (C#) or V (E major). Chords like F#dim feel unstable in major.

- No evidence of modulation (e.g., no pivot to relative major C or dominant E major). The slash chords (/A, /G) add color but stay within A minor's orbit.

**Key: A minor** (specifically leaning on the harmonic minor variant for the F#-containing chords).

#### Step 3: Determining the Mode
- **Mode: Minor** (dark, introspective tonality from the minor tonic and prevalent minor/diminished chords).
  - It's not major (lacks brightness from major tonic or Lydian/Mixolydian flavors).
  - Sub-mode nuance: Primarily **harmonic minor** due to the vii° (F#dim) and implied raised 7th (G#) for tension/resolution. This gives it a more "classical" or dramatic feel than pure natural minor (Aeolian), but it doesn't fully commit to melodic minor (which would raise the 6th for ascending lines, not evident here).
- Overall mood: Somber and cyclic, with the F#dim creating suspense before returning to Am—evocative of ballads or film noir soundtracks.

#### Additional Notes
- This progression resembles vamps in songs like "Summertime" (Gershwin, in minor) or Spanish/flamenco influences, where harmonic minor adds exotic tension.
- If this is from a specific song (e.g., it echoes parts of "Hotel California" or similar A minor tunes), the key/mode aligns with those analyses.
- To confirm in practice: Play it over an A minor scale (harmonic variant). It should feel resolved. Transposing to another key (e.g., up a half-step to A#m) would break the diatonic flow.

If you provide more context (e.g., melody notes, song title, or full arrangement), I can refine this further!
