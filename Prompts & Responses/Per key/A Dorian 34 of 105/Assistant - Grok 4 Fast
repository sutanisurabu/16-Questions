### Key and Mode Analysis

The chord progression you provided (Am - Am - F#dim/A - F#dim/A - Am - Am - C/G - Bm/A - Am - Am - F#dim/A - F#dim/A - Am - Am - G6 - Am) is a classic example of a progression in **A minor** (the relative minor of C major). This exact sequence is famously used in Radiohead's "Karma Police" from their album *OK Computer* (1997), which centers on A as the tonal root.

#### Key: A Minor
- **Tonal Center**: A. The progression repeatedly resolves to and emphasizes Am (the i chord), creating a clear sense of A as home base. It avoids any strong pull toward the parallel major (A major) by not using chords that tonicize A major (e.g., no A major chord or heavy V7 resolution like E7).
- **Scale Basis**: Derived from the A natural minor scale (A B C D E F G), which fits most chords here without accidentals.
  - Am: i (root minor triad)
  - F#dim/A: Functions as a passing or tension-building chord (like a vii°7 borrowing from A harmonic minor, where F# is the #6/leading tone; the /A bass keeps it grounded in the key).
  - C/G: iv6 (C major triad over G bass; C is the iv in A minor).
  - Bm/A: v6/iv or passing (B minor over A; Bm is like a borrowed v from A major, but contextualized as tension leading back to Am).
  - G6: VII6 (G major with added 6th—A; common in minor keys for a subtonic feel, adding color without resolving to major).

No modulations or pivot chords suggest a shift away from A minor. The overall mood is melancholic and introspective, typical of minor-key progressions.

#### Mode: Aeolian (Natural Minor)
- **Why Aeolian?** This is the "pure" natural minor mode (no raised 7th like in harmonic or melodic minor). The key signature implies 0 sharps/flats for A minor, matching the Aeolian mode of the C major scale (6th mode: A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A).
  - No consistent use of the raised 7th (G#) to create a dominant V chord (E major or E7), which would lean toward harmonic minor or suggest a Phrygian/Spanish flavor.
  - The F# in F#dim/A introduces a brief chromatic tension (from harmonic minor), but it's not structural enough to change the mode—it's more of a color note for dissonance.
  - Avoids Dorian traits (raised 6th, like F# major chords) or Phrygian (lowered 2nd, like Bb chords) as dominant elements.
- **Modal Feel**: Static and brooding, with the repeated Am blocks and the G6 ending providing a subtle plagal (iv-i or VII-i) resolution rather than a strong authentic cadence.

If this is from a specific song or context (e.g., "Karma Police"), it reinforces A Aeolian—the melody (if present) would likely outline the natural minor scale. If you have more details like melody notes or tempo, I could refine this further!
