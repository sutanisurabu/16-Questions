Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

> Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm

---

### Step 1: List the chords with their roots and bass notes

We’ll treat these as **root-position chords** where possible, but note any **inversions** (bass note ≠ root):

| Chord       | Root | Bass | Notes (approx)                      |
|-------------|------|------|-------------------------------------|
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Adim/C      | A    | C    | C E G# → **but Adim = A C Eb**, so C Eb A → **C is bass of A diminished** |
| Adim/C      | A    | C    | C Eb A                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Eb/Bb       | Eb   | Bb   | Bb Eb G → **Eb major triad, Bb bass** |
| Dm/C        | D    | C    | C D F → **D minor triad with C bass** |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Adim/C      | A    | C    | C Eb A                              |
| Adim/C      | A    | C    | C Eb A                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Bb6         | Bb   | Bb   | Bb D F G → **Bb major with added 6th (G)** |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |

### Step 2: Identify the candidate key

All chords orbit around **C minor**, and the progression ends on **Cm**, so **C minor** is very likely the **tonic**.

Let’s check if the chords fit in **C natural minor**, **C harmonic minor**, or **C melodic minor**.

#### C natural minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C  
Chords built on each degree:
- i: Cm
- ii°: D°
- III: Eb
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm
- VI: Ab
- VII: Bb

#### C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B C  
Chords:
- i: Cm
- ii°: D°
- III+: Eb+ (rare)
- iv: Fm
- V: G (major! ← important!)
- VI: Ab
- VII°: B°

#### C melodic minor (ascending): C D Eb F G A B C  
Chords:
- i: Cm
- ii: Dm
- III+: Eb+
- IV: F
- V: G
- VI: A
- VII°: B°

---

### Step 3: Analyze the chords in context

Let’s look at **non-diatonic** or surprising chords:

1. **Adim/C** = A diminished triad over C bass → **C Eb A**  
   - That’s **C minor + A** → A is the **raised 6th** → from C harmonic minor (C D Eb F G Ab B C) → **Ab** is the 6th, not A.
   - But **A natural** is the **6th of C melodic minor (ascending)**.
   - So **A** is the **#6** in C minor → **C melodic minor (ascending)**.

   So:  
   - **Adim = A C Eb** = 6th, root, minor 3rd → forms a **diminished triad on the 6th degree** in C melodic minor.

   That’s valid in **C melodic minor**:  
   - ```CmelodicMin: C D Eb F G A B```  
   - A (6th) built as A C Eb → that’s a **diminished triad** because:  
     - A to C = minor 3rd  
     - C to Eb = minor 3rd  
     - A to Eb = diminished 5th → ✅ A°

   So **Adim/C** = i6 (C minor with #6 added) → very common in jazz/pop minor keys.

2. **Eb/Bb** = Eb major triad with Bb in bass → **Bb Eb G**  
   - Eb major = III in C minor (natural/harmonic/melodic)  
   - Bb is the 7th of C minor → **Bb is the VII degree**

   But here, it's **Eb/Bb** — a **first inversion Eb major**.
   - In C minor, Eb major is the **III chord** — a major chord on the lowered 3rd.  
   This is extremely common in minor keys (e.g., “Moon River”, “All Along the Watchtower”) — the **III** chord as a major.

3. **Dm/C** = D minor triad with C bass → **C D F**
   - What is this?  
     - C D F = **Cmaj6**? No, D minor = D F A — but here, the chord is **C D F** — missing A?  
     - **C D F** is **C with added 9th**? But 9th would be D, yes — but no 3rd or 5th?  
     - Wait: **C D F** = C root, D = 9th, F = 11th — but we usually expect a 3rd (Eb) and 5th (G) for a full chord.

   This looks like a **Dm/C**, meaning a **D minor triad (D F A)**, but **A is omitted**, and bass is **C**.

   So the full notes are: **C D F** — which is **C-D-F**.

   - C = root  
   - D = major 2nd  
   - F = perfect 4th  

   → This is technically a **Cadd9**? But **F is the 4th**, not a chord tone of C major/minor.  
   → Alternatively, it's a **Dm/C**, a **slash chord** = **D minor with C in bass**

   In **C melodic minor**, D is the **ii** chord → **Dm** is diatonic!  
   → So **Dm/C** = ii6/4? Or just **ii in first inversion**?  
   Actually: Dm = D F A → Dm/C = C D F A? But we only have C D F.  
   So likely **Dm with 5th omitted** → **Dm7?** without E? E would be a 9th? Hmm…

   But the bass is **C**, which is the **major 7th** above D? No, C is a **minor 7th** above D.

   **Dm7 = D F A C** → perfect!  
   So **Dm/C** is **Dm7** with **C in bass** → so **Dm7/C** = **C D F A**.

   We’re missing A — but maybe it’s implied, or omitted. In pop/jazz, it’s common to omit the 5th.

   So **Dm/C** → effectively a **Dm7 with C bass**, which is **C D F A** = the same as **Cmaj7?** No — Cmaj7 = C E G B.

   Wait: **C D F A** = **C6/9**? That would be C E G A D → but we don’t have E or G.

   This chord **C D F** lacks the 3rd and 5th of C, so it's **not functioning as a C chord**.

   Therefore, this is better interpreted as **Dm7 with C in bass** — which creates a **Cm6**? No.

   Let’s think of it as a **motion from Dm → Cm**, and the **C bass** is a **descending bassline**:
   > [past chords] → Dm/C → Cm

   Bass: Bb → C → C  
   From Eb/Bb: bass = Bb  
   Then Dm/C: bass = C  
   Then Cm: bass = C → so **Bb → C** is a **whole step up**

   So bass line:  
   C — C — C — C — C — C — **Bb** — **C** — C — C — C — C — C — C — **Bb** — C  
   → So the bass moves:  
   - From Bb to C → so **stepwise ascent** — common in minor keys to lead from VII (Bb) to i (C)

   So **Dm/C** is likely **Dm7** with C bass (so it's a **Cmelodic minor ii7 chord in third inversion**).

   But more practically: **Dm/C** adds color and a smooth **Bb → C → C** bass motion in context with Eb/Bb → Dm/C → Cm.

   It works because:  
   - Bb (7th of C minor) → C (tonic)  
   - Dm/C supports that motion melodically and harmonically.

4. **Bb6** = Bb D F G  
   - This is **Bb major with added 6th (G)**  
   - In C minor: **Bb is the VII chord** — but normally it’s **Bb major** (VII = major in minor keys)
   - Adding the 6th (G) makes it **Bb6** — which is common in jazz/pop for color and to blur the "dominant" function.

   Bb6: notes Bb D F G  
   - G is the **major 6th** → from Bb scale: Bb C D Eb F G A → G is 6th → yes, diatonic in **C melodic minor**!

   C melodic minor scale:  
   **C D Eb F G A B** — so Bb is **not in this scale**!

   Wait — problem.

   C melodic minor ascending = C D Eb F G A B  
   So: **B natural**, **not Bb**!

   So **Bb** is **not diatonic to C melodic minor ascending** — it's chromatic!

   But in **C natural minor**:  
   C D Eb F G Ab **Bb** C → yes, **Bb** is the VII degree → diatonic!

   So Bb is diatonic in **C natural minor**, but **A natural** is not → but we have **Adim/C** which uses A natural.

   → So we have a **mix** of C natural minor (Bb, Ab) and C melodic minor (A natural).

   So this is **C minor with modal mixture (borrowed chords)**.

   Let’s consider:

   - **C minor as the tonic**
   - **Bb (VII), Eb (III)** = from **C natural minor**
   - **A natural, D, Dm** = from **C melodic minor**
   - We’re **mixing natural and melodic minor** → very common in pop, jazz, classical.

   **Key: C minor (Aleatoric / mixed minor)** → not strictly one mode, but **C minor** in general.

   But **mode**? Let’s define it.

---

### Step 4: Determine key and mode

**Key: C minor**

**Mode**: Not purely natural, harmonic, or melodic — it’s **modal mixture** in **C minor**, combining elements of:

- C natural minor: **Bb, Ab** (VII, VI)
- C melodic minor ascending: **A natural, B natural** (VI, VII)
- We have **A natural** (Adim/C) → melodic
- We have **Bb** (Bb6) → natural minor
- We have **Dm** (ii) → melodic minor
- No G# → so **not harmonic minor**

→ So the progression **does not stick to one mode**, but favors **C minor** as a tonal center using **modal mixture**.

In theory:

- **C natural minor** provides: Cm, Eb, Bb, Ab voiced as Eb/Bb
- **C melodic minor** provides: Dm, Adim (A natural), and B natural might be implied but not used here
- The chord **Bb6** is a **major chord on VII with added 6th** — common in pop and jazz progressions in minor keys

✅ So this progression is **in the key of C minor**, using **modal mixture** (borrowing from C melodic minor and C natural minor).

---

### Final Answer:

> **Key: C minor**  
> **Mode: C minor with modal mixture (mixing natural and melodic minor elements)**

Alternatively, if forced to pick one mode:  
**C natural minor** provides Bb and Ab, but uses A natural — which isn't in C natural minor.  
**C melodic minor** provides A natural, but not Bb — so neither works alone.

Thus, **the most accurate answer is**:

> **Key: C minor**  
> **Mode: Not strictly one mode — uses modal mixture from C natural minor and C melodic minor**

This is common in modern music (pop, jazz, film scores). The progression centers on C minor tonic, with colorful borrowed chords for movement and emotion.
