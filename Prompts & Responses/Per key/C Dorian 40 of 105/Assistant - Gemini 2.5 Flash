The melody you provided is:
$$\text{Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm}$$

To determine the key and mode, we need to analyze the chords used, especially the tonic (the chord the piece seems to center around and end on) and the chords that define the prevailing scale.

1.  **Tonic Chord:** The piece both starts and ends on **Cm** (C minor) and repeats this chord frequently. This strongly suggests that the tonic is **C**.

2.  **Chord Qualities and Scales:** We have the following chords:
    *   **Cm** (C-Eb-G): Minor tonic.
    *   **Adim/C** (A-C-Eb / C in bass): A diminished triad. When analyzed in the key of C, the notes are C (tonic), Eb (minor third), and A (a note not typically in C natural minor). Note that $\text{Adim}$ is often the vii$^\circ$ chord in a minor key.
    *   **Eb/Bb** (Eb-G-Bb / Bb in bass): Eb major triad. This is the **$\text{III}$** (mediant) chord in C minor.
    *   **Dm/C** (D-F-A / C in bass): D minor triad. This is the **ii$^\circ$** (supertonic) in C natural minor (if A is natural) or **ii** in C Dorian/Melodic minor.
    *   **Bb6** (Bb-D-F-G): A Bb major chord with added 6th (G).
        *   Interpreted as a separate chord: Bb is the **$\text{VII}$** (subtonic) chord in C natural minor.
        *   A $\text{Bb6}$ can also function as a substitution for $\text{G7}$ (the dominant) if the implied harmony is $\text{Gm}$ (G minor, the v chord) or $\text{Bb}$ (the VII chord).

3.  **Analyzing the Scale and Mode:**

    Let's combine the notes present in these chords (ignoring bass notes for inversion analysis, unless they add a new pitch class):

    *   Cm: C, Eb, G
    *   Adim: A, C, Eb
    *   Eb: Eb, G, Bb
    *   Dm: D, F, A
    *   Bb6: Bb, D, F, G

    Combining all unique pitches: **C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb**

    This seven-note scale matches the **C natural minor scale** (or Aeolian mode):

    *   Tonic (1): C
    *   Minor 2 (2): D
    *   Minor 3 (b3): Eb
    *   Perfect 4 (4): F
    *   Perfect 5 (5): G
    *   Minor 6 (b6): Ab - **Wait, the chords use A natural, not Ab.**
    *   Minor 7 (b7): Bb

    **Rethinking the A:**

    The chords $\text{Adim}$ (A, C, Eb) and $\text{Dm}$ (D, F, A) clearly establish **A natural** as the 6th degree, not A-flat.

    Let's check the modes of the minor key that use **A natural** as the 6th degree (A $\natural$ is the raised 6th degree relative to natural minor's A$\flat$).

    *   **C Dorian Mode:** C, D, Eb, F, G, **A$\natural$**, Bb (minor tonic + raised 6th).
        *   *Chords in C Dorian:* Cm, Dm, Eb, F, Gm, $\text{A}^\circ$ (A-C-Eb), $\text{Bb}$.
        *   *Matching our chords:*
            *   Cm (Matches)
            *   Eb (Matches)
            *   Dm ($\text{ii}$ chord in Dorian - Matches)
            *   Bb6 ($\text{VII}$ chord - Matches)
            *   Adim ($\text{A}^\circ$ is vii$^\circ$ in Dorian - Matches, though most sources list it as $\text{A}^\circ$ in the key of G minor, the Dorian mode is derived from the $\text{Bb}$ major scale, and its $\text{vi}^{\circ}$ chord is A diminished.)

    **The presence of A natural (A$\natural$) and Bb is the key characteristic of the Dorian mode (the minor mode with a raised 6th).**

    *   *(Note on Adim/C: While Adim can be the $\text{vii}^\circ$ in $\text{C}$ minor harmonic (A natural is not the root of that chord), here it functions as a strong indication that A natural is the diatonic 6th degree, as $\text{A}^\circ$ is the vi$^\circ$ chord in C Dorian.)*

### Conclusion

Based on the tonic **Cm** and the use of the chords **Dm** and $\text{A}^\circ$ (Adim), which establish the minor quality and the crucial **A natural** (raised 6th degree) and **Bb** (minor 7th degree), the key and mode are:

**Key:** **C**
**Mode:** **Dorian** ($\text{C}$ Dorian)
