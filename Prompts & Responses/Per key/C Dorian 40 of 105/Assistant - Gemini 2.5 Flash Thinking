### Reasoning

**Assessing Chord Functionality**

I've been meticulously dissecting the chord progression. Pinpointing the diminished chords, especially the Adim/C, is proving key. The bass movement really makes this stand out. My latest thought is the harmonic function, and how it informs the overall key and mode.


**Investigating Key Determinants**

I'm now prioritizing the resolution of that Dm/C chord, and comparing with the Bb6. It's becoming evident that we might have some modal mixture at play, perhaps a borrowing from the parallel major or harmonic minor. The consistent Cm cadence is still the primary harmonic anchor, of course.


**Considering Harmonic Contexts**

Alright, I'm now leaning toward the viÂ° in C minor, considering the A natural. Exploring the implications of this altered chord, and considering a jazz minor influence now feels necessary to fully grasp it. I should verify the bass movement with the other chords to see how the overall feeling is.


**Defining the Harmonic Structure**

I'm now zeroing in on the melodic minor or dorian nature of the progression, given the A natural. The Adim/C chord is central to this. Also, the Dm/C chord is clarifying the use of the A natural. The key is clearly C minor, but the mode now seems heavily influenced by the raised 6th.


**Evaluating Mode and Function**

I'm now completely engrossed in the Dorian interpretation, with the raised 6th being the key. The use of the Adim/C and Dm/C clearly support this. Furthermore, I've confirmed that the Bb6 fits perfectly. I can verify this against the C Dorian scale: C-D-Eb-F-G-A-Bb.




This chord progression is firmly rooted in the key area of C minor. However, the specific altered chords used reveal that it is functioning within a specific minor mode rather than standard Aeolian (natural minor) or Harmonic minor.

## 1. Determine the Tonic and Quality

*   **Tonic (Tonal Center):** The progression starts and ends on **Cm** and revolves around it. This establishes **C** as the tonic.
*   **Quality:** The use of Cm establishes a **minor** tonality.

## 2. Analyze the Chords and Scale Degrees

To determine the mode, we must look at the non-diatonic chords for C Natural Minor (C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb).

| Chord | Function / Notes | Relation to C | Analysis |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Cm** | i | C-Eb-G | Tonic Minor (i) |
| **Adim/C** | $\text{vi}^{\circ}$ (inverted) | A-C-Eb (Bass C) | The crucial note here is **A natural** ($\text{A}\natural$). In C natural minor, the 6th degree is $A\flat$. |
| **Eb/Bb** | $\flat$III | Eb-G-Bb (Bass Bb) | Subdominant in C minor. |
| **Dm/C** | ii | D-F-A$\natural$ (Bass C) | D minor uses **A natural**. In C natural minor, the ii chord is D diminished (D-F-A$\flat$). |
| **Bb6** | $\flat$VII | Bb-D-F-G | Diatonic Seventh (flat VII). Contains G, the 5th of C. |

## 3. Identify the Key and Mode

The presence of the tonic Cm (i), the $\text{Eb}$ major ($\flat$III), and the $\text{Bb}$ major ($\flat$VII) confirms the general $\text{C}$ minor framework.

The defining characteristic is the consistent use of the **A natural** degree (the raised 6th degree) in the Adim (A-C-Eb) and Dm (D-F-A) chords.

The C minor scale that contains the degrees $1(\text{C}), \flat 3 (\text{Eb}), 6 (\text{A}\natural), \text{and } \flat 7 (\text{Bb})$ is the **C Dorian Mode**.

*   **C Dorian Scale:** C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb
*   (i) Cm
*   (ii) Dm (Matches Dm/C)
*   ($\text{vi}^{\circ}$) $\text{A}^{\circ}$ (Matches Adim/C)
*   ($\flat$III) Eb
*   ($\flat$VII) Bb

## Conclusion

*   **Key:** C
*   **Mode:** Dorian (C Dorian)
