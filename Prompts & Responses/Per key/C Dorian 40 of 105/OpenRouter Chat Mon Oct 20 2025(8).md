### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I’m looking into a specific chord progression in C minor. The chords are: Cm, Adim/C, and Eb/Bb. For Cm, the notes are C, Eb, G. For Adim/C, I see it's an A, C, Eb triad over C, essentially acting like a C7b9 without G. Then there's Eb/Bb, which gives us an Eb major with Bb in the bass, appearing like a Bb sus4 add6. Also, the Dm/C functions as a D minor triad over C bass, resembling a C13sus b9.**Exploring C minor chords**

In the key of C minor, Dm is the ii chord (D, F, A), but in harmonic minor, it becomes D diminished. Looking at the natural minor scale, the diatonic triads are: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, and Bb. So, Dm isn’t diatonic. In ascending melodic minor, the ii chord becomes Dm7. It seems like in harmonic minor, D is diminished with D, F, Ab. If I raise Ab to A, Dm/C then incorporates A natural, which ties back to the leading tone.**Analyzing A natural in C minor**

In C minor, raising A natural serves as the #6 tone. In classical music, the ascending melodic minor features A natural and B natural, while in harmonic minor, the focus is on raising the 7th to B natural instead. So, A natural signals the use of melodic minor. The Adim chord (A, C, Eb) forms a diminished triad based on this raised 6, making it the vi° triad in C melodic minor. With C in the bass, it’s in first inversion.**Understanding chord inversions**

Adim/C puts C in the bass, making it the first inversion of the Adim triad. The root position is A, and the second inversion would have Eb in the bass. Eb/Bb is the III chord with Bb as its 5th in the bass. Dm/C reintroduces the Dm triad with C as a pedal note. The Bb6 chord functions as bVII6, creating a diatonic connection to C natural minor. Both A natural and Bb appear here, but in ascending melodic minor, we find B natural instead of Bb.**Determining key and mode**

So, I’m noticing both Bb and B are part of the chords, but B natural hasn't shown up yet. The chords suggest a C Dorian scale (C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb), which contains A and Bb. After verifying each chord and their functions, it seems all are diatonic to C Dorian. The chords include Cm, Adim/C as vi°, Eb/Bb as III6/4, Dm/C, and Bb6 as bVII6. Thus, the key center is C, with the mode as Dorian, supported by the presence of the raised 6th.

C Dorian.

- Tonic center is C (pedal C appears often).
- Chords fit C Dorian scale: C D Eb F G A Bb.
  - Cm = i
  - Adim/C = vi°6
  - Eb/Bb = bIII6/4
  - Dm/C = ii over tonic pedal
  - Bb6 = bVII(add6)

### Reasoning

**Exploring chord theory**

I'm grappling with the C7b9 chord, trying to break it down. So, in C minor, the diminished triad on A might relate to the melodic minor scale. I realize that in C harmonic minor, the diminished triad is built on the leading tone B. 

When I look at A diminished, it’s A C Eb, and I’m noting that A is not part of the harmonic minor since there’s Ab. So, I deduce that A natural indicates I’m using melodic minor!**Analyzing chord transitions**

I'm digging into the relationship between the chords Adim/C and Cm. They share C and Eb, while G and A alternate as the third voice, creating smooth voice leading. It seems typical for Cm to transition to Adim/C like this. So, G to A is an upward step followed by a return to G, making it a passing chord with C in the bass.

Then, I look at Eb over Bb, which suggests a second inversion. I think this makes it function as either V of Eb or IV of C minor, since Bb acts as the VII in natural minor.**Examining chord relationships**

The Eb/Bb chord has Bb in the bass, which might suggest a IV chord. Then I consider Dm/C, where Dm (D F A) is built over a C bass. This D minor triad isn't diatonic to C natural or harmonic minor, since F and A are part of the melodic minor.

I realize that Dm is the ii minor triad in ascending melodic minor, possibly forming a Dm7. When I look at Dm/C, it results in a C major 9 sus, suggesting notes that fall into a C6sus4(add9) structure—still diatonic to C melodic minor. Then there's the Bb6 chord: Bb D F G.**Understanding C melodic minor**

In C melodic minor, Bb acts as the b7, leading me to the Bb major chord with a raised sixth. The ascending melodic minor scale goes C D Eb F G A B, confirming that there's no E. Hence, the diatonic chord on Bb is indeed Bb major, with the notes Bb D F; adding G gives us Bb6.

This confirms that Bb6 is diatonic to C melodic minor. So, the key is C minor, specifically C melodic minor. Although, "mode" might mean aeolian or dorian in other contexts. Still, there's no B natural here, just A and F.**Clarifying the chord relationships**

I'm exploring the mix between C melodic minor and C Dorian. I notice both Bb and A natural are present in the chords, especially in Eb/Bb and Bb6. While C melodic minor ascends with B natural, using Eb/Bb includes Bb, along with other diatonic chords. 

This suggests that chords with Bb may be borrowed from C Dorian or C natural minor since C Dorian contains both A natural and Bb. 

Eventually, I determine the mode is C Dorian, which fits perfectly with all the chords! So, I can summarize: "C Dorian (C minor with natural 6), the second mode of Bb major."

C Dorian (C minor with natural 6). 
- Tonal center is C (pedal C and repeated Cm). 
- Chords fit C Dorian: Cm (i), Adim/C (vi°), Eb/Bb (III), Dm/C (ii over C), Bb6 (VII6). 
- Presence of A natural and Bb (no B natural) confirms Dorian rather than harmonic/melodic minor.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking at a chord progression and trying to identify the key and mode. It repeats C minor a lot, which implies it’s likely in C minor.

The Adim/C chord features an A diminished triad with a C bass, indicating it's part of C minor diatonic. But wait—this A diminished chord doesn’t fit into the C natural minor scale, since A isn't part of it! 

In C natural minor, the seventh scale degree would actually be B diminished. I need to clarify this.**Examining C minor and its scales**

I’m analyzing the C natural minor scale and trying to figure out its notes. In C natural minor, A♭ is present, while A natural appears in the melodic and harmonic minor scales—wait, which one? 

In C harmonic minor, the scale features A♭, while the melodic minor scale ascending has A natural and B natural. An A diminished triad (A C E♭) uses A natural and is relevant in the context of C melodic minor. 

Is A diminished functioning as a ii° or perhaps a vii° in relation to B♭? I need to clarify this!**Clarifying chord functions**

I’m checking the relationships between chords in the progression. The leading-tone diminished triad to B♭ includes A, C, and E♭, so yes, Adim is vii°/B♭, functioning as the leading-tone chord. But does it resolve to B♭? 

I notice there’s an E♭/B♭ followed by a Dm/C, plus a B♭6 chord later, which is likely a B♭ major 6 (B♭ D F G). In the context of C minor, B♭ serves as the VII chord. So it makes sense to see this progression. Also, E♭/B♭ is the second inversion of E♭ major.**Analyzing chord functions in C minor**

Actually, the E♭/B♭ chord suggests an E♭ chord (E♭ G B♭) played over a B♭ bass, functioning as a V inversion. In C minor, E♭ is the III chord, and E♭/B♭ might act as the V of A♭. 

This E♭/B♭ is in second inversion, which often serves as a passing or cadential chord. Then I see Dm/C, which is a D minor triad (D F A) over a C bass, bringing in the melodic minor flavor. 

With those repeating C minor pillars, I think the overall key is likely C melodic minor.**Determining key and mode**

The user wants me to identify the key and mode, likely implying C minor with an Aeolian mode. But the presence of A natural and B natural changes things. 

From the chords, I gather pitches: C, D, E♭, F, G, A, and B♭, but I don’t see a B natural. The scale formed is C, D, E♭, F, G, A, and B♭, which fits C Dorian perfectly! 

So I can conclude the key is C Dorian, emphasizing its raised sixth (A natural), while still being part of B♭ major’s key signature. The final answer would be: C Dorian mode or "B♭ major key signature, with a modal center on C."

C Dorian.

- Tonal center is C (repeated Cm and final cadence).
- Pitch collection implied: C D Eb F G A Bb (A natural and Bb together = Dorian).
- Chords fit C Dorian diatonic set: i (Cm), vi° (Adim/C), bIII (Eb/Bb), ii (Dm/C), bVII (Bb6).

### Key and Mode Analysis

The provided chord progression (Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm) is a repetitive sequence that strongly centers on **C minor** as the tonic key. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

#### 1. **Overall Structure and Tonic**
   - The progression repeatedly returns to **Cm** (C minor triad: C–Eb–G) as the foundational and resolving chord, appearing 10 times. This establishes **C** as the tonal center.
   - It ends on Bb6 resolving to Cm, reinforcing Cm as the point of rest (like a plagal cadence: Bb6 as a decorated subdominant/pre-dominant leading to i).
   - The pattern is symmetrical and loop-like, suggesting a minor-key ballad, jazz standard, or pop/rock progression with chromatic flavor (common in minor keys for tension/release).

#### 2. **Diatonic Fit in C Minor**
   - **Key Signature**: C minor (natural minor scale: C–D–Eb–F–G–Ab–Bb; 3 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab).
   - **Mode**: **Minor (Aeolian)**. The tonic is a minor chord (Cm), and the harmony emphasizes minor-third sonorities without strong major-mode lifts (e.g., no pivot to Eb major as tonic).
     - No evidence of Dorian (which would emphasize a raised 6th, like D major chords) or Phrygian (emphasizing lowered 2nd, like Db). Harmonic minor influences appear via raised leading tones (e.g., A natural in Adim and Dm), but the core is Aeolian.
   - Diatonic chords matching C minor:
     - **Cm**: i (tonic, diatonic).
     - **Eb/Bb**: III6 (Eb major in 1st inversion; diatonic, provides a momentary major lift common in minor keys).
     - **Bb6**: VII6 (Bb major with added 6th: Bb–D–F–G; diatonic, functions as a subdominant or pre-dominant with the added G for color, similar to a V7/III setup).
   - This fits a typical minor-key progression: i – [chromatic passing] – i – III – [chromatic] – i – [repeat] – VII6 – i.

#### 3. **Chromatic Elements**
   - **Adim/C** (A diminished triad over C bass: bass C + A–C–Eb): Not fully diatonic. A–C–Eb implies A natural (raised 7th, ♯7), borrowed from C harmonic minor (C–D–Eb–F–G–Ab–B) or acting as a leading-tone diminished chord (vii°/ii or passing to Dm). It adds tension, resolving back to Cm. The /C bass keeps it rooted in the key.
   - **Dm/C** (D minor triad over C bass: bass C + D–F–A): Partially chromatic. D–F–A uses A natural (♯7 again), suggesting a secondary ii chord or Neapolitan-like flavor, but over C bass it creates a suspended/voiced minor 9th-ish sound (C–D–F–A). This is common in jazz/folk minor progressions for color, not a key change.
   - These chromatics (A♮) don't shift the key; they enhance the minor mode's emotional depth without establishing a new tonic.

#### 4. **Why Not Other Keys/Modes?**
   - **Eb Major** (relative major): Possible for brief III (Eb), but Cm dominates as tonic (not vi), and chromatics like Adim/Dm don't fit cleanly (A♮ isn't diatonic).
   - **C Major**: Unlikely; no strong major I (C major) resolution, and Eb/Bb pulls minor-ward.
   - **G Minor** (relative to Bb): Too remote; doesn't explain Cm as tonic.
   - **Modal Variants**:
     - Not Dorian (no sustained D major or raised 6th emphasis).
     - Not Harmonic Minor dominant (no full G7/B as V).
     - Not Phrygian (no flattened 2nd like Db chords).
   - If this is from a specific song (e.g., resembles parts of "Don't Know Why" by Norah Jones or minor jazz etudes), it aligns with C minor frameworks.

#### 5. **Functional Harmony Summary**
   - **i (Cm)**: Tonic/rest.
   - **Adim/C**: Chromatic passing diminished (like vii°/V or tension builder to i).
   - **Eb/Bb**: III (mediant, brightens the minor mood).
   - **Dm/C**: Chromatic ii (supertonic variant with ♯7, leading back to i).
   - **Bb6**: VII6 (subdominant extension, resolves to i).
   - Overall: A brooding, cyclical minor progression (e.g., like i – vii°/i – i – III – ii – i – VII – i), evoking melancholy or introspection.

If this is from a specific piece or you have more context (e.g., melody notes or genre), I can refine this further!

C Dorian

This progression is built entirely from the notes of the C Dorian scale (C D Eb F G A Bb), with no Ab (the minor 6th) present despite the minor tonic chord. Key chord functions include i (Cm), ii (Dm), bIII (Eb), VII (Bb6), and passing diminished harmony (Adim, functioning as an approach to VII). The repetitive structure and bass pedal on C reinforce the modal center.

### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Progression**

\n\n

I'm starting by breaking down the user's chord progression request. My initial thought is to map out each chord, including inversions, to understand their harmonic function within the sequence. Then, I'll identify any potential modulations or key changes. The goal is to build a solid foundation before diving deeper into melodic and rhythmic analysis.


**Assessing Harmonic Function**

\n\n

I've begun assigning Roman numerals to each chord, trying to understand their relationships within C minor. The `Adim/C` chords are particularly interesting; they function as leading tones, creating tension. The `Eb/Bb` and `Bb6` chords seem like they're borrowing from the relative major, Eb major. The `Dm/C` is still a puzzle - it's likely a passing chord. I'm focusing on identifying the cadences and how each chord contributes to the overall narrative.


**Exploring Unexpected Resolutions**

\n\n

My investigation continues, now focused on the dissonant chords. Specifically, I'm examining the role of `Adim/C`. It strongly suggests a move to `Cm`, creating a half-diminished feel. I need to pinpoint the exact function and how it resolves each time. I'm also considering the implications of the "borrowed" chords, like `Eb/Bb` and how they create movement between the tonic and relative major.


**Decoding Chromatic Alterations**

\n\n

My current focus is unraveling the chromatic elements within the progression. I've pinpointed the `Adim/C` as a key point, likely serving a dominant function of the relative major, or perhaps a chromatic passing chord. I'm exploring the voice leading to see how the A natural interacts with the surrounding notes, like the Eb in `Cm`. I'm starting to see how the Dm in `Dm/C` serves a melodic function, adding colour to the progression.


**Deciphering Chord Function**

\n\n

My current focus is on the `Dm/C`. I now understand it's a `ii` chord from the C melodic minor scale, adding a unique color. The `Adim/C` is a clear chromatic element. It is serving a function as either a leading tone or a tension chord. I'm exploring the voice leading to see how the A natural in `Adim/C` affects the following `Cm` chords, and how it relates to the Bb6.


**Refining Chord Analysis**

\n\n

My current focus is on the `Eb/Bb` chord. It functions as a pivot, suggesting a temporary shift toward the relative major. I'm exploring the voice leading from `Eb/Bb` to the following `Dm/C`, examining the smooth bass movement. I'm now also looking at how the `Bb6` resolves, further clarifying the overall direction.


**Mapping the Chordal Landscape**

\n\n

I'm now zeroing in on the harmonic function and relationships between chords, particularly the altered ones like the `Adim/C`. I'm trying to decipher how these chords function within the C minor framework and how they interact with the more diatonic elements of the progression. The chromatic aspects keep adding new layers to the overall harmonic texture.


**Mapping Harmonic Relationships**

\n\n

My analysis focuses on how the `Dm/C` fits into the sequence. My assessment is that it provides a specific melodic flavour, using the `ii` chord from C melodic minor. It is functioning as a pivot point and a suspension of the tonic. The harmonic flow builds tension, which resolves back to the tonic. I'm starting to visualize this progression's unique, minor-key character.


**Mapping Tonal Centers**

\n\n

My analysis has refined my understanding of the `Dm/C` chord. It functions as a `ii` chord from the C melodic minor scale, adding a distinct colour and leading to a unique harmonic movement. I am now concentrating on the bass movement to understand its suspension. The `Bb6` also adds a unique character.




Based on an analysis of the chords, here is the determination of the key and mode:

*   **Key:** **C**
*   **Mode:** **Minor**

---

### Detailed Analysis:

1.  **Tonic Chord:** The progression repeatedly begins, ends, and returns to **Cm**. This firmly establishes **Cm** as the tonic chord, making **C** the tonal center of the piece.

2.  **Diatonic Chords:** Several chords fit perfectly within the key of C minor. The C natural minor scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.
    *   **Cm (i):** The tonic chord.
    *   **Eb/Bb (III):** The `III` chord (Eb Major) in C minor. It is the relative major. The `Bb` in the bass creates a second inversion, which leads smoothly.
    *   **Bb6 (VII):** The `VII` chord (Bb Major). The added 6th (the note G) is the 5th of the C minor scale, strengthening its connection back to the tonic.

3.  **Chromatic/Borrowed Chords:** The progression uses notes from outside the C natural minor scale, which is very common in minor key harmony. This is called modal mixture.
    *   **Adim/C (A, C, Eb):** This chord introduces an **A natural**. In C minor, the diatonic 6th degree is Ab. The A natural is the *raised 6th* degree, borrowed from the **C Melodic Minor** or **C Dorian** modes. Its function here is a chromatic color chord over a C tonic pedal, creating tension that resolves back to the pure Cm chord.
    *   **Dm/C (D, F, A):** This chord also uses the **A natural**. A Dm chord is the `ii` chord in C Melodic Minor. In C natural minor, the `ii` chord would be D diminished (D, F, Ab). Using Dm creates a brighter, more fluid sound. Placing it over a C in the bass makes it a `ii` chord over a tonic pedal.

### Conclusion:

The key is definitively **C minor**.

The progression is not strictly one minor scale. It uses a **blend of the natural minor and melodic minor scales**:
*   It uses the **C Natural Minor** scale for its foundational `i` (Cm), `III` (Eb), and `VII` (Bb) chords.
*   It borrows the raised 6th degree (A♮) from **C Melodic Minor** to create the more colorful `Adim/C` and `Dm/C` chords. This avoidance of the traditional dominant (G7) and use of chords from different minor modes is characteristic of modern pop, jazz, and funk harmony.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down step by step.

First, I need to list out all the chords clearly. I see Cm repeated a lot, so that's probably the tonic. Then there's Adim/C. Hmm, Adim is A diminished, but the slash means the bass note is C. So Adim/C is A diminished with C in the bass. Diminished chords are usually built on the seventh degree, so Adim would typically be in the key of Bb or something. But here it's Adim/C, so maybe it's functioning as a chord with C as the root? Wait, Adim/C is actually the same as Cdim7 if you rearrange the notes. Let me check that.

A diminished triad is A-C-Eb. With C as the bass, the notes are C, A, C, Eb? Wait, no. Adim/C would have C as the lowest note, so the notes are C (bass), A, C, Eb? But a diminished chord has a minor third and diminished fifth. Adim is A-C-Eb. So Adim/C is C, A, Eb. That's actually a C diminished seventh chord because C-Eb-Gb-Bbb (but Bbb is A). Cdim7 is C-Eb-Gb-Bbb, which is enharmonically A. So Adim/C is actually Cdim7. Yeah, because A-C-Eb with C in bass is C-Eb-A. But C-Eb-A isn't a standard diminished chord. Wait, maybe I'm confusing things.

Alternatively, diminished chords in minor keys often act as leading tones. In C minor, the leading tone chord is B diminished (B-D-F). But here it's A diminished. A diminished would be the ii° in G minor, but let's see.

Let me write out the chords again:

1. Cm
2. Cm
3. Adim/C
4. Adim/C
5. Cm
6. Cm
7. Eb/Bb
8. Dm/C
9. Cm
10. Cm
11. Adim/C
12. Adim/C
13. Cm
14. Cm
15. Bb6
16. Cm

So the progression has a lot of Cm, which is a strong indicator that C minor is the key. The other chords: Adim/C, Eb/Bb, Dm/C, Bb6.

Let me figure out what Adim/C is. Adim is A-C-Eb. With C in the bass, the notes are C, A, Eb. So the chord is C, Eb, A. C to Eb is a minor third, Eb to A is an augmented fourth (since A is the #11 of Eb, but here it's the third note). Wait, C-Eb-A. The interval from C to A is a major sixth. So C-Eb-A is Cm6? No, Cm6 is C-Eb-G-A. Here we have C-Eb-A without the G. So it's a Cm add b6? Or perhaps it's functioning as a secondary dominant.

Alternatively, in the key of C minor, the diatonic chords are:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII: Bb

But in harmonic minor, the v becomes G major, and the VII is Bb. The raised seventh leads to tonic, so the leading tone chord is B°.

But here we have Adim/C. A diminished chord in C minor? A is not a diatonic note in C natural minor (which has Bb). C natural minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So the notes A natural would be in the harmonic or melodic minor. In C harmonic minor, the notes are C D Eb F G Ab B. So the seventh is B natural. Then the chord on A would be A diminished (A-C-Eb), which is the ii° in G minor, but in C minor, the chord on A would be the bVI°? Wait, in C harmonic minor, the chords are:

i: Cm

ii°: D° (D-F-Ab)

III+: Eb aug (Eb-G-Bb)

iv: Fm

V: G (since leading tone is B)

vi°: Adim (A-C-Eb) — yes! In C harmonic minor, the sixth degree chord is A diminished. Because the sixth note is Ab in natural minor, but in harmonic minor, the seventh is raised to B natural, so the scale is C D Eb F G Ab B. Wait, no: C harmonic minor is C D Eb F G Ab B. So the sixth is Ab, not A. Wait, natural minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. Harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B. So the sixth is still Ab. Therefore, the chord on A natural would not be diatonic. Unless it's a borrowed chord.

Wait, but Adim is A-C-Eb. In C harmonic minor, we have Ab, not A. So A natural is not in the scale. So Adim would be a chord from another mode.

Alternatively, maybe the progression is using the Dorian mode. C Dorian is C D Eb F G A Bb. So the chords would include Dm (i), Em (ii), F (III), Gm (iv), Am (v), Bb (VI), C (VII). But Adim isn't there.

Wait, in C Dorian, the sixth is A natural, so the chord on A would be Am, not Adim. Adim has a minor third and diminished fifth, so A-C-Eb. The Eb is the minor third of C, but in A, Eb is the diminished fifth (since A to Eb is a diminished fifth). So Adim is A-C-Eb.

In C natural minor, the notes are C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So A natural isn't present. Adim would require A-C-Eb, but Ab is in the scale, not A. So Adim is chromatic.

But in the progression, Adim/C is used. So maybe it's acting as a passing chord or a secondary leading tone chord.

Let's consider Adim/C. As mentioned, Adim/C has notes C, A, Eb. If we consider C as the root, then the notes are C, Eb, A. This is an inverted chord. The interval from C to A is a major sixth, so it could be Cm6 (which is C-Eb-G-A), but missing the G. Without the fifth, it's ambiguous. Alternatively, it could be a dominant chord. For example, Adim is often used as a leading tone chord to Bb. Adim (A-C-Eb) functions as the vii° of Bb, leading to Bb. But here it's Adim/C, so the bass is C, which is the fifth of F. Wait, Adim is the vii° of Bb, so it would lead to Bb. But in the progression, Adim/C is followed by Cm. So Adim/C to Cm. If Adim is the vii° of Bb, leading to Bb, but here it's going to Cm, that doesn't fit.

Unless Adim/C is functioning as a chord that leads to Dm or something. Wait, after Adim/C, it's Cm. So maybe it's a passing chord.

Let me look at Eb/Bb. Eb/Bb is Eb major with Bb in the bass. So Bb is the root in the bass, so it's a Bb major chord with Eb in the bass? No, slash notation means the bass note is after the slash. So Eb/Bb means Bb is the bass note, so the chord is Eb major but with Bb as the root in the bass. Wait, no: X/Y means chord X with Y in the bass. So Eb/Bb is Eb major chord with Bb as the bass note. So the notes would be Bb (bass), Eb, G, Bb. So it's an inversion of Eb major. Eb major is the III chord in C minor (since C minor has Eb as the third note).

Similarly, Dm/C is D minor chord with C in the bass. So notes C, D, F, A. So it's a Dm7 chord without the fifth? Dm is D-F-A, so Dm/C would be C, D, F, A. Which is like a C9 chord without the third and seventh? C9 is C-E-G-Bb-D. Not quite. Alternatively, it's a first inversion Dm, but with C in the bass, it's actually a C chord with added notes. C-D-F-A. That's C11 (C-D-F-G-A), but missing the G. So C D F A is Cm7 add 9? Cm7 is C-Eb-G-Bb, so not matching.

Alternatively, Dm/C might be functioning as a ii chord in C minor, but in first inversion. In C minor, ii is D diminished, not D minor. So Dm is not diatonic in natural minor. In natural minor, the iv chord is Fm, v is Gm. Wait, in C natural minor, the diatonic chords are:

i: Cm (C-Eb-G)

ii°: Ddim (D-F-Ab)

III: Eb (Eb-G-Bb)

iv: Fm (F-Ab-C)

v: Gm (G-Bb-D)

VI: Ab (Ab-C-Eb)

VII: Bb (Bb-D-F)

So Dm is not diatonic. Dm would have F natural, but in C minor, the sixth scale degree is Ab, so F is natural? Wait no: C natural minor scale is C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So F is natural. Wait, yes: in C minor, the notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So F is natural. So the iv chord is Fm (F-Ab-C), but F natural as root with Ab and C is F minor. So yes, Fm is iv.

But the v chord is Gm (G-Bb-D). So D is the fifth of Gm. The ii chord is Ddim (D-F-Ab). So Dm (D-F-A) would require A natural, which is not in the scale (it's Ab). So Dm is chromatic, borrowing from harmonic minor or melodic minor.

In C harmonic minor, the scale is C D Eb F G Ab B. So the fifth is G, which becomes G major (V), and the seventh is B natural. The chord on D would be Ddim (D-F-Ab), same as natural minor. Chord on A: A is not in the scale (Ab is), so Adim isn't diatonic.

Wait, in harmonic minor, the sixth is still Ab. So A natural isn't present. Therefore, Adim (which has A natural) isn't diatonic to C harmonic minor. Unless it's a borrowed chord.

Perhaps the progression is in C minor, but using some chromatic chords. Let's consider the most frequent chord: Cm. That's likely the tonic.

Then Adim/C appears multiple times. Let's figure out what Adim/C is. As chords, Adim is A-C-Eb. With C in bass, so the notes are C, A, Eb. Now, C-Eb is a minor third, Eb-A is an augmented fourth (tritone). So this chord has a tritone between Eb and A. Tritones are characteristic of dominant chords. In fact, a dominant seventh chord has a tritone (e.g., G7: B and F). Here, Eb and A form a tritone (since A is #11 of Eb, but as an interval, it's a diminished fifth or augmented fourth).

But Eb to A is a perfect fourth, wait: Eb to A is an augmented fourth (since from Eb to Ab is perfect fourth, A is a half step up, so augmented fourth). Yes, Eb to A is augmented fourth. So the chord C-A-Eb has a tritone (Eb-A). This is similar to a dominant chord. For example, Bb7 has D and Ab, which is a tritone. Not the same.

Wait, the tritone in a dominant chord is between the 3rd and 7th. For example, G7: B (3rd) and F (7th) form a tritone. So in this chord C-A-Eb, if we take A as the 3rd and Eb as the 7th, then the root would be... the 3rd of a dominant chord is a major third above the root. So if A is the third, root is F (since F-A is major third). Then the seventh would be Eb, which is a minor seventh above F. So F7 is F-A-C-Eb. Yes! So F7 is F (root), A (third), C (fifth), Eb (seventh). Therefore, the notes C, A, Eb are actually the fifth, third, and seventh of F7. So Adim/C is an inversion of F7, specifically F7 in third inversion (with Eb in bass? Wait, F7 is F-A-C-Eb. So inversions:

Root: F-A-C-Eb

First: A-C-Eb-F

Second: C-Eb-F-A

Third: Eb-F-A-C

So Adim/C, which is C-A-Eb, would correspond to C-Eb-A, which is the second inversion of F7 (C-Eb-F-A, but missing F). Wait, if it's C-A-Eb, that's C, A, Eb. F7 is F-A-C-Eb. So C-A-Eb are three notes of F7: C (5th), A (3rd), Eb (7th). Missing the root F. So it's an incomplete F7 chord. But in the progression, it's written as Adim/C, which emphasizes A-C-Eb with C bass. But functionally, it might be acting as F7, a dominant chord.

If that's the case, then F7 would be the V7 of Bb. Because F is the fifth of Bb. So F7 should lead to Bb. But in the progression, Adim/C (functioning as F7) is followed by Cm. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's look at the progression:

... Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm ...

After Adim/C, it goes back to Cm. If Adim/C is F7, but it's resolving to Cm instead of Bb, that would be a deceptive cadence or something. But F7 to Cm is not a standard resolution. Unless it's a secondary dominant.

Maybe it's V7/vi or something. In C minor, vi is Ab. V7/vi would be Eb7. Not F7.

Alternatively, if the chord is functioning as a leading tone chord to Bb. Adim is the vii° of Bb, since Bb's leading tone is A. So Adim (A-C-Eb) is Bb's vii° chord. Therefore, Adim would resolve to Bb. But in the progression, Adim/C is followed by Cm, not Bb. However, later in the progression, we have Eb/Bb and Dm/C, then Bb6.

Let's list the chords with their functions if in C minor:

- Cm: i

- Eb/Bb: this is Eb major with Bb bass. Eb is III in C minor. Bb is the VII, so Eb/Bb might be emphasizing the Bb as a dominant, but in minor, Bb is usually a subdominant function (iv or VII).

Wait, in minor keys, the VII chord (Bb in C minor) is often used as a dominant substitute, but it's not major unless borrowed. In natural minor, VII is Bb major? Wait, C natural minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So the chord on Bb is Bb-D-F, which is Bb major. Yes! So in natural minor, the VII chord is major. So Bb is a major chord, function as subtonic.

So Eb/Bb: Eb is III, Bb is VII. So Eb/Bb is the III chord in second inversion (since Bb is the fifth of Eb? Eb major is Eb-G-Bb. So the fifth is Bb. So Eb/Bb is Eb major with Bb in bass, which is second inversion. So it's III in second inversion.

Dm/C: Dm is D-F-A. In C minor, the note D is part of the scale (second degree), but Dm would require A natural. In natural minor, the sixth is Ab, so A natural is not present. So Dm is actually the ii chord in C harmonic minor? Wait, in harmonic minor, the scale has B natural, but sixth is still Ab. So A is not natural. Therefore, Dm (D-F-A) is not diatonic. It might be the ii chord in C melodic minor ascending, which is C D Eb F G A B. So in ascending melodic minor, the sixth and seventh are raised, so A natural is present. Therefore, Dm would be diatonic in C melodic minor.

C melodic minor ascending: C D Eb F G A B. So the ii chord is Dm (D-F-A). Yes. So Dm/C is D minor first inversion? Or with C bass.

Bb6: Bb major with a sixth. Typically, Bb6 would be Bb-D-F-G (since sixth is G). But in notation, "Bb6" can sometimes mean Bb added sixth, which is Bb major plus sixth (G). So Bb6 is Bb-D-F-G.

Now, putting it all together:

The progression has a lot of Cm (i), Adim/C which might relate to Bb (VII), Eb/Bb (III in second inversion), Dm/C (ii), and Bb6.

In C natural minor, the harmonies would be i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

But here we have Dm instead of ii°, which suggests melodic minor (ascending). Also, Adim/C: in melodic minor ascending, the sixth is A natural, so Adim wouldn't be there. Adim has Eb, which is the minor third. Wait, Adim is A-C-Eb. In C melodic minor (ascending), the notes are C D Eb F G A B, so Eb is present (third degree), A is present (sixth). So chord on A would be A diminished? A-C-Eb: yes, because from A, C is minor third, Eb is diminished fifth. So in C melodic minor, the chord on A is Adim (A-C-Eb), which is the ii° chord in G minor, but in C, it's the vi° chord? Let's see:

C melodic minor ascending: C D Eb F G A B

Chords:

i: Cm (C-Eb-G)

ii°: D° (D-F-Ab) — but in ascending melodic minor, the sixth is A natural, so Ab is not present. Wait, ascending melodic minor raises the sixth and seventh, so scale is C D Eb F G A B. So the sixth is A, seventh is B. Therefore, the chord on D would be D-F-A, which is Dm, not diminished. Because D to F is minor third, F to A is major third, so Dm.

Wait, in C melodic minor ascending:

- i: C-Eb-G (Cm)

- ii: D-F-A (Dm)

- III+: Eb-G-B (Eb aug) — because third is Eb, fifth is G (major third above Eb), but seventh is B, which is augmented fifth from Eb (Eb to B is augmented fifth). So Eb aug.

- iv: F-A-C (Fm? Wait, F to A is major third, so F-A is major, but in minor scale, the fourth chord is usually minor. Wait, F-A-C: F to A is major third (4 semitones), A to C is minor third (3 semitones), so it's an F major chord? But in the melodic minor scale, the fourth degree is F, which is a whole step above Eb. The notes F, A, C: F-A is major third (4 semitones), A-C is minor third (3 semitones), so yes, F major. But in a minor key, the iv chord is usually minor. However, in ascending melodic minor, due to the raised sixth and seventh, the fourth chord becomes major.

Wait, let's confirm with C melodic minor ascending: C D Eb F G A B C.

Chords:

i: C Eb G → Cm

ii: D F A → Dm

III: Eb G B → Eb aug (since G to B is major third, but Eb to G is major third, Eb to B is augmented fifth)

iv: F A C → F major? F-A-C: F-A is major third (4 semitones), A-C is minor third (3 semitones), so yes, F major.

v: G B D → G major (since B is natural, not Bb)

VI: A C Eb → Adim (A-C is minor third, C-Eb is minor third, so diminished)

VII: B D F → B dim

So in C melodic minor ascending, the VI chord is Adim (A-C-Eb). Yes! So Adim is diatonic as the vi° chord.

Therefore, Adim/C is the vi° chord in first inversion? Adim is A-C-Eb, so first inversion would be C-Eb-A, which is exactly Adim/C. So the bass note is C, which is the third of the Adim chord.

So Adim/C is the first inversion of the vi° chord in C melodic minor.

Then, the progression makes sense in C melodic minor (ascending) because:

- Cm is i

- Adim/C is vi° first inversion

- Eb/Bb: Eb is III, but in melodic minor, III is augmented (Eb-G-B), but here it's Eb major (Eb-G-Bb). Wait, in the chord given, it's Eb/Bb. Eb major is Eb-G-Bb. In melodic minor ascending, the B is natural, so Bb is not present. Therefore, Eb major would not be diatonic; it should be Eb augmented (Eb-G-B). So this is a problem.

Hmm, maybe the key is C harmonic minor instead.

In C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim (D-F-Ab)

III+: Eb aug (Eb-G-B)

iv: Fm (F-Ab-C)

v°: Gdim? Wait, no: G-B-? In harmonic minor, the fifth chord is G major (G-B-D) because the seventh is raised to B natural. Wait, yes:

- v: G major (G-B-D)

VI: Ab (Ab-C-Eb)

VII°: Bdim (B-D-F)

So in harmonic minor, III is augmented, v is major.

But the progression has Eb major (Eb/Bb is Eb with Bb bass), which would be Eb-G-Bb. But in harmonic minor, III should be Eb augmented (Eb-G-B). So Eb major is not diatonic; it's missing the raised fifth (B natural).

Unless the progression is using the natural minor for some chords and harmonic for others.

The chord Eb/Bb: Eb major with Bb bass. In natural minor, III is Eb major (Eb-G-Bb), which is diatonic. In harmonic minor, III is augmented.

So if we consider the progression to be in C natural minor, then:

- Cm: i

- Adim/C: this chord isn't diatonic, since in natural minor, the sixth is Ab, so chord on A natural isn't present.

But earlier we saw that in melodic minor ascending, Adim is diatonic as vi°.

But Eb/Bb in melodic minor ascending should be Eb augmented, but it's Eb major here.

Perhaps the progression is mixing modes. Alternatively, the Eb/Bb is actually functioning as a IV chord in G minor or something, but that might complicate.

Another approach: let's look at the bass notes because of the slash chords.

The bass line is: C, C, C, C, C, C, Bb, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, Bb, C.

So mostly C bass, with Bb appearing at Eb/Bb and Bb6.

Wait, Eb/Bb has Bb in bass, and Bb6 probably has Bb in bass (since it's Bb6, not something else).

So the bass notes are C throughout most, except when on Eb/Bb (bass Bb) and Bb6 (bass Bb).

So the chords with Bb bass are Eb/Bb and Bb6.

Eb/Bb is Bb in bass, Eb major chord. So the harmony is Eb over Bb bass, meaning the chord is Bb with added notes? Or it's Eb chord in second inversion.

Similarly, Bb6 is Bb with sixth (G), so Bb-D-F-G.

Now, let's consider the overall harmonic movement.

The progression starts and ends on Cm, so Cm is tonic.

Common keys for Cm: C minor (natural, harmonic, melodic), or possibly modes like Dorian (D Dorian would have C as minor v, but here Cm is tonic so key is C).

Mode: if the tonic is C, and it's minor, then natural minor is Aeolian, harmonic minor is a variation, melodic minor ascending is another scale.

Let's list the chords and see which scale degrees they imply.

Chords:

- Cm: C Eb G — implies C minor scale (Eb is minor third)

- Adim/C: A C Eb — implies A diminished, which has C and Eb, so minor third relation to C. This chord contains Eb, which is the minor third of C.

- Eb/Bb: Eb G Bb over Bb bass — so the notes are Bb, Eb, G, Bb. So the harmony is Eb major, but bass is Bb. This suggests Bb is important, as it's the bass.

- Dm/C: D F A over C bass — notes C, D, F, A. This implies D minor harmony, with C in bass.

- Bb6: Bb D F G — Bb major with added sixth (G).

Now, let's see the scale degrees required:

- Cm requires Eb (minor third)

- Adim/C requires A natural and Eb

- Eb/Bb requires G (since Eb major has G) and Bb

- Dm/C requires F and A natural (since Dm is D F A)

- Bb6 requires D, F, G

So the notes used are: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

List them: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

That's the C natural minor scale! Because C natural minor is C D Eb F G Ab Bb. Wait, but here we have A natural, not Ab.

C D Eb F G A Bb — that's actually C Dorian mode.

Yes! Dorian mode has a minor third (Eb) and a major sixth (A). So C Dorian is C D Eb F G A Bb C.

In C Dorian:

- i: Cm (C Eb G)

- ii: Dm (D F A)

- III: Eb (Eb G Bb)

- IV: F (F A C)

- v: Gm (G Bb D)

- VI: Ab? Wait, no: Dorian scale degrees: 1,2,b3,4,5,6,b7.

So for C Dorian: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

Therefore:

- i: Cm (C Eb G)

- ii: Dm (D F A)

- III: Eb (Eb G Bb)

- IV: F (F A C) — F major

- v: Gm (G Bb D)

- VI: A diminished? Wait, chord on A: A C Eb — yes, Adim.

- VII: Bb (Bb D F)

Exactly! So in C Dorian:

- i: Cm

- ii: Dm

- III: Eb

- iv: Fm? Wait, no: fourth degree is F, chord is F-A-C, which is F major (since F to A is major third). So IV: F major

- v: Gm

- vi°: Adim (A-C-Eb)

- VII: Bb

Perfect! Now check the chords in the progression:

- Cm: i

- Adim/C: vi° (Adim) in first inversion (bass is C, which is the third of Adim)

- Eb/Bb: III (Eb) in second inversion (bass is Bb, the fifth of Eb)

- Dm/C: ii (Dm) in first inversion? Dm is D-F-A, so first inversion would be F-A-D. But here it's Dm/C, so bass is C, which is not part of Dm chord? Wait, Dm is D-F-A. Adding C would make it Dm7 (D-F-A-C). So Dm/C is Dm7 in third inversion (C bass).

- Bb6: VII (Bb) with added sixth (G). Bb6 typically means Bb-D-F-G, which is Bb added sixth, a common chord in Dorian mode.

Let's verify each chord in C Dorian:

1. Cm: i (diatonic)

2. Cm: i

3. Adim/C: vi° first inversion (Adim is A-C-Eb, bass C makes it first inversion)

4. Adim/C: same

5. Cm: i

6. Cm: i

7. Eb/Bb: III (Eb major) with Bb in bass (second inversion, since Bb is the fifth of Eb)

8. Dm/C: ii (Dm) but as Dm7 (D-F-A-C) with C in bass (third inversion)

9. Cm: i

10. Cm: i

11. Adim/C: vi° first inversion

12. Adim/C: same

13. Cm: i

14. Cm: i

15. Bb6: VII (Bb major) with added sixth (G)

16. Cm: i

This all fits perfectly in C Dorian!

Why?

- The frequent use of Dm (as Dm/C) matches ii in Dorian.

- Adim is diatonic as vi° in Dorian (whereas in natural minor it would be Ab major).

- Eb is III (major), which is diatonic in Dorian (natural minor also has III major, but Dorian has major IV too, though not used here).

- Bb is VII, and Bb6 is common in Dorian to emphasize the major sixth (A), but Bb6 adds G (the fifth scale degree), reinforcing the Dorian sound.

The presence of A natural (in Dm and Adim) instead of Ab confirms it's not natural minor (which has Ab). In natural minor, Adim wouldn't exist; it would be Ab major.

Also, in Dorian, the vi° chord (Adim in C) is a characteristic chord, often used for color.

The bass line emphasizes C and Bb, which are the tonic and subtonic (bVII), typical in Dorian.

Therefore, the key is C, and the mode is Dorian.

### 🎵 **Progression Analysis (Mapped to C Dorian)**:
| Chord       | Function in C Dorian         | Notes (including bass)       | Explanation |
|-------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Cm**      | **i (tonic)**                | C – E♭ – G                   | Repeated for emphasis — confirms **C** as the tonic root. |
| **Adim/C**  | **vi° (first inversion)**    | C (bass), A, C, E♭           | Adim = A° (A–C–E♭). Bass **C** makes it first inversion. **A natural** is a hallmark of Dorian (vs. natural minor’s A♭). |
| **Eb/Bb**   | **III (second inversion)**   | B♭ (bass), E♭, G, B♭         | E♭ major = III chord. Bass **B♭** (the 5th of E♭) = second inversion. Diatonic in Dorian. |
| **Dm/C**    | **ii (Dm7 third inversion)** | C (bass), D, F, A            | Dm = ii chord. Bass **C** = added 7th (Dm7). Confirms **A natural** (Dorian’s 6th degree). |
| **Bb6**     | **VII (added 6th)**          | B♭ – D – F – G               | B♭ = VII chord. Added 6th (G) = common Dorian coloring (vs. Aeolian’s minor 6th). |

---

### 🔑 **Why Not Natural Minor (Aeolian)?**
- **Natural minor (C Aeolian)** has **A♭**, not A natural.  
  → But **Adim** and **Dm** both require **A natural** (not A♭), ruling out Aeolian.  
- **Adim** would not exist in Aeolian (it would be A♭ major).  
- **Bb6** emphasizes the major 6th (G), which is unstable in Aeolian but core to Dorian.

---

### 🔑 **Why Not Harmonic/Melodic Minor?**
- **Harmonic minor** raises the 7th (B♮), creating major V (G) and diminished vii° (B°).  
  → Progression uses **Bb (VII)** and **Adim (vi°)**, not B° or G major → **not harmonic minor**.  
- **Melodic minor (ascending)** raises 6th/7th (A♮, B♮), but:  
  → III chord would be **E♭⁺ (augmented)**, not E♭ major (Eb/Bb).  
  → Bb6 would not fit (B♮ vs. B♭). → **not melodic minor**.

---

### 🎸 **Why Dorian Fits Perfectly**:
- **A natural** in **Adim** and **Dm** → **6th degree is major** (Dorian’s defining trait).  
- **B♭ (VII)** and **Bb6** → reinforces the **minor i–VII** cadence typical of Dorian.  
- **E♭ (III)** and **Cm (i)** → creates the characteristic **i–III** motion in Dorian (e.g., in jazz/folk).  
- **Adim** acts as a **chromatic passing chord** between Cm and other harmonies, common in Dorian progressions.

---

### 💡 **Final Verdict**:
This progression is **unambiguously in C Dorian**. The consistent use of **A natural** (in Dm and Adim), **B♭ (VII)**, and **E♭ (III)** aligns perfectly with Dorian’s scale structure — while excluding other minor modes. The repeated **Cm** tonic and **Bb6** resolution further confirm C as the tonal center.

**🎧 Listen for the "jazzy" brightness from A natural — that’s the Dorian sound!** 🎶

Let's analyze the chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**:

### Given Chord Progression:
```
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C
Cm  Cm  Eb/Bb  Dm/C
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C
Cm  Cm  Bb6   Cm
```

We’ll first identify the roots and qualities of the chords, then analyze their harmonic function.

---

### Step 1: Chord Analysis

Let’s extract chord roots and types, including voicings (like slash chords):

1. **Cm** – C minor
2. **Adim/C** – A diminished with C in the bass → notes: C, E♭, G♭ (A° = A–C–E♭; with C in bass: C, E♭, G♭) → enharmonic to **Cm6**? But functionally, it's A diminished over C.
3. **Eb/Bb** – E♭ major with Bb in the bass → Bb–Eb–Gb → this is **Bb7** (Bb–D–F–Ab) missing the D. But Eb/Bb = Bb–Eb–Gb → actually a **Bb minor** chord? No → Eb is E♭, so E♭ major with Bb in the bass: **Bb–Eb–Gb**? Wait: Gb = F♯, but in context, it’s more likely **Eb** chord (E♭–G–B♭) with **Bb in the bass**, so **Bb–Eb–G** → that’s **Bb major** chord in second inversion. (Eb/Bb = Bb–Eb–G) → So **Bb major over Bb bass = Bb major chord**. So **Eb/Bb** = **Bb major in first inversion?** Wait:  
Wait! **Eb/Bb** means Bb is the bass, chord is Eb → E♭ major = E♭–G–B♭.  
So with Bb in bass: **Bb–Eb–G** → which is **Bb–D♭–F**? No: G is major third.

Wait:  
E♭ major = E♭, G, B♭  
With Bb in bass: **Bb, Eb, G** → that’s **Bb–Eb–G**, which is a **Bb major chord** (Bb–D–F)? No — G is not D.

Wait: Bb–Eb–G → intervals: Bb to Eb = P5, Bb to G = M7 → this is actually a **Bb(add9)** without the 5th? Wait no:

Let’s spell:
- Bb = B♭
- Eb = E♭
- G = G

So the notes: **B♭, E♭, G**

- B♭ to E♭ = P4
- B♭ to G = M6

So the chord is **B♭–E♭–G** → that’s actually an **Em diminished**? No.

Wait — this is **E♭ major chord in second inversion**: E♭/B♭ = B♭–E♭–G → yes! That’s just **E♭ major** with **B♭ in the bass**. So **Eb/Bb** = **E♭ major (first inversion if Eb were in bass, but it’s second inversion if Bb is bass)**.

Wait: Chord is Eb, bass is Bb → so: **E♭** (chord): E♭–G–B♭, played with **Bb in the bass** → So notes: **Bb, Eb, G, Bb**.

So: **B♭, E♭, G** → This is **B♭–D–F**? No — G is not D.

But: **B♭, E♭, G** → this is not a Bb major chord (which is Bb–D–F). Here we have a **G natural**, which is **not in Bb major**. D is missing.

But G is the **major 3rd of Eb**, so this is just **Eb major** with Bb in the bass → so **Eb/Bb** = **Eb major chord (second inversion)**.

So the chord is **Eb major**, harmony-wise.

But why is it written as **Eb/Bb**? Likely to emphasize the bass movement.

So **Eb/Bb** → harmony: **Eb major**.

But in the key context, Eb major chord appears.

Similarly:

- **Dm/C** → D minor with C in bass: notes C, D, F, A → so root is D, quality is minor, bass is C → likely for voice-leading.

- **Bb6** → Bb with a 6th = Bb–D–F–G

---

### Step 2: List of Chords (by root, ignoring bass for functional analysis)

Let’s write the functional progression:

1. Cm
2. Cm
3. Adim/C → A° (A–C–Eb)
4. Adim/C → A°
5. Cm
6. Cm
7. Eb (with Bb in bass) → Eb major chord
8. Dm (with C in bass) → Dm
9. Cm
10. Cm
11. Adim/C → A°
12. Adim/C → A°
13. Cm
14. Cm
15. Bb6 (Bb–D–F–G)
16. Cm

So harmonic roots:
- Cm
- Cm
- A°
- A°
- Cm
- Cm
- Eb
- Dm
- Cm
- Cm
- A°
- A°
- Cm
- Cm
- Bb6
- Cm

So the harmonic progression is mainly moving between **Cm**, **A°**, **Eb**, **Dm**, **Bb6**

---

### Step 3: Look for Key Center

The tonic chord appears most often: **Cm** is played frequently and ends the progression.

So **tonic = C minor**

But let’s check: does it sound like a C minor key?

Let’s look at the chords:

- **Cm** – i
- **A°** – This is the **leading tone chord of Bb major**? Or **iii° in C harmonic minor**?

Let’s test **C natural minor (Aeolian)**:
- C D Eb F G Ab Bb C
- Chords: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII

In C natural minor:
- A° would be the chord on VI? F, A, C → F, A, C → FM? No.

Wait:
- i: Cm
- ii°: D°
- III: Eb
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm
- VI: Ab
- VII: Bb

So **A° is NOT in C natural minor**. A° = A, C, Eb → A is not in C minor scale.

But **A° occurs**, so must use **harmonic or melodic minor**.

Try **C harmonic minor**:
- C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B
- The scale has **B natural** instead of Bb

In C harmonic minor:
- Chord on **A** is **A°** (A–C–Eb) = **iii°**
- Chord on **E** is **Eaug** (E–G#–B) → not present
- Chord on **B** is **B°** = **vii°**

So **A°** would be the **iii°** chord in C harmonic minor.

But is that common? iii° is rare.

Wait — A° could also be the **vii° of Dm**? But A° = A–C–Eb, and Dm = D–F–A → A° is not leading to Dm.

Alternatively, **Adim** is commonly the **ii° chord in G minor**, but we're centered on Cm.

Wait — **Adim/C** is written with **C in the bass**, so maybe it’s functioning as a **diminished chord over C**, i.e., C with upper extensions.

Notes of **Adim/C**: C (bass), A, C, Eb → so pitches: C, Eb, A → wait: A–C–Eb are the chord, with C in bass.

So full notes: C, Eb, A → that’s **Cm6**? C–Eb–G–A → but no G here.

A–C–Eb = A diminished.

C–Eb–A = C minor triad plus A → that’s **Cm6** (C–Eb–G–A) missing the G.

Alternatively, **C–Eb–A** = **C half-diminished?** No, no Bb.

Wait: C, Eb, A → Eb to A is augmented 4th (tritone), but C to A is major 6th.

So this chord — **Adim/C** — may be used as a **Cm6** substitute (C–Eb–G–A), but missing G. Or it's a **iv°7** or something.

But more likely, **Adim over C** is being used as a chromatic approach chord.

Alternatively, consider that in **C minor**, the **6th degree is Ab**, so A natural is **raised 6th**, suggesting **melodic minor**.

In **C melodic minor** ascending: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B — so **A natural and B natural**.

In that scale:
- Dm = ii
- Eb = bIII
- A° = vii° (but no — A is scale degree 6, so chord on A is **A diminished**, yes — in C melodic minor, 6th degree is A, chord built on it is A–C–Eb = A° → **vi°** chord → yes.

So in C melodic minor:
- i: Cm
- ii: Dm
- bIII: Eb
- iv°: F°
- V: G or G7
- vi°: A°
- vii°: B°

Ah! So **A°** is the **vi°** chord in **C melodic minor**.

But vi° is not commonly used, unless in inversions.

Still, possible.

But look at this part:
- Cm – Adim/C – Cm
That’s like a **chromatic mediant** or passing chord.

But wait — **Adim/C** → C, Eb, A → that’s almost **Cm6**, which is common in minor keys as a color.

But Cm6 = C–Eb–G–A, missing the G.

Possibly the G is omitted.

Alternatively, **Adim/C** functions as a **vii°7 of Bb**, but that would resolve to Bb.

But here it resolves to Cm.

Wait — **Adim** is enharmonic to **C#dim7**, but that might not help.

Alternatively, think voice leading:
Adim/C has notes: C, Eb, A (from A° chord). The **A** moves down to G in Eb chord? Not clear.

Wait — progression:
- Cm
- Adim/C
- Cm
- Eb/Bb
- Dm/C

So after Cm–Adim/C–Cm, then goes to **Eb/Bb**

**Eb major** is the **bIII chord in C minor** — very common in minor keys.

Then **Dm/C** — Dm is **ii chord in C minor**, again common.

Then back to **Cm**, **Adim**, **Cm**, **Bb6**, **Cm**

**Bb6** = Bb–D–F–G → which is **Bb major 6th** — Bb is **VII in C minor**, so **bVII chord**, and adding the 6th (G) makes it smooth.

bVII is common in pop and rock in minor keys.

So all chords fit in **C minor**:

- Cm = i
- A° = vi° (in melodic minor)
- Eb = bIII
- Dm = ii
- Bb6 = bVII with 6th

So all chords exist in **C minor**, particularly C **harmonic** and **melodic minor**.

But A° as a harmonic chord is unusual as a full bar, but as a color or passing chord, possible.

But notice that **Adim/C** has **C as bass throughout**, so maybe it's not functioning as A dim, but as a **Cm with chromatic upper voice**.

In jazz or romantic harmony, **Cm – Cm6 – Cm** is common, but Cm6 is C–Eb–G–A.

But here **Adim/C** is **C, Eb, A** — missing the G.

So it's like a **Cm6 without the fifth** — often allowed.

In fact, many musicians use **Adim/C** as a shorthand for **Cm6** because A–C–Eb–G is Cm7b5? No.

Wait: **Fm7b5** is F–Ab–Bb–Eb, etc.

Actually, **Cm6** = C–Eb–G–A

But **A°7** = A–C–Eb–Gb (same as F)

But **A°** = A–C–Eb

So **Adim/C** = C–E♭–A

That’s **Cm6**, missing the **G**.

So probably, **Adim/C** is being used here as a **voicing for Cm6**, even though strictly it's incomplete.

Similarly, **Dm/C** = C–D–F–A → that’s **C9sus4 without G and Bb?** Or just **Dm over C** for voice leading.

**Eb/Bb** = Bb–Eb–G → Eb chord in second inversion.

**Bb6** = Bb–D–F–G

All very consonant.

---

### Most Likely Key: **C minor**

But which mode?

- **C natural minor** = C D Eb F G Ab Bb — but has **A♭**, not **A natural**, so **Adim** (which requires A natural) is **not** in natural minor.
- **C harmonic minor** = C D Eb F G Ab B — has **B natural**, but **A♭**, not A natural → A° cannot be formed (would need A natural)
- **C melodic minor (ascending)** = C D Eb F G A B — includes **A natural and B natural** → so **A° chord** on 6th degree (A–C–Eb) → yes, **vi°**

So only **C melodic minor** contains both **A natural** and **C**, **Eb**.

Therefore, **A°** is justified as **vi°** in **C melodic minor**.

But is the mode melodic minor?

Wait — we don’t have **B natural** anywhere in the chords.

Check all chords:

- Cm = C–Eb–G → no B
- Adim/C = A–C–Eb → no B
- Eb = Eb–G–Bb → **Bb**, not B natural
- Dm = D–F–A → no B
- Bb6 = Bb–D–F–G → Bb

So **B natural is absent**, but **Bb appears in Eb and Bb6**

So the **B** is **Bb**, not B natural.

Therefore, **melodic minor ascending** (with B natural) is **not used**.

But **A natural** is used in A°, which is not in natural minor (which has Ab).

So we have **A natural** and **Bb** — that is **C Dorian mode?**

Wait: C Dorian: C D Eb F G A Bb C

Yes! That’s it.

- Notes: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb

So:
- Cm = i
- Dm = ii
- Eb = bIII
- Fm = iv
- Gm = v
- Am = VI
- Bb = bVII

But we have **Adim**, not **Am**.

Adim = A–C–Eb → but in Dorian, A is **A natural**, but chord should be **Am** (A–C–E), not A–C–Eb.

Ah — **Eb**, not E natural.

So **Adim** requires **Eb**, but in Dorian, we have **E natural**? No.

C Dorian: A is 6th note, **A natural**, and the 3rd above is **C**, and 5th is **E natural** → so chord is **A minor**, not diminished.

But here we have **Adim**, which has **Eb** as 5th → so **A–C–Eb** → which requires **Eb**, not E natural.

So **Adim = A–C–Eb**, which implies **Eb** (minor third).

So Eb is in the key, which is fine (C minor has Eb), but the chord on A is **diminished**, which requires both **A natural** and **Eb**.

So scale must contain both A and Eb.

C melodic minor has: Eb and A → yes

But also requires B natural → not present.

C harmonic minor: G, Ab, B — has Ab, not A.

So **no standard minor scale has both A natural and Ab**? No, you pick one.

But in **jazz or chromatic contexts**, we borrow.

Perhaps the **Adim/C** is not representing a true harmonic function of A, but is **a passing chord**.

But let’s consider **C minor with modal interchange**.

Alternatively, think **C Aeolian (natural minor)**: C D Eb F G Ab Bb

We have **A natural** in Adim, but key has **Ab**, so A natural is **chromatic**.

So **A° is borrowed from C melodic minor** or used as **secondary leading tone chord**.

A° is the **vii° of Bb major** (A–C–Eb → leads to Bb), but here it resolves to Cm, not Bb.

Sequence: Adim/C → Cm → so it’s **approaching Cm from below by half step?** A° doesn't approach Cm directly.

A to C = minor 3rd.

Alternatively, **voice leading**:
- In Cm: C, Eb, G
- In Adim/C: C, Eb, A
- So G moves to A — chromatic upper neighbor.

So **G → A → G**, or G → A → Eb?

But then goes to Cm again.

So **A is a chromatic passing tone between G and Eb or G and G**.

But Eb is common.

So this suggests **Cm – Cm(add9#5?)** — no.

Most plausible: **Adim/C** is a **misleading notation** for **Cm6**, which is a common chord in C minor.

In many fake books, **Adim/C** is used as a shorthand for **Cm6** because A–C–Eb is the upper structure, even though it’s missing the root and fifth.

Similarly, **Cm6** = C–Eb–G–A, so upper three notes from **A–C–Eb** = A diminished triad.

So **Adim/C** = **Cm6** with missing G.

Therefore, **Adim/C** is likely just a **Cm6 chord**, and we can reinterpret it as such.

Similarly:
- **Eb/Bb** = **Eb major** in second inversion → fine.
- **Dm/C** = Dm over C → could be **C9sus** or just a voice-leading device.

So progression becomes:

- Cm
- Cm6
- Cm
- Cm
- Cm
- Eb
- Dm (over C bass?)
- Cm
- Cm
- Cm6
- Cm
- Cm
- Eb
- Dm?
- Cm
- Cm
- Bb6
- Cm

More clearly:

Cm → Cm6 → Cm → Eb → Dm → Cm → Cm6 → Cm → Bb6 → Cm

These are all **diatonic to C natural minor** (Aeolian) if we accept:
- Cm6 = C–Eb–G–A → requires **A natural**, but C natural minor has **Ab**, not A.

Uh-oh.

C natural minor: has **Ab**, not A.

So A natural is **not** in C natural minor.

Therefore, **A natural** must be a **raised 6th**, which is characteristic of **melodic minor** (ascending) or Dorian.

But in **Dorian**, we have A natural and B natural, but we need **Bb**, not B natural.

C Dorian: Bb — yes.

C Dorian: C D Eb F G A Bb C → has **A natural and Bb** → perfect!

But chord on A: should be **Am (A–C–E)**, not **Adim (A–C–Eb)**.

But here we have **Eb**, not **E natural**.

So the fifth of the A chord is **Eb**, not E, so it’s diminished: A–C–Eb.

But in Dorian, the **E should be natural**.

So unless the E is altered, we have a problem.

So **Adim** requires **Eb**, but Dorian has **E natural**.

So cannot have both **A natural** and **Eb** unless E is flatted.

But Eb is the third of the key.

Conclusion: **The chord Adim/C with A natural and Eb implies that the scale must have A and Eb.**

The only scale where this works without contradiction is **C minor with chromaticism**, or **A diminished is a passing chord**, not diatonic.

Perhaps the key is **C minor**, and the **Adim/C is a common chromatic chord** used as a **neighbor chord to Cm**, implying a **brief shift**.

But let’s look at the bass: C – C – C – C – C – C – Bb – C – C – C – C – C – C – C – Bb – C

So bass: mostly C, then Bb, then C, then Bb, then C.

So motion: C → Bb → C

Bb is bVII in C minor.

So harmony: i – (chromatic) – i – bIII – ii – i – (chromatic) – i – bVII6 – i

So the **tonic is Cm**.

The presence of **Eb (bIII)**, **Dm (ii)**, **Bb (bVII)** are all characteristic of **C natural minor (Aeolian)**.

The only chromatic chord is **Adim/C**, which uses **A natural**, so it's **a raised 6th degree**, suggesting a **borrowing from melodic minor** or **Dorian**, but Dorian doesn't have Eb as fifth.

After deep review:

The most likely explanation is that **Adim/C** is used as a **chordal alteration or passing chord**, and the key is still **C minor**, specifically **C Aeolian (natural minor)**, with a **chromatic passing tone (A natural)**.

But since A natural appears in a whole chord, it's more than a passing tone.

Alternatively, the key is **C minor**, and the mode is **not purely diatonic**, but the tonic is Cm, and the piece uses notes from various minor variants.

**Final Decision:**

Given that:
- Tonic chord is Cm
- Most chords (Cm, Eb, Dm, Bb) are in C natural minor
- Adim/C uses A natural and Eb, which is not diatonic, but common as a passing chord
- No B natural, so not melodic minor
- No E natural, so not Dorian

Probably, the **key is C minor**, and the **mode is Aeolian (natural minor)**, with **chromatic alteration** (A natural used as a #5 extension or in Adim for color, possibly as a ii°7 or passing chord).

But another possibility: **C Phrygian**? C Db Eb F G Ab Bb — has Db, not D.

We have Dm, so D natural, not Db. So not Phrygian.

Only possibility: **key is C minor, mode is C natural minor (Aeolian) with chromaticism**.

Or accept that **Adim/C** is misnamed, and should be **Cm6**, and the A natural is the 6th, which is borrowed from melodic minor.

This is very common in jazz and pop.

So: **Key: C minor**

**Mode: C minor, with use of major 6th (A) from melodic minor – so a hybrid scale, but tonality is C minor.**

But the mode? The most accurate answer is that the **key is C minor**, and the **mode is primarily Aeolian**, with **borrowing from melodic minor** for the 6th degree.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: C minor**  
**Mode: C minor (Aeolian) with chromaticism / modal mixture, incorporating the major 6th (A natural) from C melodic minor.**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: "Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm". They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to parse this chord progression correctly. Let me list out each chord in order:

1. Cm
2. Cm
3. Adim/C
4. Adim/C
5. Cm
6. Cm
7. Eb/Bb
8. Dm/C
9. Cm
10. Cm
11. Adim/C
12. Adim/C
13. Cm
14. Cm
15. Bb6
16. Cm

Okay, so I see a lot of Cm chords, which suggests that C minor might be the tonic. But there are other chords like Adim/C, Eb/Bb, Dm/C, and Bb6. I need to analyze what these mean.

Starting with Adim/C. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or for tension. Adim is A diminished, which is A C Eb. But when written as Adim/C, that means C is the bass note. So the chord is C, E♭, G♭, B♭♭? Wait, no. Diminished chords are made of minor thirds stacked. So a full diminished chord has four notes: root, minor third, diminished fifth, diminished seventh. But usually, when writing Adim/C, it's a diminished triad with C in the bass. Let me check: Adim is A-C-Eb. So if we put C in the bass, it's C (bass), then A, C, Eb? Wait, no. The chord is Adim over C, meaning the bass note is C, and the chord is Adim. So the notes would be C, A, C, Eb. But that's a bit messy. Actually, Adim/C is the same as a diminished triad with C as the root? No. Let's think: an Adim chord is A, C, Eb. But when played "over C" bass, the bass note is C, so the chord would be C, A, C, Eb? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, in chord notation, when it's written like "Adim/C", it means the chord is Adim (A-C-Eb) but with C in the bass. So the notes are C (bass), then A, C, Eb. But in reality, since A is a minor third above C? Wait, no. Wait, A to C is a minor third, but in the bass it's C. So the chord would be C, Eb, A. Wait, but A is a major sixth above C? No, that's confusing. Maybe it's better to think of the chord as C minor with added notes? Let me recall that Adim/C is equivalent to a C half-diminished seventh chord? Wait, no. Let's see:

Adim chord: notes A, C, Eb. If placed with C in the bass, that's C, A, C, Eb — but that's a bit redundant. Actually, the chord with C as the lowest note and the other notes A and Eb would be a C minor triad with Eb? Wait, no. A triad is three notes. So Adim/C means the bass is C, and the chord above is Adim. But the Adim chord is A, C, Eb. So when you have C in the bass, the notes would be C (bass), then A and Eb. So the notes are C, A, Eb. Which is the same as a Cminor 6? No. C, Eb, A — that's a C minor 6? Wait, C minor 6 is C, Eb, G, A. But here we have C, Eb, A — missing the G. Hmm, actually, without the G, it's not a triad. Maybe Adim/C is just a way of writing a diminished chord with C as the bass. Let's see: Adim is A, C, Eb. If the bass is C, then the root of the chord is still A, but C is the lowest note. So the chord is a first inversion of Adim, but Adim is a triad, so inversion would be: Adim in first inversion is C-Eb-A, and second inversion is Eb-A-C. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

A diminished triad: A, C, Eb.

First inversion: C, Eb, A.

Second inversion: Eb, A, C.

But "Adim/C" would be first inversion, with C in the bass. So the notes are C (bass), Eb, A. Which is the same as C, Eb, A. Now, what scale does this fit into? C, Eb, A — the interval between C and Eb is a minor third, C to A is a major sixth. So this is a minor 6th chord? But typically, minor 6th is C, Eb, G, A. But here there's no G. So perhaps it's a Cm6 chord without the fifth (G), so just Cm6. But usually chord symbols specify the notes present. Alternatively, since it's a diminished triad over C, maybe it's better to see it as a part of a larger chord.

Alternatively, maybe it's a way to indicate that the chord is Adim, but played with C in the bass. So the notes would be C (bass), then A, C, Eb. But since C is already in the chord, the bass C is the root of the chord? No, the chord is Adim, so the root is A, but bass is C, so it's a first inversion.

But perhaps for analysis, we can simplify. Adim/C is a diminished triad with C in the bass, so the notes are C, Eb, A (since Adim is A, C, Eb). So sorted: C, Eb, A. That's actually a C minor 6th chord without the fifth? Wait, C minor 6th is C, Eb, G, A. So here we have C, Eb, A — missing the G. So perhaps it's a Cm6sus4 or something? This is getting too complicated. Maybe better to just list the notes and see which key they fit into.

Let me look at the chords again, but list the notes for each:

- Cm: C, Eb, G

- Adim/C: Bass C, then A, C, Eb — so notes are C, Eb, A (since A and Eb are in the chord, and bass C). So C, Eb, A.

- Eb/Bb: Eb with Bb in bass. So Bb, Eb, Gb? Because Eb major would be Eb, G, Bb. But Eb/Bb is Eb major with Bb bass? So bass Bb, then Eb, G. Wait, Eb major chord: root Eb, so Bb is the fifth. So Eb/Bb is Bb (bass), Eb, G. So notes Bb, Eb, G.

Wait, no: Eb major is Eb, G, Bb. So if played with Bb in the bass, that's Bb, Eb, G. Which is a Bb minor triad? No: Bb, Eb, G — Bb to Eb is perfect fourth, Eb to G is minor third. Wait, Bb-Eb is perfect fourth, but in a chord with Bb as root, Bb-Eb would be a perfect fourth, but the chord would be Bb, Eb, G — which is actually Bb, Eb, G. Let's see: Bb to G is minor sixth? No: Bb to G is a minor sixth (Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G — yes, 6 notes up), but Bb to G is a minor sixth interval. Wait, no. Bb to G: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G — that's 6 steps. But in terms of interval, Bb to G is a minor sixth? Wait, Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. So G is the 6th note. So Bb to G is a major sixth? No: in a major scale, the 6th is major sixth. Yes, Bb to G is a major sixth (10 semitones). But the chord is Bb, Eb, G. So root Bb, third Eb? That's a minor third. Because Bb to Eb is perfect fourth? Wait, no: if the root is Bb, then Bb-Eb is a fourth, not a third. The third should be D. So if it's Eb major chord with Bb bass, then notes are Bb (bass), Eb (root), G (3rd). So the chord is Bb, Eb, G — which is actually a Bb minor 7th chord without the 7th? Or E minor? Wait, E minor is E, G, B. No. Alternatively, this is the third inversion of Eb major? Maybe not. Let's see: Eb major chord: Eb, G, Bb. So playing it with Bb in the bass is a second inversion (since Bb is the fifth). So the chord is Eb major, second inversion: Bb, Eb, G. So the notes are Bb, Eb, G. So Bb is the 5th of Eb, Eb is root, G is 3rd. So yes.

Similarly, Dm/C: D minor triad with C in bass. So Dm is D, F, A. With C bass: C, D, F, A. So it's a C major 7th? Wait, C, D, F, A — but that's C6/9? No, C major 7th is C, E, G, B. This is C, D, F, A. Which is actually C minor 7th with an added 9th? Wait, Cm7 is C, Eb, G, Bb. This is different. C, D, F, A — this is actually D minor 7th with C in bass? No. The chord contains D, F, A, and C, so D minor 7th chord (D, F, A, C) but with C as the bass? No, Dm7 is D, F, A, C. If played with C in bass, then it's Dm7/C, which is C, D, F, A. So the notes are C, D, F, A. Which is a Cmaj7? No, Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. But here it's C, D, F, A. So this chord is C D F A — the intervals: C to D is major second, C to F is perfect fourth, C to A is major sixth. So it's like a major seventh chord but with a 9th and 6th? Not standard. Actually, it's a suspension. But probably it's best to think of this as Dm7 with C in the bass, which would be part of the D minor scale.

But maybe for key analysis, instead of getting bogged down in inversions, I should look at all the root notes of the chords. Let's list all the chord symbols without inversions, but note that some have bass notes specified.

So when it says Adim/C, the chord is Adim, bass C. But for key analysis, maybe focus on the root chords. So Adim is A diminished, Eb/Bb is Eb major, Dm/C is D minor, Bb6 is Bb major with a 6th (so Bb, D, F, G).

Let's make a list of the chord roots (ignoring inversions for now):

1. Cm — root C
2. Cm — root C
3. Adim — root A
4. Adim — root A
5. Cm — root C
6. Cm — root C
7. Eb — root Eb (since Eb/Bb is Eb major)
8. Dm — root D (Dm/C is D minor)
9. Cm — root C
10. Cm — root C
11. Adim — root A
12. Adim — root A
13. Cm — root C
14. Cm — root C
15. Bb6 — Bb major
16. Cm — root C

So the roots are: C, C, A, A, C, C, Eb, D, C, C, A, A, C, C, Bb, C.

So the main roots are C, A, Eb, D, Bb. Let's see if these fit into a key.

Cm is common in C minor key. What about the other chords? In natural minor, the chords would be:

C minor: i = Cm, ii° = Ddim, III = Eb, iv = Fm, v = Gm, VI = Ab, VII = Bb.

But wait, in C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So diatonic chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb major

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab major

VII: Bb major

Now, looking at the chord roots in the progression: C, A, Eb, D, Bb.

If we look at the chord Dm — wait, D minor is D, F, A. But in C natural minor, ii is Ddim (D, F, Ab), not Dm. Because in natural minor, the 2nd degree is a diminished triad. So Dm would not be diatonic to C natural minor.

Similarly, A diminished: A is the 6th degree of C minor. In natural minor, the VI chord is Ab major, not A diminished.

Wait, A diminished could be used in C minor as a secondary thing. Let's see.

But let's see the chord Eb/Bb — Eb major is diatonic to C minor as the III chord. Bb major is VII chord in C minor.

Dm/C is D minor in bass C — so Dm chord, which in C natural minor isn't diatonic because ii should be Ddim. So D minor would be outside natural minor.

But maybe C harmonic minor? Let's check C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B.

Diatonic chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III+: Eb augmented

iv: Fm

v: Gm (or G major if using harmonic minor's raised 7th)

VI: Ab major

VII: B diminished (since 7th is B natural, so VII chord would be B, D, F — diminished)

But Dm isn't in harmonic minor either. Harmonic minor has a raised seventh, so the vii chord is diminished. Let's see Dm: D, F, A. F is present in C harmonic minor (F is the 4th), but the A — in C harmonic minor, A is A natural or A flat? Harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So yes, Ab is the 6th. So A as a major note isn't in harmonic minor. So Dm would be D, F, A — but in C harmonic minor, the 6th is Ab, so A natural is chromatic. So Dm would be a borrowed chord or something.

Alternatively, maybe C melodic minor? But that's ascending and descending differently. Maybe not.

Wait, another idea: maybe the key is C minor, and the chords include some borrowed chords from parallel major or other scales.

Let's see the chords present in the progression:

- Cm

- Adim/C (so A diminished chord, which is A, C, Eb)

- Eb/Bb — Eb major

- Dm/C — D minor

- Bb6 — Bb major with added 6th (so Bb, D, F, G; or sometimes 6th chord implies major triad with 6th)

In Cm, what chords are common?

Cm

Fm

Bb

Eb

Gm

G7 (if using harmonic minor)

Ddim

Ab

But the progressions have Dm (D minor) which is not diatonic to C minor. D minor in C minor would be chromatic. But maybe it's a substitution for the vii chord? Not sure.

Wait, let's see if the chords fit into C minor with some chromaticism.

C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb (natural minor)

But the chord Dm would have A natural, which is not in the scale (since Ab is natural minor's 6th), so A natural is the raised 6th, which is harmonic minor's 6th? No, harmonic minor has Ab as the natural 6th. Wait no: harmonic minor raises the 7th, so natural minor: Ab for the 6th, but harmonic minor has the 7th raised from Bb to B natural. So 6th is still Ab in harmonic minor.

Therefore, A natural is not in either C natural minor or harmonic minor. So D minor (D, F, A) includes A natural, which is the 6th degree but natural A, which would be a chromatic note in C minor. So that's a borrowed chord or from another mode.

Another angle: look at the chord Bb6. That Bb major with 6th. What's a Bb6 chord? Typically, it's Bb, D, F, G. So G is the 6th. So in C minor, Bb is the VII chord, but adding a 6th would be G.

Also, Adim: A diminished. A diminished chord is A, C, Eb. Which is the same as C minor with an added minor third? Wait, C minor is C, Eb, G. Adim is A, C, Eb. So the notes A, C, Eb. This is equivalent to C minor without the G, but A is the 6th? In C major, 6th is A, but in C minor, it's Ab.

Hmm. Maybe the key is C minor but using the Dorian mode? Wait, C Dorian is C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. Let's check.

C Dorian mode: 1 C, 2 D, b3 Eb, 4 F, 5 G, 6 A, b7 Bb.

Diatonic chords in C Dorian:

i: Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)

ii: Dm7 (D, F, A, C)

III: Ebmaj7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)

IV: Fmaj7

v: Gm7

vi: Am7b5 (A, C, Eb, G) — wait, A minor half-diminished?

vii: Bb7

Wait, let's build chords on each scale degree:

1. C: C E♭ G B♭ → Cm7

2. D: D F A C → Dm7

3. Eb: Eb G Bb D → Ebmaj7

4. F: F A C Eb → Fm7 (wait, F to A is major third, F to C perfect fifth, F to Eb minor seventh → Fm7)

5. G: G B♭ D F → Gm7

6. A: A C E♭ G → Am7b5 (or half-diminished)

7. Bb: Bb D F A → Bb maj7? Or Bbmaj7? Wait Bb to D is major third, Bb to F perfect fifth, Bb to A is major seventh, yes — Bbmaj7

But the progression has chords like Adim/C, which is Adim (A, C, Eb), which fits in C Dorian as the vi chord — but C Dorian's vi is Am7b5 (half-diminished: A, C, Eb, G). But Adim is A, C, Eb — which is the first three notes of Am7b5. So yes, Adim can be part of a half-diminished chord.

Also, Dm — in C Dorian, the ii chord is Dm7, which includes D, F, A, C — so D minor chord without the 7th is just Dm triad. So that fits.

Eb major: in C Dorian, III chord is Ebmaj7, but Eb major triad (Eb, G, Bb) is present.

Bb major: in C Dorian, the vii chord is Bbmaj7, so Bb major triad is present. Bb6 is Bb, D, F, G — which would be Bb major with added 6th G. But in C Dorian, G is the 5th degree. Wait, but Bb6 is Bb, D, F, G. The 6th is G, which is the 5th of Bb. Hmm. But maybe it's a common chord.

Also, looking at the chord progressions — the presence of D minor (as Dm7 or Dm) fits C Dorian's ii chord. The Adim would fit as part of Am7b5 (vi chord). Eb major as III chord. Bb as VII chord. But in C Dorian, the VII chord is Bbmaj7, so Bb major is correct.

Let's check if all chords fit into C Dorian.

C Dorian: notes C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

- Cm: C, Eb, G — yes.

- Adim: A, C, Eb — in the scale, A, C, Eb are all present. Yes (A is 6th, C is tone 1, Eb is b3).

- Eb major: Eb, G, Bb — yes. Eb is scale degree 3, G is 5, Bb is b7. Wait, but Eb major chord: Eb, G, Bb. Yes, those are all in the C Dorian scale.

- Dm: D, F, A — yes. D is root, F is b5? Wait, in scale: D, F (minor third), A (perfect fifth? No: D to F is minor third, F to A is major third, so D, F, A is D minor triad. Yes. And all notes are in C Dorian.

- Bb6: Bb, D, F, G. Let's see if these are in C Dorian. Bb is b7, D is 2nd, F is 4th, G is 5th. All present in C Dorian.

Perfect! So Bb6 is Bb, D, F, G — all in C Dorian.

Now, what about Eb/Bb? Eb major with Bb in bass. Bb is the root of Bb major, but here it's Eb major with Bb bass. So notes Bb, Eb, G. Which are all in C Dorian — Bb is b7, Eb is 3rd, G is 5th. Yes.

Similarly, Dm/C: D minor triad with C bass. Notes C, D, F, A. All in C Dorian: C is 1, D is 2, F is 4, A is 6. So yes.

So all the chords fit into C Dorian mode.

Let me check if other modes could fit. For example, C Aeolian (natural minor).

C Aeolian: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

- Cm: yes.

- Adim: A is not in C Aeolian — because 6th is Ab. So A natural would be chromatic. So Adim has A natural, which isn't in C Aeolian. Therefore, Adim doesn't fit.

In C Aeolian, the sixth scale degree is Ab, so A natural would be a chromatic passing tone. So the chord Adim (A, C, Eb) would have A natural, which is not in the scale. So probably not.

C Lydian mode: C, D, E, F#, G, A, B. Not really, since the progression has Eb — which is minor third, not major E.

C Mixolydian: C, D, Eb? No, Mixolydian has natural seventh. Wait, C Mixolydian is C, D, E, F, G, A, Bb. No Eb, so not likely. We have Eb in chords.

C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. But the chords include D natural (Dm), but Phrygian would have Db. So D natural would be chromatic.

So probably C Dorian is the best fit.

C Dorian: ii degree is Dm, which matches.

Also, in C Dorian, the chords commonly include:

i = Cm

ii = Dm7

III = Ebmaj7

iv = Fm7

v = Gm7

vi = Am7b5

vii = Bbmaj7

So in the progression, we have Cm (i), Adim which is part of vi (Am7b5), Eb major (III), Dm (ii, but triad), Bb (vii chord is Bbmaj7, but here Bb6 which includes the 6th). So yes.

Moreover, the repeated Cm chords suggest tonic.

Another thing to check: Adim/C. In C Dorian, Adim (A, C, Eb) is a common chord. Sometimes used as a substitute for the vi chord.

So overall, the key is C minor but the mode is Dorian.

To confirm, let's see if the progression suggests tonic center being C.

All chords seem to gravitate towards C as home.

Cm is repeated a lot. The progression starts with Cm and ends with Cm.

The other chords: Dm, Adim, Eb, Bb — all relate to C.

For example, in Dorian, the chord progression could be like i - iii - iv type things.

Another point: in the progression, there's Bb6 — Bb major with added 6th. In C Dorian, Bb is the VII chord, which is major. Adding a 6th would be G, so Bb, D, F, G. Which fits as it uses notes from C Dorian.

So yes, this seems to fit C Dorian.

Alternatively, could it be F major? Because C Dorian is the second mode of Bb major. So F major's relative minor is D minor, but not directly.

Wait, C Dorian scale: the notes are the same as Bb major scale. Because Bb major scale is Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A. So C Dorian is Bb major scale starting on C.

Therefore, the key could be Bb major, but with a mode shift.

But usually, if the tonic is Cm and it's centered around C as the tonic, we'd say key of C minor in Dorian mode, rather than thinking of it as Bb major.

But technically, the note set is the same as Bb major. But since the progression centers on Cm, the tonal center is C minor, but with a raised 6th (A natural), which is characteristic of Dorian mode.

Yes, that's the standard way: if the key feels like minor but has a natural 6th (so unlike natural minor which has flat 6th), then it's Dorian.

In C minor natural, the 6th is Ab; in Dorian, 6th is A natural. So C Dorian is C minor with natural 6th.

So checking the chords: the Adim chord includes A natural, which is the natural 6th.

Also, in the chords, there's Dm, which in C minor natural would have an A flat — but here Dm has A natural, so D, F, A — that works in C Dorian.

So yes, C Dorian.

Another point: Bb6 — Bb major chord with added 6th (G). Bb is the seventh scale degree in C Dorian, but also in Bb major, Bb is the tonic. However, when the progression emphasizes Cm chords, it's probably centered on C.

So the key is C minor in Dorian mode.

To check if there's a better fit.

For example, if it were C Aeolian (natural minor), the sixth degree is Ab, so chord on sixth would be Ab major. But in this progression, we have Adim, which would be A diminished — but A natural is not in C Aeolian. So that conflicts.

So Adim (A natural) suggests that the sixth degree is natural, not flat. So Dorian.

Another chord: Eb major. In C Dorian, Eb is the third degree. But in natural minor (C Aeolian), Eb is also the third degree. So that doesn't help distinguish.

But the Dm chord: in C Aeolian, the second degree is Ddim (D, F, Ab), but here we have Dm (D, F, A), which requires A natural, not flat. So that fits C Dorian.

Therefore, key is C minor, mode Dorian.

So final answer: the key is C minor in Dorian mode.

Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as C Dorian.

Yes, the mode is Dorian, key is C. The chord progression centers on Cm, which is the tonic. And the presence of A natural (instead of Ab) indicates Dorian mode (since C Dorian has A natural as natural 6th, while C Aeolian has Ab).

So yes.


The chord progression **Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm** strongly suggests the **key of C minor in Dorian mode**.

---

### **Analysis**
1. **Tonal Center (Key)**:  
   - The progression heavily emphasizes **Cm** (C minor) as the tonic chord, appearing repeatedly at the beginning, middle, and end. This establishes **C** as the tonal center.

2. **Mode Identification**:  
   - In **C natural minor (Aeolian)**, the 6th scale degree would be **Ab** (e.g., the chord on the 6th degree would be **Ab major**).  
   - However, the progression includes **Adim/C** (A diminished triad: **A, C, Eb**), which requires **A natural** (not Ab).  
   - This **A natural** is the hallmark of **C Dorian mode**, where the 6th scale degree is raised (A natural instead of Ab).  
   - Other chords like **Dm** (D, F, A) and **Bb6** (Bb, D, F, G) also align perfectly with the **C Dorian scale** (C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb).  
     - **C Dorian scale**: C (1), D (2), Eb (♭3), F (4), G (5), **A (6)**, Bb (♭7).  

3. **Chord Alignment with C Dorian**:  
   | Chord      | Notes          | Role in C Dorian |
   |------------|----------------|------------------|
   | **Cm**     | C, Eb, G       | i (tonic)        |
   | **Adim/C** | C, Eb, A       | vi (half-diminished triad; part of Am7♭5) |
   | **Eb/Bb**  | Bb, Eb, G      | III (major triad) |
   | **Dm/C**   | C, D, F, A     | ii (Dm7 triad)   |
   | **Bb6**    | Bb, D, F, G    | VII (major triad + 6th) |

4. **Why Not Other Modes?**  
   - **C Aeolian (natural minor)**: Fails because it requires **Ab** (not A natural) for the 6th degree.  
   - **C Harmonic Minor**: Would raise the 7th to B natural, but the progression uses Bb (not B), so this is invalid.  
   - **Bb Major (Relative Major)**: While the notes match C Dorian, the progression centers on **Cm**, not Bb. The tonal gravity is around **C**, not Bb.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **C minor**  
- **Mode**: **Dorian** (characterized by a raised 6th: A natural instead of Ab)  
- **Scale**: **C Dorian** (C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb)  

This mode is common in jazz and folk music, offering a "minor but bright" sound due to the natural 6th. The progression uses chords that fit seamlessly within this scale, with **Cm** as the clear tonic.  

> 💡 **Quick Check**: If you hum the final **Cm** chord and listen to the A natural in **Adim/C**, it resolves with a Dorian feel—neither purely natural minor nor major, but with a distinct raised 6th tension.

### Step 1: List the chords with their roots and bass notes

We’ll treat these as **root-position chords** where possible, but note any **inversions** (bass note ≠ root):

| Chord       | Root | Bass | Notes (approx)                      |
|-------------|------|------|-------------------------------------|
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Adim/C      | A    | C    | C E G# → **but Adim = A C Eb**, so C Eb A → **C is bass of A diminished** |
| Adim/C      | A    | C    | C Eb A                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Eb/Bb       | Eb   | Bb   | Bb Eb G → **Eb major triad, Bb bass** |
| Dm/C        | D    | C    | C D F → **D minor triad with C bass** |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Adim/C      | A    | C    | C Eb A                              |
| Adim/C      | A    | C    | C Eb A                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |
| Bb6         | Bb   | Bb   | Bb D F G → **Bb major with added 6th (G)** |
| Cm          | C    | C    | C Eb G                              |

---

### Step 2: Identify the candidate key

All chords orbit around **C minor**, and the progression ends on **Cm**, so **C minor** is very likely the **tonic**.

Let’s check if the chords fit in **C natural minor**, **C harmonic minor**, or **C melodic minor**.

#### C natural minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C  
Chords built on each degree:
- i: Cm
- ii°: D°
- III: Eb
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm
- VI: Ab
- VII: Bb

#### C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B C  
Chords:
- i: Cm
- ii°: D°
- III+: Eb+ (rare)
- iv: Fm
- V: G (major! ← important!)
- VI: Ab
- VII°: B°

#### C melodic minor (ascending): C D Eb F G A B C  
Chords:
- i: Cm
- ii: Dm
- III+: Eb+
- IV: F
- V: G
- VI: A
- VII°: B°

---

### Step 3: Analyze the chords in context

Let’s look at **non-diatonic** or surprising chords:

1. **Adim/C** = A diminished triad over C bass → **C Eb A**  
   - That’s **C minor + A** → A is the **raised 6th** → from C harmonic minor (C D Eb F G Ab B C) → **Ab** is the 6th, not A.
   - But **A natural** is the **6th of C melodic minor (ascending)**.
   - So **A** is the **#6** in C minor → **C melodic minor (ascending)**.

   So:  
   - **Adim = A C Eb** = 6th, root, minor 3rd → forms a **diminished triad on the 6th degree** in C melodic minor.

   That’s valid in **C melodic minor**:  
   - ```CmelodicMin: C D Eb F G A B```  
   - A (6th) built as A C Eb → that’s a **diminished triad** because:  
     - A to C = minor 3rd  
     - C to Eb = minor 3rd  
     - A to Eb = diminished 5th → ✅ A°

   So **Adim/C** = i6 (C minor with #6 added) → very common in jazz/pop minor keys.

2. **Eb/Bb** = Eb major triad with Bb in bass → **Bb Eb G**  
   - Eb major = III in C minor (natural/harmonic/melodic)  
   - Bb is the 7th of C minor → **Bb is the VII degree**

   But here, it's **Eb/Bb** — a **first inversion Eb major**.
   - In C minor, Eb major is the **III chord** — a major chord on the lowered 3rd.  
   This is extremely common in minor keys (e.g., “Moon River”, “All Along the Watchtower”) — the **III** chord as a major.

3. **Dm/C** = D minor triad with C bass → **C D F**
   - What is this?  
     - C D F = **Cmaj6**? No, D minor = D F A — but here, the chord is **C D F** — missing A?  
     - **C D F** is **C with added 9th**? But 9th would be D, yes — but no 3rd or 5th?  
     - Wait: **C D F** = C root, D = 9th, F = 11th — but we usually expect a 3rd (Eb) and 5th (G) for a full chord.

   This looks like a **Dm/C**, meaning a **D minor triad (D F A)**, but **A is omitted**, and bass is **C**.

   So the full notes are: **C D F** — which is **C-D-F**.

   - C = root  
   - D = major 2nd  
   - F = perfect 4th  

   → This is technically a **Cadd9**? But **F is the 4th**, not a chord tone of C major/minor.  
   → Alternatively, it's a **Dm/C**, a **slash chord** = **D minor with C in bass**

   In **C melodic minor**, D is the **ii** chord → **Dm** is diatonic!  
   → So **Dm/C** = ii6/4? Or just **ii in first inversion**?  
   Actually: Dm = D F A → Dm/C = C D F A? But we only have C D F.  
   So likely **Dm with 5th omitted** → **Dm7?** without E? E would be a 9th? Hmm…

   But the bass is **C**, which is the **major 7th** above D? No, C is a **minor 7th** above D.

   **Dm7 = D F A C** → perfect!  
   So **Dm/C** is **Dm7** with **C in bass** → so **Dm7/C** = **C D F A**.

   We’re missing A — but maybe it’s implied, or omitted. In pop/jazz, it’s common to omit the 5th.

   So **Dm/C** → effectively a **Dm7 with C bass**, which is **C D F A** = the same as **Cmaj7?** No — Cmaj7 = C E G B.

   Wait: **C D F A** = **C6/9**? That would be C E G A D → but we don’t have E or G.

   This chord **C D F** lacks the 3rd and 5th of C, so it's **not functioning as a C chord**.

   Therefore, this is better interpreted as **Dm7 with C in bass** — which creates a **Cm6**? No.

   Let’s think of it as a **motion from Dm → Cm**, and the **C bass** is a **descending bassline**:
   > [past chords] → Dm/C → Cm

   Bass: Bb → C → C  
   From Eb/Bb: bass = Bb  
   Then Dm/C: bass = C  
   Then Cm: bass = C → so **Bb → C** is a **whole step up**

   So bass line:  
   C — C — C — C — C — C — **Bb** — **C** — C — C — C — C — C — C — **Bb** — C  
   → So the bass moves:  
   - From Bb to C → so **stepwise ascent** — common in minor keys to lead from VII (Bb) to i (C)

   So **Dm/C** is likely **Dm7** with C bass (so it's a **Cmelodic minor ii7 chord in third inversion**).

   But more practically: **Dm/C** adds color and a smooth **Bb → C → C** bass motion in context with Eb/Bb → Dm/C → Cm.

   It works because:  
   - Bb (7th of C minor) → C (tonic)  
   - Dm/C supports that motion melodically and harmonically.

4. **Bb6** = Bb D F G  
   - This is **Bb major with added 6th (G)**  
   - In C minor: **Bb is the VII chord** — but normally it’s **Bb major** (VII = major in minor keys)
   - Adding the 6th (G) makes it **Bb6** — which is common in jazz/pop for color and to blur the "dominant" function.

   Bb6: notes Bb D F G  
   - G is the **major 6th** → from Bb scale: Bb C D Eb F G A → G is 6th → yes, diatonic in **C melodic minor**!

   C melodic minor scale:  
   **C D Eb F G A B** — so Bb is **not in this scale**!

   Wait — problem.

   C melodic minor ascending = C D Eb F G A B  
   So: **B natural**, **not Bb**!

   So **Bb** is **not diatonic to C melodic minor ascending** — it's chromatic!

   But in **C natural minor**:  
   C D Eb F G Ab **Bb** C → yes, **Bb** is the VII degree → diatonic!

   So Bb is diatonic in **C natural minor**, but **A natural** is not → but we have **Adim/C** which uses A natural.

   → So we have a **mix** of C natural minor (Bb, Ab) and C melodic minor (A natural).

   So this is **C minor with modal mixture (borrowed chords)**.

   Let’s consider:

   - **C minor as the tonic**
   - **Bb (VII), Eb (III)** = from **C natural minor**
   - **A natural, D, Dm** = from **C melodic minor**
   - We’re **mixing natural and melodic minor** → very common in pop, jazz, classical.

   **Key: C minor (Aleatoric / mixed minor)** → not strictly one mode, but **C minor** in general.

   But **mode**? Let’s define it.

---

### Step 4: Determine key and mode

**Key: C minor**

**Mode**: Not purely natural, harmonic, or melodic — it’s **modal mixture** in **C minor**, combining elements of:

- C natural minor: **Bb, Ab** (VII, VI)
- C melodic minor ascending: **A natural, B natural** (VI, VII)
- We have **A natural** (Adim/C) → melodic
- We have **Bb** (Bb6) → natural minor
- We have **Dm** (ii) → melodic minor
- No G# → so **not harmonic minor**

→ So the progression **does not stick to one mode**, but favors **C minor** as a tonal center using **modal mixture**.

In theory:

- **C natural minor** provides: Cm, Eb, Bb, Ab voiced as Eb/Bb
- **C melodic minor** provides: Dm, Adim (A natural), and B natural might be implied but not used here
- The chord **Bb6** is a **major chord on VII with added 6th** — common in pop and jazz progressions in minor keys

✅ So this progression is **in the key of C minor**, using **modal mixture** (borrowing from C melodic minor and C natural minor).

---

### Final Answer:

> **Key: C minor**  
> **Mode: C minor with modal mixture (mixing natural and melodic minor elements)**

Alternatively, if forced to pick one mode:  
**C natural minor** provides Bb and Ab, but uses A natural — which isn't in C natural minor.  
**C melodic minor** provides A natural, but not Bb — so neither works alone.

Thus, **the most accurate answer is**:

> **Key: C minor**  
> **Mode: Not strictly one mode — uses modal mixture from C natural minor and C melodic minor**

This is common in modern music (pop, jazz, film scores). The progression centers on C minor tonic, with colorful borrowed chords for movement and emotion.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

Cm – Cm – Adim/C – Adim/C – Cm – Cm – Eb/Bb – Dm/C – Cm – Cm – Adim/C – Adim/C – Cm – Cm – Bb6 – Cm

---

### Step 1: Look at the tonic (home chord)
- The progression **starts and ends on Cm**, and **Cm appears very frequently** (10 out of 16 chords).
- This strongly suggests **C minor** is the tonic.

### Step 2: Identify the key signature / diatonic chords
In **C natural minor** (Aeolian mode), the diatonic chords are:

- i: Cm  
- ii°: Ddim  
- bIII: Eb  
- iv: Fm  
- v: Gm  
- bVI: Ab  
- bVII: Bb  

But in the progression we see:
- **Cm** → i  
- **Adim/C** → Adim is not diatonic to C natural minor. In C minor, A° would be the **vii°** chord **only if we use the harmonic minor scale** (which raises the 7th degree: B natural).
   - In **C harmonic minor**: C–D–Eb–F–G–Ab–B–C
   - The vii° chord is **B°**, not A°.
   - So **Adim** is **not** diatonic to C natural or harmonic minor.

Wait—let’s double-check **Adim**:
- A° = A–C–Eb
- In **C minor**, A is the **6th scale degree**.
- In **C natural minor**, the 6th is **Ab**, not A natural.
- So **A natural** is **not in the key of C minor** unless we’re using a mode or borrowing.

But perhaps **Adim/C** is functioning as a **passing chord** or as part of a **voice-leading** motion.

Let’s look at **Eb/Bb**: that’s an **Eb major chord** with Bb in the bass → this is the **bIII** chord in C minor → **diatonic to natural minor**.

**Dm/C**: Dm = D–F–A → over C bass. D is the 2nd scale degree. In C natural minor, the 2nd chord is **Ddim** (D–F–Ab), but here we have **Dm (with A natural)**. That again introduces **A natural**, which is **not in C natural minor**.

**Bb6**: Bb6 = Bb–D–F–G → this is the **bVII6** chord in C minor. D natural appears here, which is fine (D is the 2nd degree), but again, **D natural implies A natural** is not necessarily required—but the **Dm chord** includes **A natural**, which is the raised 6th.

So we see **A natural** appearing consistently (in Adim and Dm), which suggests the **melodic minor** scale or **Dorian mode**.

### Step 3: Consider C Dorian
C Dorian mode = C–D–Eb–F–G–A–Bb–C

- Contains: Cm (i), Dm (ii), Eb (bIII), F (IV), Gm (v), Adim (vi°), Bb (bVII)

Wait—**Adim** in C Dorian:
- A–C–Eb → yes! A is natural, C and Eb are in the key → **Adim is the vi° chord in C Dorian**.

Also, **Dm** is the **ii chord** in C Dorian → D–F–A → all diatonic.

**Eb** is bIII → diatonic.

**Bb6**: Bb–D–F–G → all notes are in C Dorian.

So **all chords fit C Dorian**:
- Cm = i  
- Adim = vi°  
- Eb = bIII  
- Dm = ii  
- Bb6 = bVII6

Therefore, **the mode is Dorian**, and the **key is C minor** (or more precisely, **C Dorian**).

### Step 4: Rule out other options
- **C natural minor (Aeolian)**: would have Ab and Bb, not A natural → contradicted by Dm and Adim.
- **C harmonic minor**: has B natural, which we don’t see (no G major or E° chords that would signal harmonic minor).
- **C melodic minor (ascending)**: has A and B natural – but we see Bb (in Bb6, Eb/Bb), so B natural is absent → rules out melodic minor.
- **C Dorian**: has A natural and Bb → matches perfectly.

### ✅ Conclusion:
- **Key**: C minor  
- **Mode**: **Dorian**

So the progression is in **C Dorian**.

### Reasoning

**Assessing Chord Functionality**

I've been meticulously dissecting the chord progression. Pinpointing the diminished chords, especially the Adim/C, is proving key. The bass movement really makes this stand out. My latest thought is the harmonic function, and how it informs the overall key and mode.


**Investigating Key Determinants**

I'm now prioritizing the resolution of that Dm/C chord, and comparing with the Bb6. It's becoming evident that we might have some modal mixture at play, perhaps a borrowing from the parallel major or harmonic minor. The consistent Cm cadence is still the primary harmonic anchor, of course.


**Considering Harmonic Contexts**

Alright, I'm now leaning toward the vi° in C minor, considering the A natural. Exploring the implications of this altered chord, and considering a jazz minor influence now feels necessary to fully grasp it. I should verify the bass movement with the other chords to see how the overall feeling is.


**Defining the Harmonic Structure**

I'm now zeroing in on the melodic minor or dorian nature of the progression, given the A natural. The Adim/C chord is central to this. Also, the Dm/C chord is clarifying the use of the A natural. The key is clearly C minor, but the mode now seems heavily influenced by the raised 6th.


**Evaluating Mode and Function**

I'm now completely engrossed in the Dorian interpretation, with the raised 6th being the key. The use of the Adim/C and Dm/C clearly support this. Furthermore, I've confirmed that the Bb6 fits perfectly. I can verify this against the C Dorian scale: C-D-Eb-F-G-A-Bb.




This chord progression is firmly rooted in the key area of C minor. However, the specific altered chords used reveal that it is functioning within a specific minor mode rather than standard Aeolian (natural minor) or Harmonic minor.

## 1. Determine the Tonic and Quality

*   **Tonic (Tonal Center):** The progression starts and ends on **Cm** and revolves around it. This establishes **C** as the tonic.
*   **Quality:** The use of Cm establishes a **minor** tonality.

## 2. Analyze the Chords and Scale Degrees

To determine the mode, we must look at the non-diatonic chords for C Natural Minor (C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb).

| Chord | Function / Notes | Relation to C | Analysis |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Cm** | i | C-Eb-G | Tonic Minor (i) |
| **Adim/C** | $\text{vi}^{\circ}$ (inverted) | A-C-Eb (Bass C) | The crucial note here is **A natural** ($\text{A}\natural$). In C natural minor, the 6th degree is $A\flat$. |
| **Eb/Bb** | $\flat$III | Eb-G-Bb (Bass Bb) | Subdominant in C minor. |
| **Dm/C** | ii | D-F-A$\natural$ (Bass C) | D minor uses **A natural**. In C natural minor, the ii chord is D diminished (D-F-A$\flat$). |
| **Bb6** | $\flat$VII | Bb-D-F-G | Diatonic Seventh (flat VII). Contains G, the 5th of C. |

## 3. Identify the Key and Mode

The presence of the tonic Cm (i), the $\text{Eb}$ major ($\flat$III), and the $\text{Bb}$ major ($\flat$VII) confirms the general $\text{C}$ minor framework.

The defining characteristic is the consistent use of the **A natural** degree (the raised 6th degree) in the Adim (A-C-Eb) and Dm (D-F-A) chords.

The C minor scale that contains the degrees $1(\text{C}), \flat 3 (\text{Eb}), 6 (\text{A}\natural), \text{and } \flat 7 (\text{Bb})$ is the **C Dorian Mode**.

*   **C Dorian Scale:** C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb
*   (i) Cm
*   (ii) Dm (Matches Dm/C)
*   ($\text{vi}^{\circ}$) $\text{A}^{\circ}$ (Matches Adim/C)
*   ($\flat$III) Eb
*   ($\flat$VII) Bb

The melody you provided is:
$$\text{Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm}$$

To determine the key and mode, we need to analyze the chords used, especially the tonic (the chord the piece seems to center around and end on) and the chords that define the prevailing scale.

1.  **Tonic Chord:** The piece both starts and ends on **Cm** (C minor) and repeats this chord frequently. This strongly suggests that the tonic is **C**.

2.  **Chord Qualities and Scales:** We have the following chords:
    *   **Cm** (C-Eb-G): Minor tonic.
    *   **Adim/C** (A-C-Eb / C in bass): A diminished triad. When analyzed in the key of C, the notes are C (tonic), Eb (minor third), and A (a note not typically in C natural minor). Note that $\text{Adim}$ is often the vii$^\circ$ chord in a minor key.
    *   **Eb/Bb** (Eb-G-Bb / Bb in bass): Eb major triad. This is the **$\text{III}$** (mediant) chord in C minor.
    *   **Dm/C** (D-F-A / C in bass): D minor triad. This is the **ii$^\circ$** (supertonic) in C natural minor (if A is natural) or **ii** in C Dorian/Melodic minor.
    *   **Bb6** (Bb-D-F-G): A Bb major chord with added 6th (G).
        *   Interpreted as a separate chord: Bb is the **$\text{VII}$** (subtonic) chord in C natural minor.
        *   A $\text{Bb6}$ can also function as a substitution for $\text{G7}$ (the dominant) if the implied harmony is $\text{Gm}$ (G minor, the v chord) or $\text{Bb}$ (the VII chord).

3.  **Analyzing the Scale and Mode:**

    Let's combine the notes present in these chords (ignoring bass notes for inversion analysis, unless they add a new pitch class):

    *   Cm: C, Eb, G
    *   Adim: A, C, Eb
    *   Eb: Eb, G, Bb
    *   Dm: D, F, A
    *   Bb6: Bb, D, F, G

    Combining all unique pitches: **C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb**

    This seven-note scale matches the **C natural minor scale** (or Aeolian mode):

    *   Tonic (1): C
    *   Minor 2 (2): D
    *   Minor 3 (b3): Eb
    *   Perfect 4 (4): F
    *   Perfect 5 (5): G
    *   Minor 6 (b6): Ab - **Wait, the chords use A natural, not Ab.**
    *   Minor 7 (b7): Bb

    **Rethinking the A:**

    The chords $\text{Adim}$ (A, C, Eb) and $\text{Dm}$ (D, F, A) clearly establish **A natural** as the 6th degree, not A-flat.

    Let's check the modes of the minor key that use **A natural** as the 6th degree (A $\natural$ is the raised 6th degree relative to natural minor's A$\flat$).

    *   **C Dorian Mode:** C, D, Eb, F, G, **A$\natural$**, Bb (minor tonic + raised 6th).
        *   *Chords in C Dorian:* Cm, Dm, Eb, F, Gm, $\text{A}^\circ$ (A-C-Eb), $\text{Bb}$.
        *   *Matching our chords:*
            *   Cm (Matches)
            *   Eb (Matches)
            *   Dm ($\text{ii}$ chord in Dorian - Matches)
            *   Bb6 ($\text{VII}$ chord - Matches)
            *   Adim ($\text{A}^\circ$ is vii$^\circ$ in Dorian - Matches, though most sources list it as $\text{A}^\circ$ in the key of G minor, the Dorian mode is derived from the $\text{Bb}$ major scale, and its $\text{vi}^{\circ}$ chord is A diminished.)

    **The presence of A natural (A$\natural$) and Bb is the key characteristic of the Dorian mode (the minor mode with a raised 6th).**

    *   *(Note on Adim/C: While Adim can be the $\text{vii}^\circ$ in $\text{C}$ minor harmonic (A natural is not the root of that chord), here it functions as a strong indication that A natural is the diatonic 6th degree, as $\text{A}^\circ$ is the vi$^\circ$ chord in C Dorian.)*

### Conclusion

Based on the tonic **Cm** and the use of the chords **Dm** and $\text{A}^\circ$ (Adim), which establish the minor quality and the crucial **A natural** (raised 6th degree) and **Bb** (minor 7th degree), the key and mode are:

**Key:** **C**
**Mode:** **Dorian** ($\text{C}$ Dorian)

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's analyze the chord progression step by step to determine the **key and mode**.

---

### Chord Progression:
```
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C  
Cm  Cm  Eb/Bb   Dm/C  
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C  
Cm  Cm  Bb6     Cm
```

---

### Step 1: Identify the Tonic
- The chord **Cm** appears **8 times** and is both the **starting** and **ending** chord.
- This strongly suggests **Cm is the tonic**.

So we are likely in **C minor**.

---

### Step 2: Examine the Other Chords

| Chord     | Notes (spelling)         | Function in C minor |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Cm        | C - Eb - G                | i (tonic)            |
| Adim/C    | A - C - Eb / C (bass)     | A-C-Eb is **viio** in C minor (B-flat major scale's viio), but here it's **Adim**, which is **A-C-Eb**, a **diminished triad built on A** |
| Eb/Bb     | Eb - G - Bb / Bb (bass)   | This is **Eb major in first inversion** (Eb/Bb) = **III6** in C minor |
| Dm/C      | D - F - A / C (bass)      | Dm = **iio** in C minor, but in first inversion (Dm/C) |
| Bb6       | Bb - D - F - G            | This is **Bb major with added 6th**, or **Bb6** = **VII in C minor** (Bb major is the subtonic chord) |

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Scale Degrees

All chords fit **C natural minor**:

| Chord | Scale degree in C natural minor |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Cm    | i                             |
| Adim  | viio (from **harmonic minor**) → A-C-Eb = **viio7** without 7th? Actually, A-C-Eb is **vii° from Bb major**, but in **C harmonic minor**, the 7th degree is **B natural**, so **Bdim** or **B°7**, **not Adim** |

Wait — this is key.

> **Adim = A - C - Eb**  
> This is **not** diatonic to **C natural minor** or **C harmonic minor**.

Let’s check:

- **C natural minor**: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C → chords: Cm, D°, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb
- **C harmonic minor**: C D Eb F G Ab **B** C → chords: Cm, D°, Eb⁺, Fm, G, Ab, Bdim

So **Adim** is **not** in either.

But **A - C - Eb** is **A diminished triad** = **A°**

This chord is **not diatonic to C minor** — it contains **A natural**, which is **not in C natural or harmonic minor**.

But **A°** **is** the **vii° chord in Bb major**.

Wait — **Adim/C** — bass is **C**, so it's **A° with C in bass** = **C - Eb - A**

That’s **C - Eb - A** = **an inversion of A°**, but **C is the bass**.

So this is **A°C**, or **C - Eb - A** — a **minor third + diminished fifth** from C → C to Eb (minor 3rd), C to A (major 6th), but **A to C is minor 3rd**, **A to Eb is diminished 5th** → so **A°** over **C bass**.

So **Adim/C** = **C - Eb - A** = **a diminished triad with C in bass**.

But **C - Eb - A** is **not a standard triad** — it's **an inversion of A°**, so functionally, it's **A°/C**, which is **a passing diminished chord**, often used as **a common-tone diminished** or **approaching from below**.

But **A°** is **not diatonic to C minor**.

However, **A°** is **the vii° chord in Bb major**, and **Bb major** is the **relative major of G minor**, but here we’re in **C minor**.

But **A°** can appear as **a chromatic passing chord** or **a common-tone diminished**.

In fact, **A°** is often used in **C minor** as **a diminished chord borrowed from parallel major or as a passing chord** — especially **A°7** (A-C-Eb-Gb) — which is **the vii°7 of Bb**, but here it's **A°**, not A°7.

But **A-C-Eb** is **A°**, and **A°7 = A-C-Eb-Gb**, which is **the same as Cdim7** (enharmonic).

But **A°** over **C bass** — **C - Eb - A** — is **a diminished sound rooted on A**, with **C in bass**.

This is **very common** in **C minor** as **a chromatic passing chord** between **Cm** and **Cm**, or **as a neighbor tone chord**.

It **doesn't change the key** — it's **a non-diatonic diminished chord**, likely functioning as **a passing or neighbor chord** with **common tone C**.

So even though **Adim** is **not diatonic**, its use here is **ornamental**, not modulatory.

---

### Step 4: Check All Chords Against C Minor

| Chord     | Diatonic in C minor? | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Cm        | ✅ i                 | C-Eb-G |
| Adim      | ❌                   | A-C-Eb → **A natural** not in C minor scale |
| Eb/Bb     | ✅ III6              | Eb-G-Bb → all in C natural minor |
| Dm/C      | ✅ iio6              | D-F-A → **D natural** is in C minor, Dm = iio, common |
| Bb6       | ✅ VII               | Bb-D-F-G → Bb major + 6th → **VII**, very common in minor |

So **only Adim** is **non-diatonic**, but it's **a chromatic diminished chord**, very common in **minor keys** as **a passing or neighbor chord**.

It **doesn't imply a change of key**.

---

### Step 5: Mode?

We have:
- **i** (Cm)
- **III** (Eb)
- **iio** (Dm)
- **VII** (Bb)
- **viio-type chord (A°)** — but **on A**, not B

But **A°** is **not the leading-tone diminished** — in **C minor**, the **leading tone is B natural**, so **B°** would be the **true vii°**.

So **A°** is **not functional** as **vii°**, but **rather a chromatic passing chord** — possibly **approaching from A natural as a lower neighbor**?

But **A natural** is **not in the key**, so it's **chromatic**.

However, **A°** is **the vii° of Bb**, and **Bb is VII**, so **A°** can be heard as **a passing chord from VII back to i**, or **a common-tone diminished** — **C and Eb are shared with Cm**, so **Adim/C** shares **C and Eb** with **Cm**, making it **a smooth chromatic ornament**.

This is **standard in tonal minor music** — **not modal**, **not modulating**, **just chromatic ornamentation**.

---

### Final Determination:

- **Tonic**: **C**
- **Quality**: **Minor**
- **Scale**: Primarily **C natural minor**, with **chromatic diminished chord** (Adim) — **not modal**, **tonal minor**
- **No evidence of modal interchange to major** or **modal center**
- **Bb6** and **Eb** confirm **natural minor** (not harmonic or melodic, which would have **A♭ and B natural** for leading tone — but we **don’t see G7 or B°**, we see **Bb major**, so **subtonic, not leading tone**)

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

> **Key: C minor**  
> **Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian mode, but in tonal context, it's just "C minor")**

Even though **Adim** is **non-diatonic**, it's **a chromatic passing chord**, not indicative of a **modal shift** or **key change**.

So:

> **The progression is in C minor (natural minor)**.

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze this chord progression:  

```
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C  Cm  Cm  Eb/Bb  Dm/C  
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C  Cm  Cm  Bb6  Cm
```

### Step 1: Identify tonal center

The chord **Cm** appears repeatedly and at structurally important points (beginning, middle, and end). This strongly suggests **C minor** is the tonal center.

### Step 2: Examine supporting chords

Let’s look at each non-tonic chord in the context of C minor:

| Chord | Notes | Possible function in C minor |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------|
| Adim (A–C–Eb) | A, C, Eb | ii° (diminished supertonic) |
| Eb/Bb | Eb, G, Bb; with Bb in bass | III chord (Eb major = C minor’s relative major) |
| Dm/C | D, F, A, C | This is a Dm7/C, which could imply a borrowed chord (from C Dorian or possibly a secondary function) |
| Bb6 | Bb, D, F, G | This could be a VI (Bb major) with an added sixth or related to a submediant color chord |

### Step 3: Consider mode / scale sources

In **C natural minor (Aeolian)**, the diatonic chords are:

| Scale degree | Chord | Quality |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| i | Cm | minor |
| ii° | D° | diminished |
| III | Eb | major |
| iv | Fm | minor |
| v | Gm | minor |
| VI | Ab | major |
| VII | Bb | major |

However, we see **Adim** (A–C–Eb), which fits the **harmonic minor** (because of raised B♮ relative to natural minor, implying use of the leading tone).  
The **Dm/C** introduces F and A natural, suggesting **Dorian** flavor (raised 6th: A natural in C Dorian).

### Step 4: Interpretation

- The tonal center is clearly **C**.
- The harmony oscillates primarily around **i (Cm)** and **ii° (Adim)**.
- The presence of **A natural** (in Adim and Dm) implies the raised 6th degree → typical of **C Dorian** mood.
- Some III and VI chords (Eb and Bb) are shared between Aeolian and Dorian, so they don't clarify the distinction much.

### ✅ **Conclusion**

**Key:** C  
**Mode:** Most likely **C Dorian**, due to the recurring A natural (in Adim) and the chromatic flavor that comes from mixing A♭/A♮.  
If the A natural feels emphasized and no A♭ chords appear, then **C Dorian** is the best fit.  

If, however, later sections contain A♭ or G major chords, it may shift between **C minor (Aeolian)** and **C harmonic minor**.  

**Final answer:**  
**Key:** C  
**Mode:** C Dorian (with touches of C harmonic minor coloration).

### Reasoning

First, the user has given a chord progression: Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm. I need to determine the key and mode.

I recall that key and mode refer to the tonal center and whether it's major or minor. Since there are many Cm chords, it's likely that the key is C minor. But I should verify this by looking at the other chords.

Let me list out all the chords clearly:

- Cm

- Cm

- Adim/C

- Adim/C

- Cm

- Cm

- Eb/Bb

- Dm/C

- Cm

- Cm

- Adim/C

- Adim/C

- Cm

- Cm

- Bb6

- Cm

Now, Adim/C is a bit confusing. Adim probably means A diminished chord, and /C means with C in the bass. So Adim/C is an A diminished chord with a C bass. But since Adim is a diminished chord, it consists of A, C, Eb, and Gb. But with C in the bass, it might be functioning as a passing chord or something.

Similarly, Eb/Bb is Eb major with Bb in the bass, which is the same as Eb major in first inversion? Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So with Bb in the bass, it's Eb/Bb, which is the same as Bb7? No, Bb7 would have Bb, D, F, Ab. Eb/Bb has Eb, G, Bb with Bb bass, so it's like a slash chord.

Dm/C is D minor with C bass, so Dm chord is D, F, A, and with C bass, it might be Dm7 or something.

Bb6 is Bb major with an added 6th? Bb6 chord typically means Bb, D, F, G, so it's a major chord with 6th.

Now, to find the key, I should look at the chords that are diatonic to a scale. Since Cm appears frequently, let's assume C minor is the key.

The natural minor scale of C minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

But in chord progressions, often the harmonic minor or melodic minor are used, especially with diminished chords.

Let's see the chords in C natural minor:

- Cm: C, Eb, G

- Dm: D, F, Ab? But Dm is D, F, A? In C natural minor, the chord on D is D diminished because the notes are D, F, Ab. But here we have Dm/C, which is D, F, A with C bass. So Dm has A natural, but in C natural minor, the A is Ab. So this suggests that the A is natural, which might indicate harmonic minor or melodic minor.

In C harmonic minor, the scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So the chords would be:

- i: Cm

- ii°: D diminished

- III+: Eb augmented? But Eb augmented would be Eb, G, B, but here we have Eb/Bb, which is Eb major with Bb bass, so Eb major chord, which is Eb, G, Bb. In harmonic minor, the Eb chord would be Eb, G, Bb? Bb is the flat 7, so in harmonic minor, the III chord is actually Eb major because the B is natural? Let's see: in C harmonic minor, the notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So the chord built on Eb would be Eb, G, Bb? But Bb is not in the scale; the scale has B natural. So if we build a chord on Eb, using scale notes: Eb, G, B? But B is not a third from Eb? Eb to G is minor third? Let's list the chords properly.

In harmonic minor, the chords are:

- i: C minor (C, Eb, G)

- ii°: D diminished (D, F, Ab)

- III+: Eb augmented (Eb, G, B) because Eb to G is major third, G to B is major third, so augmented.

- iv: F minor (F, Ab, C)

- V: G major (G, B, D) because B is raised.

- VI: Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)

- vii°: B diminished (B, D, F)

But in the progression, we have Eb/Bb, which is Eb major with Bb bass. Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. But in harmonic minor, the Eb chord should be augmented if we use the scale tones. So Eb major with Bb doesn't fit harmonic minor because Bb is not in the scale; the scale has B natural.

Similarly, we have Dm/C, which is D minor with C bass. D minor chord is D, F, A. But in harmonic minor, the ii chord is diminished, so D, F, Ab, not D, F, A.

So this suggests that we might be in C natural minor or another mode.

Let's look at the Adim/C chords. Adim is A diminished, which is A, C, Eb, Gb. But with C bass, it's like C bass with A, C, Eb, Gb, which is essentially a C7b9 without the root? Or something else.

In C minor, the diminished chords often come from the harmonic minor scale. For example, the vii° chord is B diminished, which is B, D, F, Ab? In harmonic minor, vii° is B, D, F, which is diminished, but B, D, F is a diminished triad, and since it's vii°, it's fully diminished if we add the seventh, but in triads, it's just diminished.

But here we have Adim, which is not the vii° of C minor; vii° would be Bdim.

Adim would be the ii° of G minor? Let's think differently.

Perhaps the key is not C minor. Let's list all the root notes from the chords.

The chords are: Cm, Adim, Eb, Dm, Bb6.

But Adim has /C, so the bass is C, but the chord is Adim.

Similarly, Dm has /C, so bass is C.

So the harmonic roots might be C, A, Eb, D, Bb, but with bass notes affecting the function.

In terms of key, let's see the relationship between chords.

Cm is i if in C minor.

Eb is III if in C minor, but Eb major is not in C natural minor? In C natural minor, the III chord is Eb major because Eb, G, Bb all are in the natural minor scale. Yes! In natural minor, the chords are:

- i: Cm

- ii°: D diminished

- III: Eb major

- iv: Fm

- v: Gm

- VI: Ab major

- VII: Bb major

So in C natural minor, Eb major is the III chord, and Bb major is the VII chord.

In the progression, we have Eb/Bb, which is Eb major with Bb bass, so it's like Eb in first inversion? Eb chord with Bb bass means the third is in the bass? Eb chord: Eb, G, Bb. With Bb bass, it's the fifth in bass, so it's second inversion? Let's see: if root is Eb, and bass is Bb, it's Eb/Bb, which is second inversion.

Similarly, Dm/C is Dm with C bass, so root D, bass C, so it's Dm7? Dm chord is D, F, A, and with C bass, it might imply Dm7 with C in bass, so Dm7/C, which is a Dm7 chord in third inversion? Dm7 is D, F, A, C, so with C bass, it's the seventh in bass.

But in terms of key, if we are in C natural minor, then Dm should be D diminished, but here it is Dm, which has A natural instead of Ab. So Dm is not diatonic to C natural minor; it has A natural, which is the major third of D, but in C minor, the A should be Ab for the ii chord.

So for Dm to be used, it must be that the scale has A natural, which means we are not in natural minor.

Perhaps we are in C Dorian mode? C Dorian has C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. So in C Dorian, the chords would be:

- i: Cm

- ii: Dm

- III: Eb major

- IV: F major

- v: Gm

- vi: A diminished? Let's see: on A, the notes are A, C, Eb, which is A diminished triad? A, C, Eb is indeed a diminished triad, so vi°: A diminished.

- VII: Bb major

So in C Dorian, we have Dm and A diminished, which matches our progression: we have Dm/C and Adim/C.

And we have Eb major, which is III, and Bb6, which is VII with an added 6th, but Bb6 is Bb, D, F, G, and in C Dorian, Bb major is VII, and adding G is the 6th, which is the same as the 13th? But since it's Bb6, it's fine, and G is in the scale.

Also, we have Cm throughout, which is i.

So this seems to fit perfectly.

Let's verify the chords:

- Cm: i of C Dorian

- Adim: vi° of C Dorian? In C Dorian, the chord on the 6th degree is A diminished, since A, C, Eb.

But Adim is A diminished, which is A, C, Eb, and since it's Adim/C, it has C in bass, so it's like A diminished with C bass, which might be emphasizing the C, but the chord is still A diminished.

In the progression, it's used as a passing chord or something.

Similarly, Dm/C is Dm with C bass, and Dm is the ii chord in C Dorian.

Eb/Bb is Eb with Bb bass, and Eb is the III chord, and Bb is the seventh of the scale, so it's fine.

Bb6 is Bb with added G, and G is the fifth of the scale, so it's diatonic.

So overall, the key is C minor, but the mode is Dorian.

But let's confirm the mode. In Dorian mode, the characteristic note is the major sixth. In C minor, the natural sixth is Ab, but in Dorian, it is A natural. And here we have Dm, which has A natural, and Adim, which has A natural? Adim has A, C, Eb, so the A is natural, but in Adim, the A is the root, and it's diminished, but in terms of scale, the A is natural, which is the major sixth from C.

So yes, the presence of A natural in Dm and Adim confirms that we are in C Dorian.

Therefore, the key is C Dorian.

But typically, when we say key, we might say C minor with Dorian mode, or simply C Dorian.

Since Dorian is a mode of Bb major, because C Dorian is the second mode of Bb major. But the tonal center is C, so we say key of C Dorian.

In the chord progression, we have Bb6, which is the VII chord, which in Dorian is major, and it leads to Cm.

So I think this is correct.

To be thorough, let's see if there are any other possibilities.

If we consider C natural minor, we have Eb major, but we don't have Dm or Adim; we have D diminished and A diminished? In C natural minor, the chord on A is Ab major, not A diminished. So Adim doesn't fit natural minor.

In C harmonic minor, we have B diminished, but not Adim, and we have G major, but not Dm.

So only Dorian fits.

Therefore, the key is C Dorian.

So for the answer, I should say the key is C minor with Dorian mode, or simply C Dorian.

Since the user said "key and mode", I should specify both.

The key is C, and the mode is Dorian.

So, key: C, mode: Dorian.

But let's write it properly.

The chord progression primarily centers around C minor, but the use of A natural in the Dm and Adim chords indicates the Dorian mode. Specifically, the Dm chord (which contains A natural) and the Adim chord (which also contains A natural) are diatonic to C Dorian, as opposed to C natural minor where the sixth scale degree is Ab. The Eb and Bb6 chords are also consistent with C Dorian, where Eb is the III chord and Bb is the VII chord.

Thus, the key is C, and the mode is Dorian. This means the scale used is C Dorian: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

**Summary:**
- **Key:** C
- **Mode:** Dorian

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.  

---

**1. List the chords and their likely functions**

- **Cm** — i chord in C minor  
- **Adim/C** — Adim is A–C–E♭, but with C in the bass, so it’s like C–E♭–A, which is Cm(add ♭6) or C half-diminished-ish? Actually, Adim = A–C–E♭, over C bass = C–E♭–A = Cm6 without the 5th. Could be a passing chord.  
- **Eb/Bb** — E♭ major with B♭ bass = E♭–G–B♭ over B♭ = B♭–E♭–G = B♭sus4? Actually B♭–E♭–G is B♭(add11), but in C minor, E♭ is ♭III, B♭ is ♭VII.  
- **Dm/C** — D–F–A over C = C–D–F–A = C9sus4? Dm/C in C minor is unusual because Dm is not diatonic to C natural minor (Dm has F natural, but C minor key has A♭, not A natural). So Dm implies borrowing from C Dorian.  
- **Bb6** — B♭–D–F–G in C minor is ♭VII6, common in minor keys.

---

**2. Check the scale implied by the chords**

Cm key signature would be 3 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).  
Chords:  
- Cm = C–E♭–G  
- Adim = A–C–E♭ (diatonic to C harmonic minor — vii° in C minor)  
- E♭ = E♭–G–B♭ (♭III in C minor)  
- Dm = D–F–A (requires A natural, not A♭) → Dorian mode  
- B♭ = B♭–D–F (♭VII in C minor)  
- B♭6 = B♭–D–F–G (still ♭VII with 6th)

So we have both A♭ (from E♭ major chord) and A natural (from Dm chord) in the progression.  
That’s characteristic of **C Dorian** (C–D–E♭–F–G–A–B♭) — the only minor scale with E♭ and B♭ in the key signature plus A natural.

---

**3. Test C Dorian assumption**

In C Dorian:  
- Cm = i  
- Adim = A–C–E♭ — wait, in C Dorian, A–C–E♭ is Aø7 (half-diminished), not fully diminished. But here it’s written Adim = A–C–E♭–G♭? No, Adim triad is A–C–E♭, which is actually Aø7 without the 7th? Actually A diminished triad is A–C–E♭, yes, but in Dorian, the vii chord would be Bdim (B–D–F), not Adim. So Adim is not diatonic to C Dorian — it’s from C harmonic minor (A–C–E♭).  

So the progression mixes:  
- C Dorian (Dm, B♭)  
- C natural minor (E♭, B♭)  
- C harmonic minor (Adim)

But the tonic is clearly Cm, and the raised 6th (A natural) appears in Dm, giving a Dorian flavor overall.

---

**4. Determine key and mode**

Given the emphasis on Cm bookending the progression, and the use of Dm (A natural) and B♭ (♭VII), the most consistent scale is **C Dorian** with one borrowed chord from harmonic minor (Adim).  
But since Adim is used as a passing chord with C bass, it doesn’t disrupt the modal feel.

Thus:  
**Key** = C minor (1 flat + 1 flat? Actually Dorian has B♭ and E♭ in key sig but A nat) — better to say:  
**Concert key signature**: 3 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) but A is often natural.  
**Mode**: Primarily **C Dorian** (minor mode with ♭3, ♭7, natural 6).

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**
    *   **Input:** A chord progression: `Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm`
    *   **Task:** Determine the key and mode.

2.  **Initial Analysis & Simplification:**
    *   First, I need to understand each chord. Let's break them down into their core components.
    *   `Cm`: C - Eb - G (C minor)
    *   `Adim/C`: This is an A diminished chord with C in the bass. The notes of Adim are A - C - Eb. So, Adim/C is just A - C - Eb, with C being the lowest note. This is interesting. It contains the notes of the Cm chord (C and Eb) but adds an A. This A is the 6th of C minor (C - D - E - F - G - A - Bb). So, `Adim/C` functions like a `Cm6(b5)` or more likely, it's a passing chord leading somewhere. Let's keep this in mind. The notes are A, C, Eb.
    *   `Eb/Bb`: This is an Eb major chord with Bb in the bass. The notes of Eb major are Eb - G - Bb. So this chord is Eb - G - Bb. This is the IV chord in the key of C minor (C minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb). The IV chord is F minor, but Eb major is the relative major of C minor. However, in the natural minor scale, the VI chord is Eb major. In the harmonic minor scale, the VI chord is also Eb major. So, `Eb` is a very strong diatonic chord in the key of C minor.
    *   `Dm/C`: This is a D minor chord with C in the bass. The notes of D minor are D - F - A. So this chord is D - F - A, with C in the bass. Let's analyze the notes: D, F, A, C. This looks like a Dm7 chord with the 7th (C) in the bass. In the key of C minor, `D` is the supertonic. The diatonic chord is `Dø` (D diminished) or `Dm7b5` (D - F - Ab - C). The chord given is `Dm7` (D - F - A - C). The A is natural, not Ab. This is a significant clue. Where does that natural A come from? It's the raised 6th degree of the melodic minor scale (C - D - Eb - F - G - A - B). So, `Dm7` is the `ii` chord in C *melodic* minor.
    *   `Bb6`: This is a Bb major chord with an added 6th. The notes are Bb - D - F - G. In the key of C minor, Bb is the dominant chord (the V chord). The V chord is G7 or Gm7. Bb is the *flat* dominant, or the bVII chord. This is very common in rock, blues, and jazz, but it's a characteristic sound of the Dorian mode. In C Dorian, the bVII chord is Bb major. The notes (Bb - D - F - G) are all diatonic to C Dorian (C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb).

3.  **Synthesize the Findings & Form Hypotheses:**

    *   **Hypothesis 1: C Minor (Natural, Harmonic, or Melodic?)**
        *   The progression starts and ends on `Cm`. This is a strong indicator of the tonic.
        *   `Cm` is the i chord.
        *   `Adim/C` contains C, Eb (from Cm) and A (the 6th). This is a bit ambiguous. It could be seen as an embellishment of Cm.
        *   `Eb/Bb` is the VI chord (`Eb`), which is diatonic to both natural and harmonic minor.
        *   `Dm/C` (`Dm7`) is the `ii` chord, but it has a natural A. This points strongly towards C *melodic* minor, where the 6th degree is raised.
        *   `Bb6` is the bVII chord. This is *not* diatonic to standard minor scales (natural, harmonic, or melodic). In C minor, the vii chord is B diminished. The bVII is a "borrowed" chord, often from the parallel major or the Dorian mode.

    *   **Hypothesis 2: C Dorian**
        *   Let's check the chords against the C Dorian scale: C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb.
        *   `Cm` (i chord): C - Eb - G. **Diatonic.**
        *   `Adim/C` (A - C - Eb): This is not a standard diatonic chord. However, it functions similarly to a `Cm6` (C - Eb - G - A), which is a very common Dorian sound. `Adim/C` is just a more dissonant, passing-chord version of that idea. Let's accept it as a Dorian-flavored embellishment.
        *   `Eb/Bb` (Eb major): This is the III chord in C Dorian. **Diatonic.**
        *   `Dm/C` (Dm7): D - F - A - C. This is the ii chord in C Dorian. **Diatonic.**
        *   `Bb6` (Bb6): Bb - D - F - G. This is the VII chord in C Dorian. **Diatonic.**

4.  **Compare the Hypotheses:**

    *   C Minor (of any type) struggles to explain the `Dm7` (needs melodic minor) *and* the `Bb` (needs a borrowed chord). It's a mix of different minor tonalities.
    *   C Dorian explains *all* the chords beautifully and naturally. `Cm` is the tonic, `Dm7` is the supertonic, `Eb` is the mediant, and `Bb` is the subtonic. The `Adim/C` is a bit of an outlier, but its function as a `Cm6(b5)`-type sound fits perfectly within the jazzy, modal context that Dorian often inhabits. The natural 6th (A) and the flat 7th (Bb) are the defining characteristics of the Dorian mode, and this progression uses both prominently.

5.  **Refine the Conclusion:**

    *   The key is C. The tonal center is clearly C minor.
    *   The presence of a major IV chord (`Eb`), a major bVII chord (`Bb`), and a minor ii chord (`Dm7`) with a natural 6th (`A`) are the strongest indicators.
    *   These specific chords, especially the `Bb` (bVII) and the `Dm7` (ii with a natural 6), are hallmarks of the Dorian mode.
    *   The progression uses chords built from the C Dorian scale: C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb.
    *   Therefore, the key is C, and the mode is Dorian.

6.  **Structure the Final Answer:**

    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **Key of C Dorian**.
    *   Explain the reasoning step-by-step.
    *   Identify the tonal center: The progression starts and ends on Cm, making C the tonic.
    *   List the chords and analyze them in relation to C.
    *   **The "Dorian Clues":** Specifically point out the chords that are characteristic of Dorian.
        *   **The Bb6 chord:** This is the `bVII` chord (Bb major). This is a dead giveaway for Dorian, as it's the natural VII chord in the mode but a borrowed chord in traditional minor keys.
        *   **The Dm/C chord:** This functions as a `Dm7` (ii chord). The presence of the natural A (the 6th degree) is the other key Dorian characteristic. In a standard minor key, this would be Dm7b5.
    *   **Analyze the other chords:**
        *   `Cm`: The tonic `i` chord.
        *   `Eb/Bb`: The `III` chord (Eb major), which is diatonic to Dorian.
        *   `Adim/C`: Explain this as a passing chord or an embellishment of the tonic (Cm6). It contains the notes A, C, and Eb, which all come from the C Dorian scale.
    *   **Contrast with other modes:** Briefly explain why it's not C Natural Minor (the bVII chord is borrowed) or C Melodic Minor (the bVII chord is not diatonic). This strengthens the argument for Dorian.
    *   **Summarize** by stating that the combination of the natural 6th (from the Dm7 and Adim/C) and the flat 7th (from the Bb6) creates the distinctive Dorian sound.



This chord progression is in the key of **C Dorian**.

Here is a detailed analysis of why:

### 1. Identifying the Tonic

The progression begins and ends on a **Cm** chord. This strongly establishes **C** as the tonal center. Therefore, we are looking at a mode of C, most likely C minor or one of the minor modes.

### 2. Analyzing the Distinguishing Chords

The key to identifying the mode lies in the chords that deviate from a standard minor key. The two biggest clues are the **Eb/Bb** and the **Bb6** chords.

*   **The Bb6 Chord (Bb major with an added 6th):**
    *   In the key of C minor, the diatonic seventh chord on the 7th degree is B° (B diminished).
    *   The chord here is Bb major, which is the **flat-seven (bVII)** chord.
    *   The bVII chord is not native to traditional natural, harmonic, or melodic minor scales. It is, however, the defining chord of the **Dorian mode**. In C Dorian (C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb), the chord built on the 7th degree (Bb) is naturally a Bb major chord.

*   **The Dm/C Chord (D minor with C in the bass):**
    *   This chord functions as a **Dm7** (notes D - F - A - C).
    *   In C natural minor, the ii chord would be D° or Dm7b5 (D - F - Ab - C). The note A is flatted (Ab).
    *   In this progression, the A is natural. This natural A is the **raised 6th degree** of the scale.
    *   The combination of a minor third (Eb) and a major sixth (A) is the signature sound of the Dorian mode.

### 3. Putting It All Together

Let's look at all the chords and how they fit perfectly into the C Dorian scale (C - D - Eb - F - G - A - Bb):

*   **Cm (i):** The tonic minor chord. (C - Eb - G) - **Diatonic**
*   **Adim/C (A - C - Eb):** This is a passing chord that functions as an embellishment of the Cm tonic. It contains the notes of a Cm6(b5) chord, and all its notes (A, C, Eb) are from the C Dorian scale.
*   **Eb/Bb (III):** The mediant chord, Eb major. (Eb - G - Bb) - **Diatonic**
*   **Dm/C (ii7):** The supertonic chord, Dm7. The natural A is the Dorian 6th. (D - F - A - C) - **Diatonic**
*   **Bb6 (VII6):** The subtonic chord, Bb6. (Bb - D - F - G) - **Diatonic**

### Conclusion

The progression is built from the chords of the C Dorian mode. The presence of the major **bVII** chord (Bb) and the minor **ii** chord with a natural 6th (Dm7) are the definitive evidence that rules out other minor keys and confirms the Dorian mode.
