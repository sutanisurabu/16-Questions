### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progressions**

I’m looking into a specific chord progression in C minor. The chords are: Cm, Adim/C, and Eb/Bb. For Cm, the notes are C, Eb, G. For Adim/C, I see it's an A, C, Eb triad over C, essentially acting like a C7b9 without G. Then there's Eb/Bb, which gives us an Eb major with Bb in the bass, appearing like a Bb sus4 add6. Also, the Dm/C functions as a D minor triad over C bass, resembling a C13sus b9.**Exploring C minor chords**

In the key of C minor, Dm is the ii chord (D, F, A), but in harmonic minor, it becomes D diminished. Looking at the natural minor scale, the diatonic triads are: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, and Bb. So, Dm isn’t diatonic. In ascending melodic minor, the ii chord becomes Dm7. It seems like in harmonic minor, D is diminished with D, F, Ab. If I raise Ab to A, Dm/C then incorporates A natural, which ties back to the leading tone.**Analyzing A natural in C minor**

In C minor, raising A natural serves as the #6 tone. In classical music, the ascending melodic minor features A natural and B natural, while in harmonic minor, the focus is on raising the 7th to B natural instead. So, A natural signals the use of melodic minor. The Adim chord (A, C, Eb) forms a diminished triad based on this raised 6, making it the vi° triad in C melodic minor. With C in the bass, it’s in first inversion.**Understanding chord inversions**

Adim/C puts C in the bass, making it the first inversion of the Adim triad. The root position is A, and the second inversion would have Eb in the bass. Eb/Bb is the III chord with Bb as its 5th in the bass. Dm/C reintroduces the Dm triad with C as a pedal note. The Bb6 chord functions as bVII6, creating a diatonic connection to C natural minor. Both A natural and Bb appear here, but in ascending melodic minor, we find B natural instead of Bb.**Determining key and mode**

So, I’m noticing both Bb and B are part of the chords, but B natural hasn't shown up yet. The chords suggest a C Dorian scale (C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb), which contains A and Bb. After verifying each chord and their functions, it seems all are diatonic to C Dorian. The chords include Cm, Adim/C as vi°, Eb/Bb as III6/4, Dm/C, and Bb6 as bVII6. Thus, the key center is C, with the mode as Dorian, supported by the presence of the raised 6th.

C Dorian.

- Tonic center is C (pedal C appears often).
- Chords fit C Dorian scale: C D Eb F G A Bb.
  - Cm = i
  - Adim/C = vi°6
  - Eb/Bb = bIII6/4
  - Dm/C = ii over tonic pedal
  - Bb6 = bVII(add6)
