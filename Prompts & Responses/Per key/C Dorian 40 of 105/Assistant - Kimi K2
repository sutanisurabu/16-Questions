Let's analyze the chord progression step by step to determine the **key and mode**.

---

### Chord Progression:
```
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C  
Cm  Cm  Eb/Bb   Dm/C  
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C  
Cm  Cm  Bb6     Cm
```

---

### Step 1: Identify the Tonic
- The chord **Cm** appears **8 times** and is both the **starting** and **ending** chord.
- This strongly suggests **Cm is the tonic**.

So we are likely in **C minor**.

---

### Step 2: Examine the Other Chords

| Chord     | Notes (spelling)         | Function in C minor |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Cm        | C - Eb - G                | i (tonic)            |
| Adim/C    | A - C - Eb / C (bass)     | A-C-Eb is **viio** in C minor (B-flat major scale's viio), but here it's **Adim**, which is **A-C-Eb**, a **diminished triad built on A** |
| Eb/Bb     | Eb - G - Bb / Bb (bass)   | This is **Eb major in first inversion** (Eb/Bb) = **III6** in C minor |
| Dm/C      | D - F - A / C (bass)      | Dm = **iio** in C minor, but in first inversion (Dm/C) |
| Bb6       | Bb - D - F - G            | This is **Bb major with added 6th**, or **Bb6** = **VII in C minor** (Bb major is the subtonic chord) |

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Scale Degrees

All chords fit **C natural minor**:

| Chord | Scale degree in C natural minor |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Cm    | i                             |
| Adim  | viio (from **harmonic minor**) → A-C-Eb = **viio7** without 7th? Actually, A-C-Eb is **vii° from Bb major**, but in **C harmonic minor**, the 7th degree is **B natural**, so **Bdim** or **B°7**, **not Adim** |

Wait — this is key.

> **Adim = A - C - Eb**  
> This is **not** diatonic to **C natural minor** or **C harmonic minor**.

Let’s check:

- **C natural minor**: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C → chords: Cm, D°, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb
- **C harmonic minor**: C D Eb F G Ab **B** C → chords: Cm, D°, Eb⁺, Fm, G, Ab, Bdim

So **Adim** is **not** in either.

But **A - C - Eb** is **A diminished triad** = **A°**

This chord is **not diatonic to C minor** — it contains **A natural**, which is **not in C natural or harmonic minor**.

But **A°** **is** the **vii° chord in Bb major**.

Wait — **Adim/C** — bass is **C**, so it's **A° with C in bass** = **C - Eb - A**

That’s **C - Eb - A** = **an inversion of A°**, but **C is the bass**.

So this is **A°C**, or **C - Eb - A** — a **minor third + diminished fifth** from C → C to Eb (minor 3rd), C to A (major 6th), but **A to C is minor 3rd**, **A to Eb is diminished 5th** → so **A°** over **C bass**.

So **Adim/C** = **C - Eb - A** = **a diminished triad with C in bass**.

But **C - Eb - A** is **not a standard triad** — it's **an inversion of A°**, so functionally, it's **A°/C**, which is **a passing diminished chord**, often used as **a common-tone diminished** or **approaching from below**.

But **A°** is **not diatonic to C minor**.

However, **A°** is **the vii° chord in Bb major**, and **Bb major** is the **relative major of G minor**, but here we’re in **C minor**.

But **A°** can appear as **a chromatic passing chord** or **a common-tone diminished**.

In fact, **A°** is often used in **C minor** as **a diminished chord borrowed from parallel major or as a passing chord** — especially **A°7** (A-C-Eb-Gb) — which is **the vii°7 of Bb**, but here it's **A°**, not A°7.

But **A-C-Eb** is **A°**, and **A°7 = A-C-Eb-Gb**, which is **the same as Cdim7** (enharmonic).

But **A°** over **C bass** — **C - Eb - A** — is **a diminished sound rooted on A**, with **C in bass**.

This is **very common** in **C minor** as **a chromatic passing chord** between **Cm** and **Cm**, or **as a neighbor tone chord**.

It **doesn't change the key** — it's **a non-diatonic diminished chord**, likely functioning as **a passing or neighbor chord** with **common tone C**.

So even though **Adim** is **not diatonic**, its use here is **ornamental**, not modulatory.

---

### Step 4: Check All Chords Against C Minor

| Chord     | Diatonic in C minor? | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Cm        | ✅ i                 | C-Eb-G |
| Adim      | ❌                   | A-C-Eb → **A natural** not in C minor scale |
| Eb/Bb     | ✅ III6              | Eb-G-Bb → all in C natural minor |
| Dm/C      | ✅ iio6              | D-F-A → **D natural** is in C minor, Dm = iio, common |
| Bb6       | ✅ VII               | Bb-D-F-G → Bb major + 6th → **VII**, very common in minor |

So **only Adim** is **non-diatonic**, but it's **a chromatic diminished chord**, very common in **minor keys** as **a passing or neighbor chord**.

It **doesn't imply a change of key**.

---

### Step 5: Mode?

We have:
- **i** (Cm)
- **III** (Eb)
- **iio** (Dm)
- **VII** (Bb)
- **viio-type chord (A°)** — but **on A**, not B

But **A°** is **not the leading-tone diminished** — in **C minor**, the **leading tone is B natural**, so **B°** would be the **true vii°**.

So **A°** is **not functional** as **vii°**, but **rather a chromatic passing chord** — possibly **approaching from A natural as a lower neighbor**?

But **A natural** is **not in the key**, so it's **chromatic**.

However, **A°** is **the vii° of Bb**, and **Bb is VII**, so **A°** can be heard as **a passing chord from VII back to i**, or **a common-tone diminished** — **C and Eb are shared with Cm**, so **Adim/C** shares **C and Eb** with **Cm**, making it **a smooth chromatic ornament**.

This is **standard in tonal minor music** — **not modal**, **not modulating**, **just chromatic ornamentation**.

---

### Final Determination:

- **Tonic**: **C**
- **Quality**: **Minor**
- **Scale**: Primarily **C natural minor**, with **chromatic diminished chord** (Adim) — **not modal**, **tonal minor**
- **No evidence of modal interchange to major** or **modal center**
- **Bb6** and **Eb** confirm **natural minor** (not harmonic or melodic, which would have **A♭ and B natural** for leading tone — but we **don’t see G7 or B°**, we see **Bb major**, so **subtonic, not leading tone**)

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

> **Key: C minor**  
> **Mode: Natural minor (Aeolian mode, but in tonal context, it's just "C minor")**

Even though **Adim** is **non-diatonic**, it's **a chromatic passing chord**, not indicative of a **modal shift** or **key change**.

So:

> **The progression is in C minor (natural minor)**.
