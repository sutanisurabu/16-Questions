### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down step by step.

First, I need to list out all the chords clearly. I see Cm repeated a lot, so that's probably the tonic. Then there's Adim/C. Hmm, Adim is A diminished, but the slash means the bass note is C. So Adim/C is A diminished with C in the bass. Diminished chords are usually built on the seventh degree, so Adim would typically be in the key of Bb or something. But here it's Adim/C, so maybe it's functioning as a chord with C as the root? Wait, Adim/C is actually the same as Cdim7 if you rearrange the notes. Let me check that.

A diminished triad is A-C-Eb. With C as the bass, the notes are C, A, C, Eb? Wait, no. Adim/C would have C as the lowest note, so the notes are C (bass), A, C, Eb? But a diminished chord has a minor third and diminished fifth. Adim is A-C-Eb. So Adim/C is C, A, Eb. That's actually a C diminished seventh chord because C-Eb-Gb-Bbb (but Bbb is A). Cdim7 is C-Eb-Gb-Bbb, which is enharmonically A. So Adim/C is actually Cdim7. Yeah, because A-C-Eb with C in bass is C-Eb-A. But C-Eb-A isn't a standard diminished chord. Wait, maybe I'm confusing things.

Alternatively, diminished chords in minor keys often act as leading tones. In C minor, the leading tone chord is B diminished (B-D-F). But here it's A diminished. A diminished would be the ii° in G minor, but let's see.

Let me write out the chords again:

1. Cm
2. Cm
3. Adim/C
4. Adim/C
5. Cm
6. Cm
7. Eb/Bb
8. Dm/C
9. Cm
10. Cm
11. Adim/C
12. Adim/C
13. Cm
14. Cm
15. Bb6
16. Cm

So the progression has a lot of Cm, which is a strong indicator that C minor is the key. The other chords: Adim/C, Eb/Bb, Dm/C, Bb6.

Let me figure out what Adim/C is. Adim is A-C-Eb. With C in the bass, the notes are C, A, Eb. So the chord is C, Eb, A. C to Eb is a minor third, Eb to A is an augmented fourth (since A is the #11 of Eb, but here it's the third note). Wait, C-Eb-A. The interval from C to A is a major sixth. So C-Eb-A is Cm6? No, Cm6 is C-Eb-G-A. Here we have C-Eb-A without the G. So it's a Cm add b6? Or perhaps it's functioning as a secondary dominant.

Alternatively, in the key of C minor, the diatonic chords are:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab

VII: Bb

But in harmonic minor, the v becomes G major, and the VII is Bb. The raised seventh leads to tonic, so the leading tone chord is B°.

But here we have Adim/C. A diminished chord in C minor? A is not a diatonic note in C natural minor (which has Bb). C natural minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So the notes A natural would be in the harmonic or melodic minor. In C harmonic minor, the notes are C D Eb F G Ab B. So the seventh is B natural. Then the chord on A would be A diminished (A-C-Eb), which is the ii° in G minor, but in C minor, the chord on A would be the bVI°? Wait, in C harmonic minor, the chords are:

i: Cm

ii°: D° (D-F-Ab)

III+: Eb aug (Eb-G-Bb)

iv: Fm

V: G (since leading tone is B)

vi°: Adim (A-C-Eb) — yes! In C harmonic minor, the sixth degree chord is A diminished. Because the sixth note is Ab in natural minor, but in harmonic minor, the seventh is raised to B natural, so the scale is C D Eb F G Ab B. Wait, no: C harmonic minor is C D Eb F G Ab B. So the sixth is Ab, not A. Wait, natural minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. Harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B. So the sixth is still Ab. Therefore, the chord on A natural would not be diatonic. Unless it's a borrowed chord.

Wait, but Adim is A-C-Eb. In C harmonic minor, we have Ab, not A. So A natural is not in the scale. So Adim would be a chord from another mode.

Alternatively, maybe the progression is using the Dorian mode. C Dorian is C D Eb F G A Bb. So the chords would include Dm (i), Em (ii), F (III), Gm (iv), Am (v), Bb (VI), C (VII). But Adim isn't there.

Wait, in C Dorian, the sixth is A natural, so the chord on A would be Am, not Adim. Adim has a minor third and diminished fifth, so A-C-Eb. The Eb is the minor third of C, but in A, Eb is the diminished fifth (since A to Eb is a diminished fifth). So Adim is A-C-Eb.

In C natural minor, the notes are C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So A natural isn't present. Adim would require A-C-Eb, but Ab is in the scale, not A. So Adim is chromatic.

But in the progression, Adim/C is used. So maybe it's acting as a passing chord or a secondary leading tone chord.

Let's consider Adim/C. As mentioned, Adim/C has notes C, A, Eb. If we consider C as the root, then the notes are C, Eb, A. This is an inverted chord. The interval from C to A is a major sixth, so it could be Cm6 (which is C-Eb-G-A), but missing the G. Without the fifth, it's ambiguous. Alternatively, it could be a dominant chord. For example, Adim is often used as a leading tone chord to Bb. Adim (A-C-Eb) functions as the vii° of Bb, leading to Bb. But here it's Adim/C, so the bass is C, which is the fifth of F. Wait, Adim is the vii° of Bb, so it would lead to Bb. But in the progression, Adim/C is followed by Cm. So Adim/C to Cm. If Adim is the vii° of Bb, leading to Bb, but here it's going to Cm, that doesn't fit.

Unless Adim/C is functioning as a chord that leads to Dm or something. Wait, after Adim/C, it's Cm. So maybe it's a passing chord.

Let me look at Eb/Bb. Eb/Bb is Eb major with Bb in the bass. So Bb is the root in the bass, so it's a Bb major chord with Eb in the bass? No, slash notation means the bass note is after the slash. So Eb/Bb means Bb is the bass note, so the chord is Eb major but with Bb as the root in the bass. Wait, no: X/Y means chord X with Y in the bass. So Eb/Bb is Eb major chord with Bb as the bass note. So the notes would be Bb (bass), Eb, G, Bb. So it's an inversion of Eb major. Eb major is the III chord in C minor (since C minor has Eb as the third note).

Similarly, Dm/C is D minor chord with C in the bass. So notes C, D, F, A. So it's a Dm7 chord without the fifth? Dm is D-F-A, so Dm/C would be C, D, F, A. Which is like a C9 chord without the third and seventh? C9 is C-E-G-Bb-D. Not quite. Alternatively, it's a first inversion Dm, but with C in the bass, it's actually a C chord with added notes. C-D-F-A. That's C11 (C-D-F-G-A), but missing the G. So C D F A is Cm7 add 9? Cm7 is C-Eb-G-Bb, so not matching.

Alternatively, Dm/C might be functioning as a ii chord in C minor, but in first inversion. In C minor, ii is D diminished, not D minor. So Dm is not diatonic in natural minor. In natural minor, the iv chord is Fm, v is Gm. Wait, in C natural minor, the diatonic chords are:

i: Cm (C-Eb-G)

ii°: Ddim (D-F-Ab)

III: Eb (Eb-G-Bb)

iv: Fm (F-Ab-C)

v: Gm (G-Bb-D)

VI: Ab (Ab-C-Eb)

VII: Bb (Bb-D-F)

So Dm is not diatonic. Dm would have F natural, but in C minor, the sixth scale degree is Ab, so F is natural? Wait no: C natural minor scale is C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So F is natural. Wait, yes: in C minor, the notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So F is natural. So the iv chord is Fm (F-Ab-C), but F natural as root with Ab and C is F minor. So yes, Fm is iv.

But the v chord is Gm (G-Bb-D). So D is the fifth of Gm. The ii chord is Ddim (D-F-Ab). So Dm (D-F-A) would require A natural, which is not in the scale (it's Ab). So Dm is chromatic, borrowing from harmonic minor or melodic minor.

In C harmonic minor, the scale is C D Eb F G Ab B. So the fifth is G, which becomes G major (V), and the seventh is B natural. The chord on D would be Ddim (D-F-Ab), same as natural minor. Chord on A: A is not in the scale (Ab is), so Adim isn't diatonic.

Wait, in harmonic minor, the sixth is still Ab. So A natural isn't present. Therefore, Adim (which has A natural) isn't diatonic to C harmonic minor. Unless it's a borrowed chord.

Perhaps the progression is in C minor, but using some chromatic chords. Let's consider the most frequent chord: Cm. That's likely the tonic.

Then Adim/C appears multiple times. Let's figure out what Adim/C is. As chords, Adim is A-C-Eb. With C in bass, so the notes are C, A, Eb. Now, C-Eb is a minor third, Eb-A is an augmented fourth (tritone). So this chord has a tritone between Eb and A. Tritones are characteristic of dominant chords. In fact, a dominant seventh chord has a tritone (e.g., G7: B and F). Here, Eb and A form a tritone (since A is #11 of Eb, but as an interval, it's a diminished fifth or augmented fourth).

But Eb to A is a perfect fourth, wait: Eb to A is an augmented fourth (since from Eb to Ab is perfect fourth, A is a half step up, so augmented fourth). Yes, Eb to A is augmented fourth. So the chord C-A-Eb has a tritone (Eb-A). This is similar to a dominant chord. For example, Bb7 has D and Ab, which is a tritone. Not the same.

Wait, the tritone in a dominant chord is between the 3rd and 7th. For example, G7: B (3rd) and F (7th) form a tritone. So in this chord C-A-Eb, if we take A as the 3rd and Eb as the 7th, then the root would be... the 3rd of a dominant chord is a major third above the root. So if A is the third, root is F (since F-A is major third). Then the seventh would be Eb, which is a minor seventh above F. So F7 is F-A-C-Eb. Yes! So F7 is F (root), A (third), C (fifth), Eb (seventh). Therefore, the notes C, A, Eb are actually the fifth, third, and seventh of F7. So Adim/C is an inversion of F7, specifically F7 in third inversion (with Eb in bass? Wait, F7 is F-A-C-Eb. So inversions:

Root: F-A-C-Eb

First: A-C-Eb-F

Second: C-Eb-F-A

Third: Eb-F-A-C

So Adim/C, which is C-A-Eb, would correspond to C-Eb-A, which is the second inversion of F7 (C-Eb-F-A, but missing F). Wait, if it's C-A-Eb, that's C, A, Eb. F7 is F-A-C-Eb. So C-A-Eb are three notes of F7: C (5th), A (3rd), Eb (7th). Missing the root F. So it's an incomplete F7 chord. But in the progression, it's written as Adim/C, which emphasizes A-C-Eb with C bass. But functionally, it might be acting as F7, a dominant chord.

If that's the case, then F7 would be the V7 of Bb. Because F is the fifth of Bb. So F7 should lead to Bb. But in the progression, Adim/C (functioning as F7) is followed by Cm. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's look at the progression:

... Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm ...

After Adim/C, it goes back to Cm. If Adim/C is F7, but it's resolving to Cm instead of Bb, that would be a deceptive cadence or something. But F7 to Cm is not a standard resolution. Unless it's a secondary dominant.

Maybe it's V7/vi or something. In C minor, vi is Ab. V7/vi would be Eb7. Not F7.

Alternatively, if the chord is functioning as a leading tone chord to Bb. Adim is the vii° of Bb, since Bb's leading tone is A. So Adim (A-C-Eb) is Bb's vii° chord. Therefore, Adim would resolve to Bb. But in the progression, Adim/C is followed by Cm, not Bb. However, later in the progression, we have Eb/Bb and Dm/C, then Bb6.

Let's list the chords with their functions if in C minor:

- Cm: i

- Eb/Bb: this is Eb major with Bb bass. Eb is III in C minor. Bb is the VII, so Eb/Bb might be emphasizing the Bb as a dominant, but in minor, Bb is usually a subdominant function (iv or VII).

Wait, in minor keys, the VII chord (Bb in C minor) is often used as a dominant substitute, but it's not major unless borrowed. In natural minor, VII is Bb major? Wait, C natural minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So the chord on Bb is Bb-D-F, which is Bb major. Yes! So in natural minor, the VII chord is major. So Bb is a major chord, function as subtonic.

So Eb/Bb: Eb is III, Bb is VII. So Eb/Bb is the III chord in second inversion (since Bb is the fifth of Eb? Eb major is Eb-G-Bb. So the fifth is Bb. So Eb/Bb is Eb major with Bb in bass, which is second inversion. So it's III in second inversion.

Dm/C: Dm is D-F-A. In C minor, the note D is part of the scale (second degree), but Dm would require A natural. In natural minor, the sixth is Ab, so A natural is not present. So Dm is actually the ii chord in C harmonic minor? Wait, in harmonic minor, the scale has B natural, but sixth is still Ab. So A is not natural. Therefore, Dm (D-F-A) is not diatonic. It might be the ii chord in C melodic minor ascending, which is C D Eb F G A B. So in ascending melodic minor, the sixth and seventh are raised, so A natural is present. Therefore, Dm would be diatonic in C melodic minor.

C melodic minor ascending: C D Eb F G A B. So the ii chord is Dm (D-F-A). Yes. So Dm/C is D minor first inversion? Or with C bass.

Bb6: Bb major with a sixth. Typically, Bb6 would be Bb-D-F-G (since sixth is G). But in notation, "Bb6" can sometimes mean Bb added sixth, which is Bb major plus sixth (G). So Bb6 is Bb-D-F-G.

Now, putting it all together:

The progression has a lot of Cm (i), Adim/C which might relate to Bb (VII), Eb/Bb (III in second inversion), Dm/C (ii), and Bb6.

In C natural minor, the harmonies would be i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

But here we have Dm instead of ii°, which suggests melodic minor (ascending). Also, Adim/C: in melodic minor ascending, the sixth is A natural, so Adim wouldn't be there. Adim has Eb, which is the minor third. Wait, Adim is A-C-Eb. In C melodic minor (ascending), the notes are C D Eb F G A B, so Eb is present (third degree), A is present (sixth). So chord on A would be A diminished? A-C-Eb: yes, because from A, C is minor third, Eb is diminished fifth. So in C melodic minor, the chord on A is Adim (A-C-Eb), which is the ii° chord in G minor, but in C, it's the vi° chord? Let's see:

C melodic minor ascending: C D Eb F G A B

Chords:

i: Cm (C-Eb-G)

ii°: D° (D-F-Ab) — but in ascending melodic minor, the sixth is A natural, so Ab is not present. Wait, ascending melodic minor raises the sixth and seventh, so scale is C D Eb F G A B. So the sixth is A, seventh is B. Therefore, the chord on D would be D-F-A, which is Dm, not diminished. Because D to F is minor third, F to A is major third, so Dm.

Wait, in C melodic minor ascending:

- i: C-Eb-G (Cm)

- ii: D-F-A (Dm)

- III+: Eb-G-B (Eb aug) — because third is Eb, fifth is G (major third above Eb), but seventh is B, which is augmented fifth from Eb (Eb to B is augmented fifth). So Eb aug.

- iv: F-A-C (Fm? Wait, F to A is major third, so F-A is major, but in minor scale, the fourth chord is usually minor. Wait, F-A-C: F to A is major third (4 semitones), A to C is minor third (3 semitones), so it's an F major chord? But in the melodic minor scale, the fourth degree is F, which is a whole step above Eb. The notes F, A, C: F-A is major third (4 semitones), A-C is minor third (3 semitones), so yes, F major. But in a minor key, the iv chord is usually minor. However, in ascending melodic minor, due to the raised sixth and seventh, the fourth chord becomes major.

Wait, let's confirm with C melodic minor ascending: C D Eb F G A B C.

Chords:

i: C Eb G → Cm

ii: D F A → Dm

III: Eb G B → Eb aug (since G to B is major third, but Eb to G is major third, Eb to B is augmented fifth)

iv: F A C → F major? F-A-C: F-A is major third (4 semitones), A-C is minor third (3 semitones), so yes, F major.

v: G B D → G major (since B is natural, not Bb)

VI: A C Eb → Adim (A-C is minor third, C-Eb is minor third, so diminished)

VII: B D F → B dim

So in C melodic minor ascending, the VI chord is Adim (A-C-Eb). Yes! So Adim is diatonic as the vi° chord.

Therefore, Adim/C is the vi° chord in first inversion? Adim is A-C-Eb, so first inversion would be C-Eb-A, which is exactly Adim/C. So the bass note is C, which is the third of the Adim chord.

So Adim/C is the first inversion of the vi° chord in C melodic minor.

Then, the progression makes sense in C melodic minor (ascending) because:

- Cm is i

- Adim/C is vi° first inversion

- Eb/Bb: Eb is III, but in melodic minor, III is augmented (Eb-G-B), but here it's Eb major (Eb-G-Bb). Wait, in the chord given, it's Eb/Bb. Eb major is Eb-G-Bb. In melodic minor ascending, the B is natural, so Bb is not present. Therefore, Eb major would not be diatonic; it should be Eb augmented (Eb-G-B). So this is a problem.

Hmm, maybe the key is C harmonic minor instead.

In C harmonic minor: C D Eb F G Ab B

Chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim (D-F-Ab)

III+: Eb aug (Eb-G-B)

iv: Fm (F-Ab-C)

v°: Gdim? Wait, no: G-B-? In harmonic minor, the fifth chord is G major (G-B-D) because the seventh is raised to B natural. Wait, yes:

- v: G major (G-B-D)

VI: Ab (Ab-C-Eb)

VII°: Bdim (B-D-F)

So in harmonic minor, III is augmented, v is major.

But the progression has Eb major (Eb/Bb is Eb with Bb bass), which would be Eb-G-Bb. But in harmonic minor, III should be Eb augmented (Eb-G-B). So Eb major is not diatonic; it's missing the raised fifth (B natural).

Unless the progression is using the natural minor for some chords and harmonic for others.

The chord Eb/Bb: Eb major with Bb bass. In natural minor, III is Eb major (Eb-G-Bb), which is diatonic. In harmonic minor, III is augmented.

So if we consider the progression to be in C natural minor, then:

- Cm: i

- Adim/C: this chord isn't diatonic, since in natural minor, the sixth is Ab, so chord on A natural isn't present.

But earlier we saw that in melodic minor ascending, Adim is diatonic as vi°.

But Eb/Bb in melodic minor ascending should be Eb augmented, but it's Eb major here.

Perhaps the progression is mixing modes. Alternatively, the Eb/Bb is actually functioning as a IV chord in G minor or something, but that might complicate.

Another approach: let's look at the bass notes because of the slash chords.

The bass line is: C, C, C, C, C, C, Bb, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, Bb, C.

So mostly C bass, with Bb appearing at Eb/Bb and Bb6.

Wait, Eb/Bb has Bb in bass, and Bb6 probably has Bb in bass (since it's Bb6, not something else).

So the bass notes are C throughout most, except when on Eb/Bb (bass Bb) and Bb6 (bass Bb).

So the chords with Bb bass are Eb/Bb and Bb6.

Eb/Bb is Bb in bass, Eb major chord. So the harmony is Eb over Bb bass, meaning the chord is Bb with added notes? Or it's Eb chord in second inversion.

Similarly, Bb6 is Bb with sixth (G), so Bb-D-F-G.

Now, let's consider the overall harmonic movement.

The progression starts and ends on Cm, so Cm is tonic.

Common keys for Cm: C minor (natural, harmonic, melodic), or possibly modes like Dorian (D Dorian would have C as minor v, but here Cm is tonic so key is C).

Mode: if the tonic is C, and it's minor, then natural minor is Aeolian, harmonic minor is a variation, melodic minor ascending is another scale.

Let's list the chords and see which scale degrees they imply.

Chords:

- Cm: C Eb G — implies C minor scale (Eb is minor third)

- Adim/C: A C Eb — implies A diminished, which has C and Eb, so minor third relation to C. This chord contains Eb, which is the minor third of C.

- Eb/Bb: Eb G Bb over Bb bass — so the notes are Bb, Eb, G, Bb. So the harmony is Eb major, but bass is Bb. This suggests Bb is important, as it's the bass.

- Dm/C: D F A over C bass — notes C, D, F, A. This implies D minor harmony, with C in bass.

- Bb6: Bb D F G — Bb major with added sixth (G).

Now, let's see the scale degrees required:

- Cm requires Eb (minor third)

- Adim/C requires A natural and Eb

- Eb/Bb requires G (since Eb major has G) and Bb

- Dm/C requires F and A natural (since Dm is D F A)

- Bb6 requires D, F, G

So the notes used are: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

List them: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

That's the C natural minor scale! Because C natural minor is C D Eb F G Ab Bb. Wait, but here we have A natural, not Ab.

C D Eb F G A Bb — that's actually C Dorian mode.

Yes! Dorian mode has a minor third (Eb) and a major sixth (A). So C Dorian is C D Eb F G A Bb C.

In C Dorian:

- i: Cm (C Eb G)

- ii: Dm (D F A)

- III: Eb (Eb G Bb)

- IV: F (F A C)

- v: Gm (G Bb D)

- VI: Ab? Wait, no: Dorian scale degrees: 1,2,b3,4,5,6,b7.

So for C Dorian: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

Therefore:

- i: Cm (C Eb G)

- ii: Dm (D F A)

- III: Eb (Eb G Bb)

- IV: F (F A C) — F major

- v: Gm (G Bb D)

- VI: A diminished? Wait, chord on A: A C Eb — yes, Adim.

- VII: Bb (Bb D F)

Exactly! So in C Dorian:

- i: Cm

- ii: Dm

- III: Eb

- iv: Fm? Wait, no: fourth degree is F, chord is F-A-C, which is F major (since F to A is major third). So IV: F major

- v: Gm

- vi°: Adim (A-C-Eb)

- VII: Bb

Perfect! Now check the chords in the progression:

- Cm: i

- Adim/C: vi° (Adim) in first inversion (bass is C, which is the third of Adim)

- Eb/Bb: III (Eb) in second inversion (bass is Bb, the fifth of Eb)

- Dm/C: ii (Dm) in first inversion? Dm is D-F-A, so first inversion would be F-A-D. But here it's Dm/C, so bass is C, which is not part of Dm chord? Wait, Dm is D-F-A. Adding C would make it Dm7 (D-F-A-C). So Dm/C is Dm7 in third inversion (C bass).

- Bb6: VII (Bb) with added sixth (G). Bb6 typically means Bb-D-F-G, which is Bb added sixth, a common chord in Dorian mode.

Let's verify each chord in C Dorian:

1. Cm: i (diatonic)

2. Cm: i

3. Adim/C: vi° first inversion (Adim is A-C-Eb, bass C makes it first inversion)

4. Adim/C: same

5. Cm: i

6. Cm: i

7. Eb/Bb: III (Eb major) with Bb in bass (second inversion, since Bb is the fifth of Eb)

8. Dm/C: ii (Dm) but as Dm7 (D-F-A-C) with C in bass (third inversion)

9. Cm: i

10. Cm: i

11. Adim/C: vi° first inversion

12. Adim/C: same

13. Cm: i

14. Cm: i

15. Bb6: VII (Bb major) with added sixth (G)

16. Cm: i

This all fits perfectly in C Dorian!

Why?

- The frequent use of Dm (as Dm/C) matches ii in Dorian.

- Adim is diatonic as vi° in Dorian (whereas in natural minor it would be Ab major).

- Eb is III (major), which is diatonic in Dorian (natural minor also has III major, but Dorian has major IV too, though not used here).

- Bb is VII, and Bb6 is common in Dorian to emphasize the major sixth (A), but Bb6 adds G (the fifth scale degree), reinforcing the Dorian sound.

The presence of A natural (in Dm and Adim) instead of Ab confirms it's not natural minor (which has Ab). In natural minor, Adim wouldn't exist; it would be Ab major.

Also, in Dorian, the vi° chord (Adim in C) is a characteristic chord, often used for color.

The bass line emphasizes C and Bb, which are the tonic and subtonic (bVII), typical in Dorian.

Therefore, the key is C, and the mode is Dorian.

| **Dm/C**    | **ii (Dm7 third inversion)** | C (bass), D, F, A            | Dm = ii chord. Bass **C** = added 7th (Dm7). Confirms **A natural** (Dorian’s 6th degree). |
| **Bb6**     | **VII (added 6th)**          | B♭ – D – F – G               | B♭ = VII chord. Added 6th (G) = common Dorian coloring (vs. Aeolian’s minor 6th). |

### 🔑 **Why Not Natural Minor (Aeolian)?**
- **Natural minor (C Aeolian)** has **A♭**, not A natural.  
  → But **Adim** and **Dm** both require **A natural** (not A♭), ruling out Aeolian.  
- **Adim** would not exist in Aeolian (it would be A♭ major).  
- **Bb6** emphasizes the major 6th (G), which is unstable in Aeolian but core to Dorian.

### 🔑 **Why Not Harmonic/Melodic Minor?**
- **Harmonic minor** raises the 7th (B♮), creating major V (G) and diminished vii° (B°).  
  → Progression uses **Bb (VII)** and **Adim (vi°)**, not B° or G major → **not harmonic minor**.  
- **Melodic minor (ascending)** raises 6th/7th (A♮, B♮), but:  
  → III chord would be **E♭⁺ (augmented)**, not E♭ major (Eb/Bb).  
  → Bb6 would not fit (B♮ vs. B♭). → **not melodic minor**.

### 🎸 **Why Dorian Fits Perfectly**:
- **A natural** in **Adim** and **Dm** → **6th degree is major** (Dorian’s defining trait).  
- **B♭ (VII)** and **Bb6** → reinforces the **minor i–VII** cadence typical of Dorian.  
- **E♭ (III)** and **Cm (i)** → creates the characteristic **i–III** motion in Dorian (e.g., in jazz/folk).  
- **Adim** acts as a **chromatic passing chord** between Cm and other harmonies, common in Dorian progressions.

### 💡 **Final Verdict**:
This progression is **unambiguously in C Dorian**. The consistent use of **A natural** (in Dm and Adim), **B♭ (VII)**, and **E♭ (III)** aligns perfectly with Dorian’s scale structure — while excluding other minor modes. The repeated **Cm** tonic and **Bb6** resolution further confirm C as the tonal center.
