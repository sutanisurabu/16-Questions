C Dorian

This progression is built entirely from the notes of the C Dorian scale (C D Eb F G A Bb), with no Ab (the minor 6th) present despite the minor tonic chord. Key chord functions include i (Cm), ii (Dm), bIII (Eb), VII (Bb6), and passing diminished harmony (Adim, functioning as an approach to VII). The repetitive structure and bass pedal on C reinforce the modal center.
