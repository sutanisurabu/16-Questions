### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: "Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm". They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to parse this chord progression correctly. Let me list out each chord in order:

1. Cm
2. Cm
3. Adim/C
4. Adim/C
5. Cm
6. Cm
7. Eb/Bb
8. Dm/C
9. Cm
10. Cm
11. Adim/C
12. Adim/C
13. Cm
14. Cm
15. Bb6
16. Cm

Okay, so I see a lot of Cm chords, which suggests that C minor might be the tonic. But there are other chords like Adim/C, Eb/Bb, Dm/C, and Bb6. I need to analyze what these mean.

Starting with Adim/C. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords or for tension. Adim is A diminished, which is A C Eb. But when written as Adim/C, that means C is the bass note. So the chord is C, E♭, G♭, B♭♭? Wait, no. Diminished chords are made of minor thirds stacked. So a full diminished chord has four notes: root, minor third, diminished fifth, diminished seventh. But usually, when writing Adim/C, it's a diminished triad with C in the bass. Let me check: Adim is A-C-Eb. So if we put C in the bass, it's C (bass), then A, C, Eb? Wait, no. The chord is Adim over C, meaning the bass note is C, and the chord is Adim. So the notes would be C, A, C, Eb. But that's a bit messy. Actually, Adim/C is the same as a diminished triad with C as the root? No. Let's think: an Adim chord is A, C, Eb. But when played "over C" bass, the bass note is C, so the chord would be C, A, C, Eb? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, in chord notation, when it's written like "Adim/C", it means the chord is Adim (A-C-Eb) but with C in the bass. So the notes are C (bass), then A, C, Eb. But in reality, since A is a minor third above C? Wait, no. Wait, A to C is a minor third, but in the bass it's C. So the chord would be C, Eb, A. Wait, but A is a major sixth above C? No, that's confusing. Maybe it's better to think of the chord as C minor with added notes? Let me recall that Adim/C is equivalent to a C half-diminished seventh chord? Wait, no. Let's see:

Adim chord: notes A, C, Eb. If placed with C in the bass, that's C, A, C, Eb — but that's a bit redundant. Actually, the chord with C as the lowest note and the other notes A and Eb would be a C minor triad with Eb? Wait, no. A triad is three notes. So Adim/C means the bass is C, and the chord above is Adim. But the Adim chord is A, C, Eb. So when you have C in the bass, the notes would be C (bass), then A and Eb. So the notes are C, A, Eb. Which is the same as a Cminor 6? No. C, Eb, A — that's a C minor 6? Wait, C minor 6 is C, Eb, G, A. But here we have C, Eb, A — missing the G. Hmm, actually, without the G, it's not a triad. Maybe Adim/C is just a way of writing a diminished chord with C as the bass. Let's see: Adim is A, C, Eb. If the bass is C, then the root of the chord is still A, but C is the lowest note. So the chord is a first inversion of Adim, but Adim is a triad, so inversion would be: Adim in first inversion is C-Eb-A, and second inversion is Eb-A-C. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

A diminished triad: A, C, Eb.

First inversion: C, Eb, A.

Second inversion: Eb, A, C.

But "Adim/C" would be first inversion, with C in the bass. So the notes are C (bass), Eb, A. Which is the same as C, Eb, A. Now, what scale does this fit into? C, Eb, A — the interval between C and Eb is a minor third, C to A is a major sixth. So this is a minor 6th chord? But typically, minor 6th is C, Eb, G, A. But here there's no G. So perhaps it's a Cm6 chord without the fifth (G), so just Cm6. But usually chord symbols specify the notes present. Alternatively, since it's a diminished triad over C, maybe it's better to see it as a part of a larger chord.

Alternatively, maybe it's a way to indicate that the chord is Adim, but played with C in the bass. So the notes would be C (bass), then A, C, Eb. But since C is already in the chord, the bass C is the root of the chord? No, the chord is Adim, so the root is A, but bass is C, so it's a first inversion.

But perhaps for analysis, we can simplify. Adim/C is a diminished triad with C in the bass, so the notes are C, Eb, A (since Adim is A, C, Eb). So sorted: C, Eb, A. That's actually a C minor 6th chord without the fifth? Wait, C minor 6th is C, Eb, G, A. So here we have C, Eb, A — missing the G. So perhaps it's a Cm6sus4 or something? This is getting too complicated. Maybe better to just list the notes and see which key they fit into.

Let me look at the chords again, but list the notes for each:

- Cm: C, Eb, G

- Adim/C: Bass C, then A, C, Eb — so notes are C, Eb, A (since A and Eb are in the chord, and bass C). So C, Eb, A.

- Eb/Bb: Eb with Bb in bass. So Bb, Eb, Gb? Because Eb major would be Eb, G, Bb. But Eb/Bb is Eb major with Bb bass? So bass Bb, then Eb, G. Wait, Eb major chord: root Eb, so Bb is the fifth. So Eb/Bb is Bb (bass), Eb, G. So notes Bb, Eb, G.

Wait, no: Eb major is Eb, G, Bb. So if played with Bb in the bass, that's Bb, Eb, G. Which is a Bb minor triad? No: Bb, Eb, G — Bb to Eb is perfect fourth, Eb to G is minor third. Wait, Bb-Eb is perfect fourth, but in a chord with Bb as root, Bb-Eb would be a perfect fourth, but the chord would be Bb, Eb, G — which is actually Bb, Eb, G. Let's see: Bb to G is minor sixth? No: Bb to G is a minor sixth (Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G — yes, 6 notes up), but Bb to G is a minor sixth interval. Wait, no. Bb to G: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G — that's 6 steps. But in terms of interval, Bb to G is a minor sixth? Wait, Bb major scale: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. So G is the 6th note. So Bb to G is a major sixth? No: in a major scale, the 6th is major sixth. Yes, Bb to G is a major sixth (10 semitones). But the chord is Bb, Eb, G. So root Bb, third Eb? That's a minor third. Because Bb to Eb is perfect fourth? Wait, no: if the root is Bb, then Bb-Eb is a fourth, not a third. The third should be D. So if it's Eb major chord with Bb bass, then notes are Bb (bass), Eb (root), G (3rd). So the chord is Bb, Eb, G — which is actually a Bb minor 7th chord without the 7th? Or E minor? Wait, E minor is E, G, B. No. Alternatively, this is the third inversion of Eb major? Maybe not. Let's see: Eb major chord: Eb, G, Bb. So playing it with Bb in the bass is a second inversion (since Bb is the fifth). So the chord is Eb major, second inversion: Bb, Eb, G. So the notes are Bb, Eb, G. So Bb is the 5th of Eb, Eb is root, G is 3rd. So yes.

Similarly, Dm/C: D minor triad with C in bass. So Dm is D, F, A. With C bass: C, D, F, A. So it's a C major 7th? Wait, C, D, F, A — but that's C6/9? No, C major 7th is C, E, G, B. This is C, D, F, A. Which is actually C minor 7th with an added 9th? Wait, Cm7 is C, Eb, G, Bb. This is different. C, D, F, A — this is actually D minor 7th with C in bass? No. The chord contains D, F, A, and C, so D minor 7th chord (D, F, A, C) but with C as the bass? No, Dm7 is D, F, A, C. If played with C in bass, then it's Dm7/C, which is C, D, F, A. So the notes are C, D, F, A. Which is a Cmaj7? No, Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. But here it's C, D, F, A. So this chord is C D F A — the intervals: C to D is major second, C to F is perfect fourth, C to A is major sixth. So it's like a major seventh chord but with a 9th and 6th? Not standard. Actually, it's a suspension. But probably it's best to think of this as Dm7 with C in the bass, which would be part of the D minor scale.

But maybe for key analysis, instead of getting bogged down in inversions, I should look at all the root notes of the chords. Let's list all the chord symbols without inversions, but note that some have bass notes specified.

So when it says Adim/C, the chord is Adim, bass C. But for key analysis, maybe focus on the root chords. So Adim is A diminished, Eb/Bb is Eb major, Dm/C is D minor, Bb6 is Bb major with a 6th (so Bb, D, F, G).

Let's make a list of the chord roots (ignoring inversions for now):

1. Cm — root C
2. Cm — root C
3. Adim — root A
4. Adim — root A
5. Cm — root C
6. Cm — root C
7. Eb — root Eb (since Eb/Bb is Eb major)
8. Dm — root D (Dm/C is D minor)
9. Cm — root C
10. Cm — root C
11. Adim — root A
12. Adim — root A
13. Cm — root C
14. Cm — root C
15. Bb6 — Bb major
16. Cm — root C

So the roots are: C, C, A, A, C, C, Eb, D, C, C, A, A, C, C, Bb, C.

So the main roots are C, A, Eb, D, Bb. Let's see if these fit into a key.

Cm is common in C minor key. What about the other chords? In natural minor, the chords would be:

C minor: i = Cm, ii° = Ddim, III = Eb, iv = Fm, v = Gm, VI = Ab, VII = Bb.

But wait, in C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

So diatonic chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: Eb major

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: Ab major

VII: Bb major

Now, looking at the chord roots in the progression: C, A, Eb, D, Bb.

If we look at the chord Dm — wait, D minor is D, F, A. But in C natural minor, ii is Ddim (D, F, Ab), not Dm. Because in natural minor, the 2nd degree is a diminished triad. So Dm would not be diatonic to C natural minor.

Similarly, A diminished: A is the 6th degree of C minor. In natural minor, the VI chord is Ab major, not A diminished.

Wait, A diminished could be used in C minor as a secondary thing. Let's see.

But let's see the chord Eb/Bb — Eb major is diatonic to C minor as the III chord. Bb major is VII chord in C minor.

Dm/C is D minor in bass C — so Dm chord, which in C natural minor isn't diatonic because ii should be Ddim. So D minor would be outside natural minor.

But maybe C harmonic minor? Let's check C harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B.

Diatonic chords:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III+: Eb augmented

iv: Fm

v: Gm (or G major if using harmonic minor's raised 7th)

VI: Ab major

VII: B diminished (since 7th is B natural, so VII chord would be B, D, F — diminished)

But Dm isn't in harmonic minor either. Harmonic minor has a raised seventh, so the vii chord is diminished. Let's see Dm: D, F, A. F is present in C harmonic minor (F is the 4th), but the A — in C harmonic minor, A is A natural or A flat? Harmonic minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So yes, Ab is the 6th. So A as a major note isn't in harmonic minor. So Dm would be D, F, A — but in C harmonic minor, the 6th is Ab, so A natural is chromatic. So Dm would be a borrowed chord or something.

Alternatively, maybe C melodic minor? But that's ascending and descending differently. Maybe not.

Wait, another idea: maybe the key is C minor, and the chords include some borrowed chords from parallel major or other scales.

Let's see the chords present in the progression:

- Cm

- Adim/C (so A diminished chord, which is A, C, Eb)

- Eb/Bb — Eb major

- Dm/C — D minor

- Bb6 — Bb major with added 6th (so Bb, D, F, G; or sometimes 6th chord implies major triad with 6th)

In Cm, what chords are common?

Cm

Fm

Bb

Eb

Gm

G7 (if using harmonic minor)

Ddim

Ab

But the progressions have Dm (D minor) which is not diatonic to C minor. D minor in C minor would be chromatic. But maybe it's a substitution for the vii chord? Not sure.

Wait, let's see if the chords fit into C minor with some chromaticism.

C minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb (natural minor)

But the chord Dm would have A natural, which is not in the scale (since Ab is natural minor's 6th), so A natural is the raised 6th, which is harmonic minor's 6th? No, harmonic minor has Ab as the natural 6th. Wait no: harmonic minor raises the 7th, so natural minor: Ab for the 6th, but harmonic minor has the 7th raised from Bb to B natural. So 6th is still Ab in harmonic minor.

Therefore, A natural is not in either C natural minor or harmonic minor. So D minor (D, F, A) includes A natural, which is the 6th degree but natural A, which would be a chromatic note in C minor. So that's a borrowed chord or from another mode.

Another angle: look at the chord Bb6. That Bb major with 6th. What's a Bb6 chord? Typically, it's Bb, D, F, G. So G is the 6th. So in C minor, Bb is the VII chord, but adding a 6th would be G.

Also, Adim: A diminished. A diminished chord is A, C, Eb. Which is the same as C minor with an added minor third? Wait, C minor is C, Eb, G. Adim is A, C, Eb. So the notes A, C, Eb. This is equivalent to C minor without the G, but A is the 6th? In C major, 6th is A, but in C minor, it's Ab.

Hmm. Maybe the key is C minor but using the Dorian mode? Wait, C Dorian is C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. Let's check.

C Dorian mode: 1 C, 2 D, b3 Eb, 4 F, 5 G, 6 A, b7 Bb.

Diatonic chords in C Dorian:

i: Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)

ii: Dm7 (D, F, A, C)

III: Ebmaj7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)

IV: Fmaj7

v: Gm7

vi: Am7b5 (A, C, Eb, G) — wait, A minor half-diminished?

vii: Bb7

Wait, let's build chords on each scale degree:

1. C: C E♭ G B♭ → Cm7

2. D: D F A C → Dm7

3. Eb: Eb G Bb D → Ebmaj7

4. F: F A C Eb → Fm7 (wait, F to A is major third, F to C perfect fifth, F to Eb minor seventh → Fm7)

5. G: G B♭ D F → Gm7

6. A: A C E♭ G → Am7b5 (or half-diminished)

7. Bb: Bb D F A → Bb maj7? Or Bbmaj7? Wait Bb to D is major third, Bb to F perfect fifth, Bb to A is major seventh, yes — Bbmaj7

But the progression has chords like Adim/C, which is Adim (A, C, Eb), which fits in C Dorian as the vi chord — but C Dorian's vi is Am7b5 (half-diminished: A, C, Eb, G). But Adim is A, C, Eb — which is the first three notes of Am7b5. So yes, Adim can be part of a half-diminished chord.

Also, Dm — in C Dorian, the ii chord is Dm7, which includes D, F, A, C — so D minor chord without the 7th is just Dm triad. So that fits.

Eb major: in C Dorian, III chord is Ebmaj7, but Eb major triad (Eb, G, Bb) is present.

Bb major: in C Dorian, the vii chord is Bbmaj7, so Bb major triad is present. Bb6 is Bb, D, F, G — which would be Bb major with added 6th G. But in C Dorian, G is the 5th degree. Wait, but Bb6 is Bb, D, F, G. The 6th is G, which is the 5th of Bb. Hmm. But maybe it's a common chord.

Also, looking at the chord progressions — the presence of D minor (as Dm7 or Dm) fits C Dorian's ii chord. The Adim would fit as part of Am7b5 (vi chord). Eb major as III chord. Bb as VII chord. But in C Dorian, the VII chord is Bbmaj7, so Bb major is correct.

Let's check if all chords fit into C Dorian.

C Dorian: notes C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

- Cm: C, Eb, G — yes.

- Adim: A, C, Eb — in the scale, A, C, Eb are all present. Yes (A is 6th, C is tone 1, Eb is b3).

- Eb major: Eb, G, Bb — yes. Eb is scale degree 3, G is 5, Bb is b7. Wait, but Eb major chord: Eb, G, Bb. Yes, those are all in the C Dorian scale.

- Dm: D, F, A — yes. D is root, F is b5? Wait, in scale: D, F (minor third), A (perfect fifth? No: D to F is minor third, F to A is major third, so D, F, A is D minor triad. Yes. And all notes are in C Dorian.

- Bb6: Bb, D, F, G. Let's see if these are in C Dorian. Bb is b7, D is 2nd, F is 4th, G is 5th. All present in C Dorian.

Perfect! So Bb6 is Bb, D, F, G — all in C Dorian.

Now, what about Eb/Bb? Eb major with Bb in bass. Bb is the root of Bb major, but here it's Eb major with Bb bass. So notes Bb, Eb, G. Which are all in C Dorian — Bb is b7, Eb is 3rd, G is 5th. Yes.

Similarly, Dm/C: D minor triad with C bass. Notes C, D, F, A. All in C Dorian: C is 1, D is 2, F is 4, A is 6. So yes.

So all the chords fit into C Dorian mode.

Let me check if other modes could fit. For example, C Aeolian (natural minor).

C Aeolian: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords:

- Cm: yes.

- Adim: A is not in C Aeolian — because 6th is Ab. So A natural would be chromatic. So Adim has A natural, which isn't in C Aeolian. Therefore, Adim doesn't fit.

In C Aeolian, the sixth scale degree is Ab, so A natural would be a chromatic passing tone. So the chord Adim (A, C, Eb) would have A natural, which is not in the scale. So probably not.

C Lydian mode: C, D, E, F#, G, A, B. Not really, since the progression has Eb — which is minor third, not major E.

C Mixolydian: C, D, Eb? No, Mixolydian has natural seventh. Wait, C Mixolydian is C, D, E, F, G, A, Bb. No Eb, so not likely. We have Eb in chords.

C Phrygian: C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. But the chords include D natural (Dm), but Phrygian would have Db. So D natural would be chromatic.

So probably C Dorian is the best fit.

C Dorian: ii degree is Dm, which matches.

Also, in C Dorian, the chords commonly include:

i = Cm

ii = Dm7

III = Ebmaj7

iv = Fm7

v = Gm7

vi = Am7b5

vii = Bbmaj7

So in the progression, we have Cm (i), Adim which is part of vi (Am7b5), Eb major (III), Dm (ii, but triad), Bb (vii chord is Bbmaj7, but here Bb6 which includes the 6th). So yes.

Moreover, the repeated Cm chords suggest tonic.

Another thing to check: Adim/C. In C Dorian, Adim (A, C, Eb) is a common chord. Sometimes used as a substitute for the vi chord.

So overall, the key is C minor but the mode is Dorian.

To confirm, let's see if the progression suggests tonic center being C.

All chords seem to gravitate towards C as home.

Cm is repeated a lot. The progression starts with Cm and ends with Cm.

The other chords: Dm, Adim, Eb, Bb — all relate to C.

For example, in Dorian, the chord progression could be like i - iii - iv type things.

Another point: in the progression, there's Bb6 — Bb major with added 6th. In C Dorian, Bb is the VII chord, which is major. Adding a 6th would be G, so Bb, D, F, G. Which fits as it uses notes from C Dorian.

So yes, this seems to fit C Dorian.

Alternatively, could it be F major? Because C Dorian is the second mode of Bb major. So F major's relative minor is D minor, but not directly.

Wait, C Dorian scale: the notes are the same as Bb major scale. Because Bb major scale is Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A. So C Dorian is Bb major scale starting on C.

Therefore, the key could be Bb major, but with a mode shift.

But usually, if the tonic is Cm and it's centered around C as the tonic, we'd say key of C minor in Dorian mode, rather than thinking of it as Bb major.

But technically, the note set is the same as Bb major. But since the progression centers on Cm, the tonal center is C minor, but with a raised 6th (A natural), which is characteristic of Dorian mode.

Yes, that's the standard way: if the key feels like minor but has a natural 6th (so unlike natural minor which has flat 6th), then it's Dorian.

In C minor natural, the 6th is Ab; in Dorian, 6th is A natural. So C Dorian is C minor with natural 6th.

So checking the chords: the Adim chord includes A natural, which is the natural 6th.

Also, in the chords, there's Dm, which in C minor natural would have an A flat — but here Dm has A natural, so D, F, A — that works in C Dorian.

So yes, C Dorian.

Another point: Bb6 — Bb major chord with added 6th (G). Bb is the seventh scale degree in C Dorian, but also in Bb major, Bb is the tonic. However, when the progression emphasizes Cm chords, it's probably centered on C.

So the key is C minor in Dorian mode.

To check if there's a better fit.

For example, if it were C Aeolian (natural minor), the sixth degree is Ab, so chord on sixth would be Ab major. But in this progression, we have Adim, which would be A diminished — but A natural is not in C Aeolian. So that conflicts.

So Adim (A natural) suggests that the sixth degree is natural, not flat. So Dorian.

Another chord: Eb major. In C Dorian, Eb is the third degree. But in natural minor (C Aeolian), Eb is also the third degree. So that doesn't help distinguish.

But the Dm chord: in C Aeolian, the second degree is Ddim (D, F, Ab), but here we have Dm (D, F, A), which requires A natural, not flat. So that fits C Dorian.

Therefore, key is C minor, mode Dorian.

So final answer: the key is C minor in Dorian mode.

Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as C Dorian.

Yes, the mode is Dorian, key is C. The chord progression centers on Cm, which is the tonic. And the presence of A natural (instead of Ab) indicates Dorian mode (since C Dorian has A natural as natural 6th, while C Aeolian has Ab).

So yes.


The chord progression **Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm** strongly suggests the **key of C minor in Dorian mode**.

---

### **Analysis**
1. **Tonal Center (Key)**:  
   - The progression heavily emphasizes **Cm** (C minor) as the tonic chord, appearing repeatedly at the beginning, middle, and end. This establishes **C** as the tonal center.

2. **Mode Identification**:  
   - In **C natural minor (Aeolian)**, the 6th scale degree would be **Ab** (e.g., the chord on the 6th degree would be **Ab major**).  
   - However, the progression includes **Adim/C** (A diminished triad: **A, C, Eb**), which requires **A natural** (not Ab).  
   - This **A natural** is the hallmark of **C Dorian mode**, where the 6th scale degree is raised (A natural instead of Ab).  
   - Other chords like **Dm** (D, F, A) and **Bb6** (Bb, D, F, G) also align perfectly with the **C Dorian scale** (C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb).  
     - **C Dorian scale**: C (1), D (2), Eb (♭3), F (4), G (5), **A (6)**, Bb (♭7).  

3. **Chord Alignment with C Dorian**:  
   | Chord      | Notes          | Role in C Dorian |
   |------------|----------------|------------------|
   | **Cm**     | C, Eb, G       | i (tonic)        |
   | **Adim/C** | C, Eb, A       | vi (half-diminished triad; part of Am7♭5) |
   | **Eb/Bb**  | Bb, Eb, G      | III (major triad) |
   | **Dm/C**   | C, D, F, A     | ii (Dm7 triad)   |
   | **Bb6**    | Bb, D, F, G    | VII (major triad + 6th) |

4. **Why Not Other Modes?**  
   - **C Aeolian (natural minor)**: Fails because it requires **Ab** (not A natural) for the 6th degree.  
   - **C Harmonic Minor**: Would raise the 7th to B natural, but the progression uses Bb (not B), so this is invalid.  
   - **Bb Major (Relative Major)**: While the notes match C Dorian, the progression centers on **Cm**, not Bb. The tonal gravity is around **C**, not Bb.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Key**: **C minor**  
- **Mode**: **Dorian** (characterized by a raised 6th: A natural instead of Ab)  
- **Scale**: **C Dorian** (C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb)  

This mode is common in jazz and folk music, offering a "minor but bright" sound due to the natural 6th. The progression uses chords that fit seamlessly within this scale, with **Cm** as the clear tonic.  

> 💡 **Quick Check**: If you hum the final **Cm** chord and listen to the A natural in **Adim/C**, it resolves with a Dorian feel—neither purely natural minor nor major, but with a distinct raised 6th tension.
