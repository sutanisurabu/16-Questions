### Reasoning

**Exploring chord theory**

I'm grappling with the C7b9 chord, trying to break it down. So, in C minor, the diminished triad on A might relate to the melodic minor scale. I realize that in C harmonic minor, the diminished triad is built on the leading tone B. 

When I look at A diminished, it’s A C Eb, and I’m noting that A is not part of the harmonic minor since there’s Ab. So, I deduce that A natural indicates I’m using melodic minor!**Analyzing chord transitions**

I'm digging into the relationship between the chords Adim/C and Cm. They share C and Eb, while G and A alternate as the third voice, creating smooth voice leading. It seems typical for Cm to transition to Adim/C like this. So, G to A is an upward step followed by a return to G, making it a passing chord with C in the bass.

Then, I look at Eb over Bb, which suggests a second inversion. I think this makes it function as either V of Eb or IV of C minor, since Bb acts as the VII in natural minor.**Examining chord relationships**

The Eb/Bb chord has Bb in the bass, which might suggest a IV chord. Then I consider Dm/C, where Dm (D F A) is built over a C bass. This D minor triad isn't diatonic to C natural or harmonic minor, since F and A are part of the melodic minor.

I realize that Dm is the ii minor triad in ascending melodic minor, possibly forming a Dm7. When I look at Dm/C, it results in a C major 9 sus, suggesting notes that fall into a C6sus4(add9) structure—still diatonic to C melodic minor. Then there's the Bb6 chord: Bb D F G.**Understanding C melodic minor**

In C melodic minor, Bb acts as the b7, leading me to the Bb major chord with a raised sixth. The ascending melodic minor scale goes C D Eb F G A B, confirming that there's no E. Hence, the diatonic chord on Bb is indeed Bb major, with the notes Bb D F; adding G gives us Bb6.

This confirms that Bb6 is diatonic to C melodic minor. So, the key is C minor, specifically C melodic minor. Although, "mode" might mean aeolian or dorian in other contexts. Still, there's no B natural here, just A and F.**Clarifying the chord relationships**

I'm exploring the mix between C melodic minor and C Dorian. I notice both Bb and A natural are present in the chords, especially in Eb/Bb and Bb6. While C melodic minor ascends with B natural, using Eb/Bb includes Bb, along with other diatonic chords. 

This suggests that chords with Bb may be borrowed from C Dorian or C natural minor since C Dorian contains both A natural and Bb. 

Eventually, I determine the mode is C Dorian, which fits perfectly with all the chords! So, I can summarize: "C Dorian (C minor with natural 6), the second mode of Bb major."

C Dorian (C minor with natural 6). 
- Tonal center is C (pedal C and repeated Cm). 
- Chords fit C Dorian: Cm (i), Adim/C (vi°), Eb/Bb (III), Dm/C (ii over C), Bb6 (VII6). 
- Presence of A natural and Bb (no B natural) confirms Dorian rather than harmonic/melodic minor.
