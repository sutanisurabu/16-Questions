Let’s break this down step by step.

**1. List the chords and their likely functions**

- **Cm** — i chord in C minor  
- **Adim/C** — Adim is A–C–E♭, but with C in the bass, so it’s like C–E♭–A, which is Cm(add ♭6) or C half-diminished-ish? Actually, Adim = A–C–E♭, over C bass = C–E♭–A = Cm6 without the 5th. Could be a passing chord.  
- **Eb/Bb** — E♭ major with B♭ bass = E♭–G–B♭ over B♭ = B♭–E♭–G = B♭sus4? Actually B♭–E♭–G is B♭(add11), but in C minor, E♭ is ♭III, B♭ is ♭VII.  
- **Dm/C** — D–F–A over C = C–D–F–A = C9sus4? Dm/C in C minor is unusual because Dm is not diatonic to C natural minor (Dm has F natural, but C minor key has A♭, not A natural). So Dm implies borrowing from C Dorian.  
- **Bb6** — B♭–D–F–G in C minor is ♭VII6, common in minor keys.

**2. Check the scale implied by the chords**

Cm key signature would be 3 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).  
Chords:  
- Cm = C–E♭–G  
- Adim = A–C–E♭ (diatonic to C harmonic minor — vii° in C minor)  
- E♭ = E♭–G–B♭ (♭III in C minor)  
- Dm = D–F–A (requires A natural, not A♭) → Dorian mode  
- B♭ = B♭–D–F (♭VII in C minor)  
- B♭6 = B♭–D–F–G (still ♭VII with 6th)

So we have both A♭ (from E♭ major chord) and A natural (from Dm chord) in the progression.  
That’s characteristic of **C Dorian** (C–D–E♭–F–G–A–B♭) — the only minor scale with E♭ and B♭ in the key signature plus A natural.

**3. Test C Dorian assumption**

In C Dorian:  
- Cm = i  
- Adim = A–C–E♭ — wait, in C Dorian, A–C–E♭ is Aø7 (half-diminished), not fully diminished. But here it’s written Adim = A–C–E♭–G♭? No, Adim triad is A–C–E♭, which is actually Aø7 without the 7th? Actually A diminished triad is A–C–E♭, yes, but in Dorian, the vii chord would be Bdim (B–D–F), not Adim. So Adim is not diatonic to C Dorian — it’s from C harmonic minor (A–C–E♭).  

So the progression mixes:  
- C Dorian (Dm, B♭)  
- C natural minor (E♭, B♭)  
- C harmonic minor (Adim)

But the tonic is clearly Cm, and the raised 6th (A natural) appears in Dm, giving a Dorian flavor overall.

**4. Determine key and mode**

Given the emphasis on Cm bookending the progression, and the use of Dm (A natural) and B♭ (♭VII), the most consistent scale is **C Dorian** with one borrowed chord from harmonic minor (Adim).  
But since Adim is used as a passing chord with C bass, it doesn’t disrupt the modal feel.

Thus:  
**Key** = C minor (1 flat + 1 flat? Actually Dorian has B♭ and E♭ in key sig but A nat) — better to say:  
**Concert key signature**: 3 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) but A is often natural.  
**Mode**: Primarily **C Dorian** (minor mode with ♭3, ♭7, natural 6).
