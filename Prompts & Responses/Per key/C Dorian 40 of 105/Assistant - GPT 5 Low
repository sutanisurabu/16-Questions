### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking at a chord progression and trying to identify the key and mode. It repeats C minor a lot, which implies it’s likely in C minor.

The Adim/C chord features an A diminished triad with a C bass, indicating it's part of C minor diatonic. But wait—this A diminished chord doesn’t fit into the C natural minor scale, since A isn't part of it! 

In C natural minor, the seventh scale degree would actually be B diminished. I need to clarify this.**Examining C minor and its scales**

I’m analyzing the C natural minor scale and trying to figure out its notes. In C natural minor, A♭ is present, while A natural appears in the melodic and harmonic minor scales—wait, which one? 

In C harmonic minor, the scale features A♭, while the melodic minor scale ascending has A natural and B natural. An A diminished triad (A C E♭) uses A natural and is relevant in the context of C melodic minor. 

Is A diminished functioning as a ii° or perhaps a vii° in relation to B♭? I need to clarify this!**Clarifying chord functions**

I’m checking the relationships between chords in the progression. The leading-tone diminished triad to B♭ includes A, C, and E♭, so yes, Adim is vii°/B♭, functioning as the leading-tone chord. But does it resolve to B♭? 

I notice there’s an E♭/B♭ followed by a Dm/C, plus a B♭6 chord later, which is likely a B♭ major 6 (B♭ D F G). In the context of C minor, B♭ serves as the VII chord. So it makes sense to see this progression. Also, E♭/B♭ is the second inversion of E♭ major.**Analyzing chord functions in C minor**

Actually, the E♭/B♭ chord suggests an E♭ chord (E♭ G B♭) played over a B♭ bass, functioning as a V inversion. In C minor, E♭ is the III chord, and E♭/B♭ might act as the V of A♭. 

This E♭/B♭ is in second inversion, which often serves as a passing or cadential chord. Then I see Dm/C, which is a D minor triad (D F A) over a C bass, bringing in the melodic minor flavor. 

With those repeating C minor pillars, I think the overall key is likely C melodic minor.**Determining key and mode**

The user wants me to identify the key and mode, likely implying C minor with an Aeolian mode. But the presence of A natural and B natural changes things. 

From the chords, I gather pitches: C, D, E♭, F, G, A, and B♭, but I don’t see a B natural. The scale formed is C, D, E♭, F, G, A, and B♭, which fits C Dorian perfectly! 

So I can conclude the key is C Dorian, emphasizing its raised sixth (A natural), while still being part of B♭ major’s key signature. The final answer would be: C Dorian mode or "B♭ major key signature, with a modal center on C."

C Dorian.

- Tonal center is C (repeated Cm and final cadence).
- Pitch collection implied: C D Eb F G A Bb (A natural and Bb together = Dorian).
- Chords fit C Dorian diatonic set: i (Cm), vi° (Adim/C), bIII (Eb/Bb), ii (Dm/C), bVII (Bb6).
