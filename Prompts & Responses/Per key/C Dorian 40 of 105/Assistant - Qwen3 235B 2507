Let's analyze the chord progression step by step to determine the **key** and **mode**:

### Given Chord Progression:
```
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C
Cm  Cm  Eb/Bb  Dm/C
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C
Cm  Cm  Bb6   Cm
```

We’ll first identify the roots and qualities of the chords, then analyze their harmonic function.

---

### Step 1: Chord Analysis

Let’s extract chord roots and types, including voicings (like slash chords):

1. **Cm** – C minor
2. **Adim/C** – A diminished with C in the bass → notes: C, E♭, G♭ (A° = A–C–E♭; with C in bass: C, E♭, G♭) → enharmonic to **Cm6**? But functionally, it's A diminished over C.
3. **Eb/Bb** – E♭ major with Bb in the bass → Bb–Eb–Gb → this is **Bb7** (Bb–D–F–Ab) missing the D. But Eb/Bb = Bb–Eb–Gb → actually a **Bb minor** chord? No → Eb is E♭, so E♭ major with Bb in the bass: **Bb–Eb–Gb**? Wait: Gb = F♯, but in context, it’s more likely **Eb** chord (E♭–G–B♭) with **Bb in the bass**, so **Bb–Eb–G** → that’s **Bb major** chord in second inversion. (Eb/Bb = Bb–Eb–G) → So **Bb major over Bb bass = Bb major chord**. So **Eb/Bb** = **Bb major in first inversion?** Wait:  
Wait! **Eb/Bb** means Bb is the bass, chord is Eb → E♭ major = E♭–G–B♭.  
So with Bb in bass: **Bb–Eb–G** → which is **Bb–D♭–F**? No: G is major third.

Wait:  
E♭ major = E♭, G, B♭  
With Bb in bass: **Bb, Eb, G** → that’s **Bb–Eb–G**, which is a **Bb major chord** (Bb–D–F)? No — G is not D.

Wait: Bb–Eb–G → intervals: Bb to Eb = P5, Bb to G = M7 → this is actually a **Bb(add9)** without the 5th? Wait no:

Let’s spell:
- Bb = B♭
- Eb = E♭
- G = G

So the notes: **B♭, E♭, G**

- B♭ to E♭ = P4
- B♭ to G = M6

So the chord is **B♭–E♭–G** → that’s actually an **Em diminished**? No.

Wait — this is **E♭ major chord in second inversion**: E♭/B♭ = B♭–E♭–G → yes! That’s just **E♭ major** with **B♭ in the bass**. So **Eb/Bb** = **E♭ major (first inversion if Eb were in bass, but it’s second inversion if Bb is bass)**.

Wait: Chord is Eb, bass is Bb → so: **E♭** (chord): E♭–G–B♭, played with **Bb in the bass** → So notes: **Bb, Eb, G, Bb**.

So: **B♭, E♭, G** → This is **B♭–D–F**? No — G is not D.

But: **B♭, E♭, G** → this is not a Bb major chord (which is Bb–D–F). Here we have a **G natural**, which is **not in Bb major**. D is missing.

But G is the **major 3rd of Eb**, so this is just **Eb major** with Bb in the bass → so **Eb/Bb** = **Eb major chord (second inversion)**.

So the chord is **Eb major**, harmony-wise.

But why is it written as **Eb/Bb**? Likely to emphasize the bass movement.

So **Eb/Bb** → harmony: **Eb major**.

But in the key context, Eb major chord appears.

Similarly:

- **Dm/C** → D minor with C in bass: notes C, D, F, A → so root is D, quality is minor, bass is C → likely for voice-leading.

- **Bb6** → Bb with a 6th = Bb–D–F–G

---

### Step 2: List of Chords (by root, ignoring bass for functional analysis)

Let’s write the functional progression:

1. Cm
2. Cm
3. Adim/C → A° (A–C–Eb)
4. Adim/C → A°
5. Cm
6. Cm
7. Eb (with Bb in bass) → Eb major chord
8. Dm (with C in bass) → Dm
9. Cm
10. Cm
11. Adim/C → A°
12. Adim/C → A°
13. Cm
14. Cm
15. Bb6 (Bb–D–F–G)
16. Cm

So harmonic roots:
- Cm
- Cm
- A°
- A°
- Cm
- Cm
- Eb
- Dm
- Cm
- Cm
- A°
- A°
- Cm
- Cm
- Bb6
- Cm

So the harmonic progression is mainly moving between **Cm**, **A°**, **Eb**, **Dm**, **Bb6**

---

### Step 3: Look for Key Center

The tonic chord appears most often: **Cm** is played frequently and ends the progression.

So **tonic = C minor**

But let’s check: does it sound like a C minor key?

Let’s look at the chords:

- **Cm** – i
- **A°** – This is the **leading tone chord of Bb major**? Or **iii° in C harmonic minor**?

Let’s test **C natural minor (Aeolian)**:
- C D Eb F G Ab Bb C
- Chords: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII

In C natural minor:
- A° would be the chord on VI? F, A, C → F, A, C → FM? No.

Wait:
- i: Cm
- ii°: D°
- III: Eb
- iv: Fm
- v: Gm
- VI: Ab
- VII: Bb

So **A° is NOT in C natural minor**. A° = A, C, Eb → A is not in C minor scale.

But **A° occurs**, so must use **harmonic or melodic minor**.

Try **C harmonic minor**:
- C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B
- The scale has **B natural** instead of Bb

In C harmonic minor:
- Chord on **A** is **A°** (A–C–Eb) = **iii°**
- Chord on **E** is **Eaug** (E–G#–B) → not present
- Chord on **B** is **B°** = **vii°**

So **A°** would be the **iii°** chord in C harmonic minor.

But is that common? iii° is rare.

Wait — A° could also be the **vii° of Dm**? But A° = A–C–Eb, and Dm = D–F–A → A° is not leading to Dm.

Alternatively, **Adim** is commonly the **ii° chord in G minor**, but we're centered on Cm.

Wait — **Adim/C** is written with **C in the bass**, so maybe it’s functioning as a **diminished chord over C**, i.e., C with upper extensions.

Notes of **Adim/C**: C (bass), A, C, Eb → so pitches: C, Eb, A → wait: A–C–Eb are the chord, with C in bass.

So full notes: C, Eb, A → that’s **Cm6**? C–Eb–G–A → but no G here.

A–C–Eb = A diminished.

C–Eb–A = C minor triad plus A → that’s **Cm6** (C–Eb–G–A) missing the G.

Alternatively, **C–Eb–A** = **C half-diminished?** No, no Bb.

Wait: C, Eb, A → Eb to A is augmented 4th (tritone), but C to A is major 6th.

So this chord — **Adim/C** — may be used as a **Cm6** substitute (C–Eb–G–A), but missing G. Or it's a **iv°7** or something.

But more likely, **Adim over C** is being used as a chromatic approach chord.

Alternatively, consider that in **C minor**, the **6th degree is Ab**, so A natural is **raised 6th**, suggesting **melodic minor**.

In **C melodic minor** ascending: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B — so **A natural and B natural**.

In that scale:
- Dm = ii
- Eb = bIII
- A° = vii° (but no — A is scale degree 6, so chord on A is **A diminished**, yes — in C melodic minor, 6th degree is A, chord built on it is A–C–Eb = A° → **vi°** chord → yes.

So in C melodic minor:
- i: Cm
- ii: Dm
- bIII: Eb
- iv°: F°
- V: G or G7
- vi°: A°
- vii°: B°

Ah! So **A°** is the **vi°** chord in **C melodic minor**.

But vi° is not commonly used, unless in inversions.

Still, possible.

But look at this part:
- Cm – Adim/C – Cm
That’s like a **chromatic mediant** or passing chord.

But wait — **Adim/C** → C, Eb, A → that’s almost **Cm6**, which is common in minor keys as a color.

But Cm6 = C–Eb–G–A, missing the G.

Possibly the G is omitted.

Alternatively, **Adim/C** functions as a **vii°7 of Bb**, but that would resolve to Bb.

But here it resolves to Cm.

Wait — **Adim** is enharmonic to **C#dim7**, but that might not help.

Alternatively, think voice leading:
Adim/C has notes: C, Eb, A (from A° chord). The **A** moves down to G in Eb chord? Not clear.

Wait — progression:
- Cm
- Adim/C
- Cm
- Eb/Bb
- Dm/C

So after Cm–Adim/C–Cm, then goes to **Eb/Bb**

**Eb major** is the **bIII chord in C minor** — very common in minor keys.

Then **Dm/C** — Dm is **ii chord in C minor**, again common.

Then back to **Cm**, **Adim**, **Cm**, **Bb6**, **Cm**

**Bb6** = Bb–D–F–G → which is **Bb major 6th** — Bb is **VII in C minor**, so **bVII chord**, and adding the 6th (G) makes it smooth.

bVII is common in pop and rock in minor keys.

So all chords fit in **C minor**:

- Cm = i
- A° = vi° (in melodic minor)
- Eb = bIII
- Dm = ii
- Bb6 = bVII with 6th

So all chords exist in **C minor**, particularly C **harmonic** and **melodic minor**.

But A° as a harmonic chord is unusual as a full bar, but as a color or passing chord, possible.

But notice that **Adim/C** has **C as bass throughout**, so maybe it's not functioning as A dim, but as a **Cm with chromatic upper voice**.

In jazz or romantic harmony, **Cm – Cm6 – Cm** is common, but Cm6 is C–Eb–G–A.

But here **Adim/C** is **C, Eb, A** — missing the G.

So it's like a **Cm6 without the fifth** — often allowed.

In fact, many musicians use **Adim/C** as a shorthand for **Cm6** because A–C–Eb–G is Cm7b5? No.

Wait: **Fm7b5** is F–Ab–Bb–Eb, etc.

Actually, **Cm6** = C–Eb–G–A

But **A°7** = A–C–Eb–Gb (same as F)

But **A°** = A–C–Eb

So **Adim/C** = C–E♭–A

That’s **Cm6**, missing the **G**.

So probably, **Adim/C** is being used here as a **voicing for Cm6**, even though strictly it's incomplete.

Similarly, **Dm/C** = C–D–F–A → that’s **C9sus4 without G and Bb?** Or just **Dm over C** for voice leading.

**Eb/Bb** = Bb–Eb–G → Eb chord in second inversion.

**Bb6** = Bb–D–F–G

All very consonant.

### Most Likely Key: **C minor**

But which mode?

- **C natural minor** = C D Eb F G Ab Bb — but has **A♭**, not **A natural**, so **Adim** (which requires A natural) is **not** in natural minor.
- **C harmonic minor** = C D Eb F G Ab B — has **B natural**, but **A♭**, not A natural → A° cannot be formed (would need A natural)
- **C melodic minor (ascending)** = C D Eb F G A B — includes **A natural and B natural** → so **A° chord** on 6th degree (A–C–Eb) → yes, **vi°**

So only **C melodic minor** contains both **A natural** and **C**, **Eb**.

Therefore, **A°** is justified as **vi°** in **C melodic minor**.

But is the mode melodic minor?

Wait — we don’t have **B natural** anywhere in the chords.

Check all chords:

- Cm = C–Eb–G → no B
- Adim/C = A–C–Eb → no B
- Eb = Eb–G–Bb → **Bb**, not B natural
- Dm = D–F–A → no B
- Bb6 = Bb–D–F–G → Bb

So **B natural is absent**, but **Bb appears in Eb and Bb6**

So the **B** is **Bb**, not B natural.

Therefore, **melodic minor ascending** (with B natural) is **not used**.

But **A natural** is used in A°, which is not in natural minor (which has Ab).

So we have **A natural** and **Bb** — that is **C Dorian mode?**

Wait: C Dorian: C D Eb F G A Bb C

Yes! That’s it.

- Notes: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb

So:
- Cm = i
- Dm = ii
- Eb = bIII
- Fm = iv
- Gm = v
- Am = VI
- Bb = bVII

But we have **Adim**, not **Am**.

Adim = A–C–Eb → but in Dorian, A is **A natural**, but chord should be **Am** (A–C–E), not A–C–Eb.

Ah — **Eb**, not E natural.

So **Adim** requires **Eb**, but in Dorian, we have **E natural**? No.

C Dorian: A is 6th note, **A natural**, and the 3rd above is **C**, and 5th is **E natural** → so chord is **A minor**, not diminished.

But here we have **Adim**, which has **Eb** as 5th → so **A–C–Eb** → which requires **Eb**, not E natural.

So **Adim = A–C–Eb**, which implies **Eb** (minor third).

So Eb is in the key, which is fine (C minor has Eb), but the chord on A is **diminished**, which requires both **A natural** and **Eb**.

So scale must contain both A and Eb.

C melodic minor has: Eb and A → yes

But also requires B natural → not present.

C harmonic minor: G, Ab, B — has Ab, not A.

So **no standard minor scale has both A natural and Ab**? No, you pick one.

But in **jazz or chromatic contexts**, we borrow.

Perhaps the **Adim/C** is not representing a true harmonic function of A, but is **a passing chord**.

But let’s consider **C minor with modal interchange**.

Alternatively, think **C Aeolian (natural minor)**: C D Eb F G Ab Bb

We have **A natural** in Adim, but key has **Ab**, so A natural is **chromatic**.

So **A° is borrowed from C melodic minor** or used as **secondary leading tone chord**.

A° is the **vii° of Bb major** (A–C–Eb → leads to Bb), but here it resolves to Cm, not Bb.

Sequence: Adim/C → Cm → so it’s **approaching Cm from below by half step?** A° doesn't approach Cm directly.

A to C = minor 3rd.

Alternatively, **voice leading**:
- In Cm: C, Eb, G
- In Adim/C: C, Eb, A
- So G moves to A — chromatic upper neighbor.

So **G → A → G**, or G → A → Eb?

But then goes to Cm again.

So **A is a chromatic passing tone between G and Eb or G and G**.

But Eb is common.

So this suggests **Cm – Cm(add9#5?)** — no.

Most plausible: **Adim/C** is a **misleading notation** for **Cm6**, which is a common chord in C minor.

In many fake books, **Adim/C** is used as a shorthand for **Cm6** because A–C–Eb is the upper structure, even though it’s missing the root and fifth.

Similarly, **Cm6** = C–Eb–G–A, so upper three notes from **A–C–Eb** = A diminished triad.

So **Adim/C** = **Cm6** with missing G.

Therefore, **Adim/C** is likely just a **Cm6 chord**, and we can reinterpret it as such.

Similarly:
- **Eb/Bb** = **Eb major** in second inversion → fine.
- **Dm/C** = Dm over C → could be **C9sus** or just a voice-leading device.

So progression becomes:

- Cm
- Cm6
- Cm
- Cm
- Cm
- Eb
- Dm (over C bass?)
- Cm
- Cm
- Cm6
- Cm
- Cm
- Eb
- Dm?
- Cm
- Cm
- Bb6
- Cm

More clearly:

Cm → Cm6 → Cm → Eb → Dm → Cm → Cm6 → Cm → Bb6 → Cm

These are all **diatonic to C natural minor** (Aeolian) if we accept:
- Cm6 = C–Eb–G–A → requires **A natural**, but C natural minor has **Ab**, not A.

Uh-oh.

C natural minor: has **Ab**, not A.

So A natural is **not** in C natural minor.

Therefore, **A natural** must be a **raised 6th**, which is characteristic of **melodic minor** (ascending) or Dorian.

But in **Dorian**, we have A natural and B natural, but we need **Bb**, not B natural.

C Dorian: Bb — yes.

C Dorian: C D Eb F G A Bb C → has **A natural and Bb** → perfect!

But chord on A: should be **Am (A–C–E)**, not **Adim (A–C–Eb)**.

But here we have **Eb**, not **E natural**.

So the fifth of the A chord is **Eb**, not E, so it’s diminished: A–C–Eb.

But in Dorian, the **E should be natural**.

So unless the E is altered, we have a problem.

So **Adim** requires **Eb**, but Dorian has **E natural**.

So cannot have both **A natural** and **Eb** unless E is flatted.

But Eb is the third of the key.

Conclusion: **The chord Adim/C with A natural and Eb implies that the scale must have A and Eb.**

The only scale where this works without contradiction is **C minor with chromaticism**, or **A diminished is a passing chord**, not diatonic.

Perhaps the key is **C minor**, and the **Adim/C is a common chromatic chord** used as a **neighbor chord to Cm**, implying a **brief shift**.

But let’s look at the bass: C – C – C – C – C – C – Bb – C – C – C – C – C – C – C – Bb – C

So bass: mostly C, then Bb, then C, then Bb, then C.

So motion: C → Bb → C

Bb is bVII in C minor.

So harmony: i – (chromatic) – i – bIII – ii – i – (chromatic) – i – bVII6 – i

So the **tonic is Cm**.

The presence of **Eb (bIII)**, **Dm (ii)**, **Bb (bVII)** are all characteristic of **C natural minor (Aeolian)**.

The only chromatic chord is **Adim/C**, which uses **A natural**, so it's **a raised 6th degree**, suggesting a **borrowing from melodic minor** or **Dorian**, but Dorian doesn't have Eb as fifth.

After deep review:

The most likely explanation is that **Adim/C** is used as a **chordal alteration or passing chord**, and the key is still **C minor**, specifically **C Aeolian (natural minor)**, with a **chromatic passing tone (A natural)**.

But since A natural appears in a whole chord, it's more than a passing tone.

Alternatively, the key is **C minor**, and the mode is **not purely diatonic**, but the tonic is Cm, and the piece uses notes from various minor variants.

**Final Decision:**

Given that:
- Tonic chord is Cm
- Most chords (Cm, Eb, Dm, Bb) are in C natural minor
- Adim/C uses A natural and Eb, which is not diatonic, but common as a passing chord
- No B natural, so not melodic minor
- No E natural, so not Dorian

Probably, the **key is C minor**, and the **mode is Aeolian (natural minor)**, with **chromatic alteration** (A natural used as a #5 extension or in Adim for color, possibly as a ii°7 or passing chord).

But another possibility: **C Phrygian**? C Db Eb F G Ab Bb — has Db, not D.

We have Dm, so D natural, not Db. So not Phrygian.

Only possibility: **key is C minor, mode is C natural minor (Aeolian) with chromaticism**.

Or accept that **Adim/C** is misnamed, and should be **Cm6**, and the A natural is the 6th, which is borrowed from melodic minor.

This is very common in jazz and pop.

So: **Key: C minor**

**Mode: C minor, with use of major 6th (A) from melodic minor – so a hybrid scale, but tonality is C minor.**

But the mode? The most accurate answer is that the **key is C minor**, and the **mode is primarily Aeolian**, with **borrowing from melodic minor** for the 6th degree.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Key: C minor**  
**Mode: C minor (Aeolian) with chromaticism / modal mixture, incorporating the major 6th (A natural) from C melodic minor.**
