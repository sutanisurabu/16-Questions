Let's analyze this chord progression:  

```
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C  Cm  Cm  Eb/Bb  Dm/C  
Cm  Cm  Adim/C  Adim/C  Cm  Cm  Bb6  Cm
```

### Step 1: Identify tonal center

The chord **Cm** appears repeatedly and at structurally important points (beginning, middle, and end). This strongly suggests **C minor** is the tonal center.

### Step 2: Examine supporting chords

Let’s look at each non-tonic chord in the context of C minor:

| Chord | Notes | Possible function in C minor |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------|
| Adim (A–C–Eb) | A, C, Eb | ii° (diminished supertonic) |
| Eb/Bb | Eb, G, Bb; with Bb in bass | III chord (Eb major = C minor’s relative major) |
| Dm/C | D, F, A, C | This is a Dm7/C, which could imply a borrowed chord (from C Dorian or possibly a secondary function) |
| Bb6 | Bb, D, F, G | This could be a VI (Bb major) with an added sixth or related to a submediant color chord |

### Step 3: Consider mode / scale sources

In **C natural minor (Aeolian)**, the diatonic chords are:

| Scale degree | Chord | Quality |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| i | Cm | minor |
| ii° | D° | diminished |
| III | Eb | major |
| iv | Fm | minor |
| v | Gm | minor |
| VI | Ab | major |
| VII | Bb | major |

However, we see **Adim** (A–C–Eb), which fits the **harmonic minor** (because of raised B♮ relative to natural minor, implying use of the leading tone).  
The **Dm/C** introduces F and A natural, suggesting **Dorian** flavor (raised 6th: A natural in C Dorian).

### Step 4: Interpretation

- The tonal center is clearly **C**.
- The harmony oscillates primarily around **i (Cm)** and **ii° (Adim)**.
- The presence of **A natural** (in Adim and Dm) implies the raised 6th degree → typical of **C Dorian** mood.
- Some III and VI chords (Eb and Bb) are shared between Aeolian and Dorian, so they don't clarify the distinction much.

### ✅ **Conclusion**

**Key:** C  
**Mode:** Most likely **C Dorian**, due to the recurring A natural (in Adim) and the chromatic flavor that comes from mixing A♭/A♮.  
If the A natural feels emphasized and no A♭ chords appear, then **C Dorian** is the best fit.  

If, however, later sections contain A♭ or G major chords, it may shift between **C minor (Aeolian)** and **C harmonic minor**.  

**Final answer:**  
**Key:** C  
**Mode:** C Dorian (with touches of C harmonic minor coloration).
