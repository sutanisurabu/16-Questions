### Reasoning

First, the user has given a chord progression: Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Eb/Bb Dm/C Cm Cm Adim/C Adim/C Cm Cm Bb6 Cm. I need to determine the key and mode.

I recall that key and mode refer to the tonal center and whether it's major or minor. Since there are many Cm chords, it's likely that the key is C minor. But I should verify this by looking at the other chords.

Let me list out all the chords clearly:

- Cm

- Cm

- Adim/C

- Adim/C

- Cm

- Cm

- Eb/Bb

- Dm/C

- Cm

- Cm

- Adim/C

- Adim/C

- Cm

- Cm

- Bb6

- Cm

Now, Adim/C is a bit confusing. Adim probably means A diminished chord, and /C means with C in the bass. So Adim/C is an A diminished chord with a C bass. But since Adim is a diminished chord, it consists of A, C, Eb, and Gb. But with C in the bass, it might be functioning as a passing chord or something.

Similarly, Eb/Bb is Eb major with Bb in the bass, which is the same as Eb major in first inversion? Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. So with Bb in the bass, it's Eb/Bb, which is the same as Bb7? No, Bb7 would have Bb, D, F, Ab. Eb/Bb has Eb, G, Bb with Bb bass, so it's like a slash chord.

Dm/C is D minor with C bass, so Dm chord is D, F, A, and with C bass, it might be Dm7 or something.

Bb6 is Bb major with an added 6th? Bb6 chord typically means Bb, D, F, G, so it's a major chord with 6th.

Now, to find the key, I should look at the chords that are diatonic to a scale. Since Cm appears frequently, let's assume C minor is the key.

The natural minor scale of C minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

But in chord progressions, often the harmonic minor or melodic minor are used, especially with diminished chords.

Let's see the chords in C natural minor:

- Cm: C, Eb, G

- Dm: D, F, Ab? But Dm is D, F, A? In C natural minor, the chord on D is D diminished because the notes are D, F, Ab. But here we have Dm/C, which is D, F, A with C bass. So Dm has A natural, but in C natural minor, the A is Ab. So this suggests that the A is natural, which might indicate harmonic minor or melodic minor.

In C harmonic minor, the scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So the chords would be:

- i: Cm

- ii°: D diminished

- III+: Eb augmented? But Eb augmented would be Eb, G, B, but here we have Eb/Bb, which is Eb major with Bb bass, so Eb major chord, which is Eb, G, Bb. In harmonic minor, the Eb chord would be Eb, G, Bb? Bb is the flat 7, so in harmonic minor, the III chord is actually Eb major because the B is natural? Let's see: in C harmonic minor, the notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B. So the chord built on Eb would be Eb, G, Bb? But Bb is not in the scale; the scale has B natural. So if we build a chord on Eb, using scale notes: Eb, G, B? But B is not a third from Eb? Eb to G is minor third? Let's list the chords properly.

In harmonic minor, the chords are:

- i: C minor (C, Eb, G)

- ii°: D diminished (D, F, Ab)

- III+: Eb augmented (Eb, G, B) because Eb to G is major third, G to B is major third, so augmented.

- iv: F minor (F, Ab, C)

- V: G major (G, B, D) because B is raised.

- VI: Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)

- vii°: B diminished (B, D, F)

But in the progression, we have Eb/Bb, which is Eb major with Bb bass. Eb major chord is Eb, G, Bb. But in harmonic minor, the Eb chord should be augmented if we use the scale tones. So Eb major with Bb doesn't fit harmonic minor because Bb is not in the scale; the scale has B natural.

Similarly, we have Dm/C, which is D minor with C bass. D minor chord is D, F, A. But in harmonic minor, the ii chord is diminished, so D, F, Ab, not D, F, A.

So this suggests that we might be in C natural minor or another mode.

Let's look at the Adim/C chords. Adim is A diminished, which is A, C, Eb, Gb. But with C bass, it's like C bass with A, C, Eb, Gb, which is essentially a C7b9 without the root? Or something else.

In C minor, the diminished chords often come from the harmonic minor scale. For example, the vii° chord is B diminished, which is B, D, F, Ab? In harmonic minor, vii° is B, D, F, which is diminished, but B, D, F is a diminished triad, and since it's vii°, it's fully diminished if we add the seventh, but in triads, it's just diminished.

But here we have Adim, which is not the vii° of C minor; vii° would be Bdim.

Adim would be the ii° of G minor? Let's think differently.

Perhaps the key is not C minor. Let's list all the root notes from the chords.

The chords are: Cm, Adim, Eb, Dm, Bb6.

But Adim has /C, so the bass is C, but the chord is Adim.

Similarly, Dm has /C, so bass is C.

So the harmonic roots might be C, A, Eb, D, Bb, but with bass notes affecting the function.

In terms of key, let's see the relationship between chords.

Cm is i if in C minor.

Eb is III if in C minor, but Eb major is not in C natural minor? In C natural minor, the III chord is Eb major because Eb, G, Bb all are in the natural minor scale. Yes! In natural minor, the chords are:

- i: Cm

- ii°: D diminished

- III: Eb major

- iv: Fm

- v: Gm

- VI: Ab major

- VII: Bb major

So in C natural minor, Eb major is the III chord, and Bb major is the VII chord.

In the progression, we have Eb/Bb, which is Eb major with Bb bass, so it's like Eb in first inversion? Eb chord with Bb bass means the third is in the bass? Eb chord: Eb, G, Bb. With Bb bass, it's the fifth in bass, so it's second inversion? Let's see: if root is Eb, and bass is Bb, it's Eb/Bb, which is second inversion.

Similarly, Dm/C is Dm with C bass, so root D, bass C, so it's Dm7? Dm chord is D, F, A, and with C bass, it might imply Dm7 with C in bass, so Dm7/C, which is a Dm7 chord in third inversion? Dm7 is D, F, A, C, so with C bass, it's the seventh in bass.

But in terms of key, if we are in C natural minor, then Dm should be D diminished, but here it is Dm, which has A natural instead of Ab. So Dm is not diatonic to C natural minor; it has A natural, which is the major third of D, but in C minor, the A should be Ab for the ii chord.

So for Dm to be used, it must be that the scale has A natural, which means we are not in natural minor.

Perhaps we are in C Dorian mode? C Dorian has C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. So in C Dorian, the chords would be:

- i: Cm

- ii: Dm

- III: Eb major

- IV: F major

- v: Gm

- vi: A diminished? Let's see: on A, the notes are A, C, Eb, which is A diminished triad? A, C, Eb is indeed a diminished triad, so vi°: A diminished.

- VII: Bb major

So in C Dorian, we have Dm and A diminished, which matches our progression: we have Dm/C and Adim/C.

And we have Eb major, which is III, and Bb6, which is VII with an added 6th, but Bb6 is Bb, D, F, G, and in C Dorian, Bb major is VII, and adding G is the 6th, which is the same as the 13th? But since it's Bb6, it's fine, and G is in the scale.

Also, we have Cm throughout, which is i.

So this seems to fit perfectly.

Let's verify the chords:

- Cm: i of C Dorian

- Adim: vi° of C Dorian? In C Dorian, the chord on the 6th degree is A diminished, since A, C, Eb.

But Adim is A diminished, which is A, C, Eb, and since it's Adim/C, it has C in bass, so it's like A diminished with C bass, which might be emphasizing the C, but the chord is still A diminished.

In the progression, it's used as a passing chord or something.

Similarly, Dm/C is Dm with C bass, and Dm is the ii chord in C Dorian.

Eb/Bb is Eb with Bb bass, and Eb is the III chord, and Bb is the seventh of the scale, so it's fine.

Bb6 is Bb with added G, and G is the fifth of the scale, so it's diatonic.

So overall, the key is C minor, but the mode is Dorian.

But let's confirm the mode. In Dorian mode, the characteristic note is the major sixth. In C minor, the natural sixth is Ab, but in Dorian, it is A natural. And here we have Dm, which has A natural, and Adim, which has A natural? Adim has A, C, Eb, so the A is natural, but in Adim, the A is the root, and it's diminished, but in terms of scale, the A is natural, which is the major sixth from C.

So yes, the presence of A natural in Dm and Adim confirms that we are in C Dorian.

Therefore, the key is C Dorian.

But typically, when we say key, we might say C minor with Dorian mode, or simply C Dorian.

Since Dorian is a mode of Bb major, because C Dorian is the second mode of Bb major. But the tonal center is C, so we say key of C Dorian.

In the chord progression, we have Bb6, which is the VII chord, which in Dorian is major, and it leads to Cm.

So I think this is correct.

To be thorough, let's see if there are any other possibilities.

If we consider C natural minor, we have Eb major, but we don't have Dm or Adim; we have D diminished and A diminished? In C natural minor, the chord on A is Ab major, not A diminished. So Adim doesn't fit natural minor.

In C harmonic minor, we have B diminished, but not Adim, and we have G major, but not Dm.

So only Dorian fits.

Therefore, the key is C Dorian.

So for the answer, I should say the key is C minor with Dorian mode, or simply C Dorian.

Since the user said "key and mode", I should specify both.

The key is C, and the mode is Dorian.

So, key: C, mode: Dorian.

But let's write it properly.

The chord progression primarily centers around C minor, but the use of A natural in the Dm and Adim chords indicates the Dorian mode. Specifically, the Dm chord (which contains A natural) and the Adim chord (which also contains A natural) are diatonic to C Dorian, as opposed to C natural minor where the sixth scale degree is Ab. The Eb and Bb6 chords are also consistent with C Dorian, where Eb is the III chord and Bb is the VII chord.

Thus, the key is C, and the mode is Dorian. This means the scale used is C Dorian: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb.

**Summary:**
- **Key:** C
- **Mode:** Dorian
