To determine the key and mode of the chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

Cm – Cm – Adim/C – Adim/C – Cm – Cm – Eb/Bb – Dm/C – Cm – Cm – Adim/C – Adim/C – Cm – Cm – Bb6 – Cm

---

### Step 1: Look at the tonic (home chord)
- The progression **starts and ends on Cm**, and **Cm appears very frequently** (10 out of 16 chords).
- This strongly suggests **C minor** is the tonic.

### Step 2: Identify the key signature / diatonic chords
In **C natural minor** (Aeolian mode), the diatonic chords are:

- i: Cm  
- ii°: Ddim  
- bIII: Eb  
- iv: Fm  
- v: Gm  
- bVI: Ab  
- bVII: Bb  

But in the progression we see:
- **Cm** → i  
- **Adim/C** → Adim is not diatonic to C natural minor. In C minor, A° would be the **vii°** chord **only if we use the harmonic minor scale** (which raises the 7th degree: B natural).
   - In **C harmonic minor**: C–D–Eb–F–G–Ab–B–C
   - The vii° chord is **B°**, not A°.
   - So **Adim** is **not** diatonic to C natural or harmonic minor.

Wait—let’s double-check **Adim**:
- A° = A–C–Eb
- In **C minor**, A is the **6th scale degree**.
- In **C natural minor**, the 6th is **Ab**, not A natural.
- So **A natural** is **not in the key of C minor** unless we’re using a mode or borrowing.

But perhaps **Adim/C** is functioning as a **passing chord** or as part of a **voice-leading** motion.

Let’s look at **Eb/Bb**: that’s an **Eb major chord** with Bb in the bass → this is the **bIII** chord in C minor → **diatonic to natural minor**.

**Dm/C**: Dm = D–F–A → over C bass. D is the 2nd scale degree. In C natural minor, the 2nd chord is **Ddim** (D–F–Ab), but here we have **Dm (with A natural)**. That again introduces **A natural**, which is **not in C natural minor**.

**Bb6**: Bb6 = Bb–D–F–G → this is the **bVII6** chord in C minor. D natural appears here, which is fine (D is the 2nd degree), but again, **D natural implies A natural** is not necessarily required—but the **Dm chord** includes **A natural**, which is the raised 6th.

So we see **A natural** appearing consistently (in Adim and Dm), which suggests the **melodic minor** scale or **Dorian mode**.

### Step 3: Consider C Dorian
C Dorian mode = C–D–Eb–F–G–A–Bb–C

- Contains: Cm (i), Dm (ii), Eb (bIII), F (IV), Gm (v), Adim (vi°), Bb (bVII)

Wait—**Adim** in C Dorian:
- A–C–Eb → yes! A is natural, C and Eb are in the key → **Adim is the vi° chord in C Dorian**.

Also, **Dm** is the **ii chord** in C Dorian → D–F–A → all diatonic.

**Eb** is bIII → diatonic.

**Bb6**: Bb–D–F–G → all notes are in C Dorian.

So **all chords fit C Dorian**:
- Cm = i  
- Adim = vi°  
- Eb = bIII  
- Dm = ii  
- Bb6 = bVII6

Therefore, **the mode is Dorian**, and the **key is C minor** (or more precisely, **C Dorian**).

### Step 4: Rule out other options
- **C natural minor (Aeolian)**: would have Ab and Bb, not A natural → contradicted by Dm and Adim.
- **C harmonic minor**: has B natural, which we don’t see (no G major or E° chords that would signal harmonic minor).
- **C melodic minor (ascending)**: has A and B natural – but we see Bb (in Bb6, Eb/Bb), so B natural is absent → rules out melodic minor.
- **C Dorian**: has A natural and Bb → matches perfectly.

### ✅ Conclusion:
- **Key**: C minor  
- **Mode**: **Dorian**

So the progression is in **C Dorian**.
