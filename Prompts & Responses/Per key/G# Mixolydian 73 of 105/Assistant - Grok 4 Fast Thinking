**Key:** G♯ major  
**Mode:** Ionian  

This progression centers on G♯ major as the tonic chord, with repeated emphasis on it throughout (starting, repeating, and ending on G♯). The other chords (including the slash chords like Fm/G♯, which functions as a chromatic dominant or tension-builder, Cdim/F♯ as a passing diminished chord, A♯m/G♯ as a relative minor inflection, and F♯6 as a subdominant resolution) add color and tension but resolve back to the G♯ tonic, supporting the major tonality without strongly suggesting a shift to the parallel minor. The overall structure and bass movement (primarily G♯ with brief F♯ descents) confirm Ionian mode as the diatonic framework, with some chromatic borrowing for flavor.
