**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#

I need to determine the key and mode. Let me list out the chords clearly:

- G#

- G#

- Fm/G# (which is F minor with G# in the bass)

- Fm/G#

- Cdim/F# (C diminished with F# in the bass)

- A#m/G# (A# minor with G# in the bass)

- G#

- G#

- Fm/G#

- Fm/G#

- G#

- G#

- F#6

- G#

The chords are written with bass notes, so I should consider the overall harmony. Let me interpret the chords based on their root positions or functions.

Starting with G#. G# could be a chord, but in context, it might be G# major or something. Since it's just written as G#, I'll assume it's a G# major chord for now.

Similarly, Fm/G# is F minor with G# bass. But G# is not in the F minor chord, so this might be a slash chord indicating a different root. F minor chord is F, Ab, C. But G# is the same as Ab, so Fm/G# could be F minor with Ab in the bass, which is essentially an F minor chord in first inversion? Let's see: F minor chord notes: F, Ab, C. With Ab in the bass, it's Fm/Ab, which is common. But here it's written as G#, which is enharmonic to Ab, so yes, Fm/G# is F minor with Ab in the bass.

Similarly, Cdim/F#: C diminished chord is C, Eb, Gb. With F# in the bass, F# is enharmonic to Gb, so Cdim/F# might be C diminished with Gb in the bass, but that could be confusing. Cdim chord is often symmetric, but with F# bass, it might be functioning as something else.

A#m/G#: A# minor chord is A#, C#, E#? Wait, A# minor is A#, C#, E#? But E# is F, so A# minor is A#, C#, F. With G# in the bass, G# is enharmonic to Ab.

This is getting messy with enharmonic equivalents. I should think in terms of keys to avoid confusion.

Let me consider the key signature. The chords have G#, F#, A#, etc. This suggests a key with several sharps. G# is the tonic? Let's see the progression.

I recall that in music theory, chords are often analyzed in relation to a key center. Let me list the chord roots from the progression, ignoring the bass notes for now, and focus on the chord qualities.

The chords are:

- G# (probably major)

- Fm (minor)

- Cdim (diminished)

- A#m (minor)

- F#6 (F# major with added 6th? F#6 chord is F#, A#, C#, D#)

But let's list all chord symbols:

- G# : likely G# major

- Fm/G# : F minor with G# bass

- Cdim/F# : C diminished with F# bass

- A#m/G# : A# minor with G# bass

- F#6 : F# major 6th

And repeated G# and Fm/G#.

Now, to find the key, I need to see which scale these chords fit into.

Let me consider the possibility that G# is the tonic. If G# is I, then what are the other chords?

Fm is F minor, which in G# major? G# major scale is G# A# B# C# D# E# F##? That's messy because G# major has 8 sharps, which is impractical. Usually, keys with many sharps are written enharmonically as flat keys.

For example, G# major is enharmonic to Ab major. Similarly, F# major is enharmonic to Gb major.

So let's convert everything to flat keys for simplicity.

G# is enharmonic to Ab.

Fm is F minor, which is the same.

Cdim is C diminished.

A#m is A# minor, which is enharmonic to Bb minor.

F#6 is F# major 6th, enharmonic to Gb major 6th.

But let's think in Ab major. If the tonic is Ab, then Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords in Ab major:

I: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii: Gdim

Now look at the chords in the progression: we have G# which is Ab, Fm which is Fm, Cdim which is Cdim, A#m which is Bbm, and F#6 which is Gb6.

In Ab major, Fm is the vi chord, Bbm is the ii chord, Gb is the bVI chord, which is not diatonic. Gb is not in Ab major scale; Ab major has G natural, so Gb is flat VII? Let's see.

Ab major has G natural, so Gb is lowered 7th, so it might be from another mode.

Cdim is not in Ab major; Ab major has Gdim, not Cdim.

Cdim would be the vii dim in Db major? Let's think differently.

Perhaps the key is not Ab major.

Another approach: let's list the notes involved in the chords.

First, G# chord: G# B# D#? But B# is C, D# is E? No, G# major chord is G#, B#, D#. But B# is C, and D# is E, so enharmonically, it's Ab, C, Eb.

Similarly, Fm chord: F, Ab, C

Fm/G# is Fm with G# bass, so notes: G# (bass), F, Ab, C. But G# is Ab, so essentially, it's Fm with Ab bass, which is the same as F minor chord in first inversion? F minor chord with Ab in bass is Fm/Ab, which is common.

But in terms of harmony, when we have Fm/Ab, it can be considered as a chord with Ab as the root, but the chord is still F minor.

Similarly, Cdim/F#: Cdim chord is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass, notes: F#, C, Eb, Gb. But F# and Gb are enharmonic, so this is Cdim with Gb bass, but Gb is part of the chord? Cdim is C, Eb, Gb, so with Gb in bass, it's Cdim/Gb, which is essentially the same chord since dim chords are symmetric.

But Cdim/F# might be interpreted as a different chord. For example, if we think of F# as the root, then C, Eb, Gb are b5, bb7, and b3? That would be F# diminished? Let's see: F# diminished chord is F#, A, C, Eb? No, F# diminished is F#, A, C, Eb? Actually, a diminished chord is made of minor thirds, so F# dim is F#, A, C, Eb? But Eb is D#? Standard F# diminished is F#, A, C, but since it's fully diminished, it would have Eb if it's seventh, but here it's Cdim, which is likely C diminished triad or seventh? The symbol is Cdim, which usually means diminished triad, but in context, it might be implied as seventh.

In chord progressions, dim chords are often used as leading tones or passing chords.

Now, A#m/G#: A#m chord is A#, C#, E# (which is F), so notes A#, C#, F. With G# bass, notes: G#, A#, C#, F. So this is A#m with G# in bass.

F#6 chord: F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#. So notes F#, A#, C#, D#.

Now, let's list all the roots and bass notes from the progression:

Chords: G#, Fm, Cdim, A#m, F#6

But with bass notes: when we have slash chords, the bass note might be changing the inversion or implying a different root.

For harmonic analysis, we should consider the chord root and the bass separately, but for key finding, we need the harmonic function.

Let me see the sequence: it starts with G# repeated, then Fm/G# repeated, then Cdim/F#, then A#m/G#, then back to G# repeated, Fm/G# repeated, then G# repeated, then F#6, and G#.

So the progression is centered around G#.

Also, it ends on G#, so G# is likely the tonic.

But what mode? If G# is tonic, then what scale?

Let's see the chords: Fm and A#m are used, which are minor chords.

In G# major, the diatonic chords would be: I G#, ii A#m, iii B#m, IV C#, V D#, vi E#m, vii F##dim.

But we have Fm, which is not in G# major; Fm would be F Ab C, while in G# major, E#m is F minor? E# is F, so E#m is E# G# B#, which is F G# B#? B# is C, so E#m is F, G#, C? But F minor is F, Ab, C, so it's different because of the Ab vs G#.

G# is enharmonic to Ab, so in G# major, the mediant chord is B#m which is Cm, but here we have Fm, which has Ab, so it's not diatonic.

Perhaps it's G# minor? Let's check G# minor scale. G# minor is relative to B major, so G# minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#? But G# minor harmonic would have F##, but let's see diatonic chords in G# natural minor: i G#m, ii° A#dim, III B, iv C#m, v D#m, VI E, VII F#.

But in the progression, we have G# major, not minor, because it's written as G#, which implies major, and Fm, which is minor, but in G# minor, i is minor, so G# major would not be i.

The chord G# is written as G#, which typically means major triad, so it's G# major chord.

So if tonic is G# major, then the chords should fit into G# major, but Fm doesn't fit, A#m does fit as ii, but Cdim doesn't fit, and F#6 doesn't fit.

F#6 is F# A# C# D#, which in G# major, D# is the fifth, so F# A# C# D# is F# major with added 6th, but in G# major, F# is the leading tone? In G# major, the seventh scale degree is F##, not F#. So F# is not diatonic.

This is confusing. Let's think enharmonically.

Let me assume the key is Ab major for simplicity.

So Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim.

Now look at the chords in progression: G# is Ab, so I.

Fm is Fm, which is vi.

A#m is Bbm, which is ii.

Cdim is Cdim, which is not diatonic; in Ab major, we have Gdim, not Cdim.

Cdim would be the vii° of Db major? Or perhaps it's a passing chord.

F#6 is Gb6, which is Gb Bb Db Eb? Gb major chord with added 6th: Gb, Bb, Db, and Eb is the 6th. But in Ab major, Eb is the fifth, so Gb Bb Db Eb is Gb major 6th, but Gb is not in Ab major; it's the bVI chord, which is common in borrowed chords or modal mixture.

Similarly, Cdim might be a secondary dominant or something.

But let's see the progression: after Fm/G#, which is Fm/Ab, so vi chord in first inversion? In Ab major, vi is Fm, so Fm/Ab is Fm with Ab in bass, which is actually the I chord in bass? When we play Fm/Ab, it sounds like Ab with Fm above, but since Fm is vi, it's common to have vi in first inversion.

Similarly, A#m/G# is Bbm/Ab, which is ii chord with tonic in bass? Bbm/Ab means Bbm with Ab bass, so notes Ab, Bb, Db, F. In Ab major, this could be considered as I with added notes or something, but functionally, it might be ii chord over tonic pedal.

Then Cdim/F#: Cdim with F# bass. F# is Gb, so Cdim/Gb. Cdim is C, Eb, Gb, so with Gb bass, it's the same chord in first inversion? Cdim chord has Gb, so with Gb bass, it's Cdim/Gb, which is standard.

But what is Cdim in Ab major? Cdim is not diatonic. Cdim could be a common-tone diminished chord or something.

Perhaps the key is F minor? Let's check.

If F minor is i, then G# is not in F minor. F minor scale: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb? But G# is Ab, so G# is the mediant? In F minor, III is Ab major, so G# is Ab major, which is III.

Then Fm is i, but here Fm is played with G# bass, so i with III in bass? That might be possible.

Then Cdim/F#: Cdim is not in F minor; in F minor, the diminished chords are ii° Gdim, vii° Edim, etc.

A#m is Bbm, which is iv in F minor? In F minor, iv is Bbm, so yes, Bbm is iv.

Then F#6 is Gb6, which is bVI in F minor? In F minor, bVI is Gb major, so Gb6 is bVI with 6th.

But the progression starts and ends with G# which is Ab major, so if F minor is key, why does it start with Ab? That would be III, which is common in minor keys, but usually, it starts with i, not III.

In the progression, G# appears multiple times, and it ends with G#, so it seems like G# is the tonic.

Let's list the chord roots in order: G#, G#, Fm, Fm, Cdim, A#m, G#, G#, Fm, Fm, G#, G#, F#6, G#

So the roots are: G#, F, C, A#, F, G#, F#? But Fm and A#m are chords, so roots F and A#.

So roots: G#, F, C, A#, F, G#, F#? From the sequence: after Cdim and A#m, it goes to G#, so roots: G#, F, C, A#, G#, F, G#, F#? Let's list based on chord symbols:

- Chord 1: G# root

- Chord 2: G# root

- Chord 3: Fm root

- Chord 4: Fm root

- Chord 5: Cdim root

- Chord 6: A#m root

- Chord 7: G# root

- Chord 8: G# root

- Chord 9: Fm root

- Chord 10: Fm root

- Chord 11: G# root

- Chord 12: G# root

- Chord 13: F#6 root

- Chord 14: G# root

So the roots are primarily G# and F, with C and A# and F# appearing once.

So G# is dominant, and F is also frequent.

Now, the bass notes: for Fm, the bass is G#, for A#m, the bass is G#, for Cdim, the bass is F#.

So in many cases, the bass is on G# or F#, which suggests a pedal point or ostinato.

In fact, from the slash chords, when we have Fm/G#, it means the bass is playing G# while Fm chord is played, similarly for A#m/G#, bass is G#.

And for Cdim/F#, bass is F#.

And the plain G# chords have G# bass.

So overall, the bass is often G#, and sometimes F#.

So G# is a persistent bass note, which suggests that G# is the tonic pedal.

In music, when there is a pedal point, the key might be centered around that pedal note.

So likely, G# is the tonic.

But what scale? Let's see the chords over G# bass.

When bass is G#, the chords are G#, Fm, A#m, and also G# alone.

So over G# bass, we have G# major, F minor, A# minor.

What scale has G# major, F minor, and A# minor? 

G# major chord: G# B# D# → G# C D#? B# is C, D# is E, so notes G# C E? But C is not typically in G# major; let's use flats.

G# major chord: Ab C Eb

F minor chord: F Ab C

A# minor chord: Bb Db F? A#m is A# C# E# → A# C# F? But C# is Db, F is F, so Bb Db F.

So over Ab bass (G#), we have chords Ab C Eb (Ab major), F Ab C (F minor), and Bb Db F (Bb minor).

So the chords are Ab major, F minor, and Bb minor.

Now, what key has I, vi, and ii? In Ab major, I is Ab, vi is Fm, ii is Bbm, so yes! In Ab major, the chords are I, vi, and ii.

And in the progression, we have Fm/G# which is vi/I, and A#m/G# which is ii/I, meaning that the vi and ii chords are played over the tonic pedal.

So that makes sense.

Now, what about Cdim/F#? Cdim is C Eb Gb, and bass is F# which is Gb, so Cdim/F# is Cdim with Gb bass, which is essentially the same as Cdim/Gb.

But what is Cdim in Ab major? In Ab major, the diatonic diminished chord is Gdim, which is G Bb Db, but here we have Cdim, which is C Eb Gb.

C Eb Gb is the same as B D F? No, C Eb Gb is a diminished triad.

In Ab major, Cdim is not diatonic, but it might be used as a passing chord or as a secondary leading tone chord.

Notice that Cdim has Eb and Gb, and Ab major has Eb and Gb? Ab major has Eb as V, but Gb is not in the scale; Ab major has G natural, so Gb is flat 7? But in context, Cdim might be functioning as a chord leading to Bbm.

Cdim to Bbm: Cdim has C Eb Gb, Bbm has Bb Db F. The notes C to Bb, Eb to Db, Gb to F, so all moving down by half step, which is typical for diminished chords resolving to minor chords.

So Cdim is like a secondary leading tone chord to Bbm. In key of Ab, Bbm is ii, so Cdim could be the vii°/ii, which is the diminished chord of the ii key.

In key of Bb minor, the vii° chord would be A dim, but here it's Cdim, which is not vii° of Bb minor. Let's see the scale of Bb minor.

Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab? But vii° would be A dim? A dim is A C Eb, but here we have Cdim, which is C Eb Gb.

In Bb harmonic minor, the vii° is A dim, which is A C Eb, so not Cdim.

Cdim is actually the same as A dim? A dim is A C Eb, and C dim is C Eb Gb, which is different.

But notice that Cdim and A dim share two notes? A dim has A C Eb, C dim has C Eb Gb, so they are different.

Perhaps Cdim is an altered chord.

Another thought: Cdim/F# with F# bass. F# is Gb, so if we consider the chord as F# dim? F# dim chord is F# A C, but here we have C Eb Gb with F# bass, so notes F# C Eb Gb. If we rearrange, F# A C Eb would be F# fully diminished, but here we have C Eb Gb, which is C dim, and F# is added, so it might be F# diminished seventh chord? F# diminished seventh is F# A C Eb, but here we have C Eb Gb, and F# bass, so if we include the bass, the chord is F# C Eb Gb, which is F# A C Eb if A is implied? But A is not present? In a diminished seventh chord, all notes are minor thirds apart. F# to A is minor third, A to C is minor third, C to Eb is minor third, so F# A C Eb is fully diminished. But in this case, we have F# C Eb Gb. F# to C is diminished fifth, C to Eb is minor third, Eb to Gb is minor third, so it's not a standard stack of minor thirds. From F# to C is dim fifth, which is equivalent to minor third? F# to A is minor third, A to C is minor third, so F# to C is tritone, which is two minor thirds? No, two minor thirds are a diminished fifth, so F# to C is diminished fifth, which is equivalent to two minor thirds: F# to A is min3, A to C is min3, so F# to C is dim5. Similarly, C to Eb is min3, Eb to Gb is min3, so from F# to Gb is diminished seventh? Let's list the intervals from F#: F# to C is dim5, F# to Eb is major sixth? This is messy.

Perhaps for practical purposes, Cdim/F# can be heard as a F# half-diminished or something? But Cdim is a diminished triad, so with F# bass, it might be functioning as a dominant of something.

Notice that in the progression, after Cdim/F#, it goes to A#m/G# which is Bbm/Ab.

So Cdim/F# to Bbm/Ab.

The bass moves from F# to G#? F# to G# is whole step, but in the chord, bass is F# for Cdim and G# for A#m, so bass movement F# to G#.

But in terms of chord roots, C to Bb, which is half step down.

Now, in Ab major, the chord Bbm is ii, and Cdim might be used as a chromatic approach to ii.

Another possibility: Cdim is actually the same as G#dim? G#dim chord is G# B D F, but here we have Cdim which is C Eb Gb, and G# is Ab, so C Eb Gb is enharmonic to C Eb F#? But F# is Gb, so C Eb Gb is not the same as G# B D F.

Let's list the notes of Cdim/F#: notes played are F# (bass), C, Eb, Gb. So notes F#, C, Eb, Gb.

In Ab major, these notes are: F# is Gb, which is not in scale, C is in scale, Eb is in scale, Gb is not in scale. So it's chromatic.

But perhaps this chord is acting as a diminished chord leading to Bbm. The notes F# and Gb are the same, so from F# to G? In Bbm, the notes are Bb Db F, so from F# to F? F# to F is half step, from C to Bb is half step, from Eb to Db is half step, from Gb to F is half step? But Gb to F is half step only if Gb is F#? In equal temperament, Gb and F# are the same, so yes, all notes move down by half step to Bbm: F# to F, C to Bb, Eb to Db, Gb to F. But Gb to F is the same as F# to F? In terms of pitch, F# is higher than F, so F# to F is down half step, similarly Gb to F is down half step since Gb is F#.

So indeed, Cdim/F# has all notes resolving down by half step to Bbm/Ab. So it's a classic diminished chord resolution.

Therefore, Cdim/F# is functioning as a passing diminished chord to ii.

Now, finally, F#6 chord: F#6 is F# A# C# D#. Enharmonically, Gb Bb Db Eb.

In Ab major, this is Gb major with added 6th, which is the bVI chord. bVI is common in popular music and rock, often used as a submediant chord in major keys, borrowed from parallel minor.

So in this case, F#6 is bVI in Ab major.

And it resolves to G# which is I.

So the progression makes sense in Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

But the chords are written with sharps, so in terms of notation, it might be written in G# major, but as we know, G# major is enharmonic to Ab major, and Ab major is more common because it has only four flats, while G# major has eight sharps.

So in practice, the key is Ab major.

But let's confirm the mode: it's major mode, since the tonic chord is major.

So key: Ab major

Mode: major

But in the progression, we have minor chords vi and ii, which are diatonic, and bVI which is borrowed, but overall, it's major.

So for the answer, I think key is G# major enharmonic to Ab major, but since the chords are written with sharps, perhaps we should say key of G# major.

But in the question, the chords are written with G#, F#, etc., so likely the key is G# major.

But let's see the first chord: G#, and last chord G#, so tonic is G#.

So key: G# major

But in G# major, the chords Fm and A#m are not diatonic? In G# major, Fm would be? G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F##, so chords: I G#, ii A#m, iii B#m, IV C#, V D#, vi E#m, vii F##dim.

E#m is Fm? E#m is E# G# B#, which is F G# C? But F minor is F Ab C, so since G# is Ab, then E#m is F Ab C? But Ab is G#, so yes, E#m is F G# C, which is F major? No, F G# C is not a standard chord; F G# C would be F augmented if G# is sharp, but in E#m, it should be E# G# B#, and B# is C, so E# G# C, which is a minor triad because E# to G# is minor third, and G# to B# is major third? No, from E# to G#: E# is F, G# is Ab, so F to Ab is minor third, and Ab to C is major third, so it is a minor triad? Minor triad has root, minor third, perfect fifth. Here, if root is E# (F), then minor third is G# (Ab), and fifth is B# (C), so yes, it is a minor triad: F Ab C, which is F minor! So in G# major, the vi chord is E#m, which is F minor enharmonically.

Similarly, ii chord is A#m, which is A# C# E#, and E# is F, so A# C# F, which is A# minor.

And Cdim? In G# major, the vii dim is F##dim, which is F## A# C#, but F## is G, so G A# C#, which is G dim? But we have Cdim, which is C Eb Gb, so not the same.

But in the progression, we have Cdim/F#, which we interpreted as a secondary chord.

In G# major, Cdim would be not diatonic, but as we said, it resolves to A#m.

So in G# major, A#m is ii, and Cdim is like a secondary leading tone to ii, so it would be the vii°/ii, which in the key of A# minor, the vii° chord would be G##dim? Let's see.

In key of A# minor, the harmonic minor scale would have G## as leading tone? A# harmonic minor: A# B# C# D# E# F# G##? G## is A, so vii° is G##dim which is A C# E#? But we have Cdim which is C Eb Gb, which is not the same.

C Eb Gb is enharmonic to B# D# F##? This is too messy.

To avoid confusion, it's better to use Ab major.

So in Ab major, we have I Ab, vi Fm, ii Bbm, and then Cdim as vii°/ii, and bVI Gb.

So for the purpose of this question, I'll go with key of Ab major.

But since the chords are written with sharps, perhaps the key is G# major, but with understanding that it's enharmonic.

In music theory, when chords have many sharps, it's often notated as flats for readability.

So for the answer, I'll state the key as G# major.

But let's see the F#6 chord: in G# major, F#6 would be the VII chord? But in major, VII is usually minor or diminished, but F#6 is major, so it's bVII? In G# major, the seventh scale degree is F##, so F# is lowered, so it's bVII, which is common in rock music.

But in this case, from the progression, it seems more like bVI in Ab major.

In G# major, bVI would be E major? Let's calculate.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F##

bVI would be E major? E major is E G# B, but in G# major, bVI would be the chord from the parallel minor? G# minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#, so bVI would be E major? E G# B, but we have F#6 which is F# A# C# D#, so in G# minor, F# is VII, which is F# major, and F#6 is F# major with 6th, so it's VII6, which is common.

But in the progression, we have G# major chords, so it's major key with borrowed chords.

So in G# major, the chords are I, vi, ii, and then vii°/ii, and bVII.

But bVII is F# major, which is not bVI; bVI would be E major.

So in this case, F#6 is bVII6 in G# major.

But in the resolution, from F#6 to G#, it's bVII to I, which is a common rock progression.

So it works.

But in our earlier Ab major interpretation, F#6 is Gb6, which is bVI, and bVI to I is also common.

So both work, but in Ab major, bVI to I is more common in pop music, while in G# major, bVII to I is common in rock.

But let's see the chord qualities: in Ab major, bVI is Gb major, which is a major chord, and it resolves to Ab major. Similarly, in G# major, bVII is F# major, resolving to G# major.

But in the chord, it's F#6, which is still major with added 6th, so functionally similar.

Now, which one is more consistent? In Ab major, we have Fm which is vi, and Bbm which is ii, which are diatonic, while in G# major, vi is E#m which is Fm, and ii is A#m, which are diatonic, so both have diatonic vi and ii.

The difference is in the diminished chord and the last chord.

In Ab major, Cdim is not diatonic but used as vii°/ii, which is fine.

In G# major, Cdim is not diatonic, and it would be vii°/ii only if we consider the key of A# minor, but in A# minor, vii° should be G##dim, which is A dim, not C dim.

So it doesn't fit perfectly.

In Ab major, for ii chord Bbm, the vii° chord should be A dim, but here we have Cdim, which is not A dim.

Cdim is actually the same as A dim only if we consider diminished seventh chords, but for triads, they are different.

C dim triad is C Eb Gb, A dim triad is A C Eb, so they share two notes, but are different roots.

In practice, when we have a diminished chord, it can function in multiple ways.

Notice that Cdim has Eb and Gb, which are the third and fifth of Ab? No, Ab major has C Eb G, so Eb is common, but Gb is not.

Another thought: Cdim/F# with F# bass might be heard as F# half-diminished seventh? F# half-diminished is F# A C E, but here we have C Eb Gb, so if we have F# A C Eb, it would be F# half-diminished, but in this case, we have F# C Eb Gb, which is missing A? So it's not F# half-diminished.

Perhaps it's G# diminished seventh? G# diminished seventh is G# B D F, but here we have C Eb Gb, which is not the same.

Let's list the notes of Cdim/F# again: F# C Eb Gb. If we rearrange, from F#: F# to Gb is minor second? But in terms of chord, if we consider it as a diminished seventh chord, it should have four notes minor thirds apart. F# to A is min3, A to C is min3, C to Eb is min3, so F# A C Eb is diminished seventh. But here we have F# C Eb Gb. F# to C is dim5, which is equivalent to min3 from A? No.

F# to C is 6 half steps, which is two min3? F# to A is 3 half steps, A to C is 3 half steps, so F# to C is 6 half steps, which is dim5. Similarly, C to Eb is 3 half steps, Eb to Gb is 3 half steps, so from F# to Gb is 11 half steps? This is not a standard diminished seventh chord.

Perhaps it is a rootless chord or something.

In context, since the bass is F#, and the chord is Cdim, it might be intended to be heard as a F#7b9 without root? But F#7b9 is F# A# C# E G, but here we have C Eb Gb, so not matching.

Another idea: Cdim/F# might be a misnotation for F#dim? But it's written as Cdim/F#.

Perhaps in the progression, Cdim/F# is actually functioning as a dominant of Bbm.

Let's think about the voice leading. When moving from Cdim/F# to Bbm/Ab, the bass moves from F# to G#, which is whole step, but the chord tones move as above: C to Bb, Eb to Db, Gb to F, so all stepwise down.

So regardless of the theory, it works practically.

So for the key, based on the tonic pedal and the chords I, vi, ii, it is clearly Ab major.

Therefore, I'll go with key of Ab major.

But since the question has G# chords, I'll state the key as G# major, but know that it's equivalent to Ab major.

So for the answer, key: G# major

Mode: major

But let's see the F#6 chord: in G# major, F# is the seventh scale degree, but lowered, so it's mixolydian? But mixolydian has b7, but here the tonic is G# major, and we have F# major chord, which is bVII, so it could be mixolyd mode if all chords are diatonic, but here we have minor vi and ii, which are diatonic in major, so it's not mixolydian; mixolydian has minor vii, but here vii is not used, and we have bVII, which is from mixolydian? In mixolydian, the VII chord is major? Let's see G# mixolydian scale: based on C# major? No, mixolydian is mode of major scale with fifth as tonic? G# mixolydian would be the fifth mode of C# major? C# major scale: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#? So G# mixolydian: G# A# B# C# D# E# F#? So scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F#? But B# is C, E# is F, F# is F#, so notes G# A# C C# D# F F#? This has both C and C#, F and F#, so it's not heptatonic? I think I confused myself.

G# mixolydian means tonic is G# and scale has major third, so from G# to G# with intervals: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole? So G# A# B# C# D# E# F# G#? But B# is C, E# is F, so notes G# A# C C# D# F F# G#? This has two C's and two F's? No, from G# to A# is whole, A# to B# is whole, B# to C# is half? B# to C# is half step? B# is C, C# is C#, so from C to C# is half step, yes. Then C# to D# whole, D# to E# whole, E# to F# half? E# is F, F# is F#, so from F to F# is half step, then F# to G# whole. So scale: G# A# C C# D# F F# G#? But this has C and C# which are adjacent, so it's not a standard scale; it has all notes chromatic? No, let's list the scale degrees: 1 G#, 2 A#, 3 B# (C), 4 C#, 5 D#, 6 E# (F), 7 F#, 8 G#. So the notes are G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, F#. So there are seven notes, but C and C# are both present, which means it has both natural and sharp notes? This is why mixolydian on G# is not practical; it's better to use Ab mixolydian.

Ab mixolydian: from Db major scale? Db major: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C, so Ab mixolydian: Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab? So notes Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb? So b7 is Gb, which is F# enharmonically.

So in Ab mixolydian, the VII chord is Gb major, which is bVII.

So in this case, if the key is Ab mixolydian, then I is Ab, VII is Gb, which matches F#6.

But in mixolydian, the iii chord is diminished, and here we have ii chord which is Bbm, which in Ab mixolydian, ii is Bbm, since scale has Bb, so ii is minor, yes. And vi is Fm, which in Ab mixolydian, vi is Fm? Ab mixolydian scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb, so chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cdim, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii Gb? vii is Gb major? In mixolydian, the vii chord is major? Let's see: from scale, seventh degree is Gb, so chord Gb Bb Db, which is Gb major, so yes, vii is major in mixolydian.

But in our progression, we have Cdim, which is not diatonic to Ab mixolydian; in Ab mixolydian, iii is Cdim, so if we have Cdim, it could be the iii chord, but in the progression, Cdim appears before A#m which is Bbm, so if Cdim is iii, then iii to ii is common.

In Ab mixolydian, iii is Cdim, and ii is Bbm, so iii to ii is a common progression.

And then we have Fm which is vi, and G# which is I, and F#6 which is VII6.

So in this case, the progression fits perfectly in Ab mixolydian mode.

Let's verify:

- I: Ab (G#)

- vi: Fm (diatonic in mixolydian? In Ab mixolydian, vi is Fm, yes, because sixth degree is F, so Fm chord is F Ab C, and since scale has Ab, C, and F, so F minor is indeed the vi chord in Ab mixolydian? Let's see the chord built on sixth degree: scale degrees: 1 Ab, 2 Bb, 3 C, 4 Db, 5 Eb, 6 F, 7 Gb. So chord on 6: F Ab C? But F to Ab is minor third, Ab to C is major third, so it is a minor chord? Yes, F minor is the vi chord.

Similarly, chord on 2: Bb Db F? Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third, so Bbm, yes.

Chord on 3: C Eb Gb? C to Eb is minor third, Eb to Gb is minor third, so diminished chord, Cdim, yes.

So in Ab mixolydian, the chords are I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cdim, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii Gb.

Now in our progression, we have: G# (I), Fm/G# (vi with I bass), Cdim/F# (iii with VII bass? But iii is Cdim, and VII is Gb, so Cdim with Gb bass? But Cdim/Gb is the first inversion of Cdim? In Cdim chord, the notes are C Eb Gb, so with Gb bass, it is root position? No, if root is C, then with Gb bass, it is second inversion? Let's see: Cdim chord has notes C Eb Gb, so if bass is Gb, it is the fifth of the chord, so it is second inversion? But in chord symbols, Cdim/Gb means C diminished with Gb in bass, so it is second inversion.

But in terms of function, it is still the iii chord.

And then A#m/G# which is Bbm with Ab bass, so ii with I bass.

Then G# I, then Fm/G# vi with I bass, then G# I, then F#6 which is Gb6, which is VII6, then G# I.

So the progression is: I, vi, iii, ii, I, vi, I, VII, I.

All chords are diatonic to Ab mixolydian except that the bass is often on I, which is a pedal point.

So this makes perfect sense.

Therefore, the key is Ab mixolydian.

But since the chords are written with sharps, it is G# mixolydian.

So for the answer, key: G# mixolydian.

But let's confirm the mode: mixolydian is a major mode with minor seventh.

In this case, the tonic chord is major, and the seventh chord is major, so yes.

So I think this is correct.

Therefore, for the given chord progression, the key is G# mixolydian.

So in the answer, I'll say key: G# mixolydian.

But to be precise, since the bass pedal is on G#, and the chords are from G# mixolydian scale.

So finally, the key and mode is G# mixolydian.

The chord progression provided is based on a G# pedal point (consistent bass note G#) and utilizes chords diatonic to the G# mixolydian mode. The G# mixolydian scale is derived from the C# major scale, with notes G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#. Enharmonically, this is equivalent to Ab mixolydian, but the chords are notated with sharps, so G# mixolydian is appropriate.

The chords in the progression function as follows:
- G# represents the I chord (tonic).
- Fm/G# is the vi chord (F minor) over the tonic pedal.
- Cdim/F# is the iii chord (C diminished) over the VII bass (F#).
- A#m/G# is the ii chord (A# minor) over the tonic pedal.
- F#6 is the VII chord (F# major with added 6th).

All chords are diatonic to G# mixolydian, confirming the key and mode.

**Key:** G# mixolydian  
**Mode:** Mixolydian (major mode with a minor seventh)
