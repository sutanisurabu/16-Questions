To determine the key and mode from the given chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

- G#  
- G#  
- Fm/G#  
- Fm/G#  
- Cdim/F#  
- A#m/G#  
- G#  
- G#  
- Fm/G#  
- Fm/G#  
- G#  
- G#  
- F#6  
- G#

### Step 1: Analyze the tonal center

The chord **G#** appears **most frequently** (8 times), and is the **first and last chord** of the progression in many phrases, suggesting **G# as the tonal center** (the "home" chord).

However, **G# major** is an unusual key (it’s the enharmonic equivalent of Ab major). But in pop/rock or modern music, it’s not uncommon to see G# used directly.

Let’s explore possibilities.

### Step 2: Consider enharmonic respelling

In traditional tonal harmony, **G# major** is rarely used because it has 8 sharps (including a double sharp). The **enharmonic equivalent is Ab major**, which has 4 flats and is more practical.

But if the tonal center *feels* like **G#**, it might actually be **Ab**. However, looking at the other chords:

- **Fm/G#** = F minor with G# in the bass  
- **Cdim/F#** = C diminished with F# in the bass  
- **A#m/G#** = A# minor with G# in the bass  
- **F#6** = F# major with added 6th (which is D#)

These chords are **not typical in Ab major**.

Let’s consider **G# minor** instead.

### Step 3: Analyze chords in G# minor

**G# natural minor scale**:  
G# A# B C# D# E F#

Chords built on this scale:

- i: G#m  
- ii°: A#°  
- bIII: B major  
- iv: C#m  
- v: D#m  
- bVI: E major  
- bVII: F# major

But our **tonic chord is G# major**, not G# minor. That suggests **G# harmonic or melodic minor with a Picardy third**, or more likely, **G# major key**.

But again, G# major is theoretically messy.

Wait—look at **F#6**. That’s F# major with a 6th (D#). In the context of **G# minor**, F# is the **bVII chord**, which is common in minor keys (e.g., Aeolian or harmonic minor with modal mixture).

Also, **Fm/G#** — F minor over G#. F minor is **not in G# major or minor**.

But **F minor = F Ab C**  
Over G# bass = G# F Ab C → that’s a **G# diminished 7 chord** (G# B D F), but we have **F, Ab, C, G#**.

Wait: G# = Ab  
So Fm/Ab = F Ab C / Ab → that’s just **F minor in first inversion**.

So **Fm/G# = Fm/Ab**, which is a standard chord in **Ab major or Ab minor**.

Similarly, **A#m/G# = Bbm/Ab** (since A# = Bb, G# = Ab)

So let's **respell everything in Ab**:

- G# → **Ab**  
- Fm/G# → **Fm/Ab**  
- Cdim/F# → Cdim/Gb (since F# = Gb)  
- A#m/G# → **Bbm/Ab**  
- F#6 → **Gb6**

Now the progression becomes:

- Ab  
- Ab  
- Fm/Ab  
- Fm/Ab  
- Cdim/Gb  
- Bbm/Ab  
- Ab  
- Ab  
- Fm/Ab  
- Fm/Ab  
- Ab  
- Ab  
- Gb6  
- Ab

This looks much more reasonable.

### Step 4: Analyze in **Ab major**

Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords:

- I: Ab  
- ii: Bbm  
- iii: Cm  
- IV: Db  
- V: Eb  
- vi: Fm  
- vii°: G°

Now check our chords:

- **Ab** = I ✓  
- **Fm/Ab** = vi chord in first inversion ✓  
- **Bbm/Ab** = ii chord with Ab bass → that’s a **ii6/5** (Bbm7 in first inversion) or just a slash chord; still diatonic  
- **Cdim/Gb** → Cdim is **vii° of Db**, but Gb is **bVII** in Ab major — not diatonic  
- **Gb6** = Gb major with added 6 (Eb). Gb is **bVII** in Ab major — common in pop/rock as modal mixture from Mixolydian or borrowed from minor.

So, we have mostly **diatonic chords from Ab major**, with some **borrowed or modal mixture** (Gb = bVII, common in rock/pop), and Cdim/Gb may be a passing chord.

But wait—**Fm** is **vi** in Ab major, which is minor, but appears frequently. The repeated **Ab - Fm/Ab** suggests a **plagal feel** (I - vi), which is common.

Also, **Gb6** (bVII) moving to **Ab** (I) is a classic **Mixolydian cadence** (bVII - I), common in rock.

So overall, the key is most likely **Ab major**, but with **modal mixture** from **Ab Mixolydian** (which has Gb instead of G natural).

But remember: the original notation used **G#**, not **Ab**.

Why would someone write G# instead of Ab?

Possibility: The music is in **G# Phrygian** or another mode where G# is the root and the scale includes F natural (which would be the b2 in G# Phrygian).

Let’s test **G# Phrygian**:

G# Phrygian scale: G# A B# C# D# E F#

Wait—that’s not right.

Phrygian mode is: 1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7

So **G# Phrygian** = G# **A** B C# D# E F#

(Note: B natural, not B#)

So notes: G# A B C# D# E F#

Chords:

- i: G#m  
- bII: A major  
- biii: B major  
- iv: C#m  
- v: D#m  
- bVI: E major  
- bVII: F# major

But our chords include **F minor**, which has **Ab and C**, but G# Phrygian has **A natural and B natural**, not Ab.

F minor = F Ab C → Ab is **not in G# Phrygian** (which has A natural, not Ab). So that doesn’t fit.

Alternatively, what if it's **G# harmonic minor**?

G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E **F##** (E#) — too sharp.

Not matching F natural.

So the presence of **F natural** (in Fm) and **G natural** (implied in Gb6 = F#6 = F# A# C# D# → wait, F#6 has D#, not G)

Hold on: **F#6 chord** = F# A# C# D# → all sharps. No G natural.

But **Cdim** = C Eb Gb (or C E G Bbb, but usually C Eb Gb)

So Cdim/F# = C Eb Gb / F# → but F# = Gb, so Cdim/Gb = Gb C Eb

That’s a diminished chord with a flatted fifth, etc.

Now, notice: **Fm** contains **Ab**, which is **G#** enharmonically.

So **Fm/G#** = G# (bass), F, Ab, C → spell that as: G# B#? No.

Actually, **Fm/G#** = G# F Ab C

But **G# and Ab are the same pitch**, so this chord is **Ab F Ab C** → which is just **F minor in first inversion**, as said.

So the entire progression makes more sense in **Ab**.

Also, **Gb6** = Gb Bb Db Eb → which is **bVII6** in Ab major.

So the progression is:

**Ab – Fm/Ab – (passing) – Bbm/Ab – Ab – Gb6 – Ab**

This strongly supports **Ab major** as the key.

But the original uses G#, suggesting perhaps the **composer is thinking in sharps**, or it’s in a **modal context**.

However, the **mode** appears to be **Ionian (major)** with **modal mixture** (borrowed bVII from Mixolydian).

So:

- **Key: Ab major** (or enharmonically G# major, but Ab is correct in standard theory)  
- **Mode: Major (Ionian)** with **Mixolydian flavor** due to bVII (Gb)

But since the question asks in the context of the given notation (G#), perhaps they expect **G# major**.

However, **G# major key signature is impractical** and almost never used.

In practice, any music with this chord set would be notated in **Ab major**.

But if forced to answer in the given spelling:

### Final Interpretation:

- **Tonal center**: G#  
- **Chord quality**: G# major  
- **Other chords**: Fm (vi in Ab), A#m (ii in Ab), F#6 (bVII in Ab)

So **the key is Ab major**, and the **mode is Ionian (major)**.

But **if adhering strictly to the given note names**, it’s **G# major**, though enharmonically equivalent to **Ab major**.

Given that **Fm** and **Cdim** contain **natural** notes incompatible with G# major (which would require F##), the only consistent interpretation is **Ab major**.

> ✅ **Answer: Key = Ab major (enharmonically G# major), Mode = Ionian (major)**  
> (In the context of the given chord symbols, it's best understood as **Ab major** with a **bVII (Gb) borrowed from Mixolydian**.)

If the question insists on keeping G# as the root:  
> **Key: G# (enharmonic to Ab), Mode: Major (with modal mixture)**

But standard music theory would respell this as **Ab major**.
