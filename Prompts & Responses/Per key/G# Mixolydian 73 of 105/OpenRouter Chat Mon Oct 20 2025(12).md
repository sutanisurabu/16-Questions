### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord structure**

I'm thinking about the upper triad F (F-A♭-C) and bass G# (Ab). This combination suggests an Ab major 6 chord, but then I realize Ab major is Ab-C-Eb, so F is the 6th. It seems like I’m looking at Fm/Ab, which yields Ab, C, F, but that means I have Ab6 without the fifth, making it Ab6(no5). Many arrangements use the vi chord over I bass to achieve a sixth color, which is interesting!**Exploring chord relationships**

I'm examining C diminished over F#, which gives the notes C-Eb-Gb. The F# in the bass can be viewed as its enharmonic equivalent, Gb. So the notes I have are F# (Gb) in the bass, plus C and Eb, and it could spell F7b9 without the root. In the key of Ab, F# might be functioning as a leading tone. I also see how Cdim over Gb forms Gb7 without the root, but I’m getting some enharmonic confusion!**Reassessing the diminished chord**

I'm exploring C diminished as a leading-tone triad to Db, where Cdim (C-Eb-Gb) acts as vii° of Db. If I consider it over a Gb bass, it might resemble Gb7b9 without some notes. The Gb dominant 7 chord is Gb-Bb-Db-E. The b9 would be Ab (or G), which isn’t present in this case. Cdim over F# often represents D7/F#. Thinking about the notes, it feels a bit messy, but maybe I should consider the key as G#?**Analyzing the chord progression**

I'm looking at the sequence: G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G#... It feels like an Ab pop progression, where the pattern is I, vi/I, ii/I, and then back to I, leading to F#6. The outlier seems to be the Cdim/F#, followed by A#m/G#, which is enharmonically Bbm. 

In Ab major, Bbm over Ab (Bbm/Ab) gives an Ab11sus sound. Overall, it looks like we are in Ab major, with Cdim/Gb as a passing chord leading to Bbm.**Examining voice leading and chords**

I'm analyzing the voice leading between Fm/Ab and Bbm/Ab, where Cdim/Gb serves as a chromatic approach. In this context, with chords like Fm/Ab (Ab-C-F) leading to Cdim/Gb (Gb-C-Eb), the contrary motion is quite nice. Then when moving to Bbm/Ab, I see the pattern suggests Ab major with a bass movement. 

The progression reveals it’s all diatonic to G# Mixolydian, including chords like F#6. Cdim/Gb acts as a iii° over F#, but using B#° might clarify the enharmonic confusion. The entire progression fits in this Mixolydian context, making it accurately diatonic!**Analyzing key and mode**

It seems the key is G# Mixolydian, with a pedal point on G# in the bass, except when it shifts to F# in Cdim/F# and F#6. While many might refer to it as Ab Mixolydian for readability, the strong use of sharps (G#, F#, A#m) points to G# Mixolydian being more accurate.

The chords fit nicely into this mode, and the F#6 to G# cadence further suggests this interpretation. So, I’d conclude that the answer should be: "G# Mixolydian" with a brief justification highlighting the presence of F# and diatonic chord fit. Optionally, I could mention Ab Mixolydian for clarity.

G# Mixolydian (enharmonically Ab Mixolydian).

Reason: G# is the clear tonal center, and the progression features the flat 7 (F#) and a VII→I move (F#6 → G#). All the chords (G#, Fm, Cdim, A#m, F#6) fit diatonically in G# Mixolydian: G# A# B# C# D# E# F#.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord structures**

I'm looking at an Fm over Ab bass and noticing it creates a tonic pedal with a vi upper structure. The Cdim over F# bass is a bit confusing; it seems to hint at enharmonic relationships. I need to clarify the role of C diminished, which could be the ii° of Bb minor or perhaps a passing chord towards Ab. For A#m/G#, I'm also considering its enharmonic relationship to Bb. Bbm over Ab bass gives an interesting inversion, and I should check those intervals carefully.**Exploring chord inversions and keys**

I’m looking at the 3rd inversion of Bbm7 with Ab in the bass. The A#m/G# symbol actually equals Bbm/Ab enharmonically, suggesting we're in Ab major. The ii7 in 3rd inversion indicates a predominant leading to either the V or I chords. I notice a Gb6 chord, which is bVII borrowed from Mixolydian in Ab major. I'm also considering whether this could be in G# minor, but the presence of G# major chords makes Ab major seem more likely as the key.**Analyzing F#6 and chord progressions**

I'm looking at F#6, which is actually Gb6, thinking it's borrowed as a bVII6 neighbor chord over an Ab pedal. The progression follows a pattern, with a heavy emphasis on the tonic pedal. The odd passing diminished chord Cdim/F# might suggest a German or French augmented sixth, but I need to reassess. Cdim over F# bass transforms into C°/F#, where F# as Gb fits in. This brings me to consider if G# Mixolydian could be relevant here.**Exploring Mixolydian harmony**

I'm examining how F# (as bVII) fits into Ab Mixolydian. In G# Mixolydian, F# aligns with the b7, which matches the diatonic feel of the F#6 chord. In Ab major, F# is borrowed, not diatonic, leading me to consider the whole progression might be either in G# or Ab Mixolydian. The A#m (or Bbm) as ii minor fits well, especially since Ab Mixolydian stems from the Db major scale. I'm also building the chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii C dim, iv Db, v Eb dim, and VII Gb.**Determining the key and mode**

C diminished works well as the iii° in Ab Mixolydian. Notably, the presence of the bVII chord (Gb) aligns perfectly with other chords, including F#6 being Gb6 and the Bbm/A#m chord. This confirms the fit within Ab Mixolydian. Fm/G# suggests an interpretation where Fm is indeed a minor triad. I realize F diminished is incorrect here; rather, Fm is fitting for both Ab major and Ab Mixolydian. The final conclusion is that the tonal center is G# (enharmonically Ab) with the mode being Mixolydian, derived from the parent scale Db major.

Ab (G#) Mixolydian.

- Tonic center is Ab/G# (repeated G# chords).
- Presence of bVII (F#/Gb, incl. F#6) and iii° (Cdim) plus ii (A#m = Bbm) all fit Ab Mixolydian.
- No leading tone (G) appears; instead the b7 (Gb/F#) points to Mixolydian.
- Parent scale: Db major (Ab is the 5th mode).

### Reasoning

**Analyzing key signatures**

I’m examining the difference between G# and Ab. The chords used, like G#, Fm, and Cdim, suggest a preference for sharps over flats. Fm, being F minor, includes Ab, which circles back to G#. This indicates the piece is likely in a sharp key, possibly C# major or G# minor, with chords like A#m and F# showing up as well. Understanding these nuances helps clarify the musical structure.**Examining key signatures**

I'm looking into the key signature of G# major, which would have 8 sharps, including Fx and Cx—pretty uncommon! It's more likely that the key is C# major with 6 sharps or A# minor with 7 sharps. The G# chord suggests a dominant function. However, Fm brings in Ab, which complicates things a bit. If I convert to sharps, things get tricky, but maybe the actual key is Ab major after all.**Analyzing Ab major chords**

In the context of Ab major, I'm identifying chords such as the Ab major chord (I) and Fm/Ab, which is F minor over an Ab bass. This corresponds to the vi chord or possibly iv6. Indeed, Fm/Ab can be viewed as Fm in first inversion. Next, for Cdim/F#, which is C diminished over a Gb bass, I recognize C diminished is in second inversion in this case. However, I need to verify how C diminished functions in Ab major, as it appears to be the vii° of Db.**Exploring diminished triads**

I'm reviewing the diminished triad, noting that G° (G B D) doesn't apply in Ab major because B natural isn't part of that scale. However, C diminished (C Eb Gb) does use Eb and Gb, which complicates things a bit since Gb isn't a diatonic note in Ab major. It seems C diminished could be the leading-tone triad of Db, making C°/F# potentially part of a cadential 6-4 or a Neapolitan chord. Meanwhile, A#m/G# contains the notes A#, C#, and E#.**Dissecting chord progressions**

I'm working through some complex chord relationships, starting with G#maj6 and its possible interpretations. It gets messy trying to match diminished chords like Cdim/F# and their functions in Ab major, especially with enharmonic changes. Bbm turns out to be functionally ii7 in Ab major, yet without a root. The Bb, Db, and F over Ab notes suggest potential resolutions. Then F#6 could represent a bVII chord in Ab major, possibly leading to tonic G#, but I wonder if the traditional G# major key is a bit awkward here.**Analyzing Key and Mode**

I’m determining the tonal context, considering whether Cdim serves as a secondary leading tone to Db within a tonic pedal. The chords could suggest G# major or Ab major. The use of A#m and F# points to a potential mixolydian interpretation, as the presence of F# as bVII supports that idea. A deeper look at Cm and its enharmonic equivalents shows its fit as a passing chord. Eventually, I conclude that we're likely in G# Mixolydian, noting the relationships among the chords—especially focusing on neighbor motions.**Determining Key and Mode**

I'm analyzing chords to find the key and mode. The triad B#-D#-F# forms a diminished triad, relevant to G# Mixolydian. C diminished is indeed the iii° chord in this mode, as it uses notes within the G# Mixolydian scale. I find that the presence of A#m and F# fits nicely as diatonic ii and bVII chords. Thus, the key is G# Mixolydian. My answer will reflect that clearly, indicating G# (or Ab) as the tonic with a major mode and flat 7.

G# (Ab) Mixolydian.

- Tonal center: G#
- Evidence: frequent G# tonic, diatonic ii (A#m), vi (Fm ≈ E#m), and especially bVII (F#6) → I, which signals Mixolydian (major with flat 7). The Cdim (≈ B#°) is the diatonic iii° in G# Mixolydian.

**Key:** G♯ major  
**Mode:** Ionian  

This progression centers on G♯ major as the tonic chord, with repeated emphasis on it throughout (starting, repeating, and ending on G♯). The other chords (including the slash chords like Fm/G♯, which functions as a chromatic dominant or tension-builder, Cdim/F♯ as a passing diminished chord, A♯m/G♯ as a relative minor inflection, and F♯6 as a subdominant resolution) add color and tension but resolve back to the G♯ tonic, supporting the major tonality without strongly suggesting a shift to the parallel minor. The overall structure and bass movement (primarily G♯ with brief F♯ descents) confirm Ionian mode as the diatonic framework, with some chromatic borrowing for flavor.

**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

**Key:** G#  
**Mode:** Mixolydian  

This progression centers on G# (tonic) with characteristic Mixolydian elements, including the ♭7 (F natural) implied in chords like Fm/G# and A#m/G#, and the use of F# (as bass and chord tone in Cdim/F# and F#6) instead of the natural 7 (G natural) from the parallel major scale. All chord tones (e.g., G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, F#) fit the G# Mixolydian scale (G# A# B♮/C C# D# E♮/F F#), creating a modal rock/jazz flavor without major-scale tensions.

### Reasoning

**Defining the Input Parameters**

I'm focused on the input now. The chord progression is the central piece, of course, and I'm parsing the information. So far, the input seems straightforward, but I want to be certain about the format and any potential nuances, such as inversions. I'll need to define what the request is asking me to do with this input.


**Deconstructing the Chords**

I've been working through the chord transformation. I'm taking the chords and putting them into the key of Ab. This is to avoid those ridiculous double sharps. Already, I can see Ab major is a much better fit for the harmonic functions. Looking closely at the chords now, and how they relate.


**Identifying the Key and Mode**

Now I'm looking at the key. Initially, I noted G# but the excessive sharps are a deterrent. Considering the enharmonic equivalent, I'm leaning heavily towards Ab major. I'm cross-checking the chord functions within that context and re-evaluating each chord. The transition of the chords is critical for understanding this.


**Revising Chord Functions**

I'm now revising the chord functions, particularly focusing on the "odd" chords. I've re-evaluated Cdim/F# (or Cdim/Gb) and F#6. I'm taking the context of the progression to derive the functionality of each chord. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic chords, which I believe add a particular character.


**Re-evaluating the Options**

I'm leaning towards Ab major, but the bVII chord is still a puzzle. I've re-examined the F#6 and Cdim/F# chords, considering their harmonic functions within the key. I'm focused on the tension this brings. I'm carefully charting each chord's relationship.


**Refining Key and Mode**

Now I'm completely sure on the tonic, G#. The analysis strongly indicates a major key, due to the major tonic. Translating the chords to Ab major clarifies everything. The non-diatonic chords add color, but the tonal center is firmly established, and the mode is clear.


**Summarizing the Cadences**

Now, I'm analyzing the cadences. The F#6 to G# cadence is of interest. It's a clear marker of a major key, especially when considering the bVII-I progression. I'm focusing on the pull of the subdominant. The use of borrowed chords is now clear.


**Defining the Solution Framework**

I'm now formulating a detailed response. I'll need to answer the key and mode while addressing the harmonic context. To clarify the writing, I will use Ab major. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic chords as they add color. I will then summarize the overall feel of the piece.




Based on the chords provided, the key is **G# Major**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### Key Determination (Tonic)

1.  **Starts and Ends on G#:** The progression begins and ends on a G# major chord. This is the strongest indicator that G# is the tonic, or the "home" chord of the piece.
2.  **Tonic Pedal:** Many of the chords (Fm/G#, A#m/G#) have G# in the bass. This is called a "tonic pedal," where the root note of the key is held in the bass while the chords change above it, further solidifying G# as the tonal center.

### Mode Determination (Major)

The mode is **Major**, but with significant use of **modal interchange** (borrowing chords from the parallel minor or other modes).

Let's analyze the chords using Roman numerals in the key of G# Major. For easier analysis, we can think in its enharmonic equivalent, **Ab Major**, which has fewer accidentals (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G).

*   **G# (or Ab):** This is the **I** chord, the tonic. It's a major chord, which establishes the major mode.
*   **Fm/G# (or Fm/Ab):** Fm is the **vi** chord in the key of Ab Major. This is a standard diatonic chord. The G# in the bass makes it a **vi/I** (a vi chord over the tonic root).
*   **A#m/G# (or Bbm/Ab):** A#m is enharmonically Bbm. Bbm is the **ii** chord in Ab Major. This is another standard diatonic chord, here presented as **ii/I**.
*   **F#6 (or Gb6):** F# is enharmonically Gb. In the key of Ab Major, the Gb chord is the **bVII** (flatted seventh). This is a "borrowed" chord, often taken from the Mixolydian or Aeolian (natural minor) mode. The progression **bVII - I** (Gb to Ab, or F# to G#) is a very common and powerful cadence in rock, pop, and blues, creating a "plagal" or subdominant-like feel.
*   **Cdim/F# (or Cdim/Gb):** This is the most complex chord. The bass note (F#/Gb) is the same bVII note mentioned above. The C diminished triad (C-Eb-Gb) contains the 3rd, 5th, and b7th of the home key (Ab). It functions as a chromatic, non-diatonic passing chord that adds bluesy color and tension.

### Summary

The core of the progression is built on standard chords from a major key (I, vi, ii). However, the inclusion of the **F#6 (bVII6)** and the **Cdim/F#** chords introduces chromatic notes borrowed from other modes. This technique, called modal interchange, gives the progression a modern, slightly bluesy, and less strictly "classical" sound.

**Final Answer:**
*   **Key:** **G# Major**
*   **Mode:** **Major with modal interchange** (borrowing from parallel modes).

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chords: G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#. They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to unpack what this chord sequence really means. The notation uses slash chords (like Fm/G#), which indicate inversions or added bass notes. For example, Fm/G# means an F minor chord with G# in the bass. That's actually a G# diminished 7th chord because F minor (F-Ab-C) with G# bass creates G#-F-Ab-C, which stacks minor thirds. 

Hmm, the user might be a musician or student analyzing a song. They probably encountered this sequence and got confused by the unusual chord labels. Their real need is likely to understand the harmonic structure—maybe for composition, transcription, or theory study. They might be frustrated by the slash chords masking simpler chord functions. 

Let me decode these properly. Listing all chords with enharmonic equivalents for clarity:
- G# → Ab (I'll use flats for simplicity since sharps get messy)
- Fm/G# → Abm/Bb? Wait no—Fm is F-Ab-C, G# bass is Ab, so Ab-F-Ab-C? Better to think enharmonically: G# = Ab, F = E#, but that's messy. Actually, Fm/G# is G#-F-Ab-C = Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gb? No... Simpler: G# bass + F minor (F-Ab-C) = Ab + F-Ab-C → Ab-Db-F? Wait, no—Ab (G#) + F minor = notes G#, F, Ab, C. Stacked: G# to F is minor 7th? But intervals: G# to Ab is unison? Enharmonic chaos! 

*Pauses to reorient* 
Standard approach: Fm/G# = G# bass with F minor triad → notes G#, F, Ab (since Fm = F-Ab-C, but C isn't sounding? Slash chords usually imply the triad over bass). So pitches: G# (bass), F, Ab, C. Now, G# to F is minor 7th, G# to Ab is minor 2nd (G#-Ab = same note enharmonically? Wait G#=Ab, so Ab bass + F is... Ab and F? Ab to F is major 6th. I'm confusing myself. 

Key insight: Fm/G# is functionally a G# diminished 7th chord. Why? Dim7 chords are symmetrical. G# dim7 = G#-B-D-F. But here we have G# (bass), F, Ab, C. Ab is G#, C is B#? No: Ab = G#, but C natural is not in G# dim7. G# dim7 should be G#-B-D-F. F is enharmonic to E#, but here it's F natural. F natural is the minor 7th of G#? G# to F natural is minor 7th interval (G#-A-B-C-D-E-F = 10 semitones), so G#-F is minor 7th, but dim7 requires diminished 7th (G# to Fb = 9 semitones). This isn't working. 

Alternative: Fm/G#. F minor = F-G#-C (since Ab=G# enharmonically for simplicity). So bass G# (Ab), triad F-Ab-C → notes: Ab, F, Ab, C. So Ab (root), F (6th), C (5th). That's Ab major triad? Ab major is Ab-C-Eb. Here we have Ab, F, C → F and C are the 6th and 5th of Ab, but no Eb. So it's Ab major? But F is the 6th, so Ab6? But written as Fm/G#. Aha! Fm/G# is actually an Ab6 chord: Ab (bass)-C-Eb-F, but here bass is G#=Ab, and "Fm" part gives F-Ab-C → so Ab (bass), F, Ab, C. That's Ab6 without the 3rd (Eb missing). But typically slash chords include the triad. This is messy. 

*Searches for standard interpretation* 
I recall that Fm/G# is a common misnotation for G#°7. Because Fm is F-Ab-C, G# bass: G#-F-Ab-C. Intervals: G# to F = minor 7th (10 semitones), but dim7 should be diminished 7th (9 semitones). G# to F is actually minor 7th, not diminished. Unless... F is enharmonic to E#, but E# is F, same pitch. G# to E# is minor 7th? G#-A-B-C-D-E-F = G# to F is minor 7th. Dim7 would be G# to Fb (Enharmonic E). But here it's F natural, so it's not dim7. 

Perhaps it's a German augmented sixth chord? German +6 in C is Ab-C-Eb-F#, but here we have Ab-F-Ab-C → no F#. Not matching. 

Another idea: Maybe the slash is inverted. Fm/G# means G# is the bass, but Fm is the chord, so it's F minor with G# bass. But G# is the minor 9th of F minor? F minor: F-Ab-C, G# is Ab (same as Ab), so it's F minor add 9 (Ab), but Ab is already in F minor, so it's F minor with added 9th (G#), but G#=Ab, so it's F minor add #9? F-Ab-C-Ab → redundant. 

*Realization* 
F minor with G# bass: G#=Ab, so bass Ab with Fm chord → Ab and Fm. Ab is the major third of Fm? No, Fm is F-Ab, so Ab is the minor third. So bass note is the minor third of the chord, making it first inversion Fm. But written as Fm/G#, which is unusual because G#=Ab, so Fm/Ab would be standard for first inversion. But why write G# instead of Ab? Probably key context. 

Similarly, Cdim/F# → C diminished chord with F# bass. C dim = C-Eb-Gb, F# bass. F#=Gb, so Gb bass with C dim → C-Eb-Gb-Gb, which is Gb major? Gb bass (root), C dim (C-Eb-Gb) → notes Gb, C, Eb, Gb. So Gb-C-Eb → C is the 4th, Eb the 6th, so it's Gb7? Gb-Bb-Db-Fb, but here we have Gb, C, Eb → C is 11th, Eb is 13th? Messy. 

C diminished with F# bass: F# = Gb, C dim = C-Eb-Gb, so pitches: Gb (bass), C, Eb, Gb. Stacked: Gb to C is augmented fourth, Gb to Eb is minor sixth. This is actually an F# half-diminished 7th? F# half-dim = F#-A-C-E. Here we have F#-C-Eb? Eb= D#, not matching. 

Standard trick: Cdim/F# is the same as F#ø7 (half-diminished). Because F# half-dim = F#-A-C-E, but C dim = C-Eb-Gb, and F# bass: F# (Gb), C, Eb (D#), Gb. So pitches: Gb, C, D#, Gb? D# is Eb, so Gb-C-D#-Gb. Intervals: Gb to C = dim5? Gb to C is perfect 5th enharmonically? Gb to C is augmented 4th (6 semitones). Gb to D# is major 6th (9 semitones? Gb-A-Bb-B-C-D-D# = 10 semitones). Not matching F#ø7. F#ø7 should be F#-A-C-E. So pitches F#, A, C, E. But here we have F# (bass), C, Eb (from C dim), and Gb (from C dim, but Gb=F#? C dim is C-Eb-Gb, Gb=F#, so pitches: F# (bass), C, Eb, F#. So F#, C, Eb. Three notes: F#, C, Eb. Which is F# half-diminished 7th without the 7th? F#ø7 needs E natural, but we have Eb. Eb is D#, so it's F#-C-D#, which is F# diminished triad, not half-diminished. 

F# diminished triad is F#-A-C. Here we have F#-C-Eb (D#), so F#-C-D#. D# is the minor third? F# to D# is minor 7th interval (F#-G-A-Bb-C-D-D# = 10 semitones), so F#-C-D# is F# minor 7th flat 5? F#-A-C-E is half-diminished, but here third is C? No, F# to C is diminished 5th, not minor third. 

List notes: Bass F#, chord C dim = C-Eb-Gb. Gb = F#, so the chord is C-Eb-F#. So pitches: F# (bass), C, Eb. That's three notes. Which chord is F#-C-Eb? F# to C is diminished 5th (6 semitones), F# to Eb is minor 7th (10 semitones), C to Eb is minor 3rd. So it's a half-diminished 7th chord with root F#: F#-A-C-Eb. But here we have F#-C-Eb — missing the A. So it's F# half-diminished without the third? But typically, the third is essential. In practice, this slash chord might imply the full chord, so Cdim/F# = F#ø7. That's standard jazz notation: any diminished chord over a bass note a minor third below is a half-diminished. C dim over F# bass: F# is minor third below C? C to F# is augmented 4th, not minor third. Minor third below C is Ab. 

C to Ab is minor third (C-Bb-Ab). But here bass is F#, which is tritone from C. So Cdim/F# is actually a common substitution for F#7(b9) or something. But let's check intervals: notes F#, C, Eb. F#-C = dim5, F#-Eb = min7, C-Eb = min3. So it's a G7(b9) without root? G7(b9) = G-B-D-F-Ab. Not matching. 

*Epiphany* 
I remember that diminished chords are often used as passing chords. Specifically, Fm/G# is likely a mishearing of G#°7. G#°7 = G#-B-D-F. But the user wrote Fm/G#, which would be G#-F-Ab-C. If we consider Ab = G#, but Ab is not G#, it's the enharmonic equivalent only if we're sloppy. Ab is G#, yes, but in chord terms, Fm/G# = G# bass, F-Ab-C = G#, F, Ab, C. Now, Ab = G#, so notes are G#, F, G#, C. But G# and Ab are the same pitch, so it's G# (bass), F, G# (Ab), C. So pitches: G#, F, C. Which is G#-F-C. G# to F is min7, G# to C is dim5, F to C is perfect 5th. So it's C#7(b9) or something? C#7 = C#-E#-G#-B, but here G#, F, C. C is B#, F is E#, messy. 

Better to respell enharmonically: 
G# = Ab 
F = F 
Ab = G# = Ab 
C = C 
So pitches: Ab, F, Ab, C → Ab, F, C. Which is Ab major triad? Ab-C-Eb, but here we have Ab, F, C — so it's Ab6 (Ab-C-Eb-F, but Eb missing). In jazz, Ab/C is Cm7/Ab, but not standard. 

I think the key is to ignore the slash notation as misleading and look at the actual notes. Let's compile the pitch classes for each chord: 

- G#: G# (Ab) 
- Fm/G#: G# bass + Fm (F-Ab-C) → notes: G#, F, Ab, C → Ab, F, C (since G#=Ab) → Ab, C, F? Wait Ab to C is major 3rd, Ab to F is minor 6th, so it's F minor? No, F-Ab-C is F minor, with bass Ab. So it's F minor first inversion. Written as Fm/Ab, but user wrote Fm/G# (since G#=Ab). So it's Fm in first inversion. Similarly, Cdim/F#: Cdim = C-Eb-Gb, F# bass = Gb, so notes: Gb, C, Eb, Gb → Gb, C, Eb. Gb to C is augmented 4th, Gb to Eb is minor 6th. This is actually an F7 chord: F-A-C-Eb, but here we have Gb (F#), C, Eb — so F#, C, Eb. Which is B7? B-D#-F#-A, not matching. 

Gb, C, Eb: C to Gb is diminished 5th, C to Eb is minor 3rd, so it's C half-diminished with bass Gb? But Gb is the fifth. Standard: Cø7 = C-Eb-Gb-Bb. Here we have Gb, C, Eb — so it's Cø7 without the Bb. But in context, it might imply the full chord. 

Perhaps all these slashes indicate secondary dominants or altered chords. Let's list the sequence with standard interpretations: 

1. G# (Ab) major? But G# is rare; likely Ab. 
2. G# 
3. Fm/G# → first inversion F minor (Ab bass) 
4. Fm/G# 
5. Cdim/F# → let's say F# half-diminished (F#-A-C-E) but spelled as Cdim/F# is common for F#ø7 
6. A#m/G# → A# minor with G# bass. A#m = A#-C#-E#, G# bass = Ab. So pitches: Ab, A#, C#, E# → enharmonic: Ab, Bb, Db, F. Which is Bb7? Bb-Db-F-Ab. Yes! A#m/G# = G# bass + A#m triad = G#, A#, C#, E# → Ab, Bb, Db, F → Bb7 (Bb-Db-F-Ab). So it's Bb dominant 7th. 

Ah! This is crucial. A#m/G# is actually Bb7. Because: 
- G# = Ab (bass) 
- A#m = A#-C#-E# = Bb-Db-F (enharmonically) 
- So notes: Ab, Bb, Db, F → Bb-Db-F-Ab = Bb7. 

Similarly, Fm/G# = Fm with Ab bass: 
- Fm = F-Ab-C 
- Bass Ab 
- Notes: Ab, F, Ab, C → Ab, C, F (since Ab repeats) — but Ab to C is major 3rd, Ab to F is minor 6th, so it's Ab6 (Ab-C-Eb-F, but Eb missing? Wait, F minor has Ab (minor third), so it's F-Ab-C with Ab bass → the notes are F, Ab, C with Ab in bass. Which is still F minor, but the bass is the third, so it's first inversion. But the chord is F minor. However, when we play it, we have Ab in bass, so it might function as Ab something. But in context, it's probably just Fm. 

But for A#m/G#, we saw it's Bb7. Let's confirm others: 

- Cdim/F#: Cdim = C-Eb-Gb, F# bass = Gb. Notes: Gb, C, Eb, Gb → Gb, C, Eb. Gb to C is augmented 4th (tritone), Gb to Eb is minor 6th. This is actually a B7(b9) without root? Or more commonly, this is the dominant of C# minor. But let's spell: pitches Gb, C, Eb. Enharmonic: F#, C, Eb. Which is F#-C-Eb. F# to C is diminished 5th, F# to Eb is minor 7th, so it's F# half-diminished 7th (F#-A-C-Eb), but missing A. In practice, when we play Cdim/F#, it's often interpreted as F#ø7 (F# half-diminished), which is viiø7 in G minor. 

Now, F#ø7 is the diatonic chord in G minor: G natural minor has F#? Natural minor: G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F. So F is natural, not F#. We need harmonic minor for F#. G harmonic minor: G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F#. So F#ø7 is viiø7 in G minor. 

Similarly, A#m/G# we decoded as Bb7. Bb7 is V7 of Eb, but in minor keys, it could be deceptive. 

Now, the first chord is G#. If G# is the tonic, but G# minor is unusual; likely Ab. Let's assume the key uses flats for simplicity: Ab instead of G#. 

So sequence: 
Ab, Ab, Fm/Ab (which is Fm first inv), Fm/Ab, Cdim/F# → but F# is Gb, so Cdim/Gb, A#m/Gb (which we saw is Bb7), Ab, Ab, Fm/Ab, Fm/Ab, Ab, Ab, F#6, Ab. 

F#6: F#-A#-C#-D#? But F#6 might mean F# major with 6th, so F#-A#-C#-D#. Enharmonic: Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. Which is Eb minor 7? Eb-Gb-Bb-Db, but here Gb-Bb-Db-Eb → Eb is D#, so Gb-Bb-Db-D#. D# is the major 7th of Eb, so it's Eb major 7th? Eb-Gb-Bb-D. But here we have Gb-Bb-Db-D# → D# is Eb, so Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. That's Eb major 7th with Gb bass? But Eb maj7 = Eb-G-Bb-D, so Gb is not in it. Enharmonic: F# = Gb, A# = Bb, C# = Db, D# = Eb. So F#6 = F#-A#-C#-D# = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. Which is Eb major 7th chord: Eb (root), Gb, Bb, Eb — missing the G? Eb maj7 is Eb-G-Bb-D. Here we have Gb (Ab?), Bb, Db, Eb — so Ab, Bb, Db, Eb. That's Bb minor 7? Bb-Db-F-Ab, not matching. 

Gb-Bb-Db-Eb: intervals from Gb: Gb-Bb = major 3rd, Gb-Db = perfect 5th, Gb-Eb = minor 7th. So it's Gb7 chord! Gb7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Fb (which is E), but here we have Eb, not Fb. Eb is D#, which is minor 7th? Gb to Eb: Gb-G-Ab-Bb-C-D-Eb → 10 semitones, minor 7th. Yes! Gb7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb (since Fb = E natural is not used; Gb7 is Gb-Bb-Db-Fb, and Fb = E, but in chord notation, it's Gb-Bb-Db-Eb? No, Gb7 should have minor 7th: Gb to Fb is minor 7th (10 semitones), and Fb = E. But E is enharmonic to Eb? No, E natural vs Eb. Confusion. 

Standard Gb7: notes Gb, Bb, Db, Fb. Fb is enharmonic to E natural. But the user wrote F#6, which typically for F# major triad with 6th added: F#-A#-C#-D#. D# is E natural. So pitches: F#, A#, C#, D# = Gb, Bb, Db, E. Now, Gb to E is augmented 7th? Gb to E natural is major 7th (11 semitones), not minor. Gb7 requires minor 7th (Gb to Fb = E), which is 10 semitones. But here D# = E natural, which is 11 semitones from Gb — major 7th. So F#6 = F#maj6 = F#-A#-C#-D#, which is a major 6th chord, not dominant. 

F#maj6: F#-A#-C#-D#. Enharmonic: Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. Db is C#, Eb is D#. So Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. Now, Gb to Eb: Gb-G-Ab-Bb-C-D-Eb → 10 semitones? Gb to Ab:2, to Bb:4, to C:6, to Db:7, to Eb:9? Let's count: Gb (0), G (1), Ab (2), A (3), Bb (4), B (5), C (6), Db (7), D (8), Eb (9), E (10). Gb to Eb is minor 7th (10 semitones? Gb to G is 1, to Ab 2, Bb 4, C 6, Db 7, D 8, Eb 9, E 10. Yes, 10 semitones = minor 7th. But Gb to Eb should be minor 7th for Gb7, but Gb7 has Fb (E), not Eb. Gb to Fb: Fb is E, which is 10 semitones from Gb (Gb to E is minor 7th: Gb-A-Bb-C-Db-Eb-E? No: Gb to G:1, G to Ab:2? Better: semitones: Gb=6, E=4? Standard: C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11. So F#=6, D#=3? Messy. 

Absolute semitones: 
F# = 6 
A# = 10 (since A=9, A#=10) 
C# = 1 (C=0, C#=1? No: C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11). 
D# = 3? D#=3, but E=4, so D#=3 is correct. 
So F#6 = F#(6), A#(10), C#(1), D#(3). 
Now in standard key: 
- F#(6) 
- A#(10) 
- C#(1) = Db? C#=1 is C#, which is Db=1? Db is C# enharmonic, same pitch class 1. 
- D#(3) = Eb(3) 

So pitches: 6, 10, 1, 3. 
Which are: F#, Bb, C#, D# or Gb, Bb, Db, Eb. 

Chord quality: root F#, but the notes are F#, A#, C#, D# — that's F# major triad (F#-A#-C#) plus D# which is the major 6th (since F# to D# is minor 6th? F# to D: perfect 4th to D, F#-G-A-Bb-B-C-D, so F# to D is minor 6th (8 semitones: F#=6, D=2, difference 8 semitones). Major 6th would be 9 semitones. In chord notation, "6" usually means added 6th, so F#6 = F# major with 6th added, which is F#-A#-C#-D#, and D# is the major 6th above F#? F# to D#: F#-G-A-B-C-D, D is minor 6th (8 semitones), D# would be major 6th (9 semitones). Yes, D# is major 6th above F#. So F#6 = F#maj6. 

But in the context of the song, F#maj6 might be functioning as a IV chord or something. 

Back to key analysis. Let's list all chords with enharmonic respelling to Ab key (since G# is Ab): 

- G# = Ab 
- Fm/G# = F minor over Ab bass → but as pitch, it's F, Ab, C with Ab in bass, so the chord is F minor, but bass is Ab 
- Similarly, Cdim/F# = Cdim over F# bass; F#=Gb, so Cdim/Gb 
- A#m/G# = A#m over G# bass = Bbm over Ab bass, which we decoded as Bb7 
- F#6 = as above, F#maj6 

But for functional harmony, we care about chord roots and qualities. 

From earlier: 
- A#m/G# = Bb7 (dominant chord) 
- Cdim/F# is likely F#ø7 (F# half-diminished) 
- Fm/G# is probably just Fm chord 

And the sequence is: 
Ab, Ab, Fm, Fm, F#ø7, Bb7, Ab, Ab, Fm, Fm, Ab, Ab, F#maj6, Ab 

Now, F#ø7 is a common chord in minor keys. Specifically, in G minor, F#ø7 is the viiø7 chord. But here we have Ab, which is the tonic? Ab major or minor? 

Ab major scale: Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G 
Ab minor natural: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb 
Ab minor harmonic: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-G (G natural) 

In Ab minor harmonic, the leading tone is G natural, so we have G major or diminished chords. F# is Gb? In Ab minor, the notes are: 
Natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb 
Harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G (raised 7th) 

So G natural is the leading tone. G natural to Ab is half step. 

Now, F# is Gb, which is not in Ab minor; it's Cb (B) instead. But in harmonic minor, we have G natural, not Gb. So F#ø7 would be Gbø7, which isn't in Ab minor. 

But F#ø7 = F#-A-C-Eb. Enharmonic to Gb-Ab-Cb-Db. In which key is this a diatonic chord? In Ab minor harmonic, the chords are: 
i: Ab minor 
ii°: Bb diminished 
III+: Cb augmented? Not standard. 
iv: Db minor 
V: Eb major 
VI: Fb major (E) 
vii°: Gb diminished? But Gb dim = Gb-Bbb-Dbb, not matching. 

G natural is the leading tone, so vii° is G° = G-Bb-Db. But here we have F#ø7 = F#-A-C-Eb = Gb-Ab-Cb-Db. Which is not G°. 

In G minor harmonic, we have F#ø7 naturally. G minor: G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F#. So F#ø7 = F#-A-C-E. But here we have F#-A-C-Eb — Eb instead of E. So it's F# half-diminished with flattened fifth? No, half-diminished is minor 7 flat 5, which is F#-A-C-E, but E is natural. Here it's Eb, so it's diminished 7th: F#-A-C-Eb is F# diminished 7th, because all intervals are minor thirds: F#-A = min3, A-C = min3, C-Eb = min3. 

Yes! F# dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb. And it's symmetrical. 

Similarly, Cdim is C-Eb-Gb, and with F# bass, it's the same as F# dim7 because dim7 chords are inversions of each other. F# dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb, which is the same as A dim7, C dim7, Eb dim7. So Cdim/F# is just F# dim7. 

In fact, all inversions of a dim7 chord are the same set of notes. So C dim7 over F# bass is still a dim7 chord, root F# (or Gb). 

So now the sequence makes more sense: 
- G# = Ab 
- Fm/G# = F minor first inversion (Ab bass) 
- Cdim/F# = F# dim7 (or Gb dim7) 
- A#m/G# = Bb7 (as we decoded) 
- F#6 = F# major 6th, which is enharmonic to Gb maj6 

But let's write roots: 
- Ab 
- Ab 
- Fm (but bass Ab, so it's Fm, not Ab) 
- Fm 
- Gb dim7 
- Bb7 
- Ab 
- Ab 
- Fm 
- Fm 
- Ab 
- Ab 
- Gb maj6 
- Ab 

Now, Gb maj6 = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb, which is the same as Eb minor 7: Eb-Gb-Bb-Db. Eb min7. 

Gb maj6 with notes Gb, Bb, Db, Eb: if we take Eb as root, it's Eb min7 (Eb-Gb-Bb-Db). Yes! Because Eb to Gb is minor 3rd, Eb to Bb perfect 5th, Eb to Db minor 7th. So Gb maj6 is enharmonic to Eb min7. 

Similarly, F# maj6 = F#, A#, C#, D# = Gb, Bb, Db, Eb = Eb min7. 

Ah! So F#6 is actually Eb minor 7th chord. 

And Bb7 we have, which is dominant of Eb. 

So let's reinterpret the entire sequence with chord roots: 

Original: 
G# (Ab) 
G# (Ab) 
Fm/G# → Fm chord (but in context, likely part of progression) 
Fm/G# → Fm 
Cdim/F# → Gb dim7 (or F# dim7) 
A#m/G# → Bb7 
G# (Ab) 
G# (Ab) 
Fm/G# → Fm 
Fm/G# → Fm 
G# (Ab) 
G# (Ab) 
F#6 → Eb min7 
G# (Ab) 

Now, let's list the root progression: 
Ab, Ab, F, F, Gb, Bb, Ab, Ab, F, F, Ab, Ab, Eb, Ab 

Chord qualities: 
- Ab: ? (probably major, since no indication otherwise) 
- F: minor 
- Gb: diminished 7th 
- Bb: dominant 7th 
- Eb: minor 7th 

Now, what key has these chords? 

Notice Bb7 is the V7 of Eb minor. Eb min7 is the i chord of Eb minor? But Eb min7 is the tonic chord for Eb minor? 

Eb minor scale: Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb-Cb-Db 

Diatonic chords: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III+: Gb aug? Not usually 
iv: Ab min 
v: Bb min 
VI: Cb maj 
VII: Db maj 

But we have Bb7 (Bb dominant 7th), which has D natural (major third), whereas in natural minor, v is Bb minor (Bb-Db-F). So Bb7 suggests harmonic minor, which has D natural in Eb minor. 

Eb minor harmonic: Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb-Cb-D (D natural) 

So chords: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III+: Gb aug 
iv: Ab min (but with harmonic, iv is still minor? No, in harmonic minor, the chords change: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III+: Gb aug (Gb-Bb-Db? Gb to Bb is major 3rd, Gb to Db perfect 5th, so major, not augmented. Mistake. 

Eb harmonic minor: notes Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, D 
Chord on Gb: Gb, Ab, Bb, Db? Gb-Ab-Bb-Db is Gb major 7? Gb-Bb-Db-F, not matching. 

Standard harmonic minor chords: 
- i: Eb min 
- ii°: F dim (F-Ab-Cb) 
- III+: Gb aug? Gb-Bb-Db — Gb to Db is perfect 5th, so major triad, not augmented. 
Actually, in harmonic minor, the III chord is augmented: for C minor harmonic, Eb aug (Eb-G-Bb, but in C harmonic minor: C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-B, so chord on Eb: Eb-G-Bb, which is major, not augmented. I think I'm confusing. 

In minor keys, the harmonic minor raises the 7th, so: 
- The v chord becomes major (if it has the 7th), but in Eb minor natural, v is Bb minor (Bb-Db-F), with harmonic minor (D natural), v becomes Bb dominant 7 (Bb-Db-F-Ab? No, dominant 7 needs major third. Bb with D natural: Bb-D-F-Ab = Bb7. Yes! So in Eb harmonic minor, V is Bb7 (dominant). 

Similarly, the i chord is Eb minor. 

Now, we have Eb min7 as the penultimate chord, which fits as i in Eb minor. 

But the tonic throughout the sequence seems to be Ab: it starts and ends with Ab, and it's repeated. 

Ab is the IV chord in Eb minor! Because Eb minor: 
i: Eb 
ii°: F dim 
III: Gb? (but Gb is major? In Eb natural minor: Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb-Cb-Db, so chord on Gb: Gb-Ab-Bb-Db? Gb major 7? Gb-Bb-Db-F — but F not in scale. Actually, in natural minor, Gb chord is Gb major (since Gb-Ab-Bb is major triad in natural minor? No: Gb to Bb is major 3rd (4 semitones), Gb to Db is perfect 5th (7 semitones), so yes, Gb major. 

Standard natural minor diatonic chords: 
i: minor 
ii°: diminished 
III: major 
iv: minor 
v: minor 
VI: major 
VII: major 

For Eb natural minor: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III: Gb major 
iv: Ab min 
v: Bb min 
VI: Cb major (B) 
VII: Db major 

But we have Bb7, which is not natural minor — it's harmonic minor. 

In Eb harmonic minor (with D natural), the chords are: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III+: Gb augmented (Gb-Bb-D? Gb to D is augmented 5th — yes, because D natural instead of Db) 
iv: Ab min? Ab-Cb-Eb — but Cb=B, so Ab-Bb-Eb? Ab to Cb is minor 3rd? Ab to Bb is major 2nd, not. Notes for iv: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. With harmonic minor, Cb is still Cb, Db is Db, so iv is Ab minor: Ab-Cb-Eb. 
v: Bb major (Bb-Db-F? Db is C#, but in harmonic minor, 7th is raised to D natural, but that doesn't affect v chord. v is Bb-Db-F, still minor. To get dominant, we need the major third, so only if we borrow or use harmonic. 

Specifically for dominant function, in minor keys, we often use the harmonic minor for the V chord to have a leading tone. So V is major: for Eb minor, V is Bb major, and V7 is Bb7. 

So Bb7 is the V7 in Eb minor. 

Then Eb min7 is the i chord. 

But in our progression, we have Ab as the recurring chord, and Ab is the iv chord in Eb minor (since iv is Ab minor in natural minor). 

But the progression ends with Ab, suggesting it's the tonic. 

Perhaps it's in Ab minor. 

Let's check Ab minor. 

Ab natural minor: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb 
Notes: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb 

Diatonic chords: 
i: Ab min 
ii°: Bb dim 
III: Cb major (B) 
iv: Db min 
v: Eb min 
VI: Fb major (E) 
VII: Gb major 

But we have Gb dim7 earlier? In the sequence, we have Gb dim7 (from Cdim/F#). Gb dim7 would require Gb-Bb-Db-Fb, but in Ab minor, Gb chord is major (Gb-Bb-Db), not diminished. 

In Ab harmonic minor, we raise Gb to G natural. 
Ab harmonic minor: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-G 

Chords: 
- i: Ab min 
- ii°: Bb dim (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- III+: Cb aug? Cb-Eb-G? Cb to Eb is minor 3rd? Standard: Cb chord in Ab harmonic minor: Cb, Db, Eb, G? Cb-Db-Eb-G — Cb to G is augmented 5th, so Cb augmented. 
- iv: Db min (Db-Fb-Ab) 
- v: Eb min? Eb-Gb-Bb, but Gb is still Gb? In harmonic minor, we only raise the 7th, so the v chord is still minor: Eb-Ab? Eb to Gb is minor 3rd, so Eb minor. 
- VI: Fb major? Fb-Ab-Cb — Fb to Cb is perfect 5th, but Fb is E, Cb is B, so E major. 
- VII°: G° = G-Bb-Db 

Ah! The VII° chord is G diminished, which is G-Bb-Db. Enharmonic to F#-A-C, but that's F# dim triad. We have Gb dim7? Gb is F#, but G natural is the leading tone, so it's G°, not Gb°. 

In the sequence, we have "Cdim/F#" which we interpreted as Gb dim7 or F# dim7. But F# dim triad would be F#-A-C, which is not in Ab minor; we have G° = G-Bb-Db. 

However, diminished 7th chords are often used as passing chords, not always diatonic. 

Another clue: the progression has Bb7, which is V7 of Eb. Eb is the IV of Ab? If Ab is tonic, Eb is dominant? But Ab to Eb is perfect 4th, so Eb would be V in Ab major, but Ab major has Eb major, not minor. 

Perhaps it's in Ab major. 

Ab major scale: Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G 
Chords: 
I: Ab 
ii: Bb min 
iii: C min 
IV: Db 
V: Eb 
vi: F min 
vii°: G dim 

Now, look at our chords: 
- Ab: I 
- Fm: vi 
- Gb dim7: not diatonic — G dim is diatonic, but Gb dim is not 
- Bb7: V7 of Eb, but in Ab major, V is Eb major, not Bb7 
- Eb min7: iv in Ab minor, but in major it's iv minor? Ab major has iv = Db major, not Eb. 

Bb7 could be the V7/vi, i.e., dominant of F minor. In Ab major, vi is F minor, so Bb7 would be V7 of vi, which is a common secondary dominant. 

Similarly, Eb min7 could be iv in Ab minor, but if the key is Ab major, Eb is V, not minor. 

Let's see the progression: 
Ab - Ab - Fm - Fm - Gb°7 - Bb7 - Ab - Ab - Fm - Fm - Ab - Ab - Ebm7 - Ab 

If key is Ab major: 
- Ab: I 
- Fm: vi 
- Gb°7: this is problematic. Gb dim7 = F# dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb. In Ab major, the notes are Ab,Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,G — no A, C, F#, Eb. So not diatonic. 
- Bb7: V7/vi = dominant of vi (Fm), so it's secondary dominant 
- Ebm7: Eb min7 = Eb-Gb-Bb-Db. In Ab major, Eb is V chord, which should be Eb major (Eb-G-Bb-Db), but here it's minor 7th (Eb-Gb-Bb-Db), so it has Gb instead of G. Gb is not in Ab major; Ab major has G natural. So Ebm7 is not diatonic — it's borrowed from minor. 

This suggests modal mixture or a minor key. 

Perhaps the key is Ab minor. 

Assume Ab minor (tonic Ab). 

Ab natural minor: Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb, Gb 
But we have G natural in the harmonic context because of the dim7 chord and the dominant. 

Ab harmonic minor: Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb,G 

Now list chords in Ab harmonic minor: 
- i: Ab min (Ab-Cb-Eb) 
- ii°: Bb dim (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- III+: Cb aug (Cb-Eb-G) 
- iv: Db min (Db-Fb-Ab) 
- V: Eb major? Eb-G-Bb, but in harmonic minor, G is natural, so yes, V is Eb major (or V7= Eb7) 
Wait, V chord: notes on Eb: Eb, G, Bb? Eb to G is major 3rd (4 semitones), so yes, Eb major. But in minor keys, V is often major for cadence. 

But in our progression, we have Bb7, not Eb7. Bb is the v chord in Ab minor, which is minor in natural minor, but in harmonic minor? The v chord is still minor because the 7th is lowered. 

In Ab harmonic minor: scale Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb,G 
Chord on Bb: Bb, Db, Fb, Ab? Bb-Db-Fb-Ab. Db is C#, Fb is E, so Bb-D-F-A? Bb to D is major 3rd? Bb to D is major 3rd (4 semitones), Bb to F is perfect 5th, Bb to Ab is minor 7th. So Bb7 (Bb-D-F-Ab). Yes! In Ab harmonic minor, the v chord is Bb7 dominant 7th. 

Perfect! 

Similarly, the i chord is Ab minor. 

Now check other chords: 
- Fm: F minor = F-Ab-C. In Ab minor, F is the VI degree. In natural minor, VI is major (Fb major = E major), but in harmonic minor, the VI chord is still the same as natural minor for degrees not affected. Ab harmonic minor has G natural, but F is still Fb? No, in Ab minor, the sixth degree is Fb (E), so chord on Fb is Fb major (Fb-Ab-Cb). But F minor has F natural, not Fb. 

Problem: F minor = F-Ab-C, but in Ab minor, the sixth degree is Fb (E), not F natural. F natural is raised sixth, which is characteristic of melodic minor. 

Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab,Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,G 
So chord on F: F, Ab, C — F minor! Yes. 

So if we're using melodic minor, F minor is diatonic. 

But in the progression, we have Fm repeated. 

Also, we have Gb dim7. Gb is F#, which is the flat sixth? In Ab minor, sixth degree is Fb (natural minor) or F natural (melodic). F# is not standard. 

In the sequence, "Cdim/F#" = Gb dim7. Gb dim7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Fb. In Ab minor natural, Db is the fourth degree, Gb is the seventh degree? Ab minor: 1.Ab, 2.Bb, 3.Cb, 4.Db, 5.Eb, 6.Fb, 7.Gb. So Gb is the seventh degree. 

In natural minor, chord on Gb: Gb, Ab, Bb, Db? Gb-Ab-Bb-Db. Intervals: Gb to Ab = major 2nd? Not triad. Standard triad: Gb-Bb-Db, which is Gb major (since Bb is minor third? Gb to Bb is major 3rd, 4 semitones). 

But Gb dim7 would require Gb-Bbb-Dbb-Fbb, not matching. 

However, the diminished seventh chord is often used as a chromatic approach. Specifically, Gb dim7 is the common-tone diminished chord for Ab minor. 

In minor keys, the common-tone diminished chord to tonic is vii°7, but in natural minor it's half-diminished? No, in harmonic minor, vii° is diminished triad, and with the flattened seventh, it becomes half-diminished seventh. 

For Ab minor harmonic: notes Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb,G 
Chord on G: G, Bb, Db, F — G°7 (G-Bb-Db-F). 

But we have Gb dim7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Fb. Fb is E, so Gb-Bb-Db-E. Which is not the same. 

Gb dim7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb? Dim7 should be minor thirds: Gb to Bbb? Standard dim7: root, min3, dim5, dim7. So Gb dim7 = Gb-Bbb-Dbb-Fbb = Gb-A-C-Eb enharmonically. Yes! Gb dim7 = Gb, A, C, Eb. 

In Ab minor harmonic, the notes are Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb,G. Gb dim7 has Gb,A,C,Eb — A and C are not in the scale (scale has Bb, Cb, Db, etc.). A natural is not in Ab minor; it's Bbb in some contexts, but not standard. 

However, Gb dim7 can function as a leading tone chord to Gb, but in Ab minor, it might be interpreted as the Neapolitan ♭II chord. 

In minor keys, the Neapolitan chord is ♭II, which in Ab minor is Bb major? Let's see. 

Ab minor: tonic Ab. ♭II is Bbb major, which is A major. Not Gb. 

Common usage: Gb dim7 is often used as a passing chord to Ab minor. Specifically, it's the diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone of Ab minor, but the leading tone is G natural, so G°7 = G-Bb-Db-F. 

Gb is not the leading tone. 

But Gb dim7 to Ab minor is a common progression: Gb dim7 resolves to Ab by half step (Gb to Ab), and the other notes: Bb to Bb, Db to Db, Eb to E? But Ab minor has Eb, but the chord has Eb, which is the fifth, so Eb to Eb is common tone. 

Gb dim7: Gb, Bb, Db, Eb 
Resolves to Ab minor: Ab, Cb, Eb 

- Gb → Ab (up half step) 
- Bb → Bb? But Ab minor has Bb, so it can stay, but usually it goes to Ab or Cb. 
- Db → Cb (down half step) 
- Eb → Eb (common tone) 

Yes, so Gb dim7 can resolve deceptively or as a chromatic approach to Ab minor. 

In fact, it's a common subdominant function chord in minor keys. 

Now, the progression: 
Ab - Ab - Fm - Fm - Gb°7 - Bb7 - Ab - Ab - Fm - Fm - Ab - Ab - Ebm7 - Ab 

In Ab minor: 
- Ab: i 
- Fm: ? In Ab minor melodic (ascending), F is natural sixth, so chord on F is F minor (F-Ab-C), which is the minor subdominant or something. In melodic minor, the iv chord is minor, but F is not iv. iv is Db. F is VI♭? In natural minor, VI is Fb major (E), but here F minor suggests melodic minor with unraised sixth? Confusing. 

Standard: In minor keys, the VI chord is often minor when borrowed, but diatonically it's different. 

Perhaps it's in G# minor, but let's stick with Ab for simplicity. 

Another observation: the sequence has Fm/G# and G# as tonic. G# minor is impractical; it's Ab minor. 

Let's consider the cadence. The progression often returns to Ab, and ends with Ab. The penultimate chord is Ebm7, which is the iv chord in Ab minor (iv = Db minor in natural minor, not Eb). Eb is V, so Ebm7 would be v minor. 

But earlier we saw that in harmonic minor, v is major (Bb7), but here we have Ebm7, which is not diatonic. 

Notice that Bb7 resolves to Ab, which is the tonic. Bb7 to Ab is a cadence, and in Ab minor, Bb7 is the V7 chord (since v is Bb, and with leading tone G, it becomes Bb7). 

Yes! In Ab minor harmonic, V7 is Bb7, resolving to i (Ab minor). 

And at the end, we have Ebm7 to Ab. Ebm7 is not V7; it should be Bb7 for dominant. But the last two chords are Ebm7 to Ab, which is a iv to i progression in minor, but iv in Ab minor is Db minor, not Eb. 

Ebm7 = Eb-Gb-Bb-Db. In Ab minor, Eb is the V degree, so chord on Eb should be Eb major or minor. In natural minor, v is Eb minor (Eb-Gb-Bb), so Ebm7 is the v7 chord. 

So v7 (Ebm7) resolving to i (Ab minor) — but that's not a strong cadence; the strong cadence is V7 (Bb7) to i. 

In the progression, before the final Ab, we have Ebm7, but earlier we have Bb7 resolving to Ab: look at the sequence: 
... Bb7, Ab, Ab, ... 
So Bb7 to Ab is a clear cadence. 

Then later, Fm, Fm, Ab, Ab, then Ebm7, Ab — so Ebm7 to Ab is also a cadence, but weaker. 

Perhaps the key is Ab minor, and Ebm7 is the v chord in natural minor, while Bb7 is the V chord in harmonic minor. So it's mixing natural and harmonic minor. 

Now for Fm: in Ab minor, if we consider melodic minor ascending (Ab,Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,G), then chord on F is F minor? F-Ab-C. Yes, since F natural, Ab, C natural. In melodic minor, the sixth is natural, so yes, F minor is the minor subdominant or iio? Let's see: 
Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G 
Chords: 
i: Ab min 
ii: Bb min 
III: C maj 
iv: Db min 
v: Eb min 
vi: F min 
vii°: G° 

Yes! vi is F minor. 

Perfect. 

And Gb dim7: we have it as a chromatic chord, but it might be functioning as a common-tone diminished or a secondary leading tone. 

Cdim/F# = Gb dim7. As discussed, it resolves to Bb7? In the sequence: ... Fm, Fm, Gb°7, Bb7, Ab ... 

So Gb dim7 to Bb7. 

Gb dim7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb 
Bb7 = Bb-Db-F-Ab 

Resolution: 
- Gb → F? Gb to F is minor 7th down, not typical. 
Standard diminished resolution: often resolves by half step. Gb dim7 typically resolves to Gb or Ab. 

Specifically: 
- Gb → Ab (pitches: Gb up to Ab) 
- Bb → Bb? Or to A? 
- Db → C# or Cb? 

Common resolution of Gb dim7: 
- Gb → F# or Gb? To Ab major: Gb->Ab, Bb->B, Db->C, Eb->D. But here it's Bb7, which has Db (not C), F, Ab. 

Bb7: notes Bb, D, F, Ab. 

So resolution: 
- Gb → Ab (in Bb7) 
- Bb → Bb? 
- Db → Db? 
- Eb → D? But Bb7 has D natural, not Db. 

Eb in Gb dim7 to D in Bb7: Eb to D is half step down. 

So: 
- Gb → Ab (up half step) 
- Bb → Bb? But Bb7 has Bb as root, so it could stay, but typically the diminished chord notes move to chord tones. 
- Db → C? But Bb7 has Db? No, Bb7 is Bb-D-F-Ab, so Db is not in it; it's D natural. 

Notes: Gb dim7: Gb, A, C, Eb (since dim7 is minor thirds: Gb to A is min3? Gb to A is aug 2nd, enharmonic to min3). Standard: Gb°7 = Gb-Bbb-Dbb-Fbb = Gb-A-C-Eb (because Bbb=A, Dbb=C, Fbb=Eb). 

Yes: Gb, A, C, Eb. 

Bb7: Bb, D, F, Ab. 

Possible resolution: 
- Gb → F or Ab? Gb to F is major 7th down, not good. Gb to Ab is half step up. 
- A → Bb? A to Bb is half step up. 
- C → Bb or D? C to Bb is whole step down, C to D is whole step up. 
- Eb → D or E? Eb to D is half step down, Eb to E is half step up. 

Typically, diminished chords resolve with each note moving by half step. So: 
- Gb → Gb? Not. To Ab (up) 
- A → Bb (up) 
- C → B (down) but Bb7 has D, not B. 
- Eb → D (down) 

Bb7 has D, not B. So C should resolve to D (up whole step), but that's not half step. 

Perhaps it's resolving to the Bb7 chord: 
- Gb → Ab (Bb7's 7th) 
- A → Bb (root) 
- C → D (3rd) 
- Eb → D? Conflict, Eb to D is down, but C to D is up. 

Eb to D (down half step), C to D (up half step) — C and Eb both resolve to D, which is possible (two voices to same note). 

Yes: common in diminished resolutions. 

So Gb°7 resolves to Bb7: 
- Gb → Ab 
- A → Bb 
- C → D 
- Eb → D 

Bb7 has Ab (7th), Bb (root), D (3rd), F (5th), so yes, it fits: 
- Gb → Ab (7th of Bb7) 
- A → Bb (root) 
- C → D (3rd) 
- Eb → D (3rd, so doubled) 

Perfect. 

And Bb7 resolves to Ab minor: 
- Bb7: Bb, D, F, Ab 
- Ab minor: Ab, Cb, Eb 
- Resolution: Bb → Ab (down minor 3rd? Not standard), but typical: D (3rd) → Cb (down half step), F (5th) → Eb (down half step), Ab (7th) → Ab (common or down), Bb (root) → Ab (down minor 2nd). 

Standard V7 to i in minor: 
- Leading tone G to Ab (but here V7 is Bb7, not Eb7; Bb7 is the V of Ab minor, yes). 

For V7 = Bb7 (Bb-D-F-Ab) resolving to i = Ab minor (Ab-Cb-Eb): 
- D (3rd of V) → Cb (down half step, since Cb is diatonic in minor) 
- F (5th of V) → Eb (down half step) 
- Ab (7th of V) → G or Ab? In minor, the 7th often resolves down by half step to the third of tonic. Tonic third is Cb, so Ab → G? But G natural is the leading tone, which should go to Ab. 
In Ab minor, the notes: tonic Ab, third Cb (B), fifth Eb. 
V7 = Bb7: root Bb, 3rd D, 5th F, 7th Ab. 
Resolution: 
- D (3rd) → Cb (B) (down half step, since Cb is the minor third) 
- F (5th) → Eb (down half step) 
- Ab (7th) → G (down half step? But G is not in tonic chord; tonic has Ab, Cb, Eb. G is the leading tone, which isn't in the tonic triad. Typically, the 7th (Ab) resolves down to G, but in minor, G is natural for harmonic, so it should resolve to G, which might be sustained or resolved, but the chord is Ab minor, so Ab to G is a suspension. Standard is 7th resolves down by half step, so Ab → G. 

But in the sequence, it goes Bb7 to Ab directly, and Ab is the tonic, so it probably works. 

Now, the Ebm7: at the end, Ebm7 to Ab. Ebm7 = Eb-Gb-Bb-Db. Resolving to Ab minor: Eb → Eb (common), Gb → Fb or G? But Ab minor has Cb, not G. Typically, Ebm7 is the iv chord in minor? No, iv is Db minor. 

In Ab minor, Eb is V, so Eb minor is v. v minor to i is a cadence in natural minor. 

So the progression uses both harmonic minor (for Bb7) and natural minor (for Ebm7), which is common. 

Fm: as we said, in melodic minor, it's the vi chord. Ab minor melodic ascending: Ab,Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,G, so F minor is vi. 

And Fm appears before the cadence: Fm to Gb°7 to Bb7 to Ab. 

Fm to Gb°7: F minor to Gb dim7. 

F minor: F, Ab, C 
Gb dim7: Gb, A, C, Eb 

Common tones: Ab and C? Fm has Ab and C, Gb dim7 has A (which is enharmonic to G#, not Ab) and C. 

Fm: F, Ab, C 
Gb dim7: Gb, A, C, Eb 

Shared note: C. 

Resolution: F → Eb or Gb? F to Eb is half step down, F to Gb is minor 2nd up. Typically, F might go to Eb (in Gb dim7). 

In the sequence: Fm - Fm - Gb°7, so it's a progression. 

Now, to confirm the key and mode: 

- The tonic chord is Ab minor (G# minor). 
- The progression uses characteristic chords of minor: 
  - i (Abm) - tonic 
  - vi (Fm) - from melodic minor 
  - vii°7 (Gb°7) - chromatic leading tone chord, but in this context it's acting as a secondary leading tone to V 
  - V7 (Bb7) - dominant seventh, indicating harmonic minor 
  - v7 (Ebm7) - natural minor dominant chord 

The use of both V7 (Bb7) and v7 (Ebm7) suggests a minor key with mixture, but the dominant function is clearly present with Bb7 resolving to tonic. 

The mode is minor, specifically a blend, but the tonic is Ab minor. 

Since the sequence emphasizes Ab as the home chord, and has the leading tone G (implied by Bb7's third being D, but wait: Bb7 has D natural, which is the major third, so it assumes the leading tone to Ab is G natural. 

In Ab minor, the leading tone is G natural (raised 7th), which is used to create the dominant chord Bb7 (Bb-D-F-Ab), where D natural comes from the leading tone scale. 

The presence of F natural (in Fm) indicates the sixth degree is raised, characteristic of melodic minor. 

However, the Ebm7 at the end has Gb (Ab minor's minor sixth), which is lowered, so it's using natural minor for that chord. 

Overall, the key is Ab minor, and the mode is minor with melodic and harmonic variations. 

But to specify the mode: since it's not strictly one mode but a minor key with mixture, we say the key is Ab minor. 

Now, why is the last chord before tonic Ebm7? In many minor key progressions, a iv chord (which would be Db minor, but Ebm7 is not iv; iv is Db minor in Ab minor). Eb is V, so Ebm7 is v7. 

v to i is a valid cadence in minor, though weaker than V to i. 

In the sequence, the primary cadence is Bb7 to Ab (V7 to i), which is strong. The final cadence is Ebm7 to Ab, which might be a plagal cadence or just a weaker resolution. 

Given all this, the key is G# minor (enharmonically Ab minor). 

But G# minor is uncommonly notated; usually Ab minor. 

The user wrote all chords with sharps, so probably they want G# minor. 

Confirm with the original notation: 
Roots: G# (not Ab), Fm, Cdim/F# (F#=G#? F# is sixth degree), A#m/G# (A#=Bb), etc. 

In G# minor: 
Tonic: G# 
Scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F# 
Harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, Fx (but Fx is G, so G natural? Messy. 

Standard minor key notation: G# minor is impractical because it requires double sharps in harmonic minor. For example, harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, Fx (F double sharp = G natural). So it's usually respelled as Ab minor. 

Therefore, the key is Ab minor. 

But the user might expect the answer in sharps since the input uses sharps. 

So G# minor, but it's better to say Ab minor. 

Now for the mode: it's minor (Aeolian mode), but with harmonic and melodic characteristics. However, the fundamental mode is minor. 

The question asks for "key and mode". Mode typically refers to the scale type, like Aeolian, Dorian, etc. 

In traditional terms, "key" implies major or minor, and "mode" might specify Greek modes, but often in this context, "mode" means minor or major. 

Looking at the chords, it's clearly minor. 

To confirm: 
- Tonic chord is minor (G# minor, though written as G# major? Wait, the root is G#, but is it minor? 

Problem: the first chord is written as "G#", which typically implies major triad. Similarly, the last chord is "G#". 

In standard notation, "G#" means G# major. 

But in the sequence, we have "A#m/G#", which suggests A# minor, so minor is used, but the tonic is written as major. 

Ah, critical point: the tonic chord G# is written without "m", so it's probably major. 

But in minor keys, the tonic chord is minor, so "G#" should be G# minor, but it's written as G#, implying major. 

In the sequence: 
"G# G# Fm/G# ..." — "G#" with no specification usually means major in chord notation. 

But if the key is minor, the tonic chord should be minor. 

Unless it's in a major key? 

Perhaps it's in a major key, and G# is not the tonic. 

Let's rethink. 

The progression might not be in G# minor. 

Look at the chord roots: Ab, Ab, F, F, Gb, Bb, Ab, Ab, F, F, Ab, Ab, Eb, Ab 

If Ab is not tonic, what could it be? 

The chord that feels like tonic: it starts and ends with it, and has cadences to it (like Bb7 to Ab, Ebm7 to Ab). 

But if Ab major is tonic, then: 
- Ab major 
- Fm is vi 
- Gb dim7: not diatonic 
- Bb7 is V7/vi (since vi is Fm) 
- Ebm7: Eb minor 7, which is iv in Ab minor, but not in major 

Bb7 resolving to Ab is a deceptive cadence if Ab is tonic; Bb7 is V7/vi, so it should resolve to vi (Fm), but here it resolves to Ab (I). 

In the sequence: ... Gb°7, Bb7, Ab ... so Bb7 to Ab. 

If key is Ab major, Bb7 is V7/vi, which typically resolves to vi (Fm), not to I. 

But it's resolving to I, which is a common substitution (deceptive resolution). 

Then the progression makes sense in Ab major: 
- I: Ab 
- vi: Fm 
- Gb°7: chromatic passing chord 
- V7/vi: Bb7, but resolving deceptively to I instead of vi 
- Then back to I 

At the end: ... Ab, Ab, Ebm7, Ab 

Ebm7: in Ab major, Eb is V, so Ebm7 is a minor version of V, not diatonic. 

Perhaps Ebm7 is IV in F minor, but not here. 

Another idea: the Ebm7 might be a borrowed chord from minor. 

In Ab major, borrowing Ebm7 from Ab minor. 

So the key is Ab major, with modal mixture (borrowing chords from parallel minor). 

Check the chords: 
- Ab: I 
- Fm: vi (diatonic in major) 
- Gb°7: not diatonic, but common as Neapolitan? In major, Neapolitan is ♭II, which for Ab major is Bbb major (A major), not Gb dim. 
Gb dim7 could be vii°7 of Ab major? Ab major has G° = G-Bb-Db, not Gb. 

But in practice, Gb dim7 is often used as a chromatic approach to Ab major. 

Bb7: as V7/vi, normal. 

Ebm7: borrowed iv from minor. 

And the progression I - vi - [chromatic] - V7/vi - I is common, with the V7/vi resolving deceptively to I. 

The final Ebm7 to Ab could be iv - I, a plagal cadence borrowed from minor. 

Moreover, the tonic chord is written as "G#" implying major, which matches Ab major. 

In Ab minor, the tonic chord should be written as "G#m", but here it's "G#", so likely major. 

So key is Ab major. 

Then mode is Ionian (major). 

But let's confirm the borrowed chords. 

In Ab major, parallel minor is Ab minor, which has: 
- iv: Db minor 
- v: Eb minor 
- etc. 

Here we have Ebm7, which is v from minor, borrowed. 

Also, Fm is diatonic as vi. 

Gb dim7: not directly borrowed, but it can be seen as a passing chord or derived from the Neapolitan area. 

Specifically, Gb dim7 = F# dim7, which can function as the leading tone chord to G, but in Ab major, it might be interpreted as ♭VII°7 or something. 

Commonly, dim7 chords on the flat second scale degree. 

In Ab major, the scale is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. 

Gb is not in scale; it's chord on G is G°. 

But Gb dim7 = Gb, A, C, Eb. 

In Ab major, this could be the vii°7 of Ab major? Ab major's vii° is G° = G-Bb-Db. Gb dim7 is different. 

However, enharmonically, F# dim7 can be respelled as G°7? F# dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb, G°7 = G-Bb-Db-F. Different notes. 

But in practice, this dim7 chord is functioning as a secondary leading tone. 

Earlier we saw it resolves to Bb7: 
- Gb°7 (Gb,A,C,Eb) to Bb7 (Bb,D,F,Ab) 
With Gb->Ab, A->Bb, C->D, Eb->D 

Now, Bb7 is V7/vi in Ab major (since vi is Fm). 

So the progression is: 
I - I - vi - vi - [vii°7/V] - V7/vi - I ... 

Why vii°7/V? The leading tone chord for V. 

V in Ab major is Eb major. 

Leading tone chord for Eb is D°7 = D-F-Ab-Cb. 

But we have Gb°7 = Gb-A-C-Eb. 

Gb to Eb: Gb is the minor sixth of Eb? Eb scale: Eb,F,G, etc. Gb is minor third. 

Not directly. 

Perhaps it's the common-tone dim7 for Ab. 

But earlier resolution to Bb7 makes sense as a chromatic approach. 

Given that, and the fact that the tonic is major, I think the key is Ab major. 

But the very last cadence is Ebm7 to Ab. Ebm7 is iv from minor, so iv-I borrowed from parallel minor. 

Also, Fm is diatonic so no issue. 

And the Gb dim7 fits as a chromatic passing chord. 

Moreover, in many popular songs, this progression occurs in major keys with borrowed chords. 

So final answer: key is Ab major (or G# major, but Ab is standard). 

Mode: Ionian (major). 

But the user might want the answer in sharps since input uses sharps. 

G# major scale: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F## — full of sharps and double-sharps, very impractical. 

So better to say Ab major. 

For the answer, we can say "Ab major" or "G# major", but Ab is conventional. 

Perhaps the user intended G# minor, but the chord "G#" suggests major. 

Another clue: "F#6" — if it's F# major 6th, that would be F#, A#, C#, D#, which is unusual in key signatures, but in Ab major, F# is not in key; Ab major has F natural. 

F#6 = Gb Maj6 = Gb, Bb, Db, Eb, which is the borrowing from minor, but in Ab major, it's not diatonic. 

In our earlier enharmonic, we decoded F#6 as Eb minor 7th, which is the borrowed iv chord? No, iv in Ab major is Db major. 

If key is Ab major, Eb is V, so Ebm7 is borrowed v-minor. 

And F#6 = Gb Maj6, which is enharmonic to Eb minor 7th, yes. 

So it's consistent with Ab major with modal mixture. 

Therefore, key is Ab major, mode is major (Ionian). 

But to specify: "key of Ab major, Ionian mode" or simply "Ab major". 

Since mode is often redundant for major keys, but the question asks for it. 

Final decision: 
- Key: Ab major (or G# major, but Ab is standard) 
- Mode: Ionian 

However, G# is used in input, so perhaps they want G# major. 

But G# major is not practical, so likely they expect Ab major. 

In the answer, we can say "Ab major (G# major is enharmonically equivalent but rarely used)". 

But for brevity, "Ab major". 

Now, the mode is Ionian. 

But let's make sure there's no other mode. 

Could it be in Dorian, Mixolydian? Unlikely, because the tonic is clearly the I chord, and it's major. 

The progression has a major tonic, so Ionian. 

So answer: key is Ab major, mode is Ionian.

Based on the chord sequence you provided—**G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#**—here's a clear, step-by-step analysis to determine the **key and mode**. The sequence contains **enharmonic respelling** and **slash-chord misdirection**, so I'll decode these first before identifying the harmonic context. (All chords are interpreted with standard voice-leading and functional harmony.)

---

### **Step 1: Decode the "messy" slash chords**
The slash chords are **not** literal inversions—they're **enharmonic tricks** for more common harmonic progressions. Here's the correction:

- **Fm/G#** → **F minor chord with G# bass**  
  G# = Ab (enharmonically), so this is **Fm/Ab**.  
  Notes: Ab (bass), F, Ab, C → simplifies to **F minor triad** (F–Ab–C).  
  *Why?* G# (Ab) is the 3rd of F minor, so this is just an inverted F minor chord (no functional mystery).  
  **Actual chord root = Fm (vi chord in Ab major)**.

- **Cdim/F#** → **C diminished chord with F# bass**  
  F# = Gb (enharmonically), so this is **Cdim/Gb**.  
  Notes: Gb (bass), C, Eb, Gb → Cdim7 = **Gb diminished 7th** (Gb–A–C–Eb).  
  *Why?* Dim7 chords are symmetrical and function as chromatic passing chords. Here, it leads smoothly to Bb7 (see step 2).  
  **Actual chord = Gb°7**.

- **A#m/G#** → **A# minor chord with G# bass**  
  A# = Bb, G# = Ab, so notes are Ab (bass), Bb, Db, F → **Bb7** (Bb–Db–F–Ab).  
  *Why?* Ab in the bass + Bb triad = dominant 7th chord (Bb7). This is a classic **V7/vi** (secondary dominant resolving to F minor).  
  **Actual chord = Bb7**.

- **F#6** → **F# major 6th chord**  
  F#6 = F#–A#–C#–D# → enharmonically respelled as **Gb–Bb–Db–Eb**.  
  Notes: Gb, Bb, Db, Eb → **Ebm7** (Eb–Gb–Bb–Db).  
  *Why?* Gb is the 7th of Eb minor, so this is an Eb minor 7th chord (borrowed from the parallel minor key).  
  **Actual chord = Ebm7**.

---

### **Step 2: Full sequence with corrected roots**
After resolving all notational quirks, the sequence is:  
**Ab Ab Fm Fm Gb°7 Bb7 Ab Ab Fm Fm Ab Ab Ebm7 Ab**  
*(using flats for standard notation—G# = Ab, etc.)*

- **Chord qualities**:  
  - Ab = **Ab major** (I)  
  - Fm = **F minor** (vi)  
  - Gb°7 = **Gb diminished 7th** (chromatic passing chord)  
  - Bb7 = **Bb dominant 7th** (V7/vi)  
  - Ebm7 = **Eb minor 7th** (borrowed iv from parallel minor)  

---

### **Step 3: Harmonic analysis (key and mode)**
#### **Why Ab major (Ionian mode)?**
1. **Tonic confirmation**:  
   - The progression **starts/ends on Ab major** (G#).  
   - Strong cadences resolve to Ab:  
     - Bb7 → Ab (V7/vi → I deceptive resolution)  
     - Ebm7 → Ab (borrowed iv → I plagal cadence)  
   - *Critical clue*: The chord is written as **"G#"** (not "G#m"), implying a **major tonic**—standard in chord notation.

2. **Scale diatonicity**:  
   - Ab major scale: **Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G**  
   - Diatonic chords:  
     - I = Ab | ii = Bbm | iii = Cm | **vi = Fm**  
     - V = Eb (not Ebm7—this is borrowed)  
   - Fits perfectly:  
     - **Fm** = vi (diatonic)  
     - **Bb7** = V7/vi (standard secondary dominant)  
     - **Gb°7** = chromatic approach to Bb7 (common in jazz/pop)  
     - **Ebm7** = borrowed iv from **Ab minor** (parallel minor blend, typical in many genres).

3. **Why not minor?**  
   - If this were Ab minor, the tonic chord would be **Abm** (written as "G#m" in your sequence), but it's **major** ("G#").  
   - Bb7 functions as **V7/vi** (not V7 of tonic), which only makes sense in a **major key**.

4. **Mode confirmation**:  
   - The tonic chord is major (I), cadences emphasize I, and the viio chord (G° in Ab major) is absent—replaced by borrowed chords.  
   - **Mode = Ionian** (synonymous with major scale in functional harmony).

#### **Why not G# major?**
- G# major = **G#–A#–B#–C#–D#–E#–F##** (requires double sharps, e.g., B# = C, E# = F, F## = G).  
- This is **highly impractical**—standard notation uses **Ab major** (one flat) instead of G# major (8 sharps).  
- Your sequence uses sharps for convenience (common in pop/film scoring), but **Ab is the key signature**.

---

### **Key and Mode Summary**
| **Element** | **Identification** | **Reasoning** |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Key**     | **Ab major** (enharmonically equivalent to G# major, but **Ab is standard**) | Tonic is Ab major (G#), vi = Fm is diatonic, Bb7 = V7/vi. G# major is notated but impractical; Ab major uses a sensible key signature (4 flats). |
| **Mode**    | **Ionian** | Tonic chord is major (I), harmonic function centers on major tonic with characteristic cadences (V7/vi → I, iv → I). No modal alterations (e.g., no Dorian/Lydian shifts). |

---

### **Why this makes sense in music**
- **Gb°7** acts as a chromatic bridge between Fm and Bb7 (e.g., in jazz: vi → #ivo7 → V7/vi → I).  
- **Ebm7 → Ab** is a **borrowed plagal cadence** from Ab minor (very common in blues, pop, and classical—e.g., Beatles' "Let It Be").  
- The sequence **blends major and minor** (using Ebm7 from parallel minor), but the **tonic is major**, so it’s **Ionian mode** with modal mixture.

This is a **classic major-key progression** with chromatic flavor—heard in genres from jazz to film scores. If you have more context (e.g., melody), I can refine this further! 🎹

### Step 1: Write chords clearly with enharmonic equivalents if needed

First, let's rewrite some chords in a more readable way, possibly using enharmonics for clarity.

- **G#** = G# major (G#, B#, D#)
- **Fm/G#** = F minor with G# in the bass → this is an inverted chord. Fm = (F, Ab, C). G# in the bass → so it's F minor over G#.
  - But G# is not in F minor. G# = Ab, so this could be **Ab minor over Ab** = Abm/Ab → i.e., **Ab minor in root position**, just written oddly.
  - So **Fm/G#** is likely meant to be **Abm/Ab**, which is the same pitch content: Ab, Cb (B), Eb over Ab bass.
  - So **Fm/G# = Abm** — probably a notation quirk. Let's assume this is **Ab minor**.
- **Cdim/F#** = C diminished chord with F# in the bass.
  - Cdim = C, Eb, Gb
  - F# in bass → F#, C, Eb, Gb → This is the same as **F#dim7 (F#, A, C, Eb)** — which is a fully diminished 7th chord.
  - So **Cdim/F# = F#dim7**, which is enharmonically equivalent.
- **A#m/G#** = A# minor with G# in bass.
  - A#m = A#, C#, E#
  - G# in bass → G#, A#, C#, E#
  - G# to A# is a major 2nd — not a typical inversion.
  - G# is the minor 7th of A# — so this might function as a **dominant or subdominant-related chord**.
- **F#6** = F# major with added 6th = F#, A#, C#, D# — essentially F# major 6th.

So reinterpreting with enharmonic equivalents:

- G# = G#
- Fm/G# = Abm (Ab, Cb, Eb)
- Cdim/F# = F#dim7 (F#, A, C, Eb)
- A#m/G# = A#m with G# in bass — G# is the b7 of A#, so this is A#m7 in 3rd inversion: A#m7/G# → (G#, A#, C#, E#)
- F#6 = F#6 (F#, A#, C#, D#)

But let’s use consistent enharmonics. We’re in **G#-related keys**, which are messy due to sharps. Let’s consider **enharmonic equivalents** to make this easier.

Let’s convert everything to **Ab**:

- G# = Ab
- Fm/G# = Abm (as above) → Abm
- Cdim/F# = Dbdim/F# → but F# = Gb, so F#dim7 = Gbdim7 → same as **Abdim7**? No.
  - F#dim7 = F#, A, C, Eb → enharmonically the same as **Gbdim7, Bdim7, Dbdim7, E#dim7**, but in key context, it's likely **vii°7** of G# major or G# minor.
- A#m = Bbm
- F#6 = Gb6
- G# = Ab

So perhaps reframe the entire progression in **Ab**:

- Ab
- Ab
- Abm
- Abm
- F#dim7 → Gbdim7 → same notes: Gb, Bbb, Dbb, Fbb → Gb, Ebb, Cb, Fbb
  But better to keep as F#dim7 if key is G#.

Alternatively, let’s stick with **G# as tonic** and see where this goes.

---

### Step 2: Look for tonic and harmonic function

The progression starts and ends on **G#**, has G# repeated multiple times, and ends with **F#6 → G#**, which is a strong cadence (IV6 → I).

F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#  
G# is G#, B#, D#

F#6 → G# is **IV6 - I** in **G# major**.

That’s a strong indicator.

Let’s check chords in **G# major**:

G# major scale:
- G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F## (F## = G)

But this is very sharp-heavy (6 sharps, plus F## — equivalent to Ab major: 4 flats).

So G# major is enharmonically **Ab major** (4 flats):  
Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

So let’s transpose the whole progression into **Ab major** for simplicity.

---

### Enharmonic Transformation:

- G# → Ab
- Fm/G# → F minor over G# → F = E#, G# = G# — messy. But Fm is Abm enharmonically? Fm = F, Ab, C → Abm = Ab, Cb, Eb → different.
  Wait: Earlier thought Fm/G# = Abm — is that valid?

Fm = F, Ab, C  
G# = G# → so chord is G#, F, Ab, C

G# = Ab  
So pitches: Ab, F, Ab, C — so Ab, C, F — which is **Ab major** — not F minor.

Wait — that's a contradiction.

Let’s clarify:

**Fm/G#**:  
- Bass: G# (Ab)  
- Chord: F minor = F, Ab, C (F is **enharmonic to E#**, but not typically used)

So pitches: **Ab, F, Ab, C**

So the chord contains: Ab, C, F → which is **Ab major 6th** (Ab, C, Eb, F) but **missing Eb**, has **C and F**.

Ab, C, F = **F minor in first inversion (F - Ab - C)** with Ab in bass → so Ab, F, Ab, C → **Fm/Ab**

Ah! So **Fm/G#** is actually **Fm/Ab** → F minor over Ab (G#) bass.

But Fm = **F, Ab, C** → so with Ab in bass, it's **Ab - F - Ab - C** → chord tones: Ab, C, F → which is **Ab6** (Ab major with added 6th: Ab, C, Eb, F — but Eb is missing)

So without Eb, it's not Ab6 — it's **Fm/Ab**, which sounds like **Ab added sixth without the fifth**.

But in function, it may act as a **ii6 or iv chord**.

However, F minor is not in Ab major.

Let’s go back.

Alternative: perhaps the chord labeled **Fm/G#** means a **G# chord with F in the bass?** But no — notation is Fm/G#, meaning F minor chord with G# in bass.

So pitches: G#, F, Ab, C

G# = Ab  
F = F  
Ab = Ab  
C = C

So notes: **Ab, F, Ab, C** → so **Ab, C, F**

This is **F minor in first inversion (Fm = F-Ab-C)** → **Fm/Ab**

But Ab is the 3rd of Fm — so this is **Fm in first inversion**.

So **Fm/G# = Fm/Ab**

Similarly:

- **Cdim/F#**: C, Eb, Gb, with F# (Gb) in bass → Gb, C, Eb, Gb → Gb, C, Eb → that's **Gb augmented**, but Cdim = C, Eb, Gb — so with Gb in bass, it’s **Cdim/Gb**, third inversion.

Cdim = C, Eb, Gb → fully diminished? No, missing the diminished 7th. But if it’s Cdim7, it would be C, Eb, Gb, Bbb (A).

But here it's written as **Cdim**, so likely C, Eb, Gb.

With F# (Gb) in bass → Gb, C, Eb, Gb → Gb, B# (C), D# (Eb) → Gb, B#, D# → which is **Gb augmented** — suspicious.

But the notes C, Eb, Gb, F# — F# = Gb — so pitches: **C, Eb, Gb, Gb** → so **C, Eb, Gb** — C diminished with Gb in bass — which is the same as **Cdim in 2nd inversion** (fifth in bass).

Cdim = C, Eb, Gb

Root position: C
1st inv.: Eb
2nd inv.: Gb → yes.

So **Cdim/F#** = **Cdim in second inversion** — still just a C diminished chord with Gb (F#) in bass.

Now, in key of G# major, is C diminished?

G# major: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##

C natural is not in this scale — C# is.

So C is a chromatic note — not diatonic to G# major.

Similarly, Fm = F, Ab, C — F and Ab are not in G# major (which has F## = G, and A).

So this suggests we’re not in G# major.

Let’s consider **G# minor**.

G# minor (natural): G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Now check chords:

- G# = G# (major) — but G# minor is G# B D# — but here we have **G#** chord — is it major or minor?

The chord is labeled **G#** — typically means major.

But in minor key, tonic is minor. So unless it’s harmonic minor with raised leading tone, but tonic is still minor.

So G# **major** chord in G# minor = III chord? But it’s used as tonic — so probably not.

Wait — unless it’s **A-flat minor key**?

Let’s try enharmonic equivalence.

Try **Ab minor** key.

Ab minor: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb

Harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G → G natural

Now check chords:

- **G# = Ab**  
We need Ab **major**? But in Ab minor, Ab is minor. Ab major would be **III chord** — which is possible.

But the repeated use of G# major as a tonic-like chord suggests it’s being treated as major.

Another idea: perhaps the key is **E major** or **C# minor**, and G# is a chromatic chord?

Let’s look at the chord progression again:

G#  
G#  
Fm/G#  
Fm/G#  
Cdim/F#  
A#m/G#  
G#  
G#  
Fm/G#  
Fm/G#  
G#  
G#  
F#6  
G#

Note:
- Fm/G# = G#, F, Ab, C
- Cdim/F# = F#, C, Eb, Gb
- A#m/G# = G#, A#, C#, E#
- F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#

Let’s list all unique pitches used:

From G#: G#, B#, D#  
From Fm/G#: G#, F, Ab, C  
From Cdim/F#: F#, C, Eb, Gb  
From A#m/G#: G#, A#, C#, E# (F)  
From F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

So pitches:
- G#
- F (in Fm/G# and A#m/G# — E#)
- Ab (Gb)
- C
- F# (Gb)
- C (again)
- Eb
- Gb
- A#
- C#
- D# (E# is F?)
- D# (in G# and F#6)

Wait, D# in G# and F#6 (F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#) — yes.

So pitches:
- F
- F# / Gb
- G#
- A#
- C
- C#
- D#
- Eb
- Ab (same as G#)

Wait, **Ab = G#**, but also **Ab** appears in Fm, so is it Ab or G#?

Fm = F, Ab, C — so **Ab** is present.

G# is separate? Or are they the same?

Yes, **G# = Ab** in pitch.

But **A# = Bb**

So combine enharmonics:

- F
- F#
- G#
- A#
- C
- C#
- D#
- Eb
- (Ab = G# — already have)

So set of pitches: C, C#, D#, E (Fb?), F, F#, G#, A#, B (but E# = F)

Wait — missing a proper E.

Let’s list unique pitch classes:

- C
- C#
- D# (Eb missing? D# is there)
- D# = Eb → same pitch
- Eb = D#
- F
- F#
- G# (Ab)
- A#
- B? No
- E? Not directly — A#m has E# which is F

So no E natural.

Notes:
- C
- C#
- D#
- Eb (same as D#)
- F (from Fm and E# = F)
- F#  
- G#  
- A#  
- (B? Not present)  
- (E? Not present — E is 6 semitones above G#)

But G# to A# is 2 semitones, A# to C# is 3, etc.

Let’s list pitch classes (enharmonic):

1. C  
2. C#  
3. D#  
4. E = Fb? No F natural is present — but F is there, which is E#

F = E#

So pitch classes:

- C  
- C#  
- D#  
- F (E#)  
- F#  
- G#  
- A#  

That’s 7 notes.

Sort them from G#:

- G#  
- A#  
- C  
- C#  
- D#  
- F (E#)  
- F#  
- G# → back

So: G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, F#

Intervals from G#:

- G#  
- A# = +2  
- C = +3 (G# to C is augmented 3rd? G# to C = B, C? G# to B is minor 3rd, B to C is half step → G# to C = 3 half steps = minor third? G# to C = Ab to C = A to C = minor third, yes)
  - G#-A-A#-B, C → 4 half steps: G# to A (1), A to A# (2), A# to B (3), B to C (4) — yes, 4 semitones = major third
- G# to C = 4 semitones → major third
- C to C# = 1
- C# to D# = 2
- D# to F = 2.5? D# to E = 0.5, E to F = 0.5 → total 1 semitone? D# to F: D#-E-F = 2 semitones
- F to F# = 1
- F# to G# = 2

So scale: G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, F#, G#

Intervals in semitones:
- G# to A#: 2
- A# to C: 1
- C to C#: 1
- C# to D#: 2
- D# to F: 2
- F to F#: 1
- F# to G#: 2

So sequence: 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2

This doesn’t match a standard mode.

But this looks very close to **G# Dorian**?

G# Dorian: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#

- B = Cb = A#
Wait, B natural is 11 semitones above G#.
G#=0, A#=2, B=3, C#=4, D#=6, E#=8, F#=11, G#=12

But in our chords, we have C natural (3 semitones above G#) — which is B#, but in equal temperament, C = 3 semitones.

G# to C is 3 semitones = minor third.

In G# Dorian, third should be B = 3 semitones — yes, B = Cb, but C is not B — C is enharmonic to B#, which is 4 semitones.

B natural = 3 semitones above G# (G#-A-A#-B)

C = 4 semitones above G#.

So if chord has C, it's not B.

But in Fm, we have F, Ab, C — C is C.

So C is 4 semitones above G# — which is **major third**.

So the tonic chord G# is major (G#, B# (C), D#) — so has C.

B# = C, yes.

So G# major chord: G#, B#, D# = G#, C, D# — so C is B#.

Similarly, F is E#, which is in A#m: A#, C#, E# — E# = F.

So the chords are actually using **enharmonic spellings** within **G# major**.

G# major is not practical, so this is likely intended to be **Ab major**.

Let’s reinterpret.

Let’s map everything to Ab major.

- G# → Ab
- Fm/G# → F minor over G# bass → F is E# = F, G# = Ab → so chord is Ab, F, Abb (Gb), C (but Ab minor is Ab, Cb, Eb) — not matching.
  Wait, Fm = F, Ab, C
  Over Ab bass: Ab, F, Ab, C — so pitches: Ab, C, F — which is **Ab6** if we had Eb, but we don’t.

But in Ab major, Ab6 = Ab, C, Eb, F — has Eb.

Here, no Eb — has C and F.

So it's not Ab6.

But in function, it may be a **IV chord in fifth mode?**

Another idea: **F#6 to G#** is F#6 to G#, a major sixth chord to tonic.

F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D# → in G# major, this is the **IV6 chord** (IV = C#, E#, G#? No)

G# major scale: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##

So:
- I: G#
- ii: A#m
- iii: B#m
- IV: C#m
- V: D# major (D#, F##, A#) = D#, G, A#
- vi: E#m = Fm
- vii°: F#dim

Ah! Here it is.

In G# major:
- vi chord = E# minor = F minor

So **Fm = E# minor** → the vi chord in G# major.

So Fm/G# = E#m/G# — i.e., F minor in first inversion over G#, which is the tonic.

But since E#m is the vi chord in G# major, this makes sense.

Cdim/F# — C diminished = C, Eb, Gb

Is C in G# major? No. C natural = B#? B# = C.

But C# is in scale, C natural is not.

But Cdim could be chromatic.

But F# is the vii° chord in G# major.

F#dim = F#, A, C — C is natural.

F#dim = F#, A, C — in G# major, should be F#, A, C — A is Bbb? No.

G# major has F## = G, not F#.

G# major has F## (G), not F#.

So F# is not in G# major.

This is a problem.

G# major scale: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##

So F## = G

So the leading tone chord is **F##dim** = G, Bb, Db — not F#.

So F# is not in this scale.

Therefore, the chord **Cdim/F#** implies F# is in the bass.

F# = Gb, which is not in G# major.

But in **Ab major**, the scale is: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Chords:
- I: Ab
- ii: Bbm
- iii: Cm
- IV: Db
- V: Eb
- vi: Fm
- vii°: G dim

Ah! Here:

- vi = Fm
- vii° = G dim

But we have **F#dim**, not G dim.

F# = Gb, not G.

Close but not the same.

Unless it's **G dim with F#/Gb** in bass — but G dim = G, Bb, Db

Gb in bass would not be standard.

But **Cdim/F#** has F# in bass.

Another possibility: **A#m/G#** — A#m = A#, C#, E#

In Ab major, A# = Bb, so Bbm = Bb, Db, F — matches.

So A#m = Bbm

Similarly, F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D# — F# = Gb, A# = Bb, C# = Db, D# = Eb

So Gb, Bb, Db, Eb

In Ab major, this would be a **bVII6 chord** (Gb major 6th) — not diatonic.

Gb is not in Ab major.

But if the key is **E minor** or something else?

Let’s try **C# minor**.

Perhaps a better approach: the cadence F#6 to G# suggests that G# is tonic, and F#6 is acting as a subdominant or dominant.

F#6 to G# is a resolution by whole step, not strong.

But F#6 has D# = the 7th of G# chord? G# is G#, C, D#

D# is the 5th.

No leading tone.

Unless the key is **G# Dorian**.

G# Dorian: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#

So notes: G#, B, D#

So tonic chord would be G#m, not G# major.

But we have G# major.

So must be **G# Mixolydian**?

G# Mixolydian: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#

1 2 3 4 5 6 b7

So b7 = F#

F# appears.

Chords:
- I: G#7 (G# dominant 7th) — but we have G# major, not 7th.
- IV: C#m
- vii°: F#dim

F#dim = F#, A, C — not in scale; scale has F#, and A#? No, A is not in scale; scale has A#.

G# Mixolydian: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#

So F#dim would require A and C, but A is not in scale (has A#), so not.

But if we allow chromaticism, perhaps.

The chord Cdim/F# = F# in bass, C, Eb, Gb

F# to C is a diminished fifth, etc.

But in the context, after two Fm/G# (Ab, C, F), we have Cdim/F# (F# C Eb Gb), then A#m/G# (G# A# C# F)

So possible bass line: G# - C - Eb/F# - G# etc.

Not clear.

Another idea: listen to the progression or consider it's in the style of a specific song.

Fm/G# to Cdim/F# to A#m/G# to G#

Fm/G# = G#, F, Ab, C
Cdim/F# = F#, C, Eb, Gb
A#m/G# = G#, A#, C#, F
G# = G#, C, D#

Common tone: C appears in first two.

But F# to G# is half step.

F# to G# is whole step.

Perhaps the key is **A minor** and this is in a different region.

Perhaps the key is **F# major**, and G# is a chromatic chord?

We're going in circles.

Let’s go back to cadence: **F#6 -> G#**

F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#
G# = G#, B#, D# = G#, C, D#

So voice leading:
- F# -> G# (whole step)
- A# -> ? not in G# chord
- C# -> D# in G# chord? C# to D# is whole step
- D# -> D# same

So two voices move up by whole step, one same, one up by half? A# to C is not in chord.

G# has B# = C, not C#.

B# = C.

So C# in F#6 could move to C in G# chord — that's a half step down.

So:
- F# -> G# (up 2 semitones)
- A# -> ? not in G# chord; G# has G#, C, D# — so A# could resolve to G# or C
- C# -> C (down 1)
- D# -> D# (same)

So possible.

And D# is common tone.

This suggests a cadence, but not a standard V-I.

F# is the #IV of G#? G# to C## = D, not C#.

No.

Another possibility: the mode is **G# Ionian (major)**, and the Cdim/F# is a passing chord, and Fm/G# is the vi chord in first inversion.

But earlier we saw that F# is not in G# major; it's F##.

So unless the spelling is theoretical, it's very sharp.

The only practical possibility is that the key is **Ab major**.

Let’s assume that and map:

- G# -> Ab
- Fm/G# -> F minor over Ab -> Ab, F, Ab, C -> Ab6 add6 no 5? But in Ab, Fm is vi, so Fm/Ab = vi in first inversion
- Cdim/F# -> Cdim with F# in bass; F# = Gb, so Cdim/Gb -> C, Eb, Gb with Gb in bass = second inversion Cdim
  - In Ab, C is iii chord, but diminished? No, in major, iii is minor.
  - So not diatonic.
- A#m/G# -> A# = Bb, so Bbm with Ab in bass = Bbm/Ab
  - Bbm = ii in Ab major, so ii in first inversion? No, Ab is the 7th, so bass is 7th below.
  - Bbm/Ab = Ab, Bb, Db, F — so chord is Bbm, Ab bass.
  - Ab is the b7 of Bb, so it's Bbm7/Ab.
  - In jazz, common.
- F#6 -> F# = Gb, so Gb6 = Gb, Bb, Db, Eb — in Ab major, this is bVII6 (flat subtonic sixth) — common in rock/ pop.
- Then to Ab.

So progression:
Ab (I)
Ab
Fm/Ab (vi6)
Fm/Ab
Cdim/Gb (III diminished in second inversion)
Bbm/Ab (ii7 in third inversion)
Ab
Ab
Fm/Ab
Fm/Ab
Ab
Ab
Gb6
Ab

Now, Cdim/Gb = C, Eb, Gb with Gb bass — in Ab, C is the third degree, but should be C minor, not diminished.

So Cdim is chromatic.

But it could be a passing chord between Fm and Bbm.

Fm = F, Ab, C
Cdim = C, Eb, Gb
Bbm = Bb, Db, F

So from C to Eb is +1, and Gb, etc.

In voice leading, it works as a chromatic passing diminished chord.

And Gb6 (bVII6) to I is a cadence in mixolydian or popular music.

Moreover, the frequent use of Ab, and the final cadence bVII6 -> I, is very characteristic of **major keys in pop music**.

Therefore, despite the spelling, the key is **Ab major**, and the mode is **Ionian**.

The unusual spelling (G# instead of Ab, F# instead of Gb, A# instead of Bb) is due to a preference for sharp keys or a specific theoretical context, but the harmony is Ab major.

**Final Answer:**
- **Key: Ab major**
- **Mode: Ionian**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#. I need to figure out the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down step by step.

First, I should list out all the chords without the slash notations to see the root notes. So, the chords are: G#, G#, Fm, Fm, Cdim, A#m, G#, G#, Fm, Fm, G#, G#, F#6, G#. But the slashes indicate bass notes, so the actual chords might be inversions or different voicings. For example, Fm/G# means an F minor chord with G# in the bass. That might be important because the bass note can influence the perceived harmony.

Let me write out each chord's full structure considering the bass note:

- G# (could be G# major or G# minor? But usually a single note with no qualifier might mean major, but in context, it's probably the root chord. Wait, but in chord progressions, a single letter like G# usually means G# major unless specified otherwise. But let's check the context.)

Wait, but the progression has "G# G#", which might be two G# chords, likely G# major. Then "Fm/G#" – that's F minor with G# bass. So it's not F minor in root position; it's inverted. Similarly, "Cdim/F#" is diminished chord on C with F# bass. "A#m/G#" is A# minor with G# bass. "F#6" is F# major with a 6th added, which is usually F# A# C# D#? Wait, F#6 would be F# A# C# D#, so the 6th is D#.

But to find the key, I need to see which scale these chords fit into. Let's list all the root notes of the chords, ignoring the slashes for mode/key analysis, but considering the bass notes might hint at the root.

Wait, perhaps it's better to list the actual chords including the bass notes as part of the chord, but actually, the slashes mean the bass note is that note, but the chord itself has a specific quality. For example, Fm/G# means the chord is F minor, and the bass note is G#. So the full chord would be G# as the lowest note, then F minor triad above: G#, A#, C, E (since F minor is F Ab C, but with G# bass? Wait, F minor chord is F, Ab, C. If the bass is G#, then the notes would be G#, F, Ab, C. But that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe the chord is in first or second inversion. Let's see:

Fm in first inversion would be Ab, C, F (so root on Ab, but that's not the case here). Wait, Fm/G# means the chord is F minor but with G# in the bass. So the notes are G#, F, Ab, C. Because F minor chord is F, Ab, C. So if the bass is G#, then the notes are G# (bass), then F, Ab, C above it. So that's a G# root with other notes, but the chord quality might be something else. Let's see what chord that is. G#, F, Ab, C – but Ab is the same as G#, wait no. G# and Ab are enharmonically equivalent? Wait, G# is the same as Ab. Wait, G# is a note, and Ab is the same pitch, but depending on context. But in terms of spelling, they're different. However, in actual notes, they are the same physical note. Wait, but Fm/G# – the bass is G#, and the chord is F minor. So the F minor chord is F, Ab, C. But with G# in the bass, so the notes would be G#, F, Ab, C. But G# and Ab are the same pitch, but we have to write them as different names? No, they're enharmonic. If the bass is G#, then the chord contains G#, and then F, Ab, C. Wait, but G# is enharmonic to Ab. So maybe it's more accurate to think of the chord as having notes: Ab (since G# is Ab), F, Ab, C. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct way is to see what chord is formed when the bass note is G# and the chord is Fm. So the notes in the chord (including bass) are G#, F, Ab, C. Wait, but Ab and G# are the same pitch. So if the bass is G#, then the notes are G#, F, Ab, C. But Ab and G# are the same, so it's redundant. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to think of the chord as an F minor triad with G# in the bass, which is the same as saying the chord has a root of G# and various extensions, but it's called Fm/G#. Alternatively, maybe the chord is a G# major with some alterations, but no. Typically, Fm/G# means F minor chord with G# bass, so the actual chord notes would have G# at the bottom, then F, Ab, C (but Ab is the same as G#? No. F minor chord is F, Ab, C. So if bass is G#, then the notes are G# (lowest), then F, Ab, C above. But Ab is a different note from G#. Let's get their notes straight:

G# (G sharp) = the note above G, which is equivalent to Ab.

Ab is the same as G# in pitch, just different spelling.

So if the chord is Fm/G#, the bass note is G# (which is Ab), so the notes would be:

- Bass: G# (which is Ab)

- F

- Ab (but wait, Ab is the same as G#, so that's confusing)

Wait, no. If the chord is F minor, which is F, Ab, C. So if we have G# as the bass note, that would mean the chord has G# as the lowest note. So the notes would be G#, F, Ab, C. But since G# and Ab are the same pitch, that's a problem. Wait, no. G# is the note above F natural. Wait, let's list all the notes in order.

Wait, G# is a specific pitch. Ab is another name for the same pitch. So when we say Fm/G#, the chord consists of F, Ab, C with G# as the bass. But F, Ab, C – the Ab is the same as G#? No. Wait, Ab is the same as G#? Yes! Because in equal temperament, Ab and G# are the same note. So if the bass note is G# (which is Ab), then the F minor chord has a bass note of Ab. So let's redo that. Fm chord is F, Ab, C. If the bass is Ab, then the chord in first inversion would be Ab in the bass, then C and F. But Ab, C, F is F minor in first inversion. So Fm in first inversion is Ab, C, F written as Fm/Ab. So in this case, Fm/G# would be the same as Fm/Ab, since G# is Ab. So the bass note is Ab. So the chord is F minor in first inversion, with Ab in the bass.

But depending on how it's spelled, Fm/G# is equivalent to Fm/Ab. So perhaps the chord is better written as Fm/Ab. So in that case, the bass note is Ab, and the chord is F minor.

Similarly, Cdim/F# – C diminished chord with F# in the bass. So Cdim is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass, so notes are F#, C, Eb, Gb. But F# is enharmonic to Gb? In some contexts, yes. Gb and F# are the same pitch. So if the bass is F#, then the chord Cdim/F# would be F#, C, Eb, Gb. But Gb and F# are equivalent, so maybe the notes are F#, C, Eb, F#? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's see: Cdim chord is C, Eb, Gb. So if bass is F#, then the notes are F# (bass), C, Eb, Gb. But since F# is the same as Gb, then Gb in the chord is the same as the bass note F#, but the bass is F# and the chord has Gb, which is the same. So maybe it's F# as the bass, and F# C Eb. But that's a diminished triad on F#, but with root on F#? Wait, F# dim chord would be F#, A, C. No, wait: a diminished triad is root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th. So F# dim triad = F#, A, C. But that's different.

Wait, Cdim is C, Eb, Gb. If the bass is F#, then the notes are F# (bass), C, Eb, Gb. Since Gb is the same scale degree as F#, it's a bit confusing. But F# and Gb are enharmonically same. So the chord Cdim/F# would have F# as the bass, and the same pitch as Gb in the chord. So the chord would contain F# (as bass and as Gb component), which doesn't make much sense. Maybe this needs a different approach.

Perhaps instead of looking at the slash chords as individual chords, we can think of the bass notes and the chord qualities, then see what key they fit into.

Let's list the progression step by step, considering the bass notes:

The progression is: G#, G#, Fm/G#, Fm/G#, Cdim/F#, A#m/G#, G#, G#, Fm/G#, Fm/G#, G#, G#, F#6, G#.

So the bass notes are:

First two: G#

Then two of Fm/G# → bass G#

Then Cdim/F# → bass F#

Then A#m/G# → bass G#

Then two G#, two Fm/G# (bass G#), two G#, and then F#6 (bass F#), G#.

Wait, F#6 – usually the bass note would be F# unless specified, so F#6 would have bass F#.

So the bass line would be: G#, G#, G#, G#, F#, G#, G#, G#, G#, G#, G#, F#, G#.

Hmm, the bass line seems to be mostly G# and F# with some repetition.

Now, let's think about the key. Let's consider what key has G# or A flat as the tonic. Alternatively, since G# and Ab are enharmonic, maybe the key is Ab major or something.

But let's list all the chord root notes. Let's ignore the slashes for a moment and look at the chord qualities:

- G# : likely G# major (G# B# D#?), since G# major is G#, B#, D#. Wait, but if it's a single "G#" it might be just the root, but usually written as G# maj or G#.

Wait, but often when a single letter is used without modifier, it's major. So G# is G# major chord.

Then Fm/G# – which is F minor with G# bass, so F minor chord (F, Ab, C), but bass G# (which is Ab).

Then Cdim/F# – C diminished with F# bass. Cdim is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass.

A#m/G# – A# minor chord (A#, C#, E#) but bass G#.

F#6 – F# major with added 6th, so F#, A#, C#, D#.

But let's see if we can analyze this in terms of common keys.

Let's consider the key of A minor, or perhaps G# minor, but that's a bit messy with sharps. Since the chords have a lot of F minor, Cdim, etc.

Wait, Cdim is also known as the diminished chord of certain scales. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's look at the notes of each chord.

Let's list all the chords in the progression:

- G#: likely G# major = G#, B#, D# (B# is C natural)

- Fm/G#: F minor chord (F, Ab, C) with G# bass. So the chord contains G#, F, Ab, C. But Ab = G#, so actually the bass G# is same as Ab. So the chord has G# (bass), F, Ab (which is same as G#), but that seems redundant. Wait, perhaps the actual notes are G#, F, Ab, C. Wait, Ab is G#, so the notes would be G#, F, G#, C. Which is a bit confusing. Maybe better to write enharmonically. Let's choose to write in key of G major, but wait.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is C minor or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's take the bass notes and see what key they might outline.

The bass line is mostly G# followed by F#. The progression has bass notes as G#. Let's see:

Bass notes: G#, G#, G#, G#, F#, G#, G#, G#, G#, G#, G#, F#, G#

So the bass line is a bit repetitive: G# for many bars, then F#, then G#, then F#...

So the bass is going between G# and F#.

Now, what key has both G# and F#? Well, if the key is G# major, the scale is G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F## (but that's complicated, with double sharps). Alternatively, the key could be A flat major, which is Easier. A flat major has Bb, Db, Eb, etc.

Wait, let's consider if the key is Ab major. Let's check the scales.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Now, let's check the chords in the progression against that.

But wait, the bass notes: G# is the same as Ab. If the bass note is G#, in Ab major that's the tonic. So if the bass is Ab (notated as G#), then that's the tonic.

Similarly, F# would be the same as Gb. In Ab major, Gb isn't a diatonic note; Ab major has Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So the note G natural, not Gb. So F# (Gb) is not in Ab major.

Alternatively, if the key is G# minor. Let's check G# minor. The natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Yes, natural minor of G# would have F# as the 7th scale degree. So let's see.

G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Now, let's see what chords fit in this key.

But the progression has Fm/G#, which is F minor with G# bass. Let's see F minor – F, Ab, C. In G# minor scale, what notes are present?

G# minor notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

F natural is not in this scale. Wait, F natural is lower than F#. So F natural would be outside the scale. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Ab major scale instead. Ab major has scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

If we consider the key of Ab major, then the chords would be:

Ab major (tonic), Bb minor, C minor, Db major, Eb major, F minor, G diminished.

But looking at the chords in the progression: G# major (same as Ab major), Fm – in Ab major scale, F minor would be the vi chord. So Fm is diatonic. A#m – A# is Bb in Ab major. So A# minor would be Bb minor, which in Ab major is the ii chord? Wait, in Ab major, the chords are:

i: Ab

ii: Bb minor

iii: C minor

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: F minor

vii°: G diminished

So yes. So if the key is Ab major, then F minor is vi. A#m is Bb minor, because A# is Bb. Cdim would be the vii chord, which is G diminished. But wait, in the progression, there's a Cdim/F# chord. Let's see.

In Ab major, the vii° chord is G diminished chord (G, Bb, Db), but in 1st inversion or something.

Cdim chord: C, Eb, Gb. Wait, in the key of Ab major, the diminished chord is vii° which is G°. So G°. But in the progression, there's a Cdim chord. If we're in Ab major, Cdim would be non-diatonic. Hmm, unless it's a different key.

Wait, perhaps we need to see where F# comes into play. Let's look at the chords:

If key is A minor, natural minor: A B C D E F G. But no, A minor has no sharps, but the progression has G#s. Maybe A# minor, but that's complicated.

Wait, another approach: let's list all the notes used in the entire progression. Let's see the actual notes in each chord.

For each chord instance:

- G# major chord: G#, B#, D#

- Fm/G#: bass G#, then F, Ab, C. So notes are G#, F, Ab (which is G#), C. So the actual notes are G# (twice), F, C.

Wait, but Ab and G# are the same note, so the chord Fm/G# has notes: G#, F, Ab (same as G#), C → so G#, F, C. Because Ab is same as G#. So perhaps it's a chord that has G#, F, C.

But that would be G# minor seventh? Not sure. Alternatively, if Fm/G# – F minor triad with G# bass. So the notes would be G# (bass), then the F minor triad in inversion. So F minor triad is F, Ab, C. But with G# in the bass, so the notes are G#, F, Ab, C. But Ab and G# are same pitch, so only three distinct notes: G#, F, C. But G# is bass, which is the same as Ab. So it's Ab, F, C. Wait, Ab as bass note, then F and C. So that's a chord: Ab - F - C. Which is Ab major with 11th? No, Ab, C, F is Ab major chord, but that's not. Wait, Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. But here we have Ab (as G#), F, C. So the notes are Ab, C, F. Which is a chord with Ab root, C and F. So Ab is root, then C is major third, and F is perfect fourth? So an Ab major(add11), or sometimes written as Absus4. But not sure. Alternatively, it could be a F minor triad over Ab bass, but F minor in first inversion is Ab, C, F. Yes! Yes, that's correct. Fm in first inversion is Ab, C, F. So Fm/G# would be equivalent to Fm/Ab, where the bass is Ab (same as G#). So Fm in first inversion has Ab as the bass note. So the chord is Ab/C/F → but it's F minor chord in first inversion.

Similarly, Cdim/F# – C diminished triad (C, Eb, Gb) with F# bass. If F# is bass, then notes are F#, C, Eb, Gb. But Gb and F# are enharmonic. So if Gb is written as F#, but the bass is F# and the chord has Gb which is same note, then the chord would have F# as bass, and then C, Eb, and F# again. That seems odd. Alternatively, it's a different chord.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is something like C# minor or B major. Let's think.

Another way: the chord F#6 – F# major with added 6th. So F#, A#, C#, D#. That's a common chord in F# major key or D# minor.

Wait, let's check the F#6 chord: F# (root), A# (major third), C# (perfect fifth), D# (major sixth). So F# major triad with 6th.

If the progression has F#6 and other chords, maybe the key is F# major or D# minor.

Let's try F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Wait, E# is F. But F# major has E# (which is F), so scale notes: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

But in the progression, there is an A#m chord. A# minor would be A#, C#, E#. Which is diatonic to F# major, since in F# major, the ii chord is G# minor; iii is A# minor; IV is B major; V is C# major; vi is D# minor; vii° is E# diminished.

Wait, A# minor in F# major scale would be the iii chord.

Now let's see:

F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Chords:

i: F# major

ii: G# minor

iii: A# minor

IV: B major

V: C# major

vi: D# minor

vii°: E# diminished (which is F diminished)

Now, the progression's chords:

- G#: which in F# major would be the ii chord (G# minor), but the chord here is written as "G#", which if it's just G#, it could be G# minor. Wait, but the progression starts with G# G#... which in F# major would be ii chord.

- Fm/G#: F minor chord. But F in F# major scale is E# (which is the 7th degree), so F natural would not be diatonic. Wait, F natural instead of E#? Because E# is F natural. In F# major, the 7th note is E#, which is enharmonic to F natural. So actually, F natural is the same as E# in the key. Hmm.

So if the key is F# major, then the E# is F natural. So in the chord Fm – F minor – which would be F, Ab, C. But in F# major, Ab would be G# (since Ab is G#), but wait, in F# major scale, Ab isn't present; the scale has F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Wait, Ab would be enharmonic to G#, but in F# major, the scale doesn't have Ab. So if Fm chord is present, that would be a minor chord starting on F natural. Which in F# major scale, this is not diatonic. Because the note F is represented as E# in F# major scale, but the chord Fm would contain F natural (same as E#), which is a diatonic note. Wait, but E# is the 7th degree of F# major. But a chord built on F natural would be the chord starting on E#, but as E# minor? Hmm, getting confusing.

Let's take a step back. Let's look at the actual notes present:

- G# major chord: G#, B#, D# (B# = C natural)

- Fm/G#: F minor (F, Ab, C) with bass G#. Notes: G#, F, Ab, C → note that Ab = G#, so bass G# and chord has Ab (same note), so the notes are G#, F, C.

- Cdim/F#: C dim (C, Eb, Gb) with bass F#. Notes: F#, C, Eb, Gb. But Gb=F#, so same note. So notes F#, C, Eb.

- A#m/G#: A# minor chord (A#, C#, E#) with bass G#. So notes G#, A#, C#, E#.

- F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#.

- And repeated G#.

Hmm. Let's list all possible notes present:

From G# major: G#, B#, D# (B#=C)

From Fm/G# (with bass G#): G#, F, Ab (same as G#?), C. So actually G#, F, C. But F is F natural. Ab is G#, but in terms of pitch it's the same. So the actual pitches: G#, C, F.

But F is F natural, and G# is the sharp. So in terms of actual frequencies:

F is about 174.61 Hz, G# is about 207.65 Hz, etc.

From Cdim/F#: F#, C, Eb.

From A#m/G#: G#, A#, C#, E# (E#=F)

So notes: G#, A#, C#, F.

From F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#.

So compiling all the notes used:

- G# (same as Ab)

- B# (C)

- D#

- F (natural)

- Ab (same as G#)

- C (natural)

- F#

- Eb (same as D#)

- A#

- E# (F natural)

Wait, E# is F natural. So when we have E#, that's actually F natural.

So let's list the distinct pitches:

- F natural

- F#

- Eb (or D#)

- G#

- B# (C natural)

- D#

- C natural (same as B#)

- A#

Wait, getting messy. Let's collect all unique pitches:

Considering F natural, G#, A#, B natural (B# is C), D#, C#, Eb (D#), F#, etc.

Wait, maybe better to list in semitones:

F = 5 (if C=4)

Wait, perhaps better to use absolute values.

Let's assign numbers to the pitches (A=0, A#=1, B=2, C=3, Db=3, C#=4, D=5, Eb=6, D#=7, E=8, F=9, Gb=9, F#=10, G=11, Ab=12? No. Better to use standard note numbers.

Standard pitch class numbers:

C = 0

C# = 1

D = 2

D# = 3

E = 4

F = 5

F# = 6

G = 7

G# = 8

A = 9

A# = 10

B = 11

So pitch class numbers:

F natural = 5

F# = 6

G# = 8

A# = 10

C = 0

D# = 3

E# = F = 5

B# = C = 0

So from the chords:

- G# major: G#=8, B#=11? Wait, wait no.

Wait, the G# major chord consists of G#, B#, D#.

G# pitch class: 8

B# is the same as C natural (0) because B# = C. But wait, in pitch classes, B#=11+1=0 (mod 12), since B is 11, so B# is 0.

Similarly, D# is 3.

So G# major chord: 8, 0, 3.

Fm/G# chord: Fm is F=5, Ab (G#=8? No: Ab is A♭ which is pitch class 8? No. Wait Ab is A-flat, which is 8 (since A=9, Ab=8). Yes.

Standard:

A = 9

Ab = 8

A# = 10

B = 11

C = 0

C# = 1

...

So Fm chord (F minor): F=5, Ab=8, C=0.

With bass G#=8.

So chord notes: bass G#=8, then F=5, Ab=8, C=0. So pitches present: 8 (bass), 5, 0.

Cdim/F#: Cdim chord is C=0, Eb=3, Gb=6 (since Gb=8? No: G natural is 7, Gb=6. Because G=7, so Gb=6. Yes. So Cdim = 0, 3, 6. With bass F#=6. So the chord is F#=6 as bass, then C=0, Eb=3, Gb=6. So pitches: 6, 0, 3.

A#m/G#: A# minor chord is A#=10, C=0, E#=5 (since E# = F natural = 5). Bass G#=8. So chord pitches: bass 8, then A#=10, C=0, E#=5.

F#6: F#=6, A#=10, C#=1, D#=3. Wait, F#6: F# root, major third is A# (10), fifth is C# (1+4=5? Wait, correct: F# major chord: F#=6, A#=10, C#=1? Wait no. Wait:

F# major: root F#=6

Major third is A#=10 (since F# to A#: 4 semitones up? Wait F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10. Yes, so 4 semitones from F# to A#.

F# to C#: F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11, C=0, C#=1. So that's 5 semitones from F# to C#, which is perfect fifth. So F# major is 6, 10, 1.

Now F#6 adds the 6th, which is D#: 3 (F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11, C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3). Yes. So F#6 is: 6, 10, 1, 3.

So compiling all pitch classes used in the entire progression:

From G# major: 8, 0, 3 (but wait in G# major chord: G#=8, B#=11? No, wait. Wait, G# major: G#=8, B#= (G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11, so B#=C natural=0), and D#=3.

Wait, yes: G# major chord is G# (8), B# (which is C natural, pitch class 0), D# (3).

So pitches 8, 0, 3.

Fm/G#: bass 8, and chord Fm (F=5, Ab=8, C=0). So pitches: 8,5,0.

Cdim/F#: bass 6, chord Cdim=0,3,6 → pitches 0,3,6.

A#m/G#: bass 8, A# minor chord (A#=10, C=0, E#=5 (since E#=F natural=5). So pitches 10,0,5.

F#6: 6, 10, 1, 3.

The F#6 also has C#=1 and D#=3.

Looking at all pitch classes used:

- 0 (C)

- 1 (C#)

- 3 (D#)

- 5 (F)

- 6 (F#)

- 8 (G#)

- 10 (A#)

Are there others? Let's see:

From F#6, there's also D#=3. So the pitch classes present are 0,1,3,5,6,8,10.

Now, what scale can contain these notes?

Let's see. Possible keys:

Let's check G# minor. G# natural minor scale: G#=8, A#=10, B=11, C#=1, D#=3, E=4, F#=6.

But in our list we have 0 (C), which isn't in G# minor. G# minor has C# (1), not C natural (0). So that's a problem. The scale would be G# 8, A# 10, B 11, C# 1, D# 3, E 4, F# 6. So no 0 (C natural). So if there are Cs (pitch class 0), which is C natural, then it's outside G# minor natural.

Similarly, G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F# → wait harmonic minor has raised 7th, so F## (G natural), but let's see:

Natural minor: 8,10,11,1,3,4,6.

Harmonic minor: raise 7th, so F#=6 to F##=G=7. So scale: 8,10,11,1,3,4,7.

Still no C natural (0). So probably not.

How about A minor? A minor natural: A=9, B=11, C=0, D=2, E=4, F=5, G=7.

Our scale has 0 (C), 5 (F), 6 (F#), 8 (G#), 10 (A#), also 1 (C#), 3 (D#), which A minor doesn't have. So no.

How about F minor? F natural minor: F=5, G=7, Ab=8, Bb=10, C=0, Db=2, Eb=3. So scale: pentatonic notes: 5,7,8,10,0,2,3.

But our progression has pitch classes: 0,1,3,5,6,8,10. F natural minor has 0,2,3,5,7,8,10. Missing 1 and 6. But we have C# (1) and F# (6), which are not in F minor natural.

F harmonic minor: F G Ab Bb C Db E.

Scale: 5,7,8,10,0,3,11.

Still no 1 (C#), and has E=11.

F melodic minor: F G Ab Bb C D E.

Which has D=2, E=4.

So still no match.

Another approach: look at the pitch classes present: 0 (C), 1 (C#), 3 (D#), 5 (F), 6 (F#), 8 (G#), 10 (A#).

This seems like a chromatic mess? Not sure. Wait, perhaps this scale is part of some mode of major or minor. Wait, but let's see if there's a key that fits most of these.

Notice that F#, G#, A#, C major? No.

Wait, look at the chord F#6: includes F#, A#, C#, D#. So notes: 6,10,1,3.

And we have G# major (8,0,3), but wait G# major is G#, B#, D# → 8, 0, 3 (B#=0 since B#=C).

Wait, but G# major chord contains C natural and D#, which are part of the progression.

But also F (pitch 5), which is in Fm chord.

Let me try to see which key could contain all these. Let's see the notes:

We have C natural (0), C# (1), D# (3), F (5), F# (6), G# (8), A# (10).

This is a lot of semitones. Let's list all notes present:

C, C#, D#, E (wait, we don't have E? Or E?=F=5. A#=10, so Ab=8, G#=8? A#=10. F=5.

Wait, is there a note E? Pitch class 4. We don't seem to have that. We have E# which is pitch 5. So probably no E.

So notes in chromatic order:

C (0), C# (1), D# (3), F (5), F# (6), G# (8), A# (10).

Missing D (2), E (4), G (7), A (9), B (11), etc.

This doesn't look like standard keys. Maybe it's not using a standard major/minor scale but perhaps a different mode or key.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these chords are functioning as substitutes or modal interchange.

Wait, let's look at the chord types. We have Fm/G# which is F minor with G# bass. As mentioned earlier, that's Ab (G#) as bass with F minor triad, so it's F minor in first inversion: Ab, C, F.

Cdim/F# is C diminished with F# bass, which would be F# (Gb), C, Eb. So Gb, C, Eb → which is the same as F# half-diminished? Not sure.

Wait, but another idea: let's see if there's a tonic note that many chords resolve to. Looking at the progression, it starts and ends with G#, and repeats G# frequently, suggesting G# is the tonic.

So if the key is G# major or G# minor.

G# major scale: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##.

But F## is G natural. So scale: G# Ab? No, G# major is G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F## (which is G natural).

But F## is G. So chord F## is G natural.

But in the progression, there's F natural (F), which is Eb? No, F natural is different from E#.

Wait, in G# major scale, E# is the 7th degree of G# major (since G# major: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##), so E# is the 6th step? Let's check:

G# (1), A# (2), B# (3), C# (4), D# (5), E# (6), F## (7).

But E# is F natural. So in G# major scale, the 6th degree is E# (F natural), 7th is F## (G).

Now, the chord Fm/G# – F minor. F is pitch 5, but in G# major scale, F natural isn't a scale degree; the scale has E# (F natural), but that's the 6th degree. However, F minor chord would be built on F natural, which is part of the scale as E#.

But building a minor chord on F#? No.

Wait, maybe the key is E major or something else. Let's think differently.

Another approach: look at chord qualities and their functions in various keys.

For example, in the chord progression, there's a Cdim chord, which is a diminished triad. Diminished chords often function as vii° in minor keys.

Also, Fm could be in certain keys.

Wait, if it's G# minor, natural minor scale would be G# minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Let's see what chords fit.

i: G# minor

ii°: A# diminished

III: B major

iv: C# minor

v: D# minor

VI: E major

VII: F# major.

But the progression has Fm – which would be F minor. But in G# natural minor scale, F# is present, not F natural. So F natural would be outside. But our progression includes F natural (Fm chord has F and Ab and C).

Wait, but if the key is F# minor. Let's check.

F# minor natural: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E.

Chords:

i: F# minor

ii°: G# diminished

III: A major

iv: B minor

v: C# minor

VI: D major

VII: E major.

But our progression has a Cdim chord, which would be C diminished. But in F# minor, the scale has C# and D natural. So C natural would be outside. Hmm.

Wait, but if it's F# harmonic minor: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E#.

Scale: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E#.

Chords:

i: F#m

ii°: G# dim

III+: A augmented

iv: Bm

v: C#m

VI: D major

VII: E# major.

But we have a Cdim – if it's C diminished chord, which is C, Eb, Gb. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is A major, but doesn't fit.

Wait, let's look at the bass notes and see what the progression might be.

Bass line steps:

G# - G# - G# - G# - F# - G# - ...

This suggests that the bass is moving from G# to F#. G# to F# is a half step down. So if it's moving between G# and F#, maybe it's a G# minor or G# major context where the tonic is G#.

In G# minor scale, the chord on the 7th degree is F# major. But if there's a bass descent G# to F#, maybe the F# is the dominant or something.

Wait, another idea: let's look at the chord A#m/G# – A# minor, bass on G#. What's that chord? A# minor with G# bass. So the notes are G#, A#, C#, E# (F).

This is the same as what we had before. A#m over G# bass.

In G# minor scale, the scale has A# as the second degree. So A#m would be the ii chord. So in G# natural minor:

G#m (i), A#dim (ii°), Bmaj (III), C#m (iv), D#m (v), Emaj (VI), F#maj (VII).

But wait, in natural minor, ii is diminished. So A#m would not be diatonic. It should be A# diminished chord.

So that's odd. If there's a A#m in G# minor, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the key is E minor.

E minor natural: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

But chords here: E minor, F# diminished, G major, A minor, B minor, C major, D major. Not matching the progression chords.

Wait, trying to find a key where Fm is a diatonic chord.

Fm is in D major (vi chord), but D major scale is D E F# G A B C#.

Hmm.

Alternatively, consider the chords: G# major, Fm, Cdim, F#6.

Another angle: look for common chord progressions.

For example, a progression like i VI ii iii or something. But not sure.

Wait, let's suppose the key is A# minor. That would be very sharp, but let's see.

A# minor natural: A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##, G## (but this is messy).

A# minor: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#.

Wait, natural minor scale: root, whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole.

A# minor: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#.

Scale degrees:

i: A#m

ii°: B dim

III: C#m

iv: D#m

v: Em

VI: F#m

VII: G#maj.

Hmm, not sure. In this scale, F#m would be the VI chord.

But in our progression, there's an F#6 chord. F#6 would be in F# major, but in A# minor scale, the VI chord is F# minor, so F# minor chord. But F#6 is major with added 6th, which might fit if it's a major chord, but in A# minor it's supposed to be minor.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe we should think about the chords and see what key has those chords.

The chord F#6 is often found in D major or D minor (as the IV or IVm chord), but D major is D E F# G A B C#.

Wait, but in that scale, F# is a major chord.

Alternatively, the chord progression has several G# chords, suggesting G# is tonic. So let's proceed with that.

Assume key is G# major.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F## (which is G natural).

The chord G# major would be tonic.

Fm – what is F in this scale? F is part of E# (since E# = F natural). In G# major scale, E# is the sixth degree. So E# is part of the scale, but F natural is just E#.

But a chord Fm is built on F natural. In terms of scale degrees, that would be building a chord on the 6th degree, which is E# major in the scale? No, G# major chord on E# would be E# major, but that's the sixth chord.

But Fm chord would have F, Ab, C. In G# major scale, the note Ab is G#? No, Ab is a different note. In G# major, the scale has F## (G natural) as the 7th degree. So Ab would be a chromatic note.

Hmm.

Another idea: perhaps the key is E flat major (E♭ major), which has flats, but let's see.

E♭ major scale: E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, D♭.

But our chords have G# and F#, etc. Maybe not.

Wait, if the key is F# major.

F# major: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Scale degrees:

1: F#

2: G#

3: A#

4: B

5: C#

6: D#

7: E# (F)

Chords:

i: F#m? No, F# major chord is tonic.

Actually, F# major scale has chords:

I: F# major

II: G# minor

III: A# minor

IV: B major

V: C# major

VI: D# minor

VII: E# diminished.

So in F# major:

The iii chord is A# minor. The progression has A#m/G#. So A# minor is in the key.

Also, we have F#6 – that would be a major VI chord, but in F# major, D# minor is vi. F#6 is a possible extended chord but not typically part of the scale.

Also, G# minor would be the ii chord, but the progression starts with G# chords. Since in F# major, G# minor is ii, so starting with ii chord could make sense.

Also, Fm – in F# major, F natural is E# (7th degree, but E# is F natural). So building a chord on F natural would be the VII chord. In F# major, the VII chord is E# diminished. But Fm would be F natural minor, which is different.

Cdim – C diminished. In F# major, the scale is F# G# A# B C# D# E#.

C# is the 5th degree. C natural would be outside.

Hmm. But let's look at the chord Cdim/F#. Cdim with F# bass. If we're in F# major, Cdim is not diatonic.

Wait, another thought: the presence of an F#6 chord could be a major triad on F# with added 6th. F#6 is F# A# C# D#. In the key of B major, D# minor is the vi chord. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at the chord progression in terms of common cadences. The fact that it ends on G# might suggest G# is tonic. So let's try to see what chords can be in G# minor.

G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Chords:

i: G# minor

ii°: A# diminished

III: B major

iv: C# minor

v: D# minor

VI: E major

VII: F# major

G# harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

So the VII chord would be F## major, but in harmonic minor, the VII is major.

G# melodic minor ascending: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F##.

Descending is natural minor.

But our progression has Fm (F minor), which would not be in G# minor.

Unless there's chord substitutions. A #m/G# – A# minor. In G# minor, the second degree is diminished, not minor.

Another idea: perhaps this progression is in C# minor. Let's see.

C# minor natural: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B.

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III: E major

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A major

VII: B major.

Hmm, in C# minor, v chord is G# minor. If the progression has G# major chords, but in C# minor, G# minor would be the v chord. But if there's G# major, that would be a borrowed chord.

C# minor with a major V chord (G# major), which is common in harmonic minor.

So C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#.

So scale: C# D# E F# G# A B#.

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III+: E augmented

iv: F#m

v: G# major

VI: A major

VII: B#dim.

Wait, that's a possibility. So in C# harmonic minor, the v chord is G# major. And the vi chord would be A major.

Now, looking at the progression:

G# major chord – yes, that's the v chord in C# minor harmonic.

Fm/G# – F minor in G# bass. In C# harmonic minor scale, there is an F natural? C# harmonic minor has F#, not F natural. So F natural would be chromatic.

Hmm, unless there's a modulation or non-diatonic chord.

But in C# harmonic minor, A natural (not G#), etc.

Let's see:

C# harmonic minor has notes: C# D# E F# G# A B#.

E is present.

So let's see if any chords fit.

G# major (v chord) – yes.

A#m/G# – A# minor chord. A# would be in this scale? C# scale has A natural, not A#.

A# is Bb. Doesn't fit.

F#6 chord: F# A# C# D#. In C# harmonic minor, F# is the IV chord. But F#6 would be IV chord with added sixth. Possible.

But I'm getting lost. Let's try a different method.

Let me look at each chord individually and see what they might be functioning as.

First, "G#" – likely G# major or G# minor chords. If it keeps repeating G#, maybe it's the tonic.

Then "Fm/G#" – F minor chord with G# bass. So the chord is F minor in first inversion with bass on Ab (G#), which is Ab, C, F.

" Cdim/F#" – C diminished chord with F# in bass. So notes F#, C, Eb, Gb.

" A#m/G#" – A# minor with G# bass: G#, A#, C#, E# (F).

"F#6" – F#, A#, C#, D#.

Let's see what key has all these chords. F# major? In F# major, we have C# major, G# minor, A# minor.

But the chord Fm (F natural minor) is not in F# major because F# major has F## (which is G). Wait, F# major scale notes are F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E# (F).

So yes, the E# is F natural, so F natural is present as E#.

But a chord Fm would be built on F, which in scale degree terms is the 7th degree. In F# major, the 7th degree is E# diminished chord.

But Fm chord is different.

Wait, but the chord Fm (F natural minor) would have notes F, Ab, C. Ab is G# (since G#=Ab), but in F# major scale, G# is present as the second degree.

Let's see:

F natural: E# (7th degree in F# major)

Ab: G# (second degree)

C: not sure. In F# major scale: F# G# A# B C# D# E#. So C is actually C#.

So C natural wouldn't be present. So Ab= G# is present, but C natural isn't. The scale has C#.

So for Fm chord: F (E#), Ab (G#), C (natural) – but C natural is not in F# major scale, which has C#. So C natural would be outside the scale.

Hmm. So that's problematic.

Wait, but in the chord A#m/G# we have notes G#, A#, C#, E#. Which in the chord are G# (bass), A# (root of A#m), C#, E#.

Which fits F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Yes, G# (2), A# (3), C# (5), E# (7).

So F# major scale has all these notes.

G# major chord: would require G# B# D# (B#=C natural). But F# major scale has C# as the 5th degree. B# is C natural, which isn't in the scale. The scale has B natural as the 4th degree. Yes, F# major scale has F# G# A# B C# D# E#.

B is a natural. So G# major chord would be G# B# D#. B# is C natural. But F# major scale contains B natural, not C natural. So that would be non-diatonic.

Ah, here's the issue. The G# major chord contains B# (C natural), which is not present in F# major scale. The F# major scale has B natural (4), C# (5).

But G# as root with B# (C natural) would mean the major third is C natural. In F# major scale, the note after B natural is C#, so C natural would be flat.

So G# major chord is not diatonic to F# major.

Another idea: perhaps the key is B major.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Chords:

I: B major

II:C#m

III:D#m

IV:E major

V:F# major

VI:G#m

VII:A#dim.

In B major, the chord G#m would be vi. But if chords are G# major, then it would be non-diatonic. But progression has G# chords. Not sure.

Wait, this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me list all the chords used in the progression:

- G# (major?)

- Fm/G# (F minor, bass G#)

- Cdim/F# (Cdim, bass F#)

- A#m/G# (A# minor, bass G#)

- F#6 (F# major with sixth)

- G# repeated.

Let's look for a key where these chords make sense.

The Cdim/F# chord – Cdim with F# bass. Cdim is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass, so F#. What chord is Cdim over F#? F#, C, Eb, Gb. Which is equivalent to F# diminished seventh chord? No, diminished seventh would have a diminished fifth. Wait, F# dim7 is F# Ab C D.

But our bass is F#, C, Eb, Gb. Gb is F#, so it's F#, C, Eb, F#.

Not sure. Alternatively, F# minor 7 flat 5 or something else.

Another idea: the F# chord in bass could indicate that F# is the root of some chord, but it's part of Cdim/F#.

Perhaps the chord is Cdim7, but written as Cdim/F#, meaning F# in bass. So Cdim7 = C, Eb, Gb, Bbb (which is A), but not sure.

This is too confusing. Maybe better to think of the progression as having tonic G# and using some borrowed chords.

Wait, if the tonic is G#, then:

- G# major chord: tonic

- Fm/G#: this is F minor over G# bass. If G# is tonic, then this chord has G#-F-Ab-C. Which is G# with F, Ab, C. So G# minor with flattened 2nd, 4th? Not sure.

In G# minor (natural), the scale is G# A# B C# D# E F#.

So F natural isn't in the scale, but the chord Fm has F, which is not in the scale.

But if we consider G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F## (G natural).

So scale notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, G#.

So notes present: all with G# as root, up to G natural as seventh degree.

But a minor key has a minor seventh usually harmonic minor raises seventh to major.

But in this case, F## is G natural.

Now, the chord Fm: F natural minor. But in G# harmonic minor, F natural would be F natural, which is not present; the scale has E natural and G natural.

This isn't helping.

Maybe the key is A major. A major scale: A B C# D E F# G#.

Chords:

I: A major

II: B minor

III: C# minor

IV: D major

V: E major

VI: F# major

VII: G# diminished.

In A major, G# diminished is vii°, but our progression has G# major chords, which would be outside.

But F# major chord is vi, and if we have F#6, that may fit as a major chord. A#m/G# would be A# minor. In A major scale, A# is Bb, not present. So no.

Another idea: let's look at the chords themselves for clues. The presence of Fm and Cdim suggests possible keys like C minor or F minor.

In C natural minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb.

Chord Fm is iv.

Cdim is i° (no, diminished is vii°).

Not sure.

In F minor natural: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: G°

III: Ab major

iv: Bbm

v: Cm

VI: Db major

VII: Eb major.

But our progression has G# chords, which would be Ab in this key. So if F minor key, then G# is Ab. So Ab would be the III chord.

But the progression has "G#" as chords – if the key is F minor, then G# is Ab, so Ab major (III).

Let's try this.

Assume key is F minor.

F minor scale: F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Wait, natural minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Yes.

Scale degrees:

i: F minor

ii°: G diminished

III: Ab major

iv: Bb minor

v: C minor

VI: Db major

VII: Eb major.

Now, looking at the chord "G#": which is Ab.

So G# major chord would be Ab major chord, which is the III chord in F minor.

That fits. So G# written as Ab major chord.

Similarly, "Fm/G#": F minor with G# (Ab) bass. In the key of F minor, Fm chord, and with Ab bass – this would be first inversion of F minor (Ab, C, F), which is common.

In F minor, the ii° chord is G diminished, but here chord is Fm/G# which is Fm first inversion.

Then Cdim/F#, but in F minor scale, Cdim would be? C minor is v chord, not diminished. Wait, v chord in minor is minor, but harmonic minor would make it major or dim.

Cdim in context of F minor: if we take harmonic minor, the v chord is major. But C diminished – not sure.

But let's check Cdim/F#.

Cdim chord is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass. In F minor scale (natural), we have the chord notes:

C natural (v chord), F minor natural has C natural. Gb is Ab, which is in scale.

But F# would be outside. In F minor scale, F# would be raised.

But F natural is tonic.

F# isn't in F minor scale.

Hmm.

Wait, but Ab is G#. If the key is F minor, then Ab is the major III chord. But the chord "G#" as in F minor context would be Ab.

Another chord: A#m/G#. If key is F minor, A# is Bb. So A#m would be Bbm, which in F minor is the iv chord. But the chord is A#m/G# which is Bbm with G# bass. G# is Ab, so Bbm/Ab – which is first inversion of Bbm chord (Ab, C, Bb). Which makes sense in F minor key as iv chord in first inversion.

Cdim/F#: Cdim chord with F# bass. If in F minor, perhaps Cdim is not diatonic, but F# could be Gb, which is Ab. Wait, this is confusing.

But let's proceed:

If the key is F minor:

- G# (Ab) is the major III chord.

- Fm/G# would be Fm in first inversion, which is diatonic.

- A#m/G# – A#m is Bbm, G# is Ab, so Bbm/Ab which is iv chord in first inversion.

- Cdim/F#: If we assume F# is Gb (Ab), but F# is different. Wait, F# is not in F minor scale. Unless it's using harmonic minor.

F harmonic minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, E.

So in harmonic minor, there's E natural.

Then F# would be Gb, but not sure.

Let's see chord Cdim/F#. In F harmonic minor, C dim would be C Eb Gb. With bass F# (which is Gb). So bass Gb. So the chord would be Gb, C, Eb, Gb. Which is Gb diminished – which is the vii° chord in C minor. Not sure.

This is really tough.

Wait another idea: perhaps the key is G# minor, but using some chromaticism.

But I'm stuck. Let's try to find the most likely key based on common chords.

The presence of F#6 chord suggests the key might be related to F# major or E minor.

Wait, E minor scale: E F# G A B C D. The IV chord in E minor is A major, but F# is ii? No. Let's see.

No. Alternatively, key of B minor.

Wait, perhaps the key is F# major, which has A# minor as III chord. Let's revisit this.

F# Major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E# (F).

Chords:

I: F#

II: G#m

III: A#m

IV: B

V: C#

VI: D#m

VII: E#°

Now, the progression has:

- G# major chord? But in F# major, G# is natural minor (second degree), so G#m. But the chord is written as "G#", which might mean G# major. But in F# major scale, the G# note would be the major II chord? No, ii chord is minor. So F# natural minor is different.

Wait, no. In major scale, second chord is minor. So to have G# major, it would be a borrowed chord from another scale. Maybe parallel minor or something.

But let's assume that in F# major, G# is G# major – which would be out of scale.

But the chord A#m is in scale (III chord).

F#6 chord could be the tonic chord with added sixth. F#6 would be F# A# C# D#. Which includes the sixth D#. In F# major, the IV chord is B, V is C# major. But F#6 is not standard but possible.

Cdim/F#: Cdim (C Eb Gb) with F# bass. In F# major scale, C# is present but C natural isn't. Eb isn't in scale either (scale has D#). So this is outside.

Hmm.

Let's think of a different approach. Let's see the progression as written:

G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#

Let's write out the chord types clearly:

- G# (G# major? Or perhaps G# minor)

- Fm/G# (F minor over G#)

- Cdim/F# (C diminished over F#)

- A#m/G# (A# minor over G#)

- F#6 (F# major sixth)

Assume the key is F# minor. Wait, F# minor would have:

Scale: F# G# A B C# D E.

Chords:

i: F#m

ii°: G#°

III: A major

iv: Bm

v: C#m

VI: D major

VII: E major

Not seeing this fit.

Wait, but the chord "G#" – could be G# major, but in F# minor scale, G# chord would be the second degree which is diminished. So G#°. But if they're using G# major, it's non-diatonic.

Another idea: let's look at the bass notes again. The bass goes G# G# G# G# F# G# etc. So the bass moves from G# to F#.

This seems like a descending half-step motion: G# to F#. In many keys, that might be a dominant to tonic movement but reversed. Like in C major, moving from B to C, but here G# to F# is descending half step.

If the tonic is F#, then the chord before could be E major, but that's not here. Alternatively, maybe the tonic is G#, and F# is leading tone? But in G# minor, the VII chord is F# major. Yes!

In G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

So VII chord is F# major.

So the progression has F# and G# chords. If the VII chord is F# major, tonic is G# minor.

So let's check this key.

G# natural minor:

i: G#m

ii°: A#dim

III: B maj

iv: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E maj

VII: F# maj.

Now the chords in progression:

- G# – likely G#m chord, but written as G# (just major? Or could be minor)

- Fm/G# – F minor with G# bass. In G# minor scale, what is F?

Natural minor scale has E natural and F#.

So F natural isn't in scale. So Fm chord would be chromatic.

But what about the chord structure: Fm/G# – bass G#, notes F, Ab, C. Ab is G# in spelling? No, Ab is a different pitch.

Wait, G# major is G#, B#, D#. G# minor is G#, B, D#.

So G# minor includes B natural, not B#.

In G# natural minor, scale tones are G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

So let's see:

If we have a chord "G#", likely G# minor as tonic.

Then Fm/G# – F minor chord with G# bass. F natural and F# are different. So F is outside the scale.

However, there's a chord A#m/G#: A# minor over G# bass. In G# minor scale, A# is the second degree, which is normally diminished chord (A#dim), not minor. So A#m would be non-diatonic.

But wait, if it's G# melodic minor ascending: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F##.

Then scale has E# which is F natural, and F## which is G.

But A#m would still be ii chord, which in melodic minor ascending is minor.

In G# melodic minor ascending: the ii chord would be A#m.

Yes! In minor keys using melodic minor, the ascending form raises sixth and seventh.

G# melodic minor ascending: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F##.

So scale degrees:

i: G#m

ii: A#m

III+: B augmented

IV: C#m

V: D#maj

VI: E#maj

VII: F##m? No, VII should be diminished but in melodic minor ascending, seventh is raised.

Actually, scale is:

1. G#

2. A#

3. B (minor)

4. C#

5. D#

6. E# (raised)

7. F## (raised)

So chords:

i: G#m

ii: A#m

iii: B+ (aug)

IV: C#m (but with raised 7, IV would be minor)

V: D# major (since V chord is major for harmonic/minor)

VI: E# major

VII: F## diminished? Wait, no – in melodic minor ascending, upper part is raised, VII should be minor.

This is getting complicated, but the key point is in G# melodic minor ascending, the ii chord is A#m.

Also, the chord A#m/G# would be part of the key.

Now, what's Fm/G#: F minor with G# bass. In this scale, there's a note E# which is F natural. So F natural is the 6th degree of the scale (E#).

So F minor chord is built on the 6th degree. The iii chord in this scale would be B+.

But Fm would be the iii chord if we're using a different key.

Wait, but in G# melodic minor, sixth degree is E#, which is F. So the chord built on sixth degree would be E# (F) minor? Let's see.

Chord built on sixth degree (F): F, Ab, C. Which would be F minor. Yes! So if the scale has F natural (as E#), then a minor chord on it would be diatonic.

So in G# melodic minor ascending, the chord on VI is F minor.

Similarly, Cdim – C diminished chord. In G# melodic minor scale, what's C? C# is the IV degree. C natural not present.

Cdim would be outside.

Cdim/F# – Cdim with F# bass. F# is the VII degree of the scale? No, in G# melodic minor, seventh degree is F## (G), so F# is a chromatic note.

This is getting too involved. Let's try to see if the chord progression fits G# melodic minor.

The progression:

G# chord (tonic i)

Fm/G# – chord on VI (F minor) with G# bass.

Cdim/F# – not sure yet

A#m/G# – ii chord over G# bass

F#6 – not sure.

Another angle: F#6 as a chord. F#6 is F# A# C# D#. In G# melodic minor scale, scale has F## (G), E#, D#, C#, B. So F# note isn't in the scale – the seventh degree is F##. So F# would be a chromatic note.

Hmm.

This is really challenging. Perhaps the key is G# minor with harmonic elements.

Wait, let's think about the F# major chord. In G# minor harmonic, the VII chord is F# major (which is the dominant of F# minor or something), but tonic is G#m.

Yes. In G# harmonic minor scale, the seventh degree is raised to F## (G), so the VII chord is G major? No.

Wait, G# harmonic minor scale:

G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

So scale degrees:

1: G#

2: A#

3: B

4: C#

5: D#

6: E

7: F## (G natural)

Chords:

i: G#m

ii°: A#dim

III+: B augmented

iv: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major

VII: F##maj (G major)

So VII chord is G major.

Not F#. So F# major wouldn't be in this.

But if we had G# natural minor, VI chord is E major.

I'm not sure.

Another thought: the chord progression starts and ends with G#, so let's assume G# is tonic.

Now, the other chords:

- Fm/G# : could be iv chord in a major key, but in G# major, iv would be C#m.

Alternatively, if it's a minor key.

Wait, if G# is tonic and minor, the minor iv chord would be C#m.

But here we have Fm/G# which is different.

Perhaps the key is B major, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at all the root notes of the chords (ignoring slashes):

G#, G#, Fm (root F), Cdim (root C), A#m (root A#), F#6 (root F#), etc.

So root notes: G#, F, C, A#, F#.

This is a variety. If we look at these pitches: F, C, G#, A#, F#.

C and F – these are a perfect fourth apart.

G# and A# are a whole step apart.

F# and G# are whole step.

Not sure.

Wait, consider the chord Cdim/F# – if F# is bass of Cdim chord, then the chord is C diminished over F#. So the full chord would be Cdim as a chord with F# bass, so the root is F#, but chord is diminished. So F# has the diminished chords: F# diminished is F# A C. Not F# C Eb Gb.

Cdim (C, Eb, Gb) with bass F# makes it F# C Eb Gb. This is equivalent to an F# half-diminished seventh chord (F#m7b5), which has F#, A, C, E. No, different. F#m7b5 is F# A C E. Our chord has F#, C, Eb, Gb. Which is F#, C, Eb, Gb. This is the same as A#dim7? Not sure.

This might be a D# diminished seventh with F# bass? Not sure.

I'm stuck. Maybe the key is A# minor.

A# minor natural: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#.

So scale: A# B C# D# E F# G#.

Chords:

i: A#m

ii°: B dim

III: C#m

iv: D#m

v: E minor

VI: F# major

VII: G# major

Wait! In A# minor (which is same as Bb minor), the VII chord is G# major.

Also, the VI chord is F# major.

The progression has "G#" – which would be the VII chord (G# major).

"F#6" – F# major, which would be the VI chord.

"A#m/G#" – A# minor over G# bass. A#m is tonic chord of key, but with G# bass. So A#m/G# is first inversion of A#m – G#, B, E.

"Fm/G#" – F minor with G# bass. In A# minor key, what is F natural? Scale has F# as the VI degree's note. So F natural is outside.

Hmm.

But let's check.

A# minor scale: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#.

If there's a chord Fm, it has F natural, which isn't in scale.

But wait, if we take the A# harmonic minor, the seventh degree is raised. So A# harmonic minor: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G## (A).

But then VII chord is A major. Still didn't include F natural.

This isn't helping.

Another idea: let's think of the F#6 chord as the V chord to a key of B major. But not sure.

Wait, F#6: F# A# C# D#. This can be seen as D# minor seventh chord (D# F# A# C#), but with added 6th? No, D# minor seventh is D# F# A# C#.

But F#6 is not that.

Wait, no: F#6 chord is spelled F# A# C# D#. So the root is F#. It's F# major triad with 6th added.

If this is part of a key, maybe it's a IV chord in something.

Alternatively, if we are in E major, the IV chord is A major. Not helpful.

I'm really stuck. Let's look up common chord progressions with these chords.

Alternatively, maybe the key is C minor.

C minor scale: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb.

Chords include Fm (iv), but what about G#? G# is Ab. So in C minor, G# would be Ab which is vii chord? No.

In C natural minor, VII chord is Bb major.

Not matching.

Wait, but if key is Ab major.

Ab scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G.

Chords:

i: Ab

ii°: Bb dim

III: C minor

iv: Db

v: Eb

VI: F minor

VII: G diminished.

Now let's see:

" G#" chord: G# is Ab, so G#major would be Ab major.

"Fm/G#": F minor with Ab bass. Since Ab is tonic, F minor would be VI chord.

In Ab major, VI chord is F minor. Yes.

Cdim/F#: C diminished. In Ab major scale, C minor is the iii chord, but diminished? No. C diminished isn't diatonic.

Wait, Cdim chord: C Eb Gb. In Ab major, Gb is F#? No, scale has G natural. So Cdim would be non-diatonic.

But chord A#m/G#: A#m is Bbm in Ab scale. Bbm is iv chord. G# is Ab bass, so Bbm/Ab: first inversion iv chord.

F#6 chord: F# is not in Ab major scale; scale has F natural.

But F# is the #5 or something.

This seems closer.

In Ab major:

- Tonic: Ab

- VI: F minor

- iv: Bbm

So if the progression is played in Ab major:

- G# (which is Ab) would be tonic.

- Fm/G# – F minor over Ab bass. F minor is VI chord, with Ab bass, so this is first inversion? F minor chord is F Ab C. With Ab bass → Ab, F, C. Exactly. So Fm/G# is VI chord in first inversion.

- Cdim/F#: C diminished with F# bass. In Ab major, F# would be Gb, which isn't in scale. So not sure.

- A#m/G# – A# minor is Bbm chord. Over Ab bass → Bbm in first inversion (Ab, C, Bb).

- F#6 chord in Ab major? F# isn't in scale.

Hmm.

But if it's in Ab major, but using F# as a modulation or chromatic. Maybe.

But F# would be a chromatic note. F# is the #2 in Ab.

Not sure.

Let's check the Cdim/F# chord. If key is Ab major, Cdim is not diatonic. Cdim = C Eb Gb. In Ab scale, Eb is present.

Gb would be F#, which is not diatonic.

Alternatively, if the chord is Cdim7, which is C Eb Gb Bbb (which is A), but not sure.

Another approach: let's list all the intervals.

But I think the most plausible key is Ab major, interpreting G# as Ab.

Because:

- The chords fit if we read G# as Ab.

So "G#" chord is Ab major.

"Fm/G#" – F minor chord with Ab bass, which is VI chord (Fm) in Ab major, first inversion.

"Cdim/F#" – perhaps this chord is in context of Ab. If F# is Gb, and Cdim/F# is Gb bass with Cdim. Cdim chord is C Eb Gb. With Gb bass, so it's Gb, C, Eb. Which is Gb major? No, Gb C Eb – that's a diminished triad. Wait, C diminished over Gb bass: Gb C Eb – which is Cdim with Gb root? No. Cdim chord is C Eb Gb. So the chord Cdim with bass note F# (Gb) – yes, the actual chord is Cdim triad, and bass note is Gb. But Cdim already contains Gb. So it's a Cdim chord in root position with Gb bass – which it would be root position for Gb diminished. But Cdim is C Eb Gb. So if bass is Gb, then it's a Gb diminished chord. Which is the vii° in Ab major.

Yes! vii° in Ab major scale is Gb diminished.

Gdim chord (G# diminished would be Abdim, but in terms of pitch, the Gb diminished chord is notes Gb, A, C). No, wait.

In Ab major:

vii° chord is G diminished: G Bb Db.

Wait, no. Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G.

So diatonic chords:

i: Ab maj

ii°: Bb dim

III: C min

iv: Db maj

v: Eb min

VI: F min

VII: G dim.

Ah! So the VII chord is G diminished.

But our chord is "Cdim/F#". If F# is Gb, and Cdim with Gb bass, let's see:

Cdim chord is C Eb Gb.

With bass Gb – so root position for Gb diminished triad, which is Gb Ab Bbb? No. Wait, a diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth.

Gb dim: Gb Bbb Dbb? No, better to spell as Gb, Bb, Db for a Bdim? No.

Wait, Gb diminished triad is Gb, Bbb (A), Db. But this is messy.

Actually, Gb dim chord would be Gb Bbb Db. Which is enharmonic to F#dim chord: F#, A, C.

But perhaps not.

In Ab major scale, the vii° chord is G diminished: G Bb Db.

Yes! Because Ab major has a G natural. So G diminished is G Bb Db.

Now, "Cdim/F#". If Cdim is the chord, and bass F#, which is same as Gb. So Cdim with Gb bass. Cdim = C Eb Gb. So the notes are Gb (bass), C, Eb. Which would be a diminished chord with root Gb. Because Gb to C is fifth, Gb to Eb is minor third. Yes: Gb dim chord is Gb, Bbb (A), Db? Wait, no.

Wait: Gb diminished triad should be Gb, Bbb, Db. But to check:

G to B is major third, G diminished is G Bb Db.

Gb would be Gb, Bbb, Db. Bbb is A.

So notes: Gb, A, Db. Which is an A minor chord? No.

This is too confusing.

But G dim in Ab major scale is G Bb Db.

So if the chord is "Cdim/F#", and given that F# is Gb, and the chord is Cdim, but Cdim = C Eb Gb. With Gb bass, the chord is Gb, C, Eb – which is a diminished chord on Gb: Gb Bbb Db? Not exactly. Gb, C, Eb: the interval from Gb to C is perfect fourth? No, it's fifth above Gb.

G# to C is perfect fourth, so Gb to C is perfect fifth.

Gb to Eb is minor third.

Yes! Gb - Eb is minor third. So Gb, Eb, C would be Gb minor triad? Wait:

Gb to Eb is minor third (3 semitones), Eb to C is minor third (3 semitones: Eb to E natural is 1, E to F natural is 1, F to Gb is 2? Wait better to count semitones.

Eb to C: Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, Bb, B, C. That's too many. No.

From Eb up to C: Eb -> E (1), F (2), F# (3), G (4), G# (5), A (6), A# (7), B (8), C(9). No, that's nine semitones. No.

Wait, interval between Eb and C is a minor sixth.

Because Eb to C: Eb to Gb is 6 semitones down? This is too confusing.

Maybe this is taking too long. But let's assume the key is Ab major.

If we substitute all G# as Ab:

- Ab Ab Fm/Ab Fm/Ab Cdim/Gb A#m/Ab Ab Ab Fm/Ab Fm/Ab Ab Ab F#6 Ab

But F#6 would be Gb6, which is not standard. Not sure.

But in Ab major:

- "Ab": tonic

- Fm/Ab: VI chord (F minor) in first inversion

- Cdim/Gb: if we consider that Cdim/F# is Cdim with bass Gb, then Gb is part of scale? In Ab major, Gb is F#? No, Ab major scale has G natural, not Gb.

Wait, Ab major has a G natural. The scale is Ab Bb C Db Eb F G.

So G is present.

If chord Cdim with bass Gb – but Gb isn't in scale; it's F#.

This isn't adding up.

Alternative: maybe the key is B major.

B major scale: B C# D# E F# G# A#.

Chords have G# as #5? Not sure.

I'm really struggling. Maybe this is in G# minor with some borrowed chords.

Let's consider G# minor natural:

Scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#

Chords:

i: G#m

ii°: A#dim

III: B major

iv: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major

VII: F# major

So VII chord is F# major.

Now:

- The progression starts with G# (i)

- Fm/G# – but F natural isn't in scale. However, the chord A#m/G# makes sense: A#m would be ii chord, but in natural minor it's diminished. If it's harmonic minor...

Wait, if it's G# harmonic minor, scale is G# A# B C# D# E F##.

So VII chord is F## major (G major).

But the chord F#6: F# would be in the scale as sixth degree E, no. Wait, in G# harmonic minor scale, the sixth degree is E.

F# is not present.

But let's look at chords:

- G#m: i

- Fm/G#: F minor chord – F is not in scale. Scale has E and F##.

- Chord A#m/G#: A#m (ii chord in harmonic minor), yes.

- F#6: still problematic.

This is frustrating. Maybe it's better to consider the key as A# minor with the same issues.

Wait, I think there's a possibility where "Fm/G#" is actually a different chord.

Wait, chord Fm/G# – in standard notation, a G# bass under an F minor chord. Which could be an F minor chord in first inversion (Ab, C, F), but Ab is G#.

But in the context of the key, if we consider the key of B major, but not sure.

Wait, let's look at the interval between F and G#. F to G# is a minor third. Doesn't help.

Another idea: maybe the key is C minor, and G# is Ab.

In C minor:

- Tonic Cm

- VII chord: Bb major

- vi: Ab major

- iv: Fm

So if we have Fm in key C minor, that's iv.

And Ab would be vi chord.

But the progression has "G#" chord, which is Ab.

Fm/G# would be Fm over Ab bass.

In C minor:

- Fm is iv chord

- Ab is vi chord

So vi over tonic? Not sure.

But let's list chords in C minor:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: EbM

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: AbM

VII: BbM

So:

- Ab chord is VI

- Fm is iv

- The progression:

G# (Ab) chord – VI

Fm/G# – Fm over Ab bass → which would be a G# minor seventh chord? No.

Fm with Ab bass: notes Ab F A# C? No. Fm chord is F Ab C. Bass is Ab, so Ab F C.

In key of C minor, Ab is vi chord. So Fm is iv chord. How does Ab bass relate to Fm? It's first inversion of Fm. So Fm in first inversion has Ab as bass. Which would be Ab over C, but that's a way of playing iv chord in first inversion.

In C minor, iv chord is F minor, first inversion Ab C F, which can also be seen as a vi chord without the fifth? Not sure.

But in this case:

- Ab is vi

- Fm in first inversion would be part of iv chord.

But the chord progression here:

G# (Ab), Ab, Fm/G# etc.

Not sure.

But if the key is C minor:

- Ab (G#) = vi

- Fm/G# = iv in first inversion

- Cdim/F# would be... Cdim is C Eb Gb. If F# is Gb, so Cdim over Gb bass. In C minor, Gb would be F# (from the scale, we usually don't have it).

This might not fit.

But if there's a secondary dominant or something.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should consider that this progression is in Ab major, with the understanding that G# is Ab.

Let's try:

Key is Ab major.

Chords:

- G# (Ab) as tonic.

- Fm/G# – F minor with Ab bass: since in Ab major, F minor is the VI chord. And Fm in first inversion has Ab, C, F. So yes, this chord.

- Cdim/F#: Cdim chord with F# bass. But in Ab major scale, F# is not present; there's G natural. Alternatively, F# is written as Gb. If we consider Ab major has G natural, then Gb is chromatic.

But Cdim/F# (Gb bass): Cdim = C Eb Gb. With bass Gb, it's a Gb diminished chord. In Ab major, the vii chord is Gdim (G Bb Db). So Gb is not the same as G. Gb is a different pitch.

But if we consider it's a chromatic chord, maybe.

- A#m/G#: A#m is Bbm. In Ab major, iv chord is Db. So Bbm is not diatonic. Wait, Bb minor is II chord in F minor, but not fitting here.

In Ab major scale:

Chords include:

i: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gdim.

Yes! In Ab major scale:

- ii chord is Bbm minor.

- iii chord is Cm.

- etc.

So A#m is Bbm. Yes! So A#m is Bb minor chord.

So in key of Ab major:

- G# = Ab

- Fm/G# = Fm in first inversion (VI chord)

- Cdim/F#: Cdim. Cdim would be C Eb Gb. In Ab major, there is C minor chord, but diminished? No.

Wait, the iii chord is Cm, but it's minor, not diminished.

Unless the chord is Cdim as a different chord.

But Cdim/F# with bass F# (Gb). The chord Cdim with Gb bass is Gb dim chord.

Which could be the vii° in F minor, but in Ab major, not diatonic.

Alternatively, if the chord Cdim is a misnomer; maybe it's the III chord.

This is very challenging. Let's try to map everything to Ab major.

All chords rewritten for Ab major:

- G# = Ab (1)

- Fm/G# = Fm over Ab: VI chord (Fm) first inversion

- Cdim/F#: If we consider this is Gb dim, which in Ab context is chromatic

- A#m/G# = Bbm over Ab: Bbm is ii chord, which over Ab bass would be inversion

- F#6: This would be Gb6, which is unusual for Ab major.

Alternatively, F#6 might be written as Gb6. In Ab major, chords are built from the scale, so it's not usual.

But wait, in Ab major, what is Gb? It's the lowered VII, which is chromatic.

But the F#6 chord would be a major chord F#-A#-C#-D#, which is also spelled Gb-Bb-D-F.

Which is a Gb major triad with added 6th? Not sure.

But Gb major isn't in Ab major scale. Ab has F and G natural.

This doesn't fit. But the progression has G# repeated which is Ab tonic.

The Fm/G# is VI chord in Ab major, which fits.

The A#m/G# would be Bbm in Ab major with Ab bass, which is ii chord in first inversion (Bbm: Bb Db F; first inversion Db, F, Bb → not matching Ab bass. Wait, no: Bbm chord with Ab in bass is not a standard inversion. Bbm chord notes are Bb, Db, F. Bass Ab would require chord notes Ab, Bb, Db, F – which is Bbm7. Ah!

If the chord is A#m/G#, which is Bbm over Ab bass. So the notes are Ab, Bb, Db, F. Which is Bbm7.

In Ab major scale, Bbm7 would be ii7 chord, which is diatonic.

Yes! Because Ab major scale:

Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So Bbm7 chord exists: Bb, Db, F, Ab. Which matches the bass Ab, and the chord Bbm7.

Similarly, Fm/G# – Fm with Ab bass. Fm chord is F Ab C. With Ab in bass → Ab, F, C. This is Ab Major 7? No. Ab, C, F – that's a chord spelled Ab, C, F, which is a Ab major triad with a fourth added (subdominant, perhaps). Or it's C minor with Ab bass. Not sure.

But in Ab major scale:

Fm chord is vi chord: Fm = F Ab C.

So Fm over Ab bass is a common voicing for the vi chord in first inversion.

Yes! In Ab major, VI chord is F minor. Its first inversion has Ab as bass. So Fm in first inversion is Ab-C-F.

And the chord would be written as Fm/Ab (or Fm/G#), yes.

Cdim/F#: If this chord is Cdim with F# bass. Let's see:

Cdim = C Eb Gb. Bass F# (Gb). So chords notes: Gb, C, Eb.

Which in Ab major scale, this chord Gb, C, Eb would be a chord built on Gb, which is the raised VII in Ab. But more likely, it's a common substitution or a misnomer. What's the chord name for Gb, C, Eb?

It's Gb diminished triad. Since Gb diminished would be Gb, Bbb, Db – not matching this. Hmm, C, Eb, Gb is Cdim. So the same as Cdim chord, which we already know.

But in Ab context, it's not diatonic. However, if it has Gb bass, and the chord is Cdim, then it's a Cdim chord in first inversion. Not sure.

Wait, but perhaps Cdim is actually a vii° chord. In some keys.

In Ab major, vii° is G dim (G, Bb, Db).

Cdim doesn't match.

But what if Cdim/F# is meant to be Gb7 chord or something else.

This is taking too long. Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible key is Ab major, interpreting G# as Ab.

So:

- Key: Ab major mode (or just Ab major, not a mode necessarily)

- Notes in Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

- The progression:

  - Ab Ab Fm/Ab Fm/Ab (Fm with Ab bass = VI in first inversion)

  - Cdim/Gb? But not sure

  - Bbm/Ab (A#m/G# is Bbm with Ab bass → ii in first inversion?)

Wait, Bbm chord with Ab bass: notes Ab Bb Db F. Which is Bbm7 chord.

In Ab major, ii chord is Bbm in root position. So Bbm7 is diatonic.

Then F#6? If F# is written as Gb, but it's not in scale. However, F# could be a secondary dominant or chromatic.

But another point: in the progression, the F#6 chord – if it's Gb6, then Gb is the flatted VII. In Ab major, Gb is not in scale, but there's G natural. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is F minor.

But I think based on the chords fitting into Ab major:

- G# = Ab

- Fm/G# = Ab bass with Fm chord

- A#m/G# = Bbm over Ab → ii

And in Ab major, Fm is vi chord.

So progression:

Ab Ab Fm/Ab Fm/Ab Cdim/Gb Bbm/Ab Ab... etc.

Cdim/Gb – if this chord is Cdim over Gb bass, it might be a common non-diatonic chord or perhaps it's Gb7.

But let's see:

Cdim chord is C Eb Gb. Over Gb bass, it's Gb, C, Eb – which is Gb diminished triad. Which would be the vii° in D minor, but not sure.

Maybe it's a different interpretation.

Another idea: perhaps the chord "Cdim/F#" is actually Cdim7 with F# bass, which is equivalent to B diminished seventh chord over F#. Not sure.

Given all this, I think the most plausible key is Ab major, with the following interpretation:

- G# is Ab tonic

- Fm/G# is Fm chord in first inversion (VI chord)

- A#m/G# is Bbm over Ab bass (ii chord)

- The Cdim/F# chord might be a typo or a chromatic passing chord

- F#6 is problematic, but maybe it's F# major and suggesting a modulation

But if we are to choose an overall key, Ab major fits the majority of the chord structure.

Alternatively, let's consider that in the progression, the F# is leading tone in G# minor.

In G# minor natural:

- Tonic G#

- The VII chord is F# major

- vi chord is E major

- etc.

So if we have a G# tonic, then F# major chord is VII chord.

But the chord progression has F#6. F#6 would be F# A# C# D#, which in G# minor, the F# major is VII chord. The A# in F#6 chord would fit as a part of it.

In G# minor:

- G#m (i)

- F#6: could be the VII chord with added 6th.

- A#m: this would be the ii chord but in natural minor it's diminished. If it's harmonic minor, the ii chord would be diminished.

But in harmonic minor, the seventh degree is raised, so F## (G natural). But for G# harmonic minor scale:

G# A# B C# D# E F##.

So chord on A# would be A#dim (ii°).

But we have A#m, which suggests a minor chord, so maybe it's melodic minor.

But melodic minor ascending has A#m for the ii chord.

So in G# melodic minor ascending scale: G# A# B C# D# E# F##.

Chords:

i: G#m

ii: A#m

III+: B augmented

IV: C#m

V: D#M

VI: E#M

VII: F##dim.

Now:

- The progression starts with G#m (i)

- Fm/G#: F minor. In this scale, E# and F## present. F natural not present. So not sure.

Wait, but Fm would contain F natural, which isn't in scale. But what if Fm/G# is actually E# minor or something. Not sure.

This is really challenging.

Given the time I've spent, I think the most reasonable conclusion is that the key is Ab major, with all G# understood as Ab.

So:

Key: Ab major

Mode: major scale (Ionian mode, but usually we just say major key).

But let's verify:

Ab major:

Notes: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords in progression:

- G# = Ab

- Fm chord: vi chord (F minor)

- A#m = Bb minor, which is ii chord

- Cdim/F# – maybe a different interpretation, but C dim chord isn't diatonic, but if it's Cb, no. Alternatively, in Ab major, the chord might be a chromaticism.

F#6 chord in Ab major would be Gb major sixth. Not diatonic, but possible as a borrowed chord.

Another angle: maybe the key is F minor.

F minor:

Notes: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

Chords include:

- Fm (i)

- Bbm (iv)

- AbM (VI)

- Cdim (vii°)

But progression has G# which would be Ab.

So:

- Ab (VI)

- Fm/G# would be Fm over Ab bass (i chord in first inversion?)

Wait, Fm chord is F Ab C. With Ab bass → Ab F C: that's Fm first inversion.

- Cdim/F#: Cdim chord with F# bass. In F minor, Cdim would be vii° chord. Cdim = C Eb Gb.

With F# bass → Gb chord? Not sure. In F minor scale, Gb isn't present; the scale has G natural.

Wait, F minor scale has Ab and Bb.

The vii° chord in F minor would be E dim.

No. In natural minor, the vii° is E diminished.

F natural minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb.

Scale degrees:

1. F

2. G

3. Ab

4. Bb

5. C

6. Db

7. Eb

So vii chord is E diminished (E G Bb D? No). E diminished: E G Bb – yes.

But the chord Cdim isn't directly diatonic; C minor is v in minor? No, v chord in F minor minor is C minor.

Wait, no: natural minor, the v is minor chord.

Fm natural scale.

i: Fm

ii°: G°

III: AbM

iv: Bbm

v: Cm

VI: DbM

VII: EbM.

So chord Cm is v.

Cdim isn't present. But Cdim would contain C Eb Gb. In scale, Db is present, not C natural.

If the key is F minor, Cdim would not be diatonic. However, with C minor chord, Cm is present.

Let's see:

If we have Cdim/F#, which in F minor might be interpreted as Eb7 or something else, but not sure.

But the chord F# in F minor scale – no, F# isn't present; scale has F natural.

This also isn't matching.

Back to Ab major.

In Ab major:

- Cdim chord: C Eb Gb – not diatonic. But if it's a C♭ diminished or something.

But the most viable option is Ab major.

So final conclusion: the key is Ab major. The progression uses several diatonic chords to Ab major, with possible chromatic elements.

But to confirm, let's check the entire progression in Ab major:

- Ab (i)

- Ab (i)

- Fm/Ab (6/first inversion)

- Fm/Ab

- Cdim/Gb (not diatonic, but perhaps a passing chord)

- Bbm/Ab (ii chord over Ab → Bbm7)

- ... repeating Ab, Fm/Ab, etc.

Then F#6 – could be a borrowed chord or a modulation to Gb major.

But I think for all intents and purposes, the key is Ab major.

Alternatively, considering that the chords include F natural and G#, which can sometimes be in A minor or other keys.

Wait another thought: in A major, the key has F#.

But this progression has G# which would be the leading tone. Not sure.

But A major scale: A B C# D E F# G#.

So:

- G# is VII?

In A major, VII is G# diminished.

But the chords would have G#dim.

But our chords include G# major and F#6.

If in A major:

- G# would be dim, but progression has G# likely major chord.

- F#6 is IV chord in A major? IV is D major.

No, F# is the #IV or something.

Not fitting.

Final conclusion, after extensive consideration:

The most likely key is G# minor, but it's very problematic because of F natural. But perhaps the song is using a mix of minor chords with chromaticism. Or perhaps the key is C# minor.

C# minor scale: C# D# E F# G# A B.

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III: E major

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A major

VII: B major.

So:

- G# minor chord is v.

- The chords G# as minor would be v of the key.

- But it starts with G# which would be v chord, so usually tonic is C#m.

So progression could be in C# minor, where tonic is C# minor, but the progression emphasizes v (G#m) as tonic? Unlikely, but possible.

Let's test:

Key: C# minor.

Chords:

G#m (v)

Fm/G# – F minor with G# bass.

In C# minor scale, F# natural is present, F natural is chromatic.

A#m – Bb minor, chromatic.

Not promising.

Another try: perhaps it's B minor.

B minor natural: B C# D E F# G A.

Not fitting.

After exhausting options, I think the key is most likely Ab major. Therefore:

- Key: Ab major (though with some chromaticism)

But commonly, musical analysis would name the key based on tonal center. The frequent chord G# (Ab) suggests Ab tonic.

Alternatively, the mode might be Ionian.

But let's check if there's a different mode. For example, if the chords fit a minor key.

Wait, if it's Fdorian or something. Unlikely.

Wait another Idea:

Let's look at the bass line: G# G# G# G# F# G# etc.

This seems like a G# tonic with a descending step to F#.

In G# minor, F# is the VII chord. So a progression like i - VII - ... which is common in minor keys.

So the tonic is G# minor.

But then what about Fm/G#?

In G# natural minor scale, F natural isn't present. However, if it's G# harmonic minor, the sixth degree is E natural.

But to get F natural, maybe it's G# melodic minor.

G# melodic minor ascending: G# A# B C# D# E# F##.

F## is G natural.

Not F natural.

But if the chord Fm has F natural, then it's outside.

However, maybe the Fm chord is a substitute for E#m, but not sure.

Alternatively, consider that in G# minor, the chord Fm could be a borrowed chord from parallel major.

G# minor's parallel major would be G# major. But G# major is hard to play.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F##.

Which is very sharp.

In G# major, the IV chord would be C# major.

Fm chord doesn't fit.

This is really tough. Given the time I've spent and common practice, I think the most plausible key is Ab major.

So, conclusion:

Key: Ab major

Mode: Ionian (major)

But to check, let's see all chords:

- Ab (i)

- Fm/Ab: which is vi chord

- Bb minor (A#m) over Ab bass: ii chord

- Cdim/F#: this is a Gb diminished chord, which could be a passing chord or something related to Gb major (which is F# major).

- F#6 chord might be a secondary dominant to something.

But overall, the tonal center seems to be Ab.

Alternatively, it could be in G# minor with F# as the VII chord.

Let's check the progression in G# minor:

- G#m (i)

- F# major (VII) chord

- But the chords include Fm/G# – which would be in G# minor.

But Fm has F natural, which is a chromatic note. However, sometimes in minor keys, you get chromaticism.

In G# minor, the F natural would be the minor 6th of the scale. The natural minor has E natural, so sixth degree is E natural. F natural is outside.

But chord Fm/G# could be a borrowed chord.

Given all this, perhaps the key is G# minor, and the Fm is a chromatic passing chord.

But usually, the Fm wouldn't be diatonic.

However, if we take the chords:

- G#m (i)

- Fm (borrowed chord from parallel major G# major, which has F## as major VII, not F natural)

This is not helping.

Wait, another Idea: maybe all these slash chords imply that the bass note is changing.

Let's list the bass line notes only:

G# , G# , G# , G# , F# , G# , G# , G# , G# , G# , G# , F# , G#.

So the bass is mostly G# with a F# in between.

The interval from G# to F# is a minor third down.

Common in some progressions.

If the key is G# minor, then F# is the VII chord (F# major).

The progression might be i - VII - ... ?

But then what about the Fm/G# – when bass is G#, the chord is Fm.

So chord is Fm with G# bass.

What's that chord called?

It's Fm over G#, which is a chord with notes F, Ab, C, G#.

G# is the bass.

So notes: G#, F, Ab, C.

What is that chord? Let's see intervals:

G# to F is minor third.

G# to Ab is same note, so G# (Ab), F, C.

Ab, F, C.

This is Ab major with F as minor seventh?

Wait, Ab major is Ab C Eb.

But Ab C F is Ab major 6th chord? Ab6: Ab C Eb F.

Yes! Ab6 chord has notes Ab, C, Eb, F.

And we have chord notes: G# (Ab), F, Ab, C.

Yes: Ab, C, F, and Eb if present. Wait, our chord notes are G# (Ab), F, Ab, C.

So Ab, C, F – and missing Eb. So it's Ab major triad with added 6th (F), but Ab6 is usually Ab C Eb F.

But if the Eb is missing, it's an ambiguous chord.

But typically, an Ab6 chord would include Eb.

Hmm.

But without Eb, just Ab, C, F. That could be an Ab major with a suspended 4th (F) but no, a sus chord would replace the third.

Not quite.

This is really tough.

Given the time I've spent and common analysis practices, I think the most reasonable conclusion is that the tonic is Ab major, and the progression is in Ab major mode (Ionian).

Therefore:

Key: Ab major

Mode: Ionian

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the key could be G# minor, but I think the Ab major makes more sense with the chords fitting.

Another angle: when there's a chord progression like this with many G# chords that resolve to F#, it's common in minor keys where VII-I cadence. However, without other diatonic chords, but since some chords fit.

For example, in G# minor:

Chord G# minor (i)

F# major (VII)

So a progression like i - VII.

But the chord Fm/G# – if the chord is Fm over G# bass, which contains Ab, F, C.

What is Ab in G# minor scale? Ab would be the minor 6th degree? G# natural minor scale is G# A# B C# D# E F#.

So note Ab (G#) is the tonic.

Ab is not a scale degree in G# minor – G# minor includes G#, not Ab.

Unless it's written as Ab natural, which is enharmonic to G#.

So all G# are Ab.

So in musical terms, if you're seeing notes written as G#, they're likely referring to the natural note.

But in key of Ab major:

- G# is not used; Ab is the tonic.

This gets back to Ab major.

I finally think the key is Ab major, so the answer is Ab major, Ionian mode.

But to confirm, let's check with the F#6 chord.

F#6 in key of Ab major would be chromatic.

However, it could also be a dominant chord.

But if the key is Ab major, the dominant chord would be Eb.

Maybe the F#6 is a typo for F# minor or something else.

Given all, I'll go with Ab major.

After analyzing the chord progression **G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#**, we determine the **key and mode** by considering the functional relationships between chords, bass notes, and diatonic possibilities.

### 🎯 **Key Identification: Ab Major**

#### 🔍 **Why Ab Major?**
- **G# is interpreted as Ab** (enharmonic equivalent). This is standard in theoretical analysis to avoid double sharps or excessive flats, especially when the tonal center is more conveniently expressed in flats.
- **Bass line** centers around **Ab** (written as G#), reinforcing Ab as the tonic:
  - Bass notes: **G# (Ab)** repeated across most of the progression.
  - The shift from **G# → F#** (Ab → Gb) is common in minor or chromatic progressions, but in this context, it aligns with **Ab major** having a diatonic **Fm** chord (VI) and **Bbm** (ii).
- **Diagrams of chords in Ab major**:
  - **Ab (i)** – Tonic
  - **Fm/Ab** = F minor in 1st inversion = **VI chord** in Ab major
  - **A#m/G#** = **Bbm over Ab bass** = **ii7 chord** (Bbm7: Bb, Db, F, Ab)
  - **F#6** = **Gb6** (enharmonic), which is chromatic but can function as a passing or secondary dominant chord in context

#### 🌟 **Why not G# minor or other keys?**
- If the key were **G# minor**, the absence of F natural (from the Fm chord) would be non-diatonic. G# natural minor scale includes **E natural** (not F), making F minor chromatic and unlikely to be central.
- **G# major** is highly impractical (requires double sharps like F##, E#), and most chords do not resolve naturally in this key.
- **C# minor**, **F minor**, or others also fail to fit the consistent tonal center of **Ab (G#)**.

---

### 🎻 **Mode: Ionian (Major Scale)**

- The progression uses chords consistent with the **Ab major scale**:  
  - **Ab (i)**  
  - **Bbm (ii)**  
  - **Cm (iii)** – though not directly present, its notes overlap with chord structures.  
  - **Db (IV)** – though not explicitly played, it fits the key.  
  - **Eb (V)** – not present, but common in harmonic analysis of Ab major.  
  - **Fm (VI)** – present as **Fm/Ab**  
  - **Gdim (vii°)** – not directly present but consistent with the harmonic structure.

- The consistent use of **Ab as the tonic**, with **Fm (VI)** and **Bbm (ii)** as diatonic chords, confirms the **Ionian mode (major key)**.

### 🎹 **Breakdown of Chords in Ab Major Context**

| Original Chord | Enharmonic Equivalent | Function in Ab Major |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| G#             | Ab                     | **Tonic (i)**        |
| Fm/G#          | Fm over Ab bass        | **VI in 1st inversion** (Fm chord with Ab in bass) |
| Cdim/F#        | Cdim over Gb bass      | Chromatic passing chord (not diatonic, but common in extended progressions) |
| A#m/G#         | Bbm over Ab bass       | **ii7 chord** (Bbm7) |
| F#6            | Gb6                    | Chromatic/used as a substitute or passing chord |

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

- **Key: Ab Major**  
  (G# is read as Ab for practicality and tonal center clarity)
- **Mode: Ionian (Major)**  
  All chords align with the diatonic structure of Ab major except for minor chromatic elements (like Cdim/F# and F#6), which are common in expressive musical contexts.

> **Final Answer**: The key is **Ab Major**, in **Ionian mode**.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let’s analyze the chord progression you’ve provided:

**Chord progression:**
> G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#

---

### Step 1: List the chords clearly

We’ll write them in root position or highlight the bass note:

1. **G#** — likely G# major (G#-B#-D#)  
2. **G#**  
3. **Fm/G#** — F minor with G# in the bass → So bass is G#, chord is F minor → inversion of Fm: G#-A-C  
4. **Fm/G#**  
5. **Cdim/F#** — C diminished with F# in the bass → bass is F#, chord is Cdim: F#-A-C (which is F# half-diminished, or F#m7♭5)  
6. **A#m/G#** — A# minor with G# in the bass → G#-A#-E# (since A#minor = A#-C#-E#) → so it’s G# as bass, A# minor triad above → **G#-A#-C#-E#**? Wait — actually, **A#m/G#** means the chord is A# minor with G# in the bass → notes: G# - A# - C# - E#? But A#m triad is A#-C#-E#, so with G# bass → G#-A#-C#-E# — that’s **G# minor 7th**? Let’s hold that thought.

7. **G#**  
8. **G#**  
9. **Fm/G#**  
10. **Fm/G#**  
11. **G#**  
12. **G#**  
13. **F#6** — F# major with a 6th → F#-A#-C#-D#  
14. **G#**

---

### Step 2: Simplify and look for tonal center

We see **G#** repeated very frequently — it’s the most common chord/bass note. Let’s assume **G#** is the tonal center.

So potential key: **G# major** or **G# minor**

But let’s look at the other chords:

- **Fm/G#** → This is **F minor triad** over G# bass: G# - A - C  
  - This is a **minor 6th chord**? Not quite. The notes G#-A-C form a **G# diminished triad**? Let’s see:
    - G# to A: minor 2nd
    - A to C: minor 3rd
    - G# to C: diminished 5th (G#–C is 6 half-steps: G#–A–A#–B–C → G# to C is 6 semitones → tritone → diminished 5th)
    - So **G#-A-C = G# dim triad** → So this is **G#dim** chord.

Wait — hold on! That’s critical.

**Fm/G# = F minor on G# bass**

F minor triad: F–A–C  
Put G# in the bass: **G#–F–A–C** — rearranged: **G#–A–C–F**

But that’s a **4-note chord**: G#, A, C, F — this is NOT a standard triad. Chord symbols like X/Y mean the chord X with bass Y — so the *chord quality* is F minor, but the *bass note* is G#.

So the full chord is: **F minor triad (F–A–C)** with **G#** as the lowest note → notes: **G#, F, A, C**

Now let’s arrange them in order:

**G# - A - C - F**

Intervals from G#:
- G# to A: m2
- G# to C: d5 (6 semitones)
- G# to F: m6 (8 semitones) — G#–A–A#–B–C–C#–D–D#–E–F → 8 semitones? Let’s count:

**G# → A (1), A# (2), B (3), C (4), C# (5), D (6), D# (7), E (8), F (9)** → **9 semitones** from G# to F — that’s a **major 6th?** Wait, G# to F is enharmonically **G# to F##**? No, F is natural.

Wait — **G# to F** is **10 semitones**? Let me be precise:

Half-steps from G#:
- G# = 0
- A = 1
- A# = 2
- B = 3
- C = 4
- C# = 5
- D = 6
- D# = 7
- E = 8
- F = 9

So G# to F is **9 semitones** → A **minor 6th?** No — 9 semitones is a **major 6th**? Wait:

- Major 6th from G# is E# (G# to E# = 9 semitones — yes, because E# = F natural)
- But E# and F natural are enharmonic. So **G# to F natural** is a **minor 7th**? Wait, no.

Wait — G# to F natural:

- G# → A → A# → B → C → C# → D → D# → E → F → that's 9 steps → **minor 7th** would be G# to F# (8 semitones) → F natural is one step lower → **diminished 7th**? No.

Let’s count semitones accurately:

| Note | Semitone from G# |
|------|------------------|
| G#   | 0                |
| A    | 1                |
| A#   | 2                |
| B    | 3                |
| C    | 4                |
| C#   | 5                |
| D    | 6                |
| D#   | 7                |
| E    | 8                |
| F    | **9**            |

So **G# to F = 9 semitones** = a **minor 7th**? But minor 7th from G# is **F#**, which is 10 semitones? No, wait — mistake.

Wait, standard: **Minor 7th interval** = 10 semitones

- G# → A = 1
- G# → B = 3
- G# → C# = 5
- G# → D# = 7
- G# → E# = 9? No, E# is the major 6th

Wait — G# to **F#** is 10 semitones → minor 7th  
G# to **F** is 9 semitones → **Major 6th**! Because:

- Major 6th = 9 semitones  
- Minor 6th = 8 semitones → G# to E = 8 semitones

So **G# to F natural = 9 semitones → major 6th**

So F is the major 6th above G#

So the chord **Fm over G# bass** = notes: G# (bass), F, A, C

→ Belongs to the notes: **G#, A, C, F**

In terms of intervals above G#:

- 1: G#
- 2: A (M2)
- 4: C (P4)
- 6: F (M6)

So chord: **G# with added 2 and 4 and 6**? Unusual.

Better to think: **F minor triad = F, A, C** — so stacked above G# bass, it's **G#–F–A–C**

Which is the same as **A–C–F–G#**

That’s an **A minor 7th flat 5 (Aø7)** chord? A–C–E♭–G → but we have A–C–F–G# — F is natural, G# is natural.

A–C–F–G# → Could that be **G#7#5#9**? Too complicated.

Wait — here's a better approach.

---

### Step 3: Consider key signature and scales

Let’s suppose this is in the key of **G# minor**.

G# minor scale: G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F# (natural minor)

But we have chords with **F natural**, **C natural**, **A natural**, etc.

Specifically, we see:

- Fm → F is natural
- Cdim → C natural
- A#m → A#, C#, E#
- F#6 → F#, A#, C#, D#

So in the same progression, we see **C natural** (in Fm and Cdim) and **C#** (in A#m and F#6).  
Also, **F natural** and **F#**.

This suggests **chromaticism**, **modal interchange**, or even **modulation**.

But look again — **Cdim/F#** — C diminished with F# bass.

Cdim = C–E♭–G♭  
F# bass → **F#–C–E♭–G♭**

That’s **F# half-diminished** chord: F#–A–C–E → wait, no.

Cdim triad: C–E♭–G♭  
With F# bass → notes: F#, C, E♭, G♭

That’s **F# minor 7♭5** chord: F#–A–C–E would be m7♭5 — but we have F#, C, E♭, G♭.

Wait — F#, C, E♭, G♭ = F#–C–E♭–G♭ → that’s **C diminished 7th chord with F# bass** — which is enharmonic to:

Cdim7 = C–E♭–G♭–B𝄫 → which is C–E♭–G♭–A (if B𝄫 = A)

So **F#–C–E♭–A** — which is the same as **A–C–E♭–F#**

That’s **A half-diminished seventh**: A–C–E♭–G — but we have A–C–E♭–F#, so **A–C–E♭–F#** = A half-diminished 7th? Let’s check:

Normal A half-dim: A–C–E♭–G — **G natural**

We have **F#** instead → which is a **major 6th** above A? Or a **minor 7th**? A to F# = 8 semitones → minor 6th

Wait — 8 semitones = minor 6th.

So **A–C–E♭–F#** = A minor triad with a flat 5 and a minor 6th? That’s **A7♭5♭6** — extremely rare.

Alternatively: **Cdim7 chord with F# bass** → Cdim7 = C–E♭–G♭–B𝄫 (B𝄫 = A) → so C–E♭–G♭–A

Then bass is F# → not one of those notes.

So maybe it’s **Cdim7 with F# bass** → which implies **Cdim7 / F#** → but that’s not standard.

Alternative idea: **Cdim/F# = F#m7b5**

Because F#m7b5 = F#–A–C–E → but we have F#, C, and then E♭, G♭? No, we don’t have E.

This is confusing.

Let’s try a different strategy: **ignore bass notes** for a moment and just look at chord qualities.

Chord qualities in the progression:

- G# (major)
- Fm (minor)
- Cdim (diminished)
- A#m (minor)
- F#6 (major with 6th)

F#6 = F#–A#–C#–D#

That’s a **major 6th chord in F#**, which is the **major VI** chord in D# minor.

Wait — let’s look at **F# major** and **G# minor**.

### Try key of A major or F# major?

F# major scale: F# G# A# B C# D# E#  
So G# is #2, A# is #3

We have chords: G# major, Fm, Cdim, A#m — does A# minor belong? A# minor is A#–C#–E# — that’s in F# major (vi chord: vi = D#m, not A#m).

In G# minor key (natural):  
Scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#  
Chords:  
i – G#m  
ii° – A#dim  
III – Bmaj  
iv – C#m  
v – D#m  
VI – E  
VII – F#  

We don’t have any of these matching. We have **G# major** — out of place.  
We have **Fm** — F natural, not in key.  
We have **Cdim** — C natural.  
We have **A#m** — A#-C#-E# — but in G# minor, that would be II, which is diminished, not minor.

So perhaps **G# minor is not the key**.

Try **D# major?**

D# major: D# E# F# G# A# B# C##  
Chord: G# = #5 — not likely.  
F# = #7? Not good.

Try **F# major**

F# major: F# G# A# B C# D# E#  
Chords:
I: F#  
II: G#m  
III: A#m  
IV: B  
V: C#  
VI: D#  
VII: E#°

We have:
- G# — should be minor, but it’s major → so borrowed?
- Fm? — F natural — NOT in F# major (F# has F#)
- Cdim? C natural — F# major has C#
- A#m — yes! that’s III chord
- F#6 — yes, I chord with added 6

So chords we see:
- **G# major** → would normally be G#m in F# major → so **borrowed from parallel minor?** F# minor? But F# minor has G natural, not G#.

F# minor scale: F# – G# – A – B – C# – D – E  
Now F# minor includes:
- G# (as 2nd degree) → so **G# major chord**? Yes! G#–B#–D#? But in F# minor, 3rd is A — so G#–B–D — G# minor.

But you have **G# major** (G#–B#–D#) — B# — that’s not in F# minor — F# minor has B natural.

So **G# major is borrowed from F# major**, but F# major has E# and C#, not C natural.

Clash: Fm = F natural vs F# major has F# — conflict.

So not a diatonic key.

---

### Let’s look for common tones or pivot

The chord **F#6** is **F#–A#–C#–D#** — this is a very bright, major tonal center.

Let’s assume we are in **F# major**.

F# major scale: F# G# A# B C# D# E#

Chords that fit:
- F#6 = I6 → YES
- A#m = III → YES
- G# = ? Normally minor, but here it’s major → G# = II → in F# major, II is G#m, but we have G# major — so **major II chord**, which is **borrowed** (e.g., from F# Phrygian? Or parallel minor? No — F# minor has G#m)

But in **F# harmonic minor?** That’s F#–G#–A–B–C#–D–E# — still has G# minor.

So why G# major? It's unusual.

Try **D# minor**

D# minor scale (natural): D# E# F# G# A# B C#  
Chords:
i: D#m  
ii°: E#°  
III: F#  
iv: G#m  
v: A#m  
VI: B  
VII: C#

Now we have:
- G# → but it’s major — in D# minor, G# is iv → should be minor
- Fm? F natural — not in key (has F#)
- Cdim? C natural — has C#
- A#m = v → YES
- F#6 = III6 → FYI, F# major is III chord in D# minor — so F#6 is possible
- G# major — again, should be G#m

So again, G# major is inconsistent.

### Critical observation:

We keep seeing **Fm/G#**

That is: F minor with G# bass → notes: G#, F, A, C

Now, **F–A–C** is F minor triad, add G# bass.

But **G#, A, C** → spelled: G#–A–C = **G# diminished triad**

So **Fm/G#** is **functionally a G#dim chord**

Why? Because the **notes G#, A, C** form a diminished triad.

Similarly, **Cdim/F#** = C diminished with F# bass → C–E♭–G♭ with F# bass = F#–C–E♭–G♭ → that’s **F# half-diminished 7**? F#–A–C–E would be the standard — but we have E♭ and G♭ — not in key.

Wait — wait a minute: **Cdim/F#**

Cdim = C–E♭–G♭  
F# = F#

So: F#–C–E♭–G♭

Let’s write as: **F#–G♭–B𝄫–D𝄫**? No — that’s voodoo.

Wait — C–E♭–G♭ = Cdim

Now, F#–C–E♭–G♭ — what is this? Let's spell all as flats or sharps.

E♭ = D#  
G♭ = F#  
C = C

So: F#–C–D#–F#

We have: F# (bass), C, D#, F# — so **C–D#–F#** = **C major triad?** C–E–G — no, C–D#–F# = C to D# = M2, C to F# = P5? C–F# = 6 semitones — tritone.

C to D# = 3 semitones → minor 3rd? No, C to D# = C–C#–D–D# → 3 semitones = minor 3rd

C to F# = C–C#–D–D#–E–F–F# = 6 semitones = diminished 5th

So **C–D#–F# = C diminished triad** — so we’re back to **Cdim with bass C**, but we have bass **F#**

So chord = **F#–C–D#–F#** → which is **Cdim with F# in bass** = **Cdim/F#**

But Cdim = C–E♭–G♭ = C–D#–F# — yes! So **Cdim = C–D#–F#**

Therefore, **Cdim/F# = F# (bass) + C–D#–F#** → so it’s a **C diminished triad with F# in bass** — but the bass note F# is already in the chord!

So it’s just **C diminished with F# as root?** No — the chord is **Cdim**, bass is F# — so root is C, bass is F#.

But the triad is **C–D#–F#** — so the notes are **C, D#, F#** — which is a **C diminished triad**

So **Cdim/F#** is **Cdim (C–D#–F#) with F# in bass** → that’s **F#–C–D#**

Now arrange: **F#–C–D#** → that’s F# to C = 8 semitones (m6), F# to D# = 3 semitones (m3)

So F#–D#–C — which is **D#–F#–C** = D# diminished triad? D#–F#–A → but we have C, not A.

Wait — F#–C–D# is **C–D#–F#** rearranged

Which is **C diminished** — no way around it.

But F#–C–D# = **F# minor 7th flat 5?** F#–A–C–E is m7♭5, but here we have F#–C–D# = F#–D#–C — that’s **C minor 6?** No.

Actually — F#–C–D# is a **C diminished triad with F# in bass** — means the root is C, and bass is F# → it's an **inversion**

Specifically, Cdim triad = C–E♭–G♭ = C–D#–F#

Its first inversion = E♭–G♭–C = D#–F#–C  
Second inversion = G♭–C–E♭ = F#–C–D#

So **Cdim/F#** = **second inversion of C diminished triad**

So **the actual chord is C diminished**

Similarly, **Fm/G#** = F minor with G# bass = notes: G#, F, A, C — which is **G#–A–C–F**

G#–A–C: G# to A = m2, A to C = m3, G# to C = d5 — so **G#dim**

F is an added note? Or maybe we missed something.

Wait — **Fm triad = F–A–C**, bass G# — total notes: G#, F, A, C

Group as **F–A–C** (Fm) + G# bass

But these 4 notes: **F, G#, A, C**

That’s **F–A–C–G#**

Which is a **G# minor 7th?** G#–B#–D#–F# — no, we have F natural.

G#–A–C–F: intervals from G#:
- G#–A: m2
- G#–C: d5
- G#–F: M6

So it's **G# with added 2, 4, and 6** — A, C, F

A = M2, C = d5, F = M6 — these are very dissonant.

This sounds like a **G# half-diminished 7th with no 3rd**? Or **F#m7 b5 without thirds**?

Wait — G# half-dim 7th = G#–B–D#–F#

We have G#–A–C–F — no B, no D#, no F#

So other possibility: **this is a "C minor 6th" chord with G# bass?**

Cm6 = C–E♭–G–A — we have C–F–A–G# — F and G# instead of E♭ and A

Not matching.

---

### Final breakthrough: Think of G# as the root, and find scale.

Chord symbols:

- G# — assume major
- Fm/G# — implies G#dim or G#m6? But let's just take the bass as reference.

Assume the key is **G# minor**, and the **Fm/G#** is a **borrowed chord from G# melodic minor or harmonic minor**.

G# harmonic minor = G#–A#–B–C#–D#–E–F# — still no F natural.

G# melodic minor ascending: G#–A#–B–C#–D#–E#–F# — still F#.

**F natural** only appears in **G# Dorian?** — G# Dorian = G#–A#–B–C#–D#–E#–F# — same.

I'm thinking we’re dealing with **tonal ambiguity** or **modal interchange from D# Lydian or something**.

Another possibility: **This progression is in the key of B major?**

B major: B C# D# E F# G# A#

Check G# — #4  
Fm — F natural — not in key

No.

### Insight: The chord F#6 and G# major

F#6 = F# A# C# D#  
G# major = G# B# D#

In the key of C# major? C# major: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#

Now we have:

- G# major = V
- F#6 = IV6 — in C# major, IV is F# major — yes!
- A#m = vi — in C# major: vi = A#m — yes!
- Cdim = ? C# major has C# — not C

Cdim = C–E♭–G♭ — C natural — not in C# major

Fm = F natural — also not in C# major (has F#)

So again: **C natural** and **F natural** are out of key.

C# major’s note C# is sharp — C natural is chromatic.

So we have **C natural** and **F natural** — that’s a clue.

C natural and F natural: F and C form **tritone** — classic diminished chord enharmonic.

But here’s the key insight:

### Let’s reinterpret the entire sequence as a descending bass line:

Bass notes:

1. **G#**
2. **G#**
3. **G#**
4. **G#**
5. **F#**
6. **G#**
7. **G#**
8. **G#**
9. **G#**
10. **G#**
11. **G#**
12. **G#**
13. **F#**
14. **G#**

So the bass moves:  
G# (x4) → **F#** → G# (x5) → F# → G#

So we have a **G# – F# – G#** bass motion — very common in pop/rock.

That’s exactly the pattern of **I – bVI – I** in some modal settings.

Like: G# – F# – G#

**F#** would be the bVI chord if key is G# major.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F## (F## = G natural)

F# is not in G# major — it’s the **lowered 6th** → so **F# = bVI**

So if we assume **G# major** as tonic:

- G# = I
- F#6 = bVI6

That’s a **very common borrowed chord progression**: **I – bVI – I**

Like in pop: C – Ab – C

Related to the “Andalusian cadence” or bluesy movement.

Now what about the other chords:

Fm/G# — What is this? If G# is tonic, and we have Fm triad over it — Fm = F–A–C — which is **bVII if we’re in G# major?**

But G# major’s bVII would be F# — we have F natural — that’s **bVIIb**? No.

Wait — F natural is **not in G# major** — it’s a **foreign tone**.

But here’s the trick: **Fm/G#** could be interpreted as **G#7#11** or something — not standard.

Another interpretation: **Fm/G# = G#m7♭5** if we consider it as **G#–B–D–F**

But we have **G#–A–C–F** — A and C, not B and D.

So it’s **G#–A–C–F**

That’s **G#m7♭5** if C were E♭ and F were E — no.

Perhaps this is a **Cmaj7b9** or something? Too complex.

Let’s abandon trying to name the chord and look at **harmonic function**.

The sequence:

G# (tonic)  
Fm/G# — bass D? No, G# for 4 bars — suggests **tonic pedal**

Then Cdim/F# — F# bass, Cdim — which is bVI in G# major (F# = bVI)

Then A#m/G# — G# bass, A#m chord → A#m = ii in G# minor, but we’re in G# major

A#m is **iii** in F# major — again.

Now, **F#6** is **bVI6** — and it resolves back to G# — very satisfying.

So overall pattern:

> G# — Fm/G# (tonic pedal) — **Cdim/F# (bVI)** — A#m/G# (iii?) — G# — **F#6 (bVI6)** — G#

This is **essentially** a G# tonic with **bVI chord (F#)** used as a contrast, and **Fm/G#** and **A#m/G#** as colorful passing chords over the tonic bass.

The only "weird" notes are **F, C, A natural** — which are not in G# major.

But those notes — F, A, C — spell **F minor**.

**F minor is the relative minor of A-flat major** — not helpful.

But here's the idea: **The chord Fm = F–A–C** — this is the **bVII chord relative to A major?** No.

In **A major**, bVII is G — not F.

Another classic: in **minor keys**, bVII is I–bVII–I (e.g., in rock: G–F–G)

But here the key is G# major, and **F#** is the bVI — and **F minor** is the same as **E# minor** — enharmonic to F minor, but F minor as a chord of G# major doesn’t fit.

Wait — **F minor = E# minor** — and E# is the leading tone in F major — no.

### Final Answer:

Despite the presence of chromatic tones (F, C, A natural), the **tonic and anchoring chord is G#** used repeatedly, with **F#6** as a strong structural chord (bVI), forming a **I – bVI – I** progression in the key of **G# major**, but with **borrowed subdominant minor chords** (Fm) and diminished chords.

The **mode is G# major**, but the use of Fm and Cdim suggests **modal mixture** (borrowing from G# minor or other modes).

But **G# minor** doesn’t have F natural in its natural, harmonic, or melodic forms.

Wait — G# Phrygian? G# A B C# D# E F# — still no F natural.

**G# Mixolydian b2?** Not standard.

Actually, the presence of **F natural** and **C natural** suggests the key center is **E major or C# major** — but then G# isn't tonic.

I think the only logical conclusion is:

---

### ✅ **Key: G# major**  
### ✅ **Mode: Major (Ionian)**  
### **with modal mixture**: borrowing the **F minor chord** (bVII of G# minor? or from C# minor) and **C diminished** (viio of D#) as chromatic passing chords.

But more precisely — the piece **centered on G#**, with a **strong cadential motion from F#6 to G#**, and Fm/G# acting as a **colored pedal tone over I** — the F and C naturals are **non-chord tones** or **borrowed from G# Dorian?** But G# Dorian is G# A# B C# D# E# F# — no naturals.

So it's **G# major with chromaticism**, possibly suggesting **Blues or Rock style**.

The presence of **F#6** and **I** suggests this is **G# major with lowered sixth chord**, common in many pop/rock songs (e.g., "Let It Be" has C – Ab – C).

So even with all the chromaticism, the **tonal center is G#**.

---

## 🔚 Final Answer:

> **Key: G# Major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (Major)**  
>  
> *Note: The progression uses chromatic and borrowed chords (Fm, Cdim) for color and tension, but the tonal center remains G# with a strong cadence on F#6 → G#.*

This progression is **not diatonic**, but it is **clearly centered on G# major**.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the key and mode from the given chord progression:

**Chord progression:**

- G#  
- G#  
- Fm/G#  
- Fm/G#  
- Cdim/F#  
- A#m/G#  
- G#  
- G#  
- Fm/G#  
- Fm/G#  
- G#  
- G#  
- F#6  
- G#

---

### Step 1: Analyze the tonal center

The chord **G#** appears **most frequently** (8 times), and is the **first and last chord** of the progression in many phrases, suggesting **G# as the tonal center** (the "home" chord).

However, **G# major** is an unusual key (it’s the enharmonic equivalent of Ab major). But in pop/rock or modern music, it’s not uncommon to see G# used directly.

Let’s explore possibilities.

---

### Step 2: Consider enharmonic respelling

In traditional tonal harmony, **G# major** is rarely used because it has 8 sharps (including a double sharp). The **enharmonic equivalent is Ab major**, which has 4 flats and is more practical.

But if the tonal center *feels* like **G#**, it might actually be **Ab**. However, looking at the other chords:

- **Fm/G#** = F minor with G# in the bass  
- **Cdim/F#** = C diminished with F# in the bass  
- **A#m/G#** = A# minor with G# in the bass  
- **F#6** = F# major with added 6th (which is D#)

These chords are **not typical in Ab major**.

Let’s consider **G# minor** instead.

---

### Step 3: Analyze chords in G# minor

**G# natural minor scale**:  
G# A# B C# D# E F#

Chords built on this scale:

- i: G#m  
- ii°: A#°  
- bIII: B major  
- iv: C#m  
- v: D#m  
- bVI: E major  
- bVII: F# major

But our **tonic chord is G# major**, not G# minor. That suggests **G# harmonic or melodic minor with a Picardy third**, or more likely, **G# major key**.

But again, G# major is theoretically messy.

Wait—look at **F#6**. That’s F# major with a 6th (D#). In the context of **G# minor**, F# is the **bVII chord**, which is common in minor keys (e.g., Aeolian or harmonic minor with modal mixture).

Also, **Fm/G#** — F minor over G#. F minor is **not in G# major or minor**.

But **F minor = F Ab C**  
Over G# bass = G# F Ab C → that’s a **G# diminished 7 chord** (G# B D F), but we have **F, Ab, C, G#**.

Wait: G# = Ab  
So Fm/Ab = F Ab C / Ab → that’s just **F minor in first inversion**.

So **Fm/G# = Fm/Ab**, which is a standard chord in **Ab major or Ab minor**.

Similarly, **A#m/G# = Bbm/Ab** (since A# = Bb, G# = Ab)

So let's **respell everything in Ab**:

- G# → **Ab**  
- Fm/G# → **Fm/Ab**  
- Cdim/F# → Cdim/Gb (since F# = Gb)  
- A#m/G# → **Bbm/Ab**  
- F#6 → **Gb6**

Now the progression becomes:

- Ab  
- Ab  
- Fm/Ab  
- Fm/Ab  
- Cdim/Gb  
- Bbm/Ab  
- Ab  
- Ab  
- Fm/Ab  
- Fm/Ab  
- Ab  
- Ab  
- Gb6  
- Ab

This looks much more reasonable.

---

### Step 4: Analyze in **Ab major**

Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords:

- I: Ab  
- ii: Bbm  
- iii: Cm  
- IV: Db  
- V: Eb  
- vi: Fm  
- vii°: G°

Now check our chords:

- **Ab** = I ✓  
- **Fm/Ab** = vi chord in first inversion ✓  
- **Bbm/Ab** = ii chord with Ab bass → that’s a **ii6/5** (Bbm7 in first inversion) or just a slash chord; still diatonic  
- **Cdim/Gb** → Cdim is **vii° of Db**, but Gb is **bVII** in Ab major — not diatonic  
- **Gb6** = Gb major with added 6 (Eb). Gb is **bVII** in Ab major — common in pop/rock as modal mixture from Mixolydian or borrowed from minor.

So, we have mostly **diatonic chords from Ab major**, with some **borrowed or modal mixture** (Gb = bVII, common in rock/pop), and Cdim/Gb may be a passing chord.

But wait—**Fm** is **vi** in Ab major, which is minor, but appears frequently. The repeated **Ab - Fm/Ab** suggests a **plagal feel** (I - vi), which is common.

Also, **Gb6** (bVII) moving to **Ab** (I) is a classic **Mixolydian cadence** (bVII - I), common in rock.

So overall, the key is most likely **Ab major**, but with **modal mixture** from **Ab Mixolydian** (which has Gb instead of G natural).

But remember: the original notation used **G#**, not **Ab**.

Why would someone write G# instead of Ab?

Possibility: The music is in **G# Phrygian** or another mode where G# is the root and the scale includes F natural (which would be the b2 in G# Phrygian).

Let’s test **G# Phrygian**:

G# Phrygian scale: G# A B# C# D# E F#

Wait—that’s not right.

Phrygian mode is: 1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7

So **G# Phrygian** = G# **A** B C# D# E F#

(Note: B natural, not B#)

So notes: G# A B C# D# E F#

Chords:

- i: G#m  
- bII: A major  
- biii: B major  
- iv: C#m  
- v: D#m  
- bVI: E major  
- bVII: F# major

But our chords include **F minor**, which has **Ab and C**, but G# Phrygian has **A natural and B natural**, not Ab.

F minor = F Ab C → Ab is **not in G# Phrygian** (which has A natural, not Ab). So that doesn’t fit.

Alternatively, what if it's **G# harmonic minor**?

G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E **F##** (E#) — too sharp.

Not matching F natural.

So the presence of **F natural** (in Fm) and **G natural** (implied in Gb6 = F#6 = F# A# C# D# → wait, F#6 has D#, not G)

Hold on: **F#6 chord** = F# A# C# D# → all sharps. No G natural.

But **Cdim** = C Eb Gb (or C E G Bbb, but usually C Eb Gb)

So Cdim/F# = C Eb Gb / F# → but F# = Gb, so Cdim/Gb = Gb C Eb

That’s a diminished chord with a flatted fifth, etc.

Now, notice: **Fm** contains **Ab**, which is **G#** enharmonically.

So **Fm/G#** = G# (bass), F, Ab, C → spell that as: G# B#? No.

Actually, **Fm/G#** = G# F Ab C

But **G# and Ab are the same pitch**, so this chord is **Ab F Ab C** → which is just **F minor in first inversion**, as said.

So the entire progression makes more sense in **Ab**.

Also, **Gb6** = Gb Bb Db Eb → which is **bVII6** in Ab major.

So the progression is:

**Ab – Fm/Ab – (passing) – Bbm/Ab – Ab – Gb6 – Ab**

This strongly supports **Ab major** as the key.

But the original uses G#, suggesting perhaps the **composer is thinking in sharps**, or it’s in a **modal context**.

However, the **mode** appears to be **Ionian (major)** with **modal mixture** (borrowed bVII from Mixolydian).

So:

- **Key: Ab major** (or enharmonically G# major, but Ab is correct in standard theory)  
- **Mode: Major (Ionian)** with **Mixolydian flavor** due to bVII (Gb)

But since the question asks in the context of the given notation (G#), perhaps they expect **G# major**.

However, **G# major key signature is impractical** and almost never used.

In practice, any music with this chord set would be notated in **Ab major**.

But if forced to answer in the given spelling:

### Final Interpretation:

- **Tonal center**: G#  
- **Chord quality**: G# major  
- **Other chords**: Fm (vi in Ab), A#m (ii in Ab), F#6 (bVII in Ab)

So **the key is Ab major**, and the **mode is Ionian (major)**.

But **if adhering strictly to the given note names**, it’s **G# major**, though enharmonically equivalent to **Ab major**.

Given that **Fm** and **Cdim** contain **natural** notes incompatible with G# major (which would require F##), the only consistent interpretation is **Ab major**.

> ✅ **Answer: Key = Ab major (enharmonically G# major), Mode = Ionian (major)**  
> (In the context of the given chord symbols, it's best understood as **Ab major** with a **bVII (Gb) borrowed from Mixolydian**.)

If the question insists on keeping G# as the root:  
> **Key: G# (enharmonic to Ab), Mode: Major (with modal mixture)**

But standard music theory would respell this as **Ab major**.

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking**

### Reasoning

**Deciphering the Chords**

\n\n

I've started the chord analysis. The progression repeats, which is a good starting point. I'm focusing on identifying the function of each chord within the sequence, specifically looking at how the alterations from the original key add color and tension. I’ll map out potential key centers and look for any interesting secondary dominants.


**Mapping the Harmonic Landscape**

\n\n

I've made headway in determining the key and mode. The repeated G# at the beginning and end strongly suggests it's the tonic. Analyzing each chord's relationship to G# reveals a complex interplay. The Fm/G# seems to suggest a borrowed chord. Cdim/F# creates intriguing chromaticism. The supertonic minor (A#m/G#) reinforces a G# major or harmonic minor. I must now determine how to interpret the F#6.


**Unraveling Chord Functions**

\n\n

The analysis continues to evolve. That Fm/G# remains puzzling; it pulls hard away from a diatonic interpretation. I'm reassessing its potential function, perhaps as a borrowed chord from a parallel minor or some other related key. The diminished chord is also tricky, pushing towards harmonic minor territory. The F#6 adds a complex chromatic pull, and further exploration of this point is paramount.


**Confirming the Tonal Center**

\n\n

My current focus is on finding the most appropriate key signature. While G# is the root, I'm now certain that the overall framework is G# major, due to the prevalence of G# as the tonic. I'm exploring the implications of the F#6 and how it harmonizes with the rest of the key, especially when considering the diminished chord.


**Refining the Key Signature**

\n\n

My current key analysis leans definitively toward G# major, with a strong case for borrowing chords. I'm reassessing the function of the diminished and major sixth chords, and I'm looking at their impact on the overall harmonic direction. The repeated chord changes highlight a clear framework, allowing for deeper dives into the chromatic elements that give the progression its unique color.


**Unveiling the Key's Identity**

\n\n

My understanding solidified, the underlying key is undeniably G# major, with significant influences from modal borrowing. The diminished chord continues to suggest harmonic minor, but is best understood within the framework of a G# major, with a key focus on the implications of a $bVII$ chord. The challenge now is to determine how the unusual changes enhance the overall feel of the tonal center.


**Defining the Tonal Framework**

\n\n

My current focus is on the tonic's stability. After careful analysis, I've confirmed G# as the foundation, with the mode leaning heavily toward major, even if some of the chords don't seem to make sense. My analysis of the bVII (F#6) makes me believe it's borrowed, adding a sense of modal color. I must now reassess the progression and all its complexities.


**Reassessing Chord Functions**

\n\n

My current focus is interpreting the diminished chord, particularly the F# bass. The bVII chord adds a unique color, likely borrowed from the parallel minor or the Mixolydian mode. While G# is the root, its major tonality is evident. I'm carefully evaluating how these borrowed chords affect the overall feel, making sure the key remains stable.




The tonal center of the progression is clearly **G#**, as it is the starting, ending, and most frequently used chord.

To determine the key and mode accurately, it is helpful to analyze the chords using the enharmonic equivalent **Ab Major**, as this simplifies the relationship between the chord voicings (Fm, A#m) and the tonic.

1.  **Tonic Center:** G# Major (Ab Major)

2.  **Chromatic Analysis (using Ab Major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G):**
    *   **G# (Ab):** Tonic ($\text{I}$) – Major
    *   **Fm/G# (Fm/Ab):** Submediant minor ($\text{vi}$) – Diatonic to Major
    *   **A#m/G# (Bbm/Ab):** Supertonic minor ($\text{ii}$) – Diatonic to Major
    *   **F\#6 (Gb6):** Subtonic/Flat VII ($\text{bVII}$) – Borrowed (Modal Mixture)
    *   **Cdim/F\# (Cdim/Gb):** This chord (C-Eb-Gb) combines degrees $b\text{III}$, $\text{V}$, and $b\text{VII}$. This often functions as a highly chromatic passing chord or is borrowed from the parallel natural minor ($\text{Ab}$ Minor).

3.  **Mode Determination:**
    The core chords ($\text{I}$, $\text{ii}$, $\text{vi}$) are strongly diatonic to the **Major** key. However, the presence of the **F\#6 ($\text{bVII}$)** chord, which is heavily featured late in the progression, indicates borrowing from the parallel minor scale (Mixolydian or Natural Minor).

**Conclusion:**

*   **Key:** **G-sharp Major** (or Ab Major)
*   **Mode:** **Major** (with strong modal mixture/borrowing of the $b\text{VII}$ degree).

The given sequence of chords is:

G\# | G\# | Fm/G\# | Fm/G\# | Cdim/F\# | A\#m/G\# | G\# | G\# | Fm/G\# | Fm/G\# | G\# | G\# | F\#6 | G\#

To determine the key and mode, let's analyze the chords and their roots in the context of common scales.

### 1. Chord Roots and Qualities

The roots of the chords are:
*   G\# (Major)
*   F (Minor) (Note: Fm/G\# implies an F minor triad, and the bass note G\# makes it part of the tonality).
*   C (Diminished)
*   A\# (Minor)
*   F\# (Major/Sixth)

The notes present in these triads (ignoring the bass inversion for a moment, as it heavily features G\#):

*   G\# Major: G\#, B\#, D\#
*   F Minor: F, A$\flat$, C (or E\#, G\#, B\# for theoretical consistency with G\# major)
*   C Diminished: C, E$\flat$, G$\flat$
*   A\# Minor: A\#, C\#, E\#
*   F\# Major/Sixth: F\#, A\#, C\#, D\#

### 2. Identifying the Tonal Center

The most prominent and resolving chord is clearly **G\# Major**. It appears most frequently, starts the progression, and ends the progression. This strongly indicates that **G\# is the tonic**.

### 3. Analyzing the Scale and Diatonic Chords

If G\# is the tonic, we look for a scale that accommodates the other major chords (Fm, A\#m, Cdim, F\#6).

A common theoretical key based on G\# tonic would be **G\# Major** (Key Signature: 8 sharps: Fx, Cx, Gx, D\#, A\#, E\#, B\#, G\#).

The diatonic chords in G\# Major are:
*   I: G\# Major (G\#, B\#, D\#) - **Present**
*   ii: A\# minor (A\#, C\#, E\#) - **Present (A\#m/G\#)**
*   iii: B\# minor (B\#, D\#, Fx)
*   IV: C\# Major (C\#, E\#, G\#)
*   V: D\# Major (D\#, Fx, A\#) (or D\#7)
*   vi: E\# minor (E\#, G\#, B\#)
*   vii°: Fx diminished (Fx, A\#, C\#)

Now let's examine the non-diatonic chords:

*   **Fm (F minor):** The notes are F, A$\flat$, C. In G\# Major, the note F is enharmonically E\# (subtonic). An F minor chord contains A$\flat$ (or G\#) and C. If we use the F minor spelling (F, A$\flat$, C), A$\flat$ is the lowered second degree relative to the scale's G\#. If we spell it E\# minor, the notes would be E\#, G\#, B\# (vi). The 'Fm' chord (F, A$\flat$, C) is actually very common as a borrowed chord in major keys, particularly the **i minor chord borrowed from the relative minor** (or parallel minor) when the tonic is interpreted as A$\flat$ Major (A$\flat$ is the enharmonic equivalent of G\#).

*   **Cdim (C diminished):** The notes are C, E$\flat$, G$\flat$. These notes are not diatonic to G\# Major. This chord typically functions as a chromatic chord, often a **secondary diminished chord** or part of a **Neapolitan progression** (though $VI_{b}$ is more common). Its function is highly unstable.

*   **F\#6 (F\# Major with a sixth):** The notes are F\#, A\#, C\#, D\#. The F\# Major triad is the lowered leading tone chord ($bVII$). This is a common borrowed chord, often called the **Subtonic Chord** (or a Mixolydian/Dorian chord), frequently used in pop/rock music to approach the tonic (V–I) or to resolve to the tonic directly.

### 4. Considering Modal Borrowing

Since the progression strongly establishes G\# as the tonic major chord (G\# Major), but frequently uses the $bVI$, $bVII$, and other borrowed chords, the key is definitively **G\# Major**.

However, the borrowed chords (Fm and F\#6) point toward modal mixture, specifically borrowing from the parallel minor or the Mixolydian or Dorian modes.

*   The F\# Major chord ($bVII$) is classic borrowed from **G\# Mixolydian**.
*   The overall stability of G\# Major (I) confirms the **Major quality**.

### Conclusion

The tonic is **G\#**, established by the clear primary emphasis and resolution to the G\# Major chord.

The **Key** is **G\# Major**.

The **Mode** is **Major** with significant **Modal Mixture** (or borrowing), primarily from the parallel Mixolydian (for the F\#6, $bVII$ chord). The use of these color chords is characteristic of "Pop Music Harmony" or "Neo-Riemannian" harmonic movement rather than strict diatonic functional harmony.

**Key and Mode:** **G\# Major** (with substantial Mixolydian/'Pop' borrowing).

The chords are:

G# – G# – Fm/G# – Fm/G# – Cdim/F# – A#m/G# – G# – G# – Fm/G# – Fm/G# – G# – G# – F#6 – G#

1. Interpret the symbols  
   - “/G#” just means the bass stays on G♯—it does not change the chord’s root.  
   - Cdim/F# is a C diminished triad (C-E♭-G♭) with F♯ in the bass; enharmonically that is F♯dim7 (F♯-A-C-E♭), the vii°7 of G♯ (resp. A♭).

2. Build a scale from the sounding notes  
   Taking every pitch that appears (all spelled with sharps for convenience) we get:  
   G♯ A♯ B♯(=C) C♯ D♯ E F♯ G♯  

   That is exactly the set of sharps that belongs to G♯ major (6♯), i.e. A♭ major.

3. Check the harmonic functions in that key  
   - G♯ maj = I  
   - Fm (F♯-A-C♯) = vi  
   - F♯dim7 (=Cdim/F♯) = vii°7/ii or simply vii°, a standard dominant substitute  
   - A♯m (B♭m) = ii  

   All chords are diatonic to G♯ (A♭) major.

4. Look for the dominant confirmation  
   The progression never actually states a D♯7 chord, but the repeated vii°7 on F♯ and the total absence of any flats or lowered 6th degree rule out the parallel natural minor; the tonic G♯ major is heard throughout.

Key: G♯ major (concert pitch A♭ major)  
Mode: major (ionian)

```

### 1. Identify likely tonic
- The chord **G# major** appears very frequently and often at structural cadences — strong indicator that the **tonic** is G#.
- Common chords relative to G#:
  - ii = A#m
  - iii = B#m (enharmonic to Cm)
  - IV = C#
  - V = D# or D#7
  - vi = Fm
  - vii° = Gdim

---

### 2. Look at the other chords
| Chord       | Typical function (in G# major or minor)                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fm/G#        | Fm is the vi chord in G# major, or iv in G# minor (with tonic pedal G#). |
| Cdim/F#      | C° would be vii° in D♭ major, or could be a passing diminished chord between Fm and A#m. The F# in the bass gives it a chromatic feel—non-diatonic. |
| A#m/G#       | A#m is ii minor in G# major, or iv in F# minor. Over G# it functions as a neighbor/passing sonority. |
| F#6          | F#6 could be interpreted as a chromatic subtonic (VII6) borrowed from the parallel minor (G# minor) or Mixolydian flavor. |

---

### 3. Pattern and modal coloring
- The overwhelming presence of **G# major** and **Fm (vi)** suggests G# *major* as the base key.
- The inclusion of **F#6** (a bVII chord) points toward **G# Mixolydian** inflection — where the 7th scale degree (F## = G natural) is lowered to F#.
- **Cdim/F#** can serve as a chromatic passing diminished chord.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Tonic (key center):** G#  
- **Mode:** Primarily **G# major**, with **Mixolydian** (bVII) coloration due to the F#6 chord.

**Therefore:** the progression is best described as **in G# major with a Mixolydian flavor**.

### Reasoning

First, I have this chord progression: G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#

I need to determine the key and mode. Let me list out the chords clearly:

- G#

- G#

- Fm/G# (which is F minor with G# in the bass)

- Fm/G#

- Cdim/F# (C diminished with F# in the bass)

- A#m/G# (A# minor with G# in the bass)

- G#

- G#

- Fm/G#

- Fm/G#

- G#

- G#

- F#6

- G#

The chords are written with bass notes, so I should consider the overall harmony. Let me interpret the chords based on their root positions or functions.

Starting with G#. G# could be a chord, but in context, it might be G# major or something. Since it's just written as G#, I'll assume it's a G# major chord for now.

Similarly, Fm/G# is F minor with G# bass. But G# is not in the F minor chord, so this might be a slash chord indicating a different root. F minor chord is F, Ab, C. But G# is the same as Ab, so Fm/G# could be F minor with Ab in the bass, which is essentially an F minor chord in first inversion? Let's see: F minor chord notes: F, Ab, C. With Ab in the bass, it's Fm/Ab, which is common. But here it's written as G#, which is enharmonic to Ab, so yes, Fm/G# is F minor with Ab in the bass.

Similarly, Cdim/F#: C diminished chord is C, Eb, Gb. With F# in the bass, F# is enharmonic to Gb, so Cdim/F# might be C diminished with Gb in the bass, but that could be confusing. Cdim chord is often symmetric, but with F# bass, it might be functioning as something else.

A#m/G#: A# minor chord is A#, C#, E#? Wait, A# minor is A#, C#, E#? But E# is F, so A# minor is A#, C#, F. With G# in the bass, G# is enharmonic to Ab.

This is getting messy with enharmonic equivalents. I should think in terms of keys to avoid confusion.

Let me consider the key signature. The chords have G#, F#, A#, etc. This suggests a key with several sharps. G# is the tonic? Let's see the progression.

I recall that in music theory, chords are often analyzed in relation to a key center. Let me list the chord roots from the progression, ignoring the bass notes for now, and focus on the chord qualities.

The chords are:

- G# (probably major)

- Fm (minor)

- Cdim (diminished)

- A#m (minor)

- F#6 (F# major with added 6th? F#6 chord is F#, A#, C#, D#)

But let's list all chord symbols:

- G# : likely G# major

- Fm/G# : F minor with G# bass

- Cdim/F# : C diminished with F# bass

- A#m/G# : A# minor with G# bass

- F#6 : F# major 6th

And repeated G# and Fm/G#.

Now, to find the key, I need to see which scale these chords fit into.

Let me consider the possibility that G# is the tonic. If G# is I, then what are the other chords?

Fm is F minor, which in G# major? G# major scale is G# A# B# C# D# E# F##? That's messy because G# major has 8 sharps, which is impractical. Usually, keys with many sharps are written enharmonically as flat keys.

For example, G# major is enharmonic to Ab major. Similarly, F# major is enharmonic to Gb major.

So let's convert everything to flat keys for simplicity.

G# is enharmonic to Ab.

Fm is F minor, which is the same.

Cdim is C diminished.

A#m is A# minor, which is enharmonic to Bb minor.

F#6 is F# major 6th, enharmonic to Gb major 6th.

But let's think in Ab major. If the tonic is Ab, then Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords in Ab major:

I: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii: Gdim

Now look at the chords in the progression: we have G# which is Ab, Fm which is Fm, Cdim which is Cdim, A#m which is Bbm, and F#6 which is Gb6.

In Ab major, Fm is the vi chord, Bbm is the ii chord, Gb is the bVI chord, which is not diatonic. Gb is not in Ab major scale; Ab major has G natural, so Gb is flat VII? Let's see.

Ab major has G natural, so Gb is lowered 7th, so it might be from another mode.

Cdim is not in Ab major; Ab major has Gdim, not Cdim.

Cdim would be the vii dim in Db major? Let's think differently.

Perhaps the key is not Ab major.

Another approach: let's list the notes involved in the chords.

First, G# chord: G# B# D#? But B# is C, D# is E? No, G# major chord is G#, B#, D#. But B# is C, and D# is E, so enharmonically, it's Ab, C, Eb.

Similarly, Fm chord: F, Ab, C

Fm/G# is Fm with G# bass, so notes: G# (bass), F, Ab, C. But G# is Ab, so essentially, it's Fm with Ab bass, which is the same as F minor chord in first inversion? F minor chord with Ab in bass is Fm/Ab, which is common.

But in terms of harmony, when we have Fm/Ab, it can be considered as a chord with Ab as the root, but the chord is still F minor.

Similarly, Cdim/F#: Cdim chord is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass, notes: F#, C, Eb, Gb. But F# and Gb are enharmonic, so this is Cdim with Gb bass, but Gb is part of the chord? Cdim is C, Eb, Gb, so with Gb in bass, it's Cdim/Gb, which is essentially the same chord since dim chords are symmetric.

But Cdim/F# might be interpreted as a different chord. For example, if we think of F# as the root, then C, Eb, Gb are b5, bb7, and b3? That would be F# diminished? Let's see: F# diminished chord is F#, A, C, Eb? No, F# diminished is F#, A, C, Eb? Actually, a diminished chord is made of minor thirds, so F# dim is F#, A, C, Eb? But Eb is D#? Standard F# diminished is F#, A, C, but since it's fully diminished, it would have Eb if it's seventh, but here it's Cdim, which is likely C diminished triad or seventh? The symbol is Cdim, which usually means diminished triad, but in context, it might be implied as seventh.

In chord progressions, dim chords are often used as leading tones or passing chords.

Now, A#m/G#: A#m chord is A#, C#, E# (which is F), so notes A#, C#, F. With G# bass, notes: G#, A#, C#, F. So this is A#m with G# in bass.

F#6 chord: F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#. So notes F#, A#, C#, D#.

Now, let's list all the roots and bass notes from the progression:

Chords: G#, Fm, Cdim, A#m, F#6

But with bass notes: when we have slash chords, the bass note might be changing the inversion or implying a different root.

For harmonic analysis, we should consider the chord root and the bass separately, but for key finding, we need the harmonic function.

Let me see the sequence: it starts with G# repeated, then Fm/G# repeated, then Cdim/F#, then A#m/G#, then back to G# repeated, Fm/G# repeated, then G# repeated, then F#6, and G#.

So the progression is centered around G#.

Also, it ends on G#, so G# is likely the tonic.

But what mode? If G# is tonic, then what scale?

Let's see the chords: Fm and A#m are used, which are minor chords.

In G# major, the diatonic chords would be: I G#, ii A#m, iii B#m, IV C#, V D#, vi E#m, vii F##dim.

But we have Fm, which is not in G# major; Fm would be F Ab C, while in G# major, E#m is F minor? E# is F, so E#m is E# G# B#, which is F G# B#? B# is C, so E#m is F, G#, C? But F minor is F, Ab, C, so it's different because of the Ab vs G#.

G# is enharmonic to Ab, so in G# major, the mediant chord is B#m which is Cm, but here we have Fm, which has Ab, so it's not diatonic.

Perhaps it's G# minor? Let's check G# minor scale. G# minor is relative to B major, so G# minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#? But G# minor harmonic would have F##, but let's see diatonic chords in G# natural minor: i G#m, ii° A#dim, III B, iv C#m, v D#m, VI E, VII F#.

But in the progression, we have G# major, not minor, because it's written as G#, which implies major, and Fm, which is minor, but in G# minor, i is minor, so G# major would not be i.

The chord G# is written as G#, which typically means major triad, so it's G# major chord.

So if tonic is G# major, then the chords should fit into G# major, but Fm doesn't fit, A#m does fit as ii, but Cdim doesn't fit, and F#6 doesn't fit.

F#6 is F# A# C# D#, which in G# major, D# is the fifth, so F# A# C# D# is F# major with added 6th, but in G# major, F# is the leading tone? In G# major, the seventh scale degree is F##, not F#. So F# is not diatonic.

This is confusing. Let's think enharmonically.

Let me assume the key is Ab major for simplicity.

So Ab major scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cm, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii° Gdim.

Now look at the chords in progression: G# is Ab, so I.

Fm is Fm, which is vi.

A#m is Bbm, which is ii.

Cdim is Cdim, which is not diatonic; in Ab major, we have Gdim, not Cdim.

Cdim would be the vii° of Db major? Or perhaps it's a passing chord.

F#6 is Gb6, which is Gb Bb Db Eb? Gb major chord with added 6th: Gb, Bb, Db, and Eb is the 6th. But in Ab major, Eb is the fifth, so Gb Bb Db Eb is Gb major 6th, but Gb is not in Ab major; it's the bVI chord, which is common in borrowed chords or modal mixture.

Similarly, Cdim might be a secondary dominant or something.

But let's see the progression: after Fm/G#, which is Fm/Ab, so vi chord in first inversion? In Ab major, vi is Fm, so Fm/Ab is Fm with Ab in bass, which is actually the I chord in bass? When we play Fm/Ab, it sounds like Ab with Fm above, but since Fm is vi, it's common to have vi in first inversion.

Similarly, A#m/G# is Bbm/Ab, which is ii chord with tonic in bass? Bbm/Ab means Bbm with Ab bass, so notes Ab, Bb, Db, F. In Ab major, this could be considered as I with added notes or something, but functionally, it might be ii chord over tonic pedal.

Then Cdim/F#: Cdim with F# bass. F# is Gb, so Cdim/Gb. Cdim is C, Eb, Gb, so with Gb bass, it's the same chord in first inversion? Cdim chord has Gb, so with Gb bass, it's Cdim/Gb, which is standard.

But what is Cdim in Ab major? Cdim is not diatonic. Cdim could be a common-tone diminished chord or something.

Perhaps the key is F minor? Let's check.

If F minor is i, then G# is not in F minor. F minor scale: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb? But G# is Ab, so G# is the mediant? In F minor, III is Ab major, so G# is Ab major, which is III.

Then Fm is i, but here Fm is played with G# bass, so i with III in bass? That might be possible.

Then Cdim/F#: Cdim is not in F minor; in F minor, the diminished chords are ii° Gdim, vii° Edim, etc.

A#m is Bbm, which is iv in F minor? In F minor, iv is Bbm, so yes, Bbm is iv.

Then F#6 is Gb6, which is bVI in F minor? In F minor, bVI is Gb major, so Gb6 is bVI with 6th.

But the progression starts and ends with G# which is Ab major, so if F minor is key, why does it start with Ab? That would be III, which is common in minor keys, but usually, it starts with i, not III.

In the progression, G# appears multiple times, and it ends with G#, so it seems like G# is the tonic.

Let's list the chord roots in order: G#, G#, Fm, Fm, Cdim, A#m, G#, G#, Fm, Fm, G#, G#, F#6, G#

So the roots are: G#, F, C, A#, F, G#, F#? But Fm and A#m are chords, so roots F and A#.

So roots: G#, F, C, A#, F, G#, F#? From the sequence: after Cdim and A#m, it goes to G#, so roots: G#, F, C, A#, G#, F, G#, F#? Let's list based on chord symbols:

- Chord 1: G# root

- Chord 2: G# root

- Chord 3: Fm root

- Chord 4: Fm root

- Chord 5: Cdim root

- Chord 6: A#m root

- Chord 7: G# root

- Chord 8: G# root

- Chord 9: Fm root

- Chord 10: Fm root

- Chord 11: G# root

- Chord 12: G# root

- Chord 13: F#6 root

- Chord 14: G# root

So the roots are primarily G# and F, with C and A# and F# appearing once.

So G# is dominant, and F is also frequent.

Now, the bass notes: for Fm, the bass is G#, for A#m, the bass is G#, for Cdim, the bass is F#.

So in many cases, the bass is on G# or F#, which suggests a pedal point or ostinato.

In fact, from the slash chords, when we have Fm/G#, it means the bass is playing G# while Fm chord is played, similarly for A#m/G#, bass is G#.

And for Cdim/F#, bass is F#.

And the plain G# chords have G# bass.

So overall, the bass is often G#, and sometimes F#.

So G# is a persistent bass note, which suggests that G# is the tonic pedal.

In music, when there is a pedal point, the key might be centered around that pedal note.

So likely, G# is the tonic.

But what scale? Let's see the chords over G# bass.

When bass is G#, the chords are G#, Fm, A#m, and also G# alone.

So over G# bass, we have G# major, F minor, A# minor.

What scale has G# major, F minor, and A# minor? 

G# major chord: G# B# D# → G# C D#? B# is C, D# is E, so notes G# C E? But C is not typically in G# major; let's use flats.

G# major chord: Ab C Eb

F minor chord: F Ab C

A# minor chord: Bb Db F? A#m is A# C# E# → A# C# F? But C# is Db, F is F, so Bb Db F.

So over Ab bass (G#), we have chords Ab C Eb (Ab major), F Ab C (F minor), and Bb Db F (Bb minor).

So the chords are Ab major, F minor, and Bb minor.

Now, what key has I, vi, and ii? In Ab major, I is Ab, vi is Fm, ii is Bbm, so yes! In Ab major, the chords are I, vi, and ii.

And in the progression, we have Fm/G# which is vi/I, and A#m/G# which is ii/I, meaning that the vi and ii chords are played over the tonic pedal.

So that makes sense.

Now, what about Cdim/F#? Cdim is C Eb Gb, and bass is F# which is Gb, so Cdim/F# is Cdim with Gb bass, which is essentially the same as Cdim/Gb.

But what is Cdim in Ab major? In Ab major, the diatonic diminished chord is Gdim, which is G Bb Db, but here we have Cdim, which is C Eb Gb.

C Eb Gb is the same as B D F? No, C Eb Gb is a diminished triad.

In Ab major, Cdim is not diatonic, but it might be used as a passing chord or as a secondary leading tone chord.

Notice that Cdim has Eb and Gb, and Ab major has Eb and Gb? Ab major has Eb as V, but Gb is not in the scale; Ab major has G natural, so Gb is flat 7? But in context, Cdim might be functioning as a chord leading to Bbm.

Cdim to Bbm: Cdim has C Eb Gb, Bbm has Bb Db F. The notes C to Bb, Eb to Db, Gb to F, so all moving down by half step, which is typical for diminished chords resolving to minor chords.

So Cdim is like a secondary leading tone chord to Bbm. In key of Ab, Bbm is ii, so Cdim could be the vii°/ii, which is the diminished chord of the ii key.

In key of Bb minor, the vii° chord would be A dim, but here it's Cdim, which is not vii° of Bb minor. Let's see the scale of Bb minor.

Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab? But vii° would be A dim? A dim is A C Eb, but here we have Cdim, which is C Eb Gb.

In Bb harmonic minor, the vii° is A dim, which is A C Eb, so not Cdim.

Cdim is actually the same as A dim? A dim is A C Eb, and C dim is C Eb Gb, which is different.

But notice that Cdim and A dim share two notes? A dim has A C Eb, C dim has C Eb Gb, so they are different.

Perhaps Cdim is an altered chord.

Another thought: Cdim/F# with F# bass. F# is Gb, so if we consider the chord as F# dim? F# dim chord is F# A C, but here we have C Eb Gb with F# bass, so notes F# C Eb Gb. If we rearrange, F# A C Eb would be F# fully diminished, but here we have C Eb Gb, which is C dim, and F# is added, so it might be F# diminished seventh chord? F# diminished seventh is F# A C Eb, but here we have C Eb Gb, and F# bass, so if we include the bass, the chord is F# C Eb Gb, which is F# A C Eb if A is implied? But A is not present? In a diminished seventh chord, all notes are minor thirds apart. F# to A is minor third, A to C is minor third, C to Eb is minor third, so F# A C Eb is fully diminished. But in this case, we have F# C Eb Gb. F# to C is diminished fifth, C to Eb is minor third, Eb to Gb is minor third, so it's not a standard stack of minor thirds. From F# to C is dim fifth, which is equivalent to minor third? F# to A is minor third, A to C is minor third, so F# to C is tritone, which is two minor thirds? No, two minor thirds are a diminished fifth, so F# to C is diminished fifth, which is equivalent to two minor thirds: F# to A is min3, A to C is min3, so F# to C is dim5. Similarly, C to Eb is min3, Eb to Gb is min3, so from F# to Gb is diminished seventh? Let's list the intervals from F#: F# to C is dim5, F# to Eb is major sixth? This is messy.

Perhaps for practical purposes, Cdim/F# can be heard as a F# half-diminished or something? But Cdim is a diminished triad, so with F# bass, it might be functioning as a dominant of something.

Notice that in the progression, after Cdim/F#, it goes to A#m/G# which is Bbm/Ab.

So Cdim/F# to Bbm/Ab.

The bass moves from F# to G#? F# to G# is whole step, but in the chord, bass is F# for Cdim and G# for A#m, so bass movement F# to G#.

But in terms of chord roots, C to Bb, which is half step down.

Now, in Ab major, the chord Bbm is ii, and Cdim might be used as a chromatic approach to ii.

Another possibility: Cdim is actually the same as G#dim? G#dim chord is G# B D F, but here we have Cdim which is C Eb Gb, and G# is Ab, so C Eb Gb is enharmonic to C Eb F#? But F# is Gb, so C Eb Gb is not the same as G# B D F.

Let's list the notes of Cdim/F#: notes played are F# (bass), C, Eb, Gb. So notes F#, C, Eb, Gb.

In Ab major, these notes are: F# is Gb, which is not in scale, C is in scale, Eb is in scale, Gb is not in scale. So it's chromatic.

But perhaps this chord is acting as a diminished chord leading to Bbm. The notes F# and Gb are the same, so from F# to G? In Bbm, the notes are Bb Db F, so from F# to F? F# to F is half step, from C to Bb is half step, from Eb to Db is half step, from Gb to F is half step? But Gb to F is half step only if Gb is F#? In equal temperament, Gb and F# are the same, so yes, all notes move down by half step to Bbm: F# to F, C to Bb, Eb to Db, Gb to F. But Gb to F is the same as F# to F? In terms of pitch, F# is higher than F, so F# to F is down half step, similarly Gb to F is down half step since Gb is F#.

So indeed, Cdim/F# has all notes resolving down by half step to Bbm/Ab. So it's a classic diminished chord resolution.

Therefore, Cdim/F# is functioning as a passing diminished chord to ii.

Now, finally, F#6 chord: F#6 is F# A# C# D#. Enharmonically, Gb Bb Db Eb.

In Ab major, this is Gb major with added 6th, which is the bVI chord. bVI is common in popular music and rock, often used as a submediant chord in major keys, borrowed from parallel minor.

So in this case, F#6 is bVI in Ab major.

And it resolves to G# which is I.

So the progression makes sense in Ab major.

Therefore, the key is Ab major.

But the chords are written with sharps, so in terms of notation, it might be written in G# major, but as we know, G# major is enharmonic to Ab major, and Ab major is more common because it has only four flats, while G# major has eight sharps.

So in practice, the key is Ab major.

But let's confirm the mode: it's major mode, since the tonic chord is major.

So key: Ab major

Mode: major

But in the progression, we have minor chords vi and ii, which are diatonic, and bVI which is borrowed, but overall, it's major.

So for the answer, I think key is G# major enharmonic to Ab major, but since the chords are written with sharps, perhaps we should say key of G# major.

But in the question, the chords are written with G#, F#, etc., so likely the key is G# major.

But let's see the first chord: G#, and last chord G#, so tonic is G#.

So key: G# major

But in G# major, the chords Fm and A#m are not diatonic? In G# major, Fm would be? G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F##, so chords: I G#, ii A#m, iii B#m, IV C#, V D#, vi E#m, vii F##dim.

E#m is Fm? E#m is E# G# B#, which is F G# C? But F minor is F Ab C, so since G# is Ab, then E#m is F Ab C? But Ab is G#, so yes, E#m is F G# C, which is F major? No, F G# C is not a standard chord; F G# C would be F augmented if G# is sharp, but in E#m, it should be E# G# B#, and B# is C, so E# G# C, which is a minor triad because E# to G# is minor third, and G# to B# is major third? No, from E# to G#: E# is F, G# is Ab, so F to Ab is minor third, and Ab to C is major third, so it is a minor triad? Minor triad has root, minor third, perfect fifth. Here, if root is E# (F), then minor third is G# (Ab), and fifth is B# (C), so yes, it is a minor triad: F Ab C, which is F minor! So in G# major, the vi chord is E#m, which is F minor enharmonically.

Similarly, ii chord is A#m, which is A# C# E#, and E# is F, so A# C# F, which is A# minor.

And Cdim? In G# major, the vii dim is F##dim, which is F## A# C#, but F## is G, so G A# C#, which is G dim? But we have Cdim, which is C Eb Gb, so not the same.

But in the progression, we have Cdim/F#, which we interpreted as a secondary chord.

In G# major, Cdim would be not diatonic, but as we said, it resolves to A#m.

So in G# major, A#m is ii, and Cdim is like a secondary leading tone to ii, so it would be the vii°/ii, which in the key of A# minor, the vii° chord would be G##dim? Let's see.

In key of A# minor, the harmonic minor scale would have G## as leading tone? A# harmonic minor: A# B# C# D# E# F# G##? G## is A, so vii° is G##dim which is A C# E#? But we have Cdim which is C Eb Gb, which is not the same.

C Eb Gb is enharmonic to B# D# F##? This is too messy.

To avoid confusion, it's better to use Ab major.

So in Ab major, we have I Ab, vi Fm, ii Bbm, and then Cdim as vii°/ii, and bVI Gb.

So for the purpose of this question, I'll go with key of Ab major.

But since the chords are written with sharps, perhaps the key is G# major, but with understanding that it's enharmonic.

In music theory, when chords have many sharps, it's often notated as flats for readability.

So for the answer, I'll state the key as G# major.

But let's see the F#6 chord: in G# major, F#6 would be the VII chord? But in major, VII is usually minor or diminished, but F#6 is major, so it's bVII? In G# major, the seventh scale degree is F##, so F# is lowered, so it's bVII, which is common in rock music.

But in this case, from the progression, it seems more like bVI in Ab major.

In G# major, bVI would be E major? Let's calculate.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F##

bVI would be E major? E major is E G# B, but in G# major, bVI would be the chord from the parallel minor? G# minor scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#, so bVI would be E major? E G# B, but we have F#6 which is F# A# C# D#, so in G# minor, F# is VII, which is F# major, and F#6 is F# major with 6th, so it's VII6, which is common.

But in the progression, we have G# major chords, so it's major key with borrowed chords.

So in G# major, the chords are I, vi, ii, and then vii°/ii, and bVII.

But bVII is F# major, which is not bVI; bVI would be E major.

So in this case, F#6 is bVII6 in G# major.

But in the resolution, from F#6 to G#, it's bVII to I, which is a common rock progression.

So it works.

But in our earlier Ab major interpretation, F#6 is Gb6, which is bVI, and bVI to I is also common.

So both work, but in Ab major, bVI to I is more common in pop music, while in G# major, bVII to I is common in rock.

But let's see the chord qualities: in Ab major, bVI is Gb major, which is a major chord, and it resolves to Ab major. Similarly, in G# major, bVII is F# major, resolving to G# major.

But in the chord, it's F#6, which is still major with added 6th, so functionally similar.

Now, which one is more consistent? In Ab major, we have Fm which is vi, and Bbm which is ii, which are diatonic, while in G# major, vi is E#m which is Fm, and ii is A#m, which are diatonic, so both have diatonic vi and ii.

The difference is in the diminished chord and the last chord.

In Ab major, Cdim is not diatonic but used as vii°/ii, which is fine.

In G# major, Cdim is not diatonic, and it would be vii°/ii only if we consider the key of A# minor, but in A# minor, vii° should be G##dim, which is A dim, not C dim.

So it doesn't fit perfectly.

In Ab major, for ii chord Bbm, the vii° chord should be A dim, but here we have Cdim, which is not A dim.

Cdim is actually the same as A dim only if we consider diminished seventh chords, but for triads, they are different.

C dim triad is C Eb Gb, A dim triad is A C Eb, so they share two notes, but are different roots.

In practice, when we have a diminished chord, it can function in multiple ways.

Notice that Cdim has Eb and Gb, which are the third and fifth of Ab? No, Ab major has C Eb G, so Eb is common, but Gb is not.

Another thought: Cdim/F# with F# bass might be heard as F# half-diminished seventh? F# half-diminished is F# A C E, but here we have C Eb Gb, so if we have F# A C Eb, it would be F# half-diminished, but in this case, we have F# C Eb Gb, which is missing A? So it's not F# half-diminished.

Perhaps it's G# diminished seventh? G# diminished seventh is G# B D F, but here we have C Eb Gb, which is not the same.

Let's list the notes of Cdim/F# again: F# C Eb Gb. If we rearrange, from F#: F# to Gb is minor second? But in terms of chord, if we consider it as a diminished seventh chord, it should have four notes minor thirds apart. F# to A is min3, A to C is min3, C to Eb is min3, so F# A C Eb is diminished seventh. But here we have F# C Eb Gb. F# to C is dim5, which is equivalent to min3 from A? No.

F# to C is 6 half steps, which is two min3? F# to A is 3 half steps, A to C is 3 half steps, so F# to C is 6 half steps, which is dim5. Similarly, C to Eb is 3 half steps, Eb to Gb is 3 half steps, so from F# to Gb is 11 half steps? This is not a standard diminished seventh chord.

Perhaps it is a rootless chord or something.

In context, since the bass is F#, and the chord is Cdim, it might be intended to be heard as a F#7b9 without root? But F#7b9 is F# A# C# E G, but here we have C Eb Gb, so not matching.

Another idea: Cdim/F# might be a misnotation for F#dim? But it's written as Cdim/F#.

Perhaps in the progression, Cdim/F# is actually functioning as a dominant of Bbm.

Let's think about the voice leading. When moving from Cdim/F# to Bbm/Ab, the bass moves from F# to G#, which is whole step, but the chord tones move as above: C to Bb, Eb to Db, Gb to F, so all stepwise down.

So regardless of the theory, it works practically.

So for the key, based on the tonic pedal and the chords I, vi, ii, it is clearly Ab major.

Therefore, I'll go with key of Ab major.

But since the question has G# chords, I'll state the key as G# major, but know that it's equivalent to Ab major.

So for the answer, key: G# major

Mode: major

But let's see the F#6 chord: in G# major, F# is the seventh scale degree, but lowered, so it's mixolydian? But mixolydian has b7, but here the tonic is G# major, and we have F# major chord, which is bVII, so it could be mixolyd mode if all chords are diatonic, but here we have minor vi and ii, which are diatonic in major, so it's not mixolydian; mixolydian has minor vii, but here vii is not used, and we have bVII, which is from mixolydian? In mixolydian, the VII chord is major? Let's see G# mixolydian scale: based on C# major? No, mixolydian is mode of major scale with fifth as tonic? G# mixolydian would be the fifth mode of C# major? C# major scale: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#? So G# mixolydian: G# A# B# C# D# E# F#? So scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F#? But B# is C, E# is F, F# is F#, so notes G# A# C C# D# F F#? This has both C and C#, F and F#, so it's not heptatonic? I think I confused myself.

G# mixolydian means tonic is G# and scale has major third, so from G# to G# with intervals: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole? So G# A# B# C# D# E# F# G#? But B# is C, E# is F, so notes G# A# C C# D# F F# G#? This has two C's and two F's? No, from G# to A# is whole, A# to B# is whole, B# to C# is half? B# to C# is half step? B# is C, C# is C#, so from C to C# is half step, yes. Then C# to D# whole, D# to E# whole, E# to F# half? E# is F, F# is F#, so from F to F# is half step, then F# to G# whole. So scale: G# A# C C# D# F F# G#? But this has C and C# which are adjacent, so it's not a standard scale; it has all notes chromatic? No, let's list the scale degrees: 1 G#, 2 A#, 3 B# (C), 4 C#, 5 D#, 6 E# (F), 7 F#, 8 G#. So the notes are G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, F#. So there are seven notes, but C and C# are both present, which means it has both natural and sharp notes? This is why mixolydian on G# is not practical; it's better to use Ab mixolydian.

Ab mixolydian: from Db major scale? Db major: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C, so Ab mixolydian: Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab? So notes Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb? So b7 is Gb, which is F# enharmonically.

So in Ab mixolydian, the VII chord is Gb major, which is bVII.

So in this case, if the key is Ab mixolydian, then I is Ab, VII is Gb, which matches F#6.

But in mixolydian, the iii chord is diminished, and here we have ii chord which is Bbm, which in Ab mixolydian, ii is Bbm, since scale has Bb, so ii is minor, yes. And vi is Fm, which in Ab mixolydian, vi is Fm? Ab mixolydian scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb, so chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cdim, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii Gb? vii is Gb major? In mixolydian, the vii chord is major? Let's see: from scale, seventh degree is Gb, so chord Gb Bb Db, which is Gb major, so yes, vii is major in mixolydian.

But in our progression, we have Cdim, which is not diatonic to Ab mixolydian; in Ab mixolydian, iii is Cdim, so if we have Cdim, it could be the iii chord, but in the progression, Cdim appears before A#m which is Bbm, so if Cdim is iii, then iii to ii is common.

In Ab mixolydian, iii is Cdim, and ii is Bbm, so iii to ii is a common progression.

And then we have Fm which is vi, and G# which is I, and F#6 which is VII6.

So in this case, the progression fits perfectly in Ab mixolydian mode.

Let's verify:

- I: Ab (G#)

- vi: Fm (diatonic in mixolydian? In Ab mixolydian, vi is Fm, yes, because sixth degree is F, so Fm chord is F Ab C, and since scale has Ab, C, and F, so F minor is indeed the vi chord in Ab mixolydian? Let's see the chord built on sixth degree: scale degrees: 1 Ab, 2 Bb, 3 C, 4 Db, 5 Eb, 6 F, 7 Gb. So chord on 6: F Ab C? But F to Ab is minor third, Ab to C is major third, so it is a minor chord? Yes, F minor is the vi chord.

Similarly, chord on 2: Bb Db F? Bb to Db is minor third, Db to F is major third, so Bbm, yes.

Chord on 3: C Eb Gb? C to Eb is minor third, Eb to Gb is minor third, so diminished chord, Cdim, yes.

So in Ab mixolydian, the chords are I Ab, ii Bbm, iii Cdim, IV Db, V Eb, vi Fm, vii Gb.

Now in our progression, we have: G# (I), Fm/G# (vi with I bass), Cdim/F# (iii with VII bass? But iii is Cdim, and VII is Gb, so Cdim with Gb bass? But Cdim/Gb is the first inversion of Cdim? In Cdim chord, the notes are C Eb Gb, so with Gb bass, it is root position? No, if root is C, then with Gb bass, it is second inversion? Let's see: Cdim chord has notes C Eb Gb, so if bass is Gb, it is the fifth of the chord, so it is second inversion? But in chord symbols, Cdim/Gb means C diminished with Gb in bass, so it is second inversion.

But in terms of function, it is still the iii chord.

And then A#m/G# which is Bbm with Ab bass, so ii with I bass.

Then G# I, then Fm/G# vi with I bass, then G# I, then F#6 which is Gb6, which is VII6, then G# I.

So the progression is: I, vi, iii, ii, I, vi, I, VII, I.

All chords are diatonic to Ab mixolydian except that the bass is often on I, which is a pedal point.

So this makes perfect sense.

Therefore, the key is Ab mixolydian.

But since the chords are written with sharps, it is G# mixolydian.

So for the answer, key: G# mixolydian.

But let's confirm the mode: mixolydian is a major mode with minor seventh.

In this case, the tonic chord is major, and the seventh chord is major, so yes.

So I think this is correct.

Therefore, for the given chord progression, the key is G# mixolydian.

So in the answer, I'll say key: G# mixolydian.

But to be precise, since the bass pedal is on G#, and the chords are from G# mixolydian scale.

So finally, the key and mode is G# mixolydian.

The chord progression provided is based on a G# pedal point (consistent bass note G#) and utilizes chords diatonic to the G# mixolydian mode. The G# mixolydian scale is derived from the C# major scale, with notes G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#. Enharmonically, this is equivalent to Ab mixolydian, but the chords are notated with sharps, so G# mixolydian is appropriate.

The chords in the progression function as follows:
- G# represents the I chord (tonic).
- Fm/G# is the vi chord (F minor) over the tonic pedal.
- Cdim/F# is the iii chord (C diminished) over the VII bass (F#).
- A#m/G# is the ii chord (A# minor) over the tonic pedal.
- F#6 is the VII chord (F# major with added 6th).

All chords are diatonic to G# mixolydian, confirming the key and mode.

**Key:** G# mixolydian  
**Mode:** Mixolydian (major mode with a minor seventh)

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## 1. List the chords clearly

The progression is:

G#  G#  Fm/G#  Fm/G#  Cdim/F#  A#m/G#  G#  G#  Fm/G#  Fm/G#  G#  G#  F#6  G#

We can first rewrite slash chords to understand their bass notes vs. chord quality:

- **G#** = G# major (G# B# D#)
- **Fm/G#** = F minor chord (F Ab C) over G# bass → Fm(add9)/G#? Actually G# is the 9th of Fm, so it's Fm9 without the 5th? Let's check: F Ab C G# → G# = Ab enharmonic, which is the minor 3rd of F? Wait, Ab is already in Fm (F-Ab-C). G# = Ab, so the bass is the same as the minor 3rd of the chord? That’s unusual — means the bass is the same pitch as the chord's Ab. So Fm/G# is just Fm with Ab in bass — but Ab is G# enharmonically, so it's actually Fm in first inversion: Fm/Ab. So they wrote Fm/G# meaning Fm/Ab.

So Fm/G# = Fm/Ab.

- **Cdim/F#** = C dim chord (C Eb Gb) over F# bass. Cdim = C Eb Gb (A? fully diminished would be C Eb Gb Bbb=A). But here bass is F#, which is the dim7 note if it were Cdim7 (C Eb Gb Bbb=A) — F# is enharmonic to Gb? No, F# is a half step above F, Gb is a half step above F? Wait, Gb = F#. So F# is the same as Gb, which is already in the chord (C Eb Gb). So Cdim/F# means Cdim with Gb in bass — but Gb is already the dim5 of Cdim, so it's just second inversion Cdim. But they wrote F# not Gb — so maybe they are thinking in key of G# minor? Let's keep going.

- **A#m/G#** = A# minor chord (A# C# E#) over G# bass. G# is the minor 7th of A#m, so it's A#m7 in third inversion.

- **F#6** = F# A# C# D#.

---

## 2. Look for tonal center

The progression starts and ends on G#, and G# appears many times. Likely tonic is G#.

Possible keys containing G# major: G# major (6 sharps) or E# minor (G# is mediant) — but more likely enharmonic to Ab major (4 flats) or F minor (Ab is relative major of F minor).

But G# major chord is I in G# major, but also V in C# major, but here it feels like tonic.

Fm chord in G# major? Fm = F Ab C. In G# major (G# A# B# C# D# E# Fx G#) — no F natural, so Fm is foreign. But if we think in G# minor (G# A# B C# D# E F# G#), Fm would be ♭VI chord (F Ab C) — yes, in G# minor, F is F natural, Ab = G#, C is C natural. But G# minor has F# and C# in natural minor, so F and C are from G# harmonic/melodic minor? Actually F is in G# natural minor? Let's check: G# natural minor: G# A# B C# D# E F# — F# not F. So F natural is ♭6 in G# minor — so Fm is ♭VI in G# minor.

So G# minor key:  
i = G#m  
♭VI = Fm  
etc.

But our first chord is G# **major**, not G# minor. So maybe we are in G# **harmonic minor** or G# **melodic minor**, where the I chord can be major (raised 7 → leading tone D#), common in minor keys.

So likely: **Key of G# minor**, using G# major chord (I major from harmonic minor).

---

## 3. Check other chords in G# minor context

G# minor scale (harmonic): G# A# B C# D# E F## (F## = G natural? Wait, F## is G? No, F## is enharmonic to G, but in G# minor harmonic, 7th is F## = G? Let's spell correctly: G# A# B C# D# E Fx (Fx = E#? No, Fx = G natural). Actually simpler: G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F## (F## = G). So chords:

G# major (I) = G# B# D# (B# = C, D#) — B# is C? Wait, B# is C natural, but in G# harmonic minor, the 7th is F## (G), and the 3rd of G# major is B# (C)? That’s wrong — 3rd of G# major is B# (C), but in G# harmonic minor, the leading tone is F## (G natural), so the triad G# B D# would be G# minor. For G# major, we need B#, not B. So G# major in G# harmonic minor is actually borrowing from major? No — in minor key, the I chord is only major if we use the Picardy third, but here it's throughout the progression, so maybe we are in G# **Mixolydian b6**? Or G# Dorian? Let's check F#6: F# A# C# D# — in G# minor, F# is VII (F# A# C#) is F# major, add D# (7th) = F#7. But they say F#6 = F# A# C# D#. D# is the major 6th of F#, but in G# minor, D# is the 5th of G# minor harmonic scale. So F#6 contains D# which is the leading tone in G# minor. So F#6 = F# A# C# D# = D# dim triad over F# bass? Actually F#6 = D#m7b5/F#.

So maybe key is G# minor but with major I (common in rock, minor key with major tonic).

---

## 4. Try enharmonic simplification

G# major = Ab major  
Fm/G# = Fm/Ab  
Cdim/F# = Cdim/Gb (since F#=Gb)  
A#m/G# = Bbm/Ab  
F#6 = Gb6

Rewriting in Ab for simplicity:

Ab  Ab  Fm/Ab  Fm/Ab  Cdim/Gb  Bbm/Ab  Ab  Ab  Fm/Ab  Fm/Ab  Ab  Ab  Gb6  Ab

Now in Ab major key:  
Ab = I  
Fm = vi  
Bbm = ii  
Gb6 = Gb Bb Db Eb — in Ab major, Gb is ♭VII, Gb6 is ♭VII6.

Cdim/Gb = Cdim/F# in original: C Eb Gb — that’s vii°7 rootless? Actually Cdim is symmetric. In Ab major, Cdim = ? It’s not in Ab major diatonically. But Cdim = Ebdim = Gbdim = Adim, all same notes. In Ab major, the leading tone is G, so Gdim would be vii° — but Cdim shares notes with Gdim7 (G Bb Db Fb) — no, not matching. Let's check: Cdim = C Eb Gb; Gdim7 = G Bb Db Fb(E); no common.

Better: Cdim/Gb = Gb C Eb — that’s Gb7(b9) without root? Actually Gb7 = Gb Bb Db Fb(E); Cdim = C Eb Gb — that’s the upper structure of Gb7b9: Gb Bb Db Fb A (Cbb) — messy.

But given the sound: Fm is vi in Ab major, but then Gb6 is ♭VII, common in Mixolydian or minor key bVII. So maybe mode is **Ab Mixolydian**? Ab Mixolydian scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb. Chords:  
I = Ab  
vi = Fm  
♭VII = Gb  
ii = Bbm (not in Mixolydian — Bbm would be biii in Ab major) — so Bbm is from Ab minor? So maybe Ab **Dorian**? Ab Dorian: Ab Bb Cb(Db?) wait, Ab Dorian: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F Gb — Cb = B. So Bbm (Bbm = Bb Db F) is ii in Ab Dorian. Yes! And Fm is vi in Ab Dorian? Let's check: In Ab Dorian, chords:  
i = Abm  
But we have Ab major, so maybe mixed Ab major and Ab Dorian? Actually if we take the progression: Ab, Fm, Bbm, Gb — all from Ab Dorian except Ab major instead of Abm. So they’re using a major I in a Dorian context — common in pop (major tonic with minor iv and minor ii).

So:  
Key = **Ab major with Dorian mixture** (borrowing Bbm, Fm from Ab Dorian).  
Gb6 is ♭VII from Mixolydian or Dorian (both have ♭VII).

---

## 5. Final answer

Given the original was in G# notation, the key is **G# major with Dorian mixture** — but functionally, the tonic is G# major, and the chords F#m (Fm enharmonic?), A#m, F#6 fit G# Dorian mode but with a major I.

So:

**Key: G# major (with modal mixture from G# Dorian)**  
**Mode: Mostly Dorian ♭3?** Wait, Dorian has minor tonic — but here tonic is major, so it's **Mixolydian**? Let's check: G# Mixolydian: G# A# B# C# D# E# F# — chords: I = G#, vi = Fm? No, Fm is F A C — not in G# Mixolydian. So not pure mode.

Given complexity, safest:  
**Key: G# major**  
**Modal color: Dorian b3?** No — actually they’re using Fm (♭VI in G# minor) and G# major tonic — that’s common in rock: minor key with major I — so it’s **G# minor key but with major I chord**, so the scale is **G# Mixolydian ♭6** (Fifth mode of C# melodic minor). Yes:  
C# melodic minor: C# D# E F# G# A# B#  
Fifth mode: G# A# B# C# D# E F# — that’s G# A# C C# D# E F# — so G# major with F natural and E natural — gives Fm and E chord? We have Fm and A#m and F#6. A#m = Bbm in Ab — in this scale, A#m not present (we need A# C# E# — but E#=F, so A# C# F = A# dim). So not quite.

Given time, the most consistent:  
**Tonal center: G#**  
**Mode: G# minor (but with Picardy third throughout — so G# major tonic in minor key)**  
Common in modern music: "Minor key with major tonic" — sometimes called "Major-minor" or "Hybrid mode".

    *   The chords are written with slash notation (e.g., `Fm/G#`). This means the chord is `F minor` with `G#` in the bass. This is a common way to indicate an inverted chord or a specific bass line movement.
    *   Let's identify the core chords, ignoring the bass notes for a moment:
        *   `G#` (major)
        *   `Fm` (minor)
        *   `Cdim` (diminished)
        *   `A#m` (minor)
        *   `F#6` (major 6th)
    *   The bass notes are `G#`, `G#`, `G#`, `F#`, `G#`, `G#`, `G#`, `G#`, `G#`, `G#`, `G#`. The bass line is heavily centered on `G#`, with a single move down to `F#`. This strongly suggests `G#` is the tonic or a very important tonal center.

3.  **Hypothesis 1: G# is the Tonic.**
    *   If `G#` is the tonic, what key are we in? Let's consider the major and minor keys.
    *   **G# Major:** The scale is G#-A#-B#-C#-D#-E#-Fx (F double sharp). Let's check the chords against this scale.
        *   `G#` (I): Yes, this is the tonic.
        *   `Fm`: The note F is not in G# major. The vi chord would be E#m. So, `Fm` is not diatonic to G# major. This is a big red flag.
        *   `Cdim`: The note C is not in G# major. The vii° chord would be Fx°. So, `Cdim` is not diatonic.
        *   `A#m`: This would be the ii chord in G# major. Yes, this is diatonic.
        *   `F#6`: The note F is not in G# major. The V chord would be D#. So, `F#6` is not diatonic.
    *   **Conclusion for G# Major:** Too many non-diatonic chords. Unlikely.

    *   **G# Minor:** The scale is G#-A#-B-C#-D#-E-F#. Let's check the chords against this scale (natural, harmonic, melodic).
        *   `G#` (i): Yes, this is the tonic.
        *   `Fm`: The note F is not in G# minor. The VII chord would be F# major (in harmonic/melodic minor) or F# diminished (in natural minor). `Fm` is non-diatonic. This is a problem.
        *   `Cdim`: The note C is not in G# minor. The ii° chord would be A# diminished. The iv chord would be C# minor. `Cdim` is non-diatonic.
        *   `A#m`: This would be the ii chord in G# minor (A# diminished in natural minor, A# major in harmonic/melodic). `A#m` is non-diatonic.
        *   `F#6`: This would be the VII chord in G# natural minor (F# diminished) or the VII chord in G# harmonic/melodic minor (F# major). `F#6` is a very plausible alteration of the F# major chord.
    *   **Conclusion for G# Minor:** Also has many non-diatonic chords. This is getting complicated. Maybe the key isn't G# major or minor.

4.  **Re-evaluating the Slash Chords:** The slash notation is crucial. I can't just ignore it. Let's analyze the chords *with* their bass notes.
    *   `G#`: A simple G# major chord. Root position.
    *   `Fm/G#`: This is an F minor triad (F-Ab-C) over a G# bass. Let's analyze the intervals from the bass note G#:
        *   G# to F is a minor 7th down (or a major 2nd up).
        *   G# to Ab is a minor 2nd up.
        *   G# to C is a perfect 4th up.
        *   The notes are G#, Ab, C, F. This is a very tense, dissonant chord. It sounds like a G#7(b9,b13) or something similar if you re-interpret it. Let's hold that thought.
    *   `Cdim/F#`: A C diminished triad (C-Eb-Gb) over an F# bass.
        *   F# to C is a tritone (augmented 4th).
        *   F# to Eb is a major 6th down (or minor 3rd up).
        *   F# to Gb is a minor 2nd up.
        *   The notes are F#, C, Eb, Gb. This is also very dissonant. It could be seen as an F#7(b9,sus4) or F#°7 type of sound.
    *   `A#m/G#`: An A# minor triad (A#-C#-E#) over a G# bass.
        *   G# to A# is a major 2nd up.
        *   G# to C# is a perfect 4th up.
        *   G# to E# is a major 6th up.
        *   The notes are G#, A#, C#, E#. This is a G#maj7#11 chord. G#-B#-D#-F#-A#. Wait, the notes are G#, A#, C#, E#. That's G#-A#-C#-E#. This is a G# Lydian chord (I7#11 in a Lydian context, or Imaj7#11). This is a strong clue!
    *   `F#6`: F#-A#-C#-D#. This is a standard major 6th chord.

5.  **Hypothesis 2: A different tonal center.**
    *   The `A#m/G#` chord being interpreted as `G#maj7#11` is a huge clue. The #11 (the note E#) is the defining characteristic of the Lydian mode.
    *   Let's test the **G# Lydian** hypothesis.
    *   The G# Lydian scale is the same as the C# major scale, but starting on G#. The notes are: G#-A#-B#-C#-D#-E#-F#.
    *   Let's re-examine the chords against the G# Lydian scale.
        *   `G#`: The I chord (Imaj7). Yes.
        *   `Fm/G#`: Let's look at the notes again: F-Ab-C over G#. The notes F and Ab are not in G# Lydian. This is a "borrowed" chord. Where would it come from? F minor is the iv chord in C# minor. Ab is the b6 of C# major. This is a chromatic mediant relationship. It's a common "color" chord. It functions as a backdoor dominant or a subdominant minor type of sound. It creates a lot of tension that resolves back to the tonic G#. This is very common in jazz, film music, and modern classical styles.
        *   `Cdim/F#`: The notes are C-Eb-Gb over F#. None of these (except F#) are in G# Lydian. Let's re-interpret this chord. F# is the V of G#. The chord `Cdim/F#` could be seen as an F#7b9 without the root. F#7 is F#-A#-C#-E#. F#7b9 is F#-A#-C#-E#-G. The notes we have are F# (bass), C, Eb, Gb. This doesn't quite line up. Let's try another interpretation. `Cdim` is the leading-tone chord to Db major. `F#` is the leading-tone chord to G major. This is a very chromatic chord. It's likely a passing chord or a way to get from one area to another. Let's look at its function. It moves to `A#m/G#`. The bass moves `F#` to `G#`. The chord `Cdim` (C-Eb-Gb) moves to `A#m` (A#-C#-E#). The note C is common. This is a chromatic passing chord.
        *   `A#m/G#`: As we established, this is `G#maj7#11`. The notes G#-A#-C#-E# are all in G# Lydian. This is the "money chord" that confirms the Lydian mode.
        *   `F#6`: The notes are F#-A#-C#-D#. All of these notes are in the G# Lydian scale. This is the Vmaj7 chord (Vmaj7 or V6) of the key. It strongly wants to resolve to the tonic G#.

6.  **Synthesizing the Analysis:**
    *   **Tonic:** The progression starts and ends on G#, and the bass line is dominated by G#. This points strongly to G# as the tonic.
    *   **Mode:** The presence of the `G#maj7#11` chord (realized as `A#m/G#`) and the `F#6` chord (Vmaj7) are hallmarks of the Lydian mode. The Lydian mode is characterized by a raised 4th degree. In G# Lydian, the 4th degree is C#, and the raised 4th is D# (or E#, depending on enharmonic spelling). Wait, let me correct that. The 4th degree of G# is C#. The raised 4th is C## (C double sharp). The `A#m/G#` chord gives us the notes G#-A#-C#-E#. The E# is the #11 of the G# root. Yes, that's correct. G#(1) - A#(2) - B#(3) - C#(4) - D#(5) - E#(6) - F#(7). The #11 is the same as the #4. So the note is C##. The chord `A#m/G#` contains the notes G#, A#, C#, E#. The E# is the raised 6th. The C# is the natural 4th. Hmm. Let me re-think the `G#maj7#11` analysis.
    *   `A#m/G#` = G# in the bass, A#-C#-E# on top. The notes are G#, A#, C#, E#. Let's build a G# Lydian chord: G#-B#-D#-F#-A#-C##-E#. The `A#m/G#` chord doesn't contain the 3rd (B#) or 5th (D#) of the G# Lydian tonic chord. It contains the root (G#), the 2nd (A#), the 4th (C#), and the 6th (E#). This is a very common Lydian "voicing" - often a `Iadd2(4,6)` or a `Isus2(add6,4)`. The crucial part is that it uses the *natural 4th (C#)*, which is characteristic of Lydian, as opposed to the raised 4th (C##). Wait, no, Lydian has a *raised* 4th. The major scale has a natural 4th. G# Major has a C#. G# Lydian has a C##. The chord `A#m/G#` uses C#, the *natural 4th*. This is characteristic of the **Lydian Dominant** or **Mixolydian** mode, not Lydian.
    *   Let's re-evaluate. What key has G# as the tonic and a natural 4th (C#)? **G# Mixolydian**.
    *   The G# Mixolydian scale is the same as C# major, but with a flattened 7th. The notes are: G#-A#-B#-C#-D#-E#-F#.
    *   Let's check the chords against G# Mixolydian.
        *   `G#`: The I chord. Yes.
        *   `Fm/G#`: F-Ab-C over G#. Still non-diatonic. F is the b7. Ab is the b5. C is the b3. This is a G#7(b9,b5) type of sound. A very altered dominant sound. This is common in jazz and can function as a V chord in a minor key, or as a tritone substitution, or just a chromatic passing chord. It's a "color" chord.
        *   `Cdim/F#`: C-Eb-Gb over F#. Still non-diatonic. F# is the 7th degree of the G# Mixolydian scale. This chord is likely a chromatic passing chord leading to the next harmony.
        *   `A#m/G#`: G#-A#-C#-E#. All these notes are in G# Mixolydian. This is a `Iadd2(4,6)` chord. The use of the natural 4th (C#) is a strong indicator of Mixolydian (or Lydian Dominant, which is Mixolydian with a #4).
        *   `F#6`: F#-A#-C#-D#. All these notes are in G# Mixolydian. This is the VII chord (VII7 or VII6). In Mixolydian, the VII chord is major, which is a key characteristic. This strongly supports the Mixolydian mode.

7.  **Final Conclusion Formulation:**
    *   **Key:** G# is the clear tonic. The progression starts and ends there, and the bass line centers on it.
    *   **Mode:** The strongest evidence points to the **G# Mixolydian** mode.
        *   The `A#m/G#` chord (G#-A#-C#-E#) is a `Iadd2(4,6)` voicing that uses the natural 4th (C#), a hallmark of the Mixolydian mode (as opposed to Lydian, which would imply a #4, or Major, which would tend to avoid the 4th as a suspension).
        *   The `F#6` chord is the major VII chord, which is the defining characteristic of the Mixolydian mode (in a major key, the vii chord is diminished; in a minor key, the VII chord is diminished).
    *   **Non-Diatonic Chords:** The `Fm/G#` and `Cdim/F#` chords are chromatic. They are not diatonic to G# Mixolydian but are used to add color, tension, and harmonic interest. This is very common in modern, jazz-influenced, or film-score harmony. The `Fm/G#` is particularly striking, creating a highly altered, tense sound that resolves back to the stable G# tonic area. The `Cdim/F#` functions as a chromatic passing chord, connecting the `Fm/G#` to the `A#m/G#` by moving the bass from F# to G#.

8.  **Structure the Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: **Key: G# Mixolydian**.
    *   Provide the "Why" in a structured way.
    *   **The Tonic:** Explain why G# is the tonic (starts/ends, bassline).
    *   **The Mode (Evidence for Mixolydian):**
        *   Explain the role of the `F#6` chord as the major VII chord, the defining feature of Mixolydian.
        *   Explain the role of the `A#m/G#` chord as a `Iadd2(4,6)` voicing that uses the natural 4th (C#), reinforcing the Mixolydian sound.
    *   **The Chromatic Chords:**
        *   Address the `Fm/G#` and `Cdim/F#` chords. Explain that they are non-diatonic "color" chords used for tension and interest. Briefly describe their sound and function (e.g., `Fm/G#` as a highly altered dominant sound, `Cdim/F#` as a passing chord).
    *   **Summary:** Conclude by summarizing that the progression is built on a G# Mixolydian foundation but uses chromaticism to create a rich, modern harmonic landscape. This shows a deeper understanding than just identifying the diatonic chords.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key and mode is **G# Mixolydian**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### 1. Identifying the Tonic (Key)

The tonal center is clearly **G#**.
*   The progression starts and ends on a G# chord.
*   The bass line is heavily centered on G#, with only one brief move to F#.
*   The progression feels like it's "telling a story" in the key of G#.

### 2. Determining the Mode

Once we've established G# as the tonic, we need to figure out if it's G# Major, G# Minor, or one of the other modes. The strongest evidence points to the **Mixolydian** mode.

The Mixolydian mode is like a major scale but with a flattened (lowered) 7th degree. This single change gives the mode its characteristic "bluesy" or "dominant" sound, and its most defining harmonic feature is a **major VII chord**.

Let's look at the chords in the context of G# Mixolydian (G#-A#-B#-C#-D#-E#-F#):

*   **`G#`**: This is the **I** chord (the tonic). It fits perfectly.
*   **`F#6`**: This is the **VII** chord. In G# Mixolydian, the 7th degree (F#) is natural, not flattened as it would be in G# major (where it would be Fx). Therefore, the chord built on F# is major (F# major, here voiced as F#6). This is the single biggest clue for the Mixolydian mode.
*   **`A#m/G#`**: This is an A# minor chord with a G# in the bass. Let's analyze the notes present: G# (root), A# (2nd), C# (4th), and E# (6th). All of these notes are diatonic to G# Mixolydian. This chord functions as a `Iadd2(4,6)` voicing. The prominent use of the **natural 4th (C#)** is another strong indicator of the Mixolydian (or Lydian) mode, as it's a characteristic note that is often featured.

### 3. The Chromatic (Non-Diatonic) Chords

The progression is made more interesting and modern by the use of chords that are not from the G# Mixolydian scale. These are "color" chords that add tension.

*   **`Fm/G#`**: This is an F minor triad over a G# bass. The notes (F, Ab, C) are all outside the G# Mixolydian scale. This creates a very tense, dissonant sound. It can be interpreted as an altered G# dominant chord (like G#7(b9,b5)) that resolves strongly back to the tonic G#. This is a common device in jazz and modern classical music.
*   **`Cdim/F#`**: This is a C diminished triad over an F# bass. This is also a highly chromatic chord. It functions primarily as a **passing chord**, creating a smooth chromatic bass line (from the G# of the previous chord, to the F# here, and back to G# for the `A#m/G#` chord) and adding harmonic tension before resolving to the more stable `A#m/G#`.

### Summary

| Chord | Function in G# Mixolydian | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G#** | **I (Tonic)** | Establishes the tonal center. |
| **Fm/G#** | **Altered Chord** | Chromatic "color" chord adding tension. |
| **Fm/G#** | **Altered Chord** | Reinforces the tension. |
| **Cdim/F#** | **Chromatic Passing Chord** | Connects the previous harmony to the next. |
| **A#m/G#** | **Iadd2(4,6)** | Diatonic voicing that strongly implies the Mixolydian mode. |
| **G#** | **I (Tonic)** | Return to the tonic. |
| **Fm/G#** | **Altered Chord** | Re-introduction of tension. |
| **Fm/G#** | **Altered Chord** | |
| **G#** | **I (Tonic)** | |
| **F#6** | **VII (Major)** | The defining chord of the Mixolydian mode. |
| **G#** | **I (Tonic)** | Final resolution. |

**Conclusion:** The progression is built on a **G# Mixolydian** foundation, using the characteristic major VII chord (`F#6`) and diatonic `Iadd2(4,6)` voicing (`A#m/G#`) to establish the mode. It is then enriched with sophisticated chromatic chords (`Fm/G#`, `Cdim/F#`) to create a rich, modern, and tense harmonic landscape.
