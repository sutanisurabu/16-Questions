The chords are:

G# – G# – Fm/G# – Fm/G# – Cdim/F# – A#m/G# – G# – G# – Fm/G# – Fm/G# – G# – G# – F#6 – G#

1. Interpret the symbols  
   - “/G#” just means the bass stays on G♯—it does not change the chord’s root.  
   - Cdim/F# is a C diminished triad (C-E♭-G♭) with F♯ in the bass; enharmonically that is F♯dim7 (F♯-A-C-E♭), the vii°7 of G♯ (resp. A♭).

2. Build a scale from the sounding notes  
   Taking every pitch that appears (all spelled with sharps for convenience) we get:  
   G♯ A♯ B♯(=C) C♯ D♯ E F♯ G♯  

   That is exactly the set of sharps that belongs to G♯ major (6♯), i.e. A♭ major.

3. Check the harmonic functions in that key  
   - G♯ maj = I  
   - Fm (F♯-A-C♯) = vi  
   - F♯dim7 (=Cdim/F♯) = vii°7/ii or simply vii°, a standard dominant substitute  
   - A♯m (B♭m) = ii  

   All chords are diatonic to G♯ (A♭) major.

4. Look for the dominant confirmation  
   The progression never actually states a D♯7 chord, but the repeated vii°7 on F♯ and the total absence of any flats or lowered 6th degree rule out the parallel natural minor; the tonic G♯ major is heard throughout.

Key: G♯ major (concert pitch A♭ major)  
Mode: major (ionian)
