### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord structures**

I'm looking at an Fm over Ab bass and noticing it creates a tonic pedal with a vi upper structure. The Cdim over F# bass is a bit confusing; it seems to hint at enharmonic relationships. I need to clarify the role of C diminished, which could be the ii° of Bb minor or perhaps a passing chord towards Ab. For A#m/G#, I'm also considering its enharmonic relationship to Bb. Bbm over Ab bass gives an interesting inversion, and I should check those intervals carefully.**Exploring chord inversions and keys**

I’m looking at the 3rd inversion of Bbm7 with Ab in the bass. The A#m/G# symbol actually equals Bbm/Ab enharmonically, suggesting we're in Ab major. The ii7 in 3rd inversion indicates a predominant leading to either the V or I chords. I notice a Gb6 chord, which is bVII borrowed from Mixolydian in Ab major. I'm also considering whether this could be in G# minor, but the presence of G# major chords makes Ab major seem more likely as the key.**Analyzing F#6 and chord progressions**

I'm looking at F#6, which is actually Gb6, thinking it's borrowed as a bVII6 neighbor chord over an Ab pedal. The progression follows a pattern, with a heavy emphasis on the tonic pedal. The odd passing diminished chord Cdim/F# might suggest a German or French augmented sixth, but I need to reassess. Cdim over F# bass transforms into C°/F#, where F# as Gb fits in. This brings me to consider if G# Mixolydian could be relevant here.**Exploring Mixolydian harmony**

I'm examining how F# (as bVII) fits into Ab Mixolydian. In G# Mixolydian, F# aligns with the b7, which matches the diatonic feel of the F#6 chord. In Ab major, F# is borrowed, not diatonic, leading me to consider the whole progression might be either in G# or Ab Mixolydian. The A#m (or Bbm) as ii minor fits well, especially since Ab Mixolydian stems from the Db major scale. I'm also building the chords: I Ab, ii Bbm, iii C dim, iv Db, v Eb dim, and VII Gb.**Determining the key and mode**

C diminished works well as the iii° in Ab Mixolydian. Notably, the presence of the bVII chord (Gb) aligns perfectly with other chords, including F#6 being Gb6 and the Bbm/A#m chord. This confirms the fit within Ab Mixolydian. Fm/G# suggests an interpretation where Fm is indeed a minor triad. I realize F diminished is incorrect here; rather, Fm is fitting for both Ab major and Ab Mixolydian. The final conclusion is that the tonal center is G# (enharmonically Ab) with the mode being Mixolydian, derived from the parent scale Db major.

Ab (G#) Mixolydian.

- Tonic center is Ab/G# (repeated G# chords).
- Presence of bVII (F#/Gb, incl. F#6) and iii° (Cdim) plus ii (A#m = Bbm) all fit Ab Mixolydian.
- No leading tone (G) appears; instead the b7 (Gb/F#) points to Mixolydian.
- Parent scale: Db major (Ab is the 5th mode).
