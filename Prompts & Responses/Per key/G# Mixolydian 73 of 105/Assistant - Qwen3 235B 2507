### Step 1: Write chords clearly with enharmonic equivalents if needed

First, let's rewrite some chords in a more readable way, possibly using enharmonics for clarity.

- **G#** = G# major (G#, B#, D#)
- **Fm/G#** = F minor with G# in the bass → this is an inverted chord. Fm = (F, Ab, C). G# in the bass → so it's F minor over G#.
  - But G# is not in F minor. G# = Ab, so this could be **Ab minor over Ab** = Abm/Ab → i.e., **Ab minor in root position**, just written oddly.
  - So **Fm/G#** is likely meant to be **Abm/Ab**, which is the same pitch content: Ab, Cb (B), Eb over Ab bass.
  - So **Fm/G# = Abm** — probably a notation quirk. Let's assume this is **Ab minor**.
- **Cdim/F#** = C diminished chord with F# in the bass.
  - Cdim = C, Eb, Gb
  - F# in bass → F#, C, Eb, Gb → This is the same as **F#dim7 (F#, A, C, Eb)** — which is a fully diminished 7th chord.
  - So **Cdim/F# = F#dim7**, which is enharmonically equivalent.
- **A#m/G#** = A# minor with G# in bass.
  - A#m = A#, C#, E#
  - G# in bass → G#, A#, C#, E#
  - G# to A# is a major 2nd — not a typical inversion.
  - G# is the minor 7th of A# — so this might function as a **dominant or subdominant-related chord**.
- **F#6** = F# major with added 6th = F#, A#, C#, D# — essentially F# major 6th.

So reinterpreting with enharmonic equivalents:

- G# = G#
- Fm/G# = Abm (Ab, Cb, Eb)
- Cdim/F# = F#dim7 (F#, A, C, Eb)
- A#m/G# = A#m with G# in bass — G# is the b7 of A#, so this is A#m7 in 3rd inversion: A#m7/G# → (G#, A#, C#, E#)
- F#6 = F#6 (F#, A#, C#, D#)

But let’s use consistent enharmonics. We’re in **G#-related keys**, which are messy due to sharps. Let’s consider **enharmonic equivalents** to make this easier.

Let’s convert everything to **Ab**:

- G# = Ab
- Fm/G# = Abm (as above) → Abm
- Cdim/F# = Dbdim/F# → but F# = Gb, so F#dim7 = Gbdim7 → same as **Abdim7**? No.
  - F#dim7 = F#, A, C, Eb → enharmonically the same as **Gbdim7, Bdim7, Dbdim7, E#dim7**, but in key context, it's likely **vii°7** of G# major or G# minor.
- A#m = Bbm
- F#6 = Gb6
- G# = Ab

So perhaps reframe the entire progression in **Ab**:

- Ab
- Ab
- Abm
- Abm
- F#dim7 → Gbdim7 → same notes: Gb, Bbb, Dbb, Fbb → Gb, Ebb, Cb, Fbb
  But better to keep as F#dim7 if key is G#.

Alternatively, let’s stick with **G# as tonic** and see where this goes.

---

### Step 2: Look for tonic and harmonic function

The progression starts and ends on **G#**, has G# repeated multiple times, and ends with **F#6 → G#**, which is a strong cadence (IV6 → I).

F#6 is F#, A#, C#, D#  
G# is G#, B#, D#

F#6 → G# is **IV6 - I** in **G# major**.

That’s a strong indicator.

Let’s check chords in **G# major**:

G# major scale:
- G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F## (F## = G)

But this is very sharp-heavy (6 sharps, plus F## — equivalent to Ab major: 4 flats).

So G# major is enharmonically **Ab major** (4 flats):  
Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

So let’s transpose the whole progression into **Ab major** for simplicity.

---

### Enharmonic Transformation:

- G# → Ab
- Fm/G# → F minor over G# → F = E#, G# = G# — messy. But Fm is Abm enharmonically? Fm = F, Ab, C → Abm = Ab, Cb, Eb → different.
  Wait: Earlier thought Fm/G# = Abm — is that valid?

Fm = F, Ab, C  
G# = G# → so chord is G#, F, Ab, C

G# = Ab  
So pitches: Ab, F, Ab, C — so Ab, C, F — which is **Ab major** — not F minor.

Wait — that's a contradiction.

Let’s clarify:

**Fm/G#**:  
- Bass: G# (Ab)  
- Chord: F minor = F, Ab, C (F is **enharmonic to E#**, but not typically used)

So pitches: **Ab, F, Ab, C**

So the chord contains: Ab, C, F → which is **Ab major 6th** (Ab, C, Eb, F) but **missing Eb**, has **C and F**.

Ab, C, F = **F minor in first inversion (F - Ab - C)** with Ab in bass → so Ab, F, Ab, C → **Fm/Ab**

Ah! So **Fm/G#** is actually **Fm/Ab** → F minor over Ab (G#) bass.

But Fm = **F, Ab, C** → so with Ab in bass, it's **Ab - F - Ab - C** → chord tones: Ab, C, F → which is **Ab6** (Ab major with added 6th: Ab, C, Eb, F — but Eb is missing)

So without Eb, it's not Ab6 — it's **Fm/Ab**, which sounds like **Ab added sixth without the fifth**.

But in function, it may act as a **ii6 or iv chord**.

However, F minor is not in Ab major.

Let’s go back.

Alternative: perhaps the chord labeled **Fm/G#** means a **G# chord with F in the bass?** But no — notation is Fm/G#, meaning F minor chord with G# in bass.

So pitches: G#, F, Ab, C

G# = Ab  
F = F  
Ab = Ab  
C = C

So notes: **Ab, F, Ab, C** → so **Ab, C, F**

This is **F minor in first inversion (Fm = F-Ab-C)** → **Fm/Ab**

But Ab is the 3rd of Fm — so this is **Fm in first inversion**.

So **Fm/G# = Fm/Ab**

Similarly:

- **Cdim/F#**: C, Eb, Gb, with F# (Gb) in bass → Gb, C, Eb, Gb → Gb, C, Eb → that's **Gb augmented**, but Cdim = C, Eb, Gb — so with Gb in bass, it’s **Cdim/Gb**, third inversion.

Cdim = C, Eb, Gb → fully diminished? No, missing the diminished 7th. But if it’s Cdim7, it would be C, Eb, Gb, Bbb (A).

But here it's written as **Cdim**, so likely C, Eb, Gb.

With F# (Gb) in bass → Gb, C, Eb, Gb → Gb, B# (C), D# (Eb) → Gb, B#, D# → which is **Gb augmented** — suspicious.

But the notes C, Eb, Gb, F# — F# = Gb — so pitches: **C, Eb, Gb, Gb** → so **C, Eb, Gb** — C diminished with Gb in bass — which is the same as **Cdim in 2nd inversion** (fifth in bass).

Cdim = C, Eb, Gb

Root position: C
1st inv.: Eb
2nd inv.: Gb → yes.

So **Cdim/F#** = **Cdim in second inversion** — still just a C diminished chord with Gb (F#) in bass.

Now, in key of G# major, is C diminished?

G# major: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##

C natural is not in this scale — C# is.

So C is a chromatic note — not diatonic to G# major.

Similarly, Fm = F, Ab, C — F and Ab are not in G# major (which has F## = G, and A).

So this suggests we’re not in G# major.

Let’s consider **G# minor**.

G# minor (natural): G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

So notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#

Now check chords:

- G# = G# (major) — but G# minor is G# B D# — but here we have **G#** chord — is it major or minor?

The chord is labeled **G#** — typically means major.

But in minor key, tonic is minor. So unless it’s harmonic minor with raised leading tone, but tonic is still minor.

So G# **major** chord in G# minor = III chord? But it’s used as tonic — so probably not.

Wait — unless it’s **A-flat minor key**?

Let’s try enharmonic equivalence.

Try **Ab minor** key.

Ab minor: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb

Harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G → G natural

Now check chords:

- **G# = Ab**  
We need Ab **major**? But in Ab minor, Ab is minor. Ab major would be **III chord** — which is possible.

But the repeated use of G# major as a tonic-like chord suggests it’s being treated as major.

Another idea: perhaps the key is **E major** or **C# minor**, and G# is a chromatic chord?

Let’s look at the chord progression again:

G#  
G#  
Fm/G#  
Fm/G#  
Cdim/F#  
A#m/G#  
G#  
G#  
Fm/G#  
Fm/G#  
G#  
G#  
F#6  
G#

Note:
- Fm/G# = G#, F, Ab, C
- Cdim/F# = F#, C, Eb, Gb
- A#m/G# = G#, A#, C#, E#
- F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#

Let’s list all unique pitches used:

From G#: G#, B#, D#  
From Fm/G#: G#, F, Ab, C  
From Cdim/F#: F#, C, Eb, Gb  
From A#m/G#: G#, A#, C#, E# (F)  
From F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#

So pitches:
- G#
- F (in Fm/G# and A#m/G# — E#)
- Ab (Gb)
- C
- F# (Gb)
- C (again)
- Eb
- Gb
- A#
- C#
- D# (E# is F?)
- D# (in G# and F#6)

Wait, D# in G# and F#6 (F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#) — yes.

So pitches:
- F
- F# / Gb
- G#
- A#
- C
- C#
- D#
- Eb
- Ab (same as G#)

Wait, **Ab = G#**, but also **Ab** appears in Fm, so is it Ab or G#?

Fm = F, Ab, C — so **Ab** is present.

G# is separate? Or are they the same?

Yes, **G# = Ab** in pitch.

But **A# = Bb**

So combine enharmonics:

- F
- F#
- G#
- A#
- C
- C#
- D#
- Eb
- (Ab = G# — already have)

So set of pitches: C, C#, D#, E (Fb?), F, F#, G#, A#, B (but E# = F)

Wait — missing a proper E.

Let’s list unique pitch classes:

- C
- C#
- D# (Eb missing? D# is there)
- D# = Eb → same pitch
- Eb = D#
- F
- F#
- G# (Ab)
- A#
- B? No
- E? Not directly — A#m has E# which is F

So no E natural.

Notes:
- C
- C#
- D#
- Eb (same as D#)
- F (from Fm and E# = F)
- F#  
- G#  
- A#  
- (B? Not present)  
- (E? Not present — E is 6 semitones above G#)

But G# to A# is 2 semitones, A# to C# is 3, etc.

Let’s list pitch classes (enharmonic):

1. C  
2. C#  
3. D#  
4. E = Fb? No F natural is present — but F is there, which is E#

F = E#

So pitch classes:

- C  
- C#  
- D#  
- F (E#)  
- F#  
- G#  
- A#  

That’s 7 notes.

Sort them from G#:

- G#  
- A#  
- C  
- C#  
- D#  
- F (E#)  
- F#  
- G# → back

So: G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, F#

Intervals from G#:

- G#  
- A# = +2  
- C = +3 (G# to C is augmented 3rd? G# to C = B, C? G# to B is minor 3rd, B to C is half step → G# to C = 3 half steps = minor third? G# to C = Ab to C = A to C = minor third, yes)
  - G#-A-A#-B, C → 4 half steps: G# to A (1), A to A# (2), A# to B (3), B to C (4) — yes, 4 semitones = major third
- G# to C = 4 semitones → major third
- C to C# = 1
- C# to D# = 2
- D# to F = 2.5? D# to E = 0.5, E to F = 0.5 → total 1 semitone? D# to F: D#-E-F = 2 semitones
- F to F# = 1
- F# to G# = 2

So scale: G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, F#, G#

Intervals in semitones:
- G# to A#: 2
- A# to C: 1
- C to C#: 1
- C# to D#: 2
- D# to F: 2
- F to F#: 1
- F# to G#: 2

So sequence: 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2

This doesn’t match a standard mode.

But this looks very close to **G# Dorian**?

G# Dorian: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#

- B = Cb = A#
Wait, B natural is 11 semitones above G#.
G#=0, A#=2, B=3, C#=4, D#=6, E#=8, F#=11, G#=12

But in our chords, we have C natural (3 semitones above G#) — which is B#, but in equal temperament, C = 3 semitones.

G# to C is 3 semitones = minor third.

In G# Dorian, third should be B = 3 semitones — yes, B = Cb, but C is not B — C is enharmonic to B#, which is 4 semitones.

B natural = 3 semitones above G# (G#-A-A#-B)

C = 4 semitones above G#.

So if chord has C, it's not B.

But in Fm, we have F, Ab, C — C is C.

So C is 4 semitones above G# — which is **major third**.

So the tonic chord G# is major (G#, B# (C), D#) — so has C.

B# = C, yes.

So G# major chord: G#, B#, D# = G#, C, D# — so C is B#.

Similarly, F is E#, which is in A#m: A#, C#, E# — E# = F.

So the chords are actually using **enharmonic spellings** within **G# major**.

G# major is not practical, so this is likely intended to be **Ab major**.

Let’s reinterpret.

Let’s map everything to Ab major.

- G# → Ab
- Fm/G# → F minor over G# bass → F is E# = F, G# = Ab → so chord is Ab, F, Abb (Gb), C (but Ab minor is Ab, Cb, Eb) — not matching.
  Wait, Fm = F, Ab, C
  Over Ab bass: Ab, F, Ab, C — so pitches: Ab, C, F — which is **Ab6** if we had Eb, but we don’t.

But in Ab major, Ab6 = Ab, C, Eb, F — has Eb.

Here, no Eb — has C and F.

So it's not Ab6.

But in function, it may be a **IV chord in fifth mode?**

Another idea: **F#6 to G#** is F#6 to G#, a major sixth chord to tonic.

F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D# → in G# major, this is the **IV6 chord** (IV = C#, E#, G#? No)

G# major scale: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##

So:
- I: G#
- ii: A#m
- iii: B#m
- IV: C#m
- V: D# major (D#, F##, A#) = D#, G, A#
- vi: E#m = Fm
- vii°: F#dim

Ah! Here it is.

In G# major:
- vi chord = E# minor = F minor

So **Fm = E# minor** → the vi chord in G# major.

So Fm/G# = E#m/G# — i.e., F minor in first inversion over G#, which is the tonic.

But since E#m is the vi chord in G# major, this makes sense.

Cdim/F# — C diminished = C, Eb, Gb

Is C in G# major? No. C natural = B#? B# = C.

But C# is in scale, C natural is not.

But Cdim could be chromatic.

But F# is the vii° chord in G# major.

F#dim = F#, A, C — C is natural.

F#dim = F#, A, C — in G# major, should be F#, A, C — A is Bbb? No.

G# major has F## = G, not F#.

G# major has F## (G), not F#.

So F# is not in G# major.

This is a problem.

G# major scale: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##

So F## = G

So the leading tone chord is **F##dim** = G, Bb, Db — not F#.

So F# is not in this scale.

Therefore, the chord **Cdim/F#** implies F# is in the bass.

F# = Gb, which is not in G# major.

But in **Ab major**, the scale is: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G

Chords:
- I: Ab
- ii: Bbm
- iii: Cm
- IV: Db
- V: Eb
- vi: Fm
- vii°: G dim

Ah! Here:

- vi = Fm
- vii° = G dim

But we have **F#dim**, not G dim.

F# = Gb, not G.

Close but not the same.

Unless it's **G dim with F#/Gb** in bass — but G dim = G, Bb, Db

Gb in bass would not be standard.

But **Cdim/F#** has F# in bass.

Another possibility: **A#m/G#** — A#m = A#, C#, E#

In Ab major, A# = Bb, so Bbm = Bb, Db, F — matches.

So A#m = Bbm

Similarly, F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D# — F# = Gb, A# = Bb, C# = Db, D# = Eb

So Gb, Bb, Db, Eb

In Ab major, this would be a **bVII6 chord** (Gb major 6th) — not diatonic.

Gb is not in Ab major.

But if the key is **E minor** or something else?

Let’s try **C# minor**.

Perhaps a better approach: the cadence F#6 to G# suggests that G# is tonic, and F#6 is acting as a subdominant or dominant.

F#6 to G# is a resolution by whole step, not strong.

But F#6 has D# = the 7th of G# chord? G# is G#, C, D#

D# is the 5th.

No leading tone.

Unless the key is **G# Dorian**.

G# Dorian: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#

So notes: G#, B, D#

So tonic chord would be G#m, not G# major.

But we have G# major.

So must be **G# Mixolydian**?

G# Mixolydian: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#

1 2 3 4 5 6 b7

So b7 = F#

F# appears.

Chords:
- I: G#7 (G# dominant 7th) — but we have G# major, not 7th.
- IV: C#m
- vii°: F#dim

F#dim = F#, A, C — not in scale; scale has F#, and A#? No, A is not in scale; scale has A#.

G# Mixolydian: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#

So F#dim would require A and C, but A is not in scale (has A#), so not.

But if we allow chromaticism, perhaps.

The chord Cdim/F# = F# in bass, C, Eb, Gb

F# to C is a diminished fifth, etc.

But in the context, after two Fm/G# (Ab, C, F), we have Cdim/F# (F# C Eb Gb), then A#m/G# (G# A# C# F)

So possible bass line: G# - C - Eb/F# - G# etc.

Not clear.

Another idea: listen to the progression or consider it's in the style of a specific song.

Fm/G# to Cdim/F# to A#m/G# to G#

Fm/G# = G#, F, Ab, C
Cdim/F# = F#, C, Eb, Gb
A#m/G# = G#, A#, C#, F
G# = G#, C, D#

Common tone: C appears in first two.

But F# to G# is half step.

F# to G# is whole step.

Perhaps the key is **A minor** and this is in a different region.

Perhaps the key is **F# major**, and G# is a chromatic chord?

We're going in circles.

Let’s go back to cadence: **F#6 -> G#**

F#6 = F#, A#, C#, D#
G# = G#, B#, D# = G#, C, D#

So voice leading:
- F# -> G# (whole step)
- A# -> ? not in G# chord
- C# -> D# in G# chord? C# to D# is whole step
- D# -> D# same

So two voices move up by whole step, one same, one up by half? A# to C is not in chord.

G# has B# = C, not C#.

B# = C.

So C# in F#6 could move to C in G# chord — that's a half step down.

So:
- F# -> G# (up 2 semitones)
- A# -> ? not in G# chord; G# has G#, C, D# — so A# could resolve to G# or C
- C# -> C (down 1)
- D# -> D# (same)

So possible.

And D# is common tone.

This suggests a cadence, but not a standard V-I.

F# is the #IV of G#? G# to C## = D, not C#.

No.

Another possibility: the mode is **G# Ionian (major)**, and the Cdim/F# is a passing chord, and Fm/G# is the vi chord in first inversion.

But earlier we saw that F# is not in G# major; it's F##.

So unless the spelling is theoretical, it's very sharp.

The only practical possibility is that the key is **Ab major**.

Let’s assume that and map:

- G# -> Ab
- Fm/G# -> F minor over Ab -> Ab, F, Ab, C -> Ab6 add6 no 5? But in Ab, Fm is vi, so Fm/Ab = vi in first inversion
- Cdim/F# -> Cdim with F# in bass; F# = Gb, so Cdim/Gb -> C, Eb, Gb with Gb in bass = second inversion Cdim
  - In Ab, C is iii chord, but diminished? No, in major, iii is minor.
  - So not diatonic.
- A#m/G# -> A# = Bb, so Bbm with Ab in bass = Bbm/Ab
  - Bbm = ii in Ab major, so ii in first inversion? No, Ab is the 7th, so bass is 7th below.
  - Bbm/Ab = Ab, Bb, Db, F — so chord is Bbm, Ab bass.
  - Ab is the b7 of Bb, so it's Bbm7/Ab.
  - In jazz, common.
- F#6 -> F# = Gb, so Gb6 = Gb, Bb, Db, Eb — in Ab major, this is bVII6 (flat subtonic sixth) — common in rock/ pop.
- Then to Ab.

So progression:
Ab (I)
Ab
Fm/Ab (vi6)
Fm/Ab
Cdim/Gb (III diminished in second inversion)
Bbm/Ab (ii7 in third inversion)
Ab
Ab
Fm/Ab
Fm/Ab
Ab
Ab
Gb6
Ab

Now, Cdim/Gb = C, Eb, Gb with Gb bass — in Ab, C is the third degree, but should be C minor, not diminished.

So Cdim is chromatic.

But it could be a passing chord between Fm and Bbm.

Fm = F, Ab, C
Cdim = C, Eb, Gb
Bbm = Bb, Db, F

So from C to Eb is +1, and Gb, etc.

In voice leading, it works as a chromatic passing diminished chord.

And Gb6 (bVII6) to I is a cadence in mixolydian or popular music.

Moreover, the frequent use of Ab, and the final cadence bVII6 -> I, is very characteristic of **major keys in pop music**.

Therefore, despite the spelling, the key is **Ab major**, and the mode is **Ionian**.

The unusual spelling (G# instead of Ab, F# instead of Gb, A# instead of Bb) is due to a preference for sharp keys or a specific theoretical context, but the harmony is Ab major.

**Final Answer:**
- **Key: Ab major**
- **Mode: Ionian**
