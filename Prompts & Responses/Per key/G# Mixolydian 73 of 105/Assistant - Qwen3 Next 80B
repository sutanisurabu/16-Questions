Let’s analyze the chord progression you’ve provided:

**Chord progression:**
> G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#

---

### Step 1: List the chords clearly

We’ll write them in root position or highlight the bass note:

1. **G#** — likely G# major (G#-B#-D#)  
2. **G#**  
3. **Fm/G#** — F minor with G# in the bass → So bass is G#, chord is F minor → inversion of Fm: G#-A-C  
4. **Fm/G#**  
5. **Cdim/F#** — C diminished with F# in the bass → bass is F#, chord is Cdim: F#-A-C (which is F# half-diminished, or F#m7♭5)  
6. **A#m/G#** — A# minor with G# in the bass → G#-A#-E# (since A#minor = A#-C#-E#) → so it’s G# as bass, A# minor triad above → **G#-A#-C#-E#**? Wait — actually, **A#m/G#** means the chord is A# minor with G# in the bass → notes: G# - A# - C# - E#? But A#m triad is A#-C#-E#, so with G# bass → G#-A#-C#-E# — that’s **G# minor 7th**? Let’s hold that thought.

7. **G#**  
8. **G#**  
9. **Fm/G#**  
10. **Fm/G#**  
11. **G#**  
12. **G#**  
13. **F#6** — F# major with a 6th → F#-A#-C#-D#  
14. **G#**

---

### Step 2: Simplify and look for tonal center

We see **G#** repeated very frequently — it’s the most common chord/bass note. Let’s assume **G#** is the tonal center.

So potential key: **G# major** or **G# minor**

But let’s look at the other chords:

- **Fm/G#** → This is **F minor triad** over G# bass: G# - A - C  
  - This is a **minor 6th chord**? Not quite. The notes G#-A-C form a **G# diminished triad**? Let’s see:
    - G# to A: minor 2nd
    - A to C: minor 3rd
    - G# to C: diminished 5th (G#–C is 6 half-steps: G#–A–A#–B–C → G# to C is 6 semitones → tritone → diminished 5th)
    - So **G#-A-C = G# dim triad** → So this is **G#dim** chord.

Wait — hold on! That’s critical.

**Fm/G# = F minor on G# bass**

F minor triad: F–A–C  
Put G# in the bass: **G#–F–A–C** — rearranged: **G#–A–C–F**

But that’s a **4-note chord**: G#, A, C, F — this is NOT a standard triad. Chord symbols like X/Y mean the chord X with bass Y — so the *chord quality* is F minor, but the *bass note* is G#.

So the full chord is: **F minor triad (F–A–C)** with **G#** as the lowest note → notes: **G#, F, A, C**

Now let’s arrange them in order:

**G# - A - C - F**

Intervals from G#:
- G# to A: m2
- G# to C: d5 (6 semitones)
- G# to F: m6 (8 semitones) — G#–A–A#–B–C–C#–D–D#–E–F → 8 semitones? Let’s count:

**G# → A (1), A# (2), B (3), C (4), C# (5), D (6), D# (7), E (8), F (9)** → **9 semitones** from G# to F — that’s a **major 6th?** Wait, G# to F is enharmonically **G# to F##**? No, F is natural.

Wait — **G# to F** is **10 semitones**? Let me be precise:

Half-steps from G#:
- G# = 0
- A = 1
- A# = 2
- B = 3
- C = 4
- C# = 5
- D = 6
- D# = 7
- E = 8
- F = 9

So G# to F is **9 semitones** → A **minor 6th?** No — 9 semitones is a **major 6th**? Wait:

- Major 6th from G# is E# (G# to E# = 9 semitones — yes, because E# = F natural)
- But E# and F natural are enharmonic. So **G# to F natural** is a **minor 7th**? Wait, no.

Wait — G# to F natural:

- G# → A → A# → B → C → C# → D → D# → E → F → that's 9 steps → **minor 7th** would be G# to F# (8 semitones) → F natural is one step lower → **diminished 7th**? No.

Let’s count semitones accurately:

| Note | Semitone from G# |
|------|------------------|
| G#   | 0                |
| A    | 1                |
| A#   | 2                |
| B    | 3                |
| C    | 4                |
| C#   | 5                |
| D    | 6                |
| D#   | 7                |
| E    | 8                |
| F    | **9**            |

So **G# to F = 9 semitones** = a **minor 7th**? But minor 7th from G# is **F#**, which is 10 semitones? No, wait — mistake.

Wait, standard: **Minor 7th interval** = 10 semitones

- G# → A = 1
- G# → B = 3
- G# → C# = 5
- G# → D# = 7
- G# → E# = 9? No, E# is the major 6th

Wait — G# to **F#** is 10 semitones → minor 7th  
G# to **F** is 9 semitones → **Major 6th**! Because:

- Major 6th = 9 semitones  
- Minor 6th = 8 semitones → G# to E = 8 semitones

So **G# to F natural = 9 semitones → major 6th**

So F is the major 6th above G#

So the chord **Fm over G# bass** = notes: G# (bass), F, A, C

→ Belongs to the notes: **G#, A, C, F**

In terms of intervals above G#:

- 1: G#
- 2: A (M2)
- 4: C (P4)
- 6: F (M6)

So chord: **G# with added 2 and 4 and 6**? Unusual.

Better to think: **F minor triad = F, A, C** — so stacked above G# bass, it's **G#–F–A–C**

Which is the same as **A–C–F–G#**

That’s an **A minor 7th flat 5 (Aø7)** chord? A–C–E♭–G → but we have A–C–F–G# — F is natural, G# is natural.

A–C–F–G# → Could that be **G#7#5#9**? Too complicated.

Wait — here's a better approach.

---

### Step 3: Consider key signature and scales

Let’s suppose this is in the key of **G# minor**.

G# minor scale: G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E - F# (natural minor)

But we have chords with **F natural**, **C natural**, **A natural**, etc.

Specifically, we see:

- Fm → F is natural
- Cdim → C natural
- A#m → A#, C#, E#
- F#6 → F#, A#, C#, D#

So in the same progression, we see **C natural** (in Fm and Cdim) and **C#** (in A#m and F#6).  
Also, **F natural** and **F#**.

This suggests **chromaticism**, **modal interchange**, or even **modulation**.

But look again — **Cdim/F#** — C diminished with F# bass.

Cdim = C–E♭–G♭  
F# bass → **F#–C–E♭–G♭**

That’s **F# half-diminished** chord: F#–A–C–E → wait, no.

Cdim triad: C–E♭–G♭  
With F# bass → notes: F#, C, E♭, G♭

That’s **F# minor 7♭5** chord: F#–A–C–E would be m7♭5 — but we have F#, C, E♭, G♭.

Wait — F#, C, E♭, G♭ = F#–C–E♭–G♭ → that’s **C diminished 7th chord with F# bass** — which is enharmonic to:

Cdim7 = C–E♭–G♭–B𝄫 → which is C–E♭–G♭–A (if B𝄫 = A)

So **F#–C–E♭–A** — which is the same as **A–C–E♭–F#**

That’s **A half-diminished seventh**: A–C–E♭–G — but we have A–C–E♭–F#, so **A–C–E♭–F#** = A half-diminished 7th? Let’s check:

Normal A half-dim: A–C–E♭–G — **G natural**

We have **F#** instead → which is a **major 6th** above A? Or a **minor 7th**? A to F# = 8 semitones → minor 6th

Wait — 8 semitones = minor 6th.

So **A–C–E♭–F#** = A minor triad with a flat 5 and a minor 6th? That’s **A7♭5♭6** — extremely rare.

Alternatively: **Cdim7 chord with F# bass** → Cdim7 = C–E♭–G♭–B𝄫 (B𝄫 = A) → so C–E♭–G♭–A

Then bass is F# → not one of those notes.

So maybe it’s **Cdim7 with F# bass** → which implies **Cdim7 / F#** → but that’s not standard.

Alternative idea: **Cdim/F# = F#m7b5**

Because F#m7b5 = F#–A–C–E → but we have F#, C, and then E♭, G♭? No, we don’t have E.

This is confusing.

Let’s try a different strategy: **ignore bass notes** for a moment and just look at chord qualities.

Chord qualities in the progression:

- G# (major)
- Fm (minor)
- Cdim (diminished)
- A#m (minor)
- F#6 (major with 6th)

F#6 = F#–A#–C#–D#

That’s a **major 6th chord in F#**, which is the **major VI** chord in D# minor.

Wait — let’s look at **F# major** and **G# minor**.

### Try key of A major or F# major?

F# major scale: F# G# A# B C# D# E#  
So G# is #2, A# is #3

We have chords: G# major, Fm, Cdim, A#m — does A# minor belong? A# minor is A#–C#–E# — that’s in F# major (vi chord: vi = D#m, not A#m).

In G# minor key (natural):  
Scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#  
Chords:  
i – G#m  
ii° – A#dim  
III – Bmaj  
iv – C#m  
v – D#m  
VI – E  
VII – F#  

We don’t have any of these matching. We have **G# major** — out of place.  
We have **Fm** — F natural, not in key.  
We have **Cdim** — C natural.  
We have **A#m** — A#-C#-E# — but in G# minor, that would be II, which is diminished, not minor.

So perhaps **G# minor is not the key**.

Try **D# major?**

D# major: D# E# F# G# A# B# C##  
Chord: G# = #5 — not likely.  
F# = #7? Not good.

Try **F# major**

F# major: F# G# A# B C# D# E#  
Chords:
I: F#  
II: G#m  
III: A#m  
IV: B  
V: C#  
VI: D#  
VII: E#°

We have:
- G# — should be minor, but it’s major → so borrowed?
- Fm? — F natural — NOT in F# major (F# has F#)
- Cdim? C natural — F# major has C#
- A#m — yes! that’s III chord
- F#6 — yes, I chord with added 6

So chords we see:
- **G# major** → would normally be G#m in F# major → so **borrowed from parallel minor?** F# minor? But F# minor has G natural, not G#.

F# minor scale: F# – G# – A – B – C# – D – E  
Now F# minor includes:
- G# (as 2nd degree) → so **G# major chord**? Yes! G#–B#–D#? But in F# minor, 3rd is A — so G#–B–D — G# minor.

But you have **G# major** (G#–B#–D#) — B# — that’s not in F# minor — F# minor has B natural.

So **G# major is borrowed from F# major**, but F# major has E# and C#, not C natural.

Clash: Fm = F natural vs F# major has F# — conflict.

So not a diatonic key.

---

### Let’s look for common tones or pivot

The chord **F#6** is **F#–A#–C#–D#** — this is a very bright, major tonal center.

Let’s assume we are in **F# major**.

F# major scale: F# G# A# B C# D# E#

Chords that fit:
- F#6 = I6 → YES
- A#m = III → YES
- G# = ? Normally minor, but here it’s major → G# = II → in F# major, II is G#m, but we have G# major — so **major II chord**, which is **borrowed** (e.g., from F# Phrygian? Or parallel minor? No — F# minor has G#m)

But in **F# harmonic minor?** That’s F#–G#–A–B–C#–D–E# — still has G# minor.

So why G# major? It's unusual.

Try **D# minor**

D# minor scale (natural): D# E# F# G# A# B C#  
Chords:
i: D#m  
ii°: E#°  
III: F#  
iv: G#m  
v: A#m  
VI: B  
VII: C#

Now we have:
- G# → but it’s major — in D# minor, G# is iv → should be minor
- Fm? F natural — not in key (has F#)
- Cdim? C natural — has C#
- A#m = v → YES
- F#6 = III6 → FYI, F# major is III chord in D# minor — so F#6 is possible
- G# major — again, should be G#m

So again, G# major is inconsistent.

### Critical observation:

We keep seeing **Fm/G#**

That is: F minor with G# bass → notes: G#, F, A, C

Now, **F–A–C** is F minor triad, add G# bass.

But **G#, A, C** → spelled: G#–A–C = **G# diminished triad**

So **Fm/G#** is **functionally a G#dim chord**

Why? Because the **notes G#, A, C** form a diminished triad.

Similarly, **Cdim/F#** = C diminished with F# bass → C–E♭–G♭ with F# bass = F#–C–E♭–G♭ → that’s **F# half-diminished 7**? F#–A–C–E would be the standard — but we have E♭ and G♭ — not in key.

Wait — wait a minute: **Cdim/F#**

Cdim = C–E♭–G♭  
F# = F#

So: F#–C–E♭–G♭

Let’s write as: **F#–G♭–B𝄫–D𝄫**? No — that’s voodoo.

Wait — C–E♭–G♭ = Cdim

Now, F#–C–E♭–G♭ — what is this? Let's spell all as flats or sharps.

E♭ = D#  
G♭ = F#  
C = C

So: F#–C–D#–F#

We have: F# (bass), C, D#, F# — so **C–D#–F#** = **C major triad?** C–E–G — no, C–D#–F# = C to D# = M2, C to F# = P5? C–F# = 6 semitones — tritone.

C to D# = 3 semitones → minor 3rd? No, C to D# = C–C#–D–D# → 3 semitones = minor 3rd

C to F# = C–C#–D–D#–E–F–F# = 6 semitones = diminished 5th

So **C–D#–F# = C diminished triad** — so we’re back to **Cdim with bass C**, but we have bass **F#**

So chord = **F#–C–D#–F#** → which is **Cdim with F# in bass** = **Cdim/F#**

But Cdim = C–E♭–G♭ = C–D#–F# — yes! So **Cdim = C–D#–F#**

Therefore, **Cdim/F# = F# (bass) + C–D#–F#** → so it’s a **C diminished triad with F# in bass** — but the bass note F# is already in the chord!

So it’s just **C diminished with F# as root?** No — the chord is **Cdim**, bass is F# — so root is C, bass is F#.

But the triad is **C–D#–F#** — so the notes are **C, D#, F#** — which is a **C diminished triad**

So **Cdim/F#** is **Cdim (C–D#–F#) with F# in bass** → that’s **F#–C–D#**

Now arrange: **F#–C–D#** → that’s F# to C = 8 semitones (m6), F# to D# = 3 semitones (m3)

So F#–D#–C — which is **D#–F#–C** = D# diminished triad? D#–F#–A → but we have C, not A.

Wait — F#–C–D# is **C–D#–F#** rearranged

Which is **C diminished** — no way around it.

But F#–C–D# = **F# minor 7th flat 5?** F#–A–C–E is m7♭5, but here we have F#–C–D# = F#–D#–C — that’s **C minor 6?** No.

Actually — F#–C–D# is a **C diminished triad with F# in bass** — means the root is C, and bass is F# → it's an **inversion**

Specifically, Cdim triad = C–E♭–G♭ = C–D#–F#

Its first inversion = E♭–G♭–C = D#–F#–C  
Second inversion = G♭–C–E♭ = F#–C–D#

So **Cdim/F#** = **second inversion of C diminished triad**

So **the actual chord is C diminished**

Similarly, **Fm/G#** = F minor with G# bass = notes: G#, F, A, C — which is **G#–A–C–F**

G#–A–C: G# to A = m2, A to C = m3, G# to C = d5 — so **G#dim**

F is an added note? Or maybe we missed something.

Wait — **Fm triad = F–A–C**, bass G# — total notes: G#, F, A, C

Group as **F–A–C** (Fm) + G# bass

But these 4 notes: **F, G#, A, C**

That’s **F–A–C–G#**

Which is a **G# minor 7th?** G#–B#–D#–F# — no, we have F natural.

G#–A–C–F: intervals from G#:
- G#–A: m2
- G#–C: d5
- G#–F: M6

So it's **G# with added 2, 4, and 6** — A, C, F

A = M2, C = d5, F = M6 — these are very dissonant.

This sounds like a **G# half-diminished 7th with no 3rd**? Or **F#m7 b5 without thirds**?

Wait — G# half-dim 7th = G#–B–D#–F#

We have G#–A–C–F — no B, no D#, no F#

So other possibility: **this is a "C minor 6th" chord with G# bass?**

Cm6 = C–E♭–G–A — we have C–F–A–G# — F and G# instead of E♭ and A

Not matching.

---

### Final breakthrough: Think of G# as the root, and find scale.

Chord symbols:

- G# — assume major
- Fm/G# — implies G#dim or G#m6? But let's just take the bass as reference.

Assume the key is **G# minor**, and the **Fm/G#** is a **borrowed chord from G# melodic minor or harmonic minor**.

G# harmonic minor = G#–A#–B–C#–D#–E–F# — still no F natural.

G# melodic minor ascending: G#–A#–B–C#–D#–E#–F# — still F#.

**F natural** only appears in **G# Dorian?** — G# Dorian = G#–A#–B–C#–D#–E#–F# — same.

I'm thinking we’re dealing with **tonal ambiguity** or **modal interchange from D# Lydian or something**.

Another possibility: **This progression is in the key of B major?**

B major: B C# D# E F# G# A#

Check G# — #4  
Fm — F natural — not in key

No.

### Insight: The chord F#6 and G# major

F#6 = F# A# C# D#  
G# major = G# B# D#

In the key of C# major? C# major: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#

Now we have:

- G# major = V
- F#6 = IV6 — in C# major, IV is F# major — yes!
- A#m = vi — in C# major: vi = A#m — yes!
- Cdim = ? C# major has C# — not C

Cdim = C–E♭–G♭ — C natural — not in C# major

Fm = F natural — also not in C# major (has F#)

So again: **C natural** and **F natural** are out of key.

C# major’s note C# is sharp — C natural is chromatic.

So we have **C natural** and **F natural** — that’s a clue.

C natural and F natural: F and C form **tritone** — classic diminished chord enharmonic.

But here’s the key insight:

### Let’s reinterpret the entire sequence as a descending bass line:

Bass notes:

1. **G#**
2. **G#**
3. **G#**
4. **G#**
5. **F#**
6. **G#**
7. **G#**
8. **G#**
9. **G#**
10. **G#**
11. **G#**
12. **G#**
13. **F#**
14. **G#**

So the bass moves:  
G# (x4) → **F#** → G# (x5) → F# → G#

So we have a **G# – F# – G#** bass motion — very common in pop/rock.

That’s exactly the pattern of **I – bVI – I** in some modal settings.

Like: G# – F# – G#

**F#** would be the bVI chord if key is G# major.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F## (F## = G natural)

F# is not in G# major — it’s the **lowered 6th** → so **F# = bVI**

So if we assume **G# major** as tonic:

- G# = I
- F#6 = bVI6

That’s a **very common borrowed chord progression**: **I – bVI – I**

Like in pop: C – Ab – C

Related to the “Andalusian cadence” or bluesy movement.

Now what about the other chords:

Fm/G# — What is this? If G# is tonic, and we have Fm triad over it — Fm = F–A–C — which is **bVII if we’re in G# major?**

But G# major’s bVII would be F# — we have F natural — that’s **bVIIb**? No.

Wait — F natural is **not in G# major** — it’s a **foreign tone**.

But here’s the trick: **Fm/G#** could be interpreted as **G#7#11** or something — not standard.

Another interpretation: **Fm/G# = G#m7♭5** if we consider it as **G#–B–D–F**

But we have **G#–A–C–F** — A and C, not B and D.

So it’s **G#–A–C–F**

That’s **G#m7♭5** if C were E♭ and F were E — no.

Perhaps this is a **Cmaj7b9** or something? Too complex.

Let’s abandon trying to name the chord and look at **harmonic function**.

The sequence:

G# (tonic)  
Fm/G# — bass D? No, G# for 4 bars — suggests **tonic pedal**

Then Cdim/F# — F# bass, Cdim — which is bVI in G# major (F# = bVI)

Then A#m/G# — G# bass, A#m chord → A#m = ii in G# minor, but we’re in G# major

A#m is **iii** in F# major — again.

Now, **F#6** is **bVI6** — and it resolves back to G# — very satisfying.

So overall pattern:

> G# — Fm/G# (tonic pedal) — **Cdim/F# (bVI)** — A#m/G# (iii?) — G# — **F#6 (bVI6)** — G#

This is **essentially** a G# tonic with **bVI chord (F#)** used as a contrast, and **Fm/G#** and **A#m/G#** as colorful passing chords over the tonic bass.

The only "weird" notes are **F, C, A natural** — which are not in G# major.

But those notes — F, A, C — spell **F minor**.

**F minor is the relative minor of A-flat major** — not helpful.

But here's the idea: **The chord Fm = F–A–C** — this is the **bVII chord relative to A major?** No.

In **A major**, bVII is G — not F.

Another classic: in **minor keys**, bVII is I–bVII–I (e.g., in rock: G–F–G)

But here the key is G# major, and **F#** is the bVI — and **F minor** is the same as **E# minor** — enharmonic to F minor, but F minor as a chord of G# major doesn’t fit.

Wait — **F minor = E# minor** — and E# is the leading tone in F major — no.

### Final Answer:

Despite the presence of chromatic tones (F, C, A natural), the **tonic and anchoring chord is G#** used repeatedly, with **F#6** as a strong structural chord (bVI), forming a **I – bVI – I** progression in the key of **G# major**, but with **borrowed subdominant minor chords** (Fm) and diminished chords.

The **mode is G# major**, but the use of Fm and Cdim suggests **modal mixture** (borrowing from G# minor or other modes).

But **G# minor** doesn’t have F natural in its natural, harmonic, or melodic forms.

Wait — G# Phrygian? G# A B C# D# E F# — still no F natural.

**G# Mixolydian b2?** Not standard.

Actually, the presence of **F natural** and **C natural** suggests the key center is **E major or C# major** — but then G# isn't tonic.

I think the only logical conclusion is:

---

### ✅ **Key: G# major**  
### ✅ **Mode: Major (Ionian)**  
### **with modal mixture**: borrowing the **F minor chord** (bVII of G# minor? or from C# minor) and **C diminished** (viio of D#) as chromatic passing chords.

But more precisely — the piece **centered on G#**, with a **strong cadential motion from F#6 to G#**, and Fm/G# acting as a **colored pedal tone over I** — the F and C naturals are **non-chord tones** or **borrowed from G# Dorian?** But G# Dorian is G# A# B C# D# E# F# — no naturals.

So it's **G# major with chromaticism**, possibly suggesting **Blues or Rock style**.

The presence of **F#6** and **I** suggests this is **G# major with lowered sixth chord**, common in many pop/rock songs (e.g., "Let It Be" has C – Ab – C).

So even with all the chromaticism, the **tonal center is G#**.

## 🔚 Final Answer:

> **Key: G# Major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (Major)**  
>  
> *Note: The progression uses chromatic and borrowed chords (Fm, Cdim) for color and tension, but the tonal center remains G# with a strong cadence on F#6 → G#.*

This progression is **not diatonic**, but it is **clearly centered on G# major**.
