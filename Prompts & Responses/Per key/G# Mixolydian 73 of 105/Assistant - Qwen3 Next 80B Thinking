### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#. I need to figure out the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down step by step.

First, I should list out all the chords without the slash notations to see the root notes. So, the chords are: G#, G#, Fm, Fm, Cdim, A#m, G#, G#, Fm, Fm, G#, G#, F#6, G#. But the slashes indicate bass notes, so the actual chords might be inversions or different voicings. For example, Fm/G# means an F minor chord with G# in the bass. That might be important because the bass note can influence the perceived harmony.

Let me write out each chord's full structure considering the bass note:

- G# (could be G# major or G# minor? But usually a single note with no qualifier might mean major, but in context, it's probably the root chord. Wait, but in chord progressions, a single letter like G# usually means G# major unless specified otherwise. But let's check the context.)

Wait, but the progression has "G# G#", which might be two G# chords, likely G# major. Then "Fm/G#" – that's F minor with G# bass. So it's not F minor in root position; it's inverted. Similarly, "Cdim/F#" is diminished chord on C with F# bass. "A#m/G#" is A# minor with G# bass. "F#6" is F# major with a 6th added, which is usually F# A# C# D#? Wait, F#6 would be F# A# C# D#, so the 6th is D#.

But to find the key, I need to see which scale these chords fit into. Let's list all the root notes of the chords, ignoring the slashes for mode/key analysis, but considering the bass notes might hint at the root.

Wait, perhaps it's better to list the actual chords including the bass notes as part of the chord, but actually, the slashes mean the bass note is that note, but the chord itself has a specific quality. For example, Fm/G# means the chord is F minor, and the bass note is G#. So the full chord would be G# as the lowest note, then F minor triad above: G#, A#, C, E (since F minor is F Ab C, but with G# bass? Wait, F minor chord is F, Ab, C. If the bass is G#, then the notes would be G#, F, Ab, C. But that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe the chord is in first or second inversion. Let's see:

Fm in first inversion would be Ab, C, F (so root on Ab, but that's not the case here). Wait, Fm/G# means the chord is F minor but with G# in the bass. So the notes are G#, F, Ab, C. Because F minor chord is F, Ab, C. So if the bass is G#, then the notes are G# (bass), then F, Ab, C above it. So that's a G# root with other notes, but the chord quality might be something else. Let's see what chord that is. G#, F, Ab, C – but Ab is the same as G#, wait no. G# and Ab are enharmonically equivalent? Wait, G# is the same as Ab. Wait, G# is a note, and Ab is the same pitch, but depending on context. But in terms of spelling, they're different. However, in actual notes, they are the same physical note. Wait, but Fm/G# – the bass is G#, and the chord is F minor. So the F minor chord is F, Ab, C. But with G# in the bass, so the notes would be G#, F, Ab, C. But G# and Ab are the same pitch, but we have to write them as different names? No, they're enharmonic. If the bass is G#, then the chord contains G#, and then F, Ab, C. Wait, but G# is enharmonic to Ab. So maybe it's more accurate to think of the chord as having notes: Ab (since G# is Ab), F, Ab, C. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct way is to see what chord is formed when the bass note is G# and the chord is Fm. So the notes in the chord (including bass) are G#, F, Ab, C. Wait, but Ab and G# are the same pitch. So if the bass is G#, then the notes are G#, F, Ab, C. But Ab and G# are the same, so it's redundant. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to think of the chord as an F minor triad with G# in the bass, which is the same as saying the chord has a root of G# and various extensions, but it's called Fm/G#. Alternatively, maybe the chord is a G# major with some alterations, but no. Typically, Fm/G# means F minor chord with G# bass, so the actual chord notes would have G# at the bottom, then F, Ab, C (but Ab is the same as G#? No. F minor chord is F, Ab, C. So if bass is G#, then the notes are G# (lowest), then F, Ab, C above. But Ab is a different note from G#. Let's get their notes straight:

G# (G sharp) = the note above G, which is equivalent to Ab.

Ab is the same as G# in pitch, just different spelling.

So if the chord is Fm/G#, the bass note is G# (which is Ab), so the notes would be:

- Bass: G# (which is Ab)

- F

- Ab (but wait, Ab is the same as G#, so that's confusing)

Wait, no. If the chord is F minor, which is F, Ab, C. So if we have G# as the bass note, that would mean the chord has G# as the lowest note. So the notes would be G#, F, Ab, C. But since G# and Ab are the same pitch, that's a problem. Wait, no. G# is the note above F natural. Wait, let's list all the notes in order.

Wait, G# is a specific pitch. Ab is another name for the same pitch. So when we say Fm/G#, the chord consists of F, Ab, C with G# as the bass. But F, Ab, C – the Ab is the same as G#? No. Wait, Ab is the same as G#? Yes! Because in equal temperament, Ab and G# are the same note. So if the bass note is G# (which is Ab), then the F minor chord has a bass note of Ab. So let's redo that. Fm chord is F, Ab, C. If the bass is Ab, then the chord in first inversion would be Ab in the bass, then C and F. But Ab, C, F is F minor in first inversion. So Fm in first inversion is Ab, C, F written as Fm/Ab. So in this case, Fm/G# would be the same as Fm/Ab, since G# is Ab. So the bass note is Ab. So the chord is F minor in first inversion, with Ab in the bass.

But depending on how it's spelled, Fm/G# is equivalent to Fm/Ab. So perhaps the chord is better written as Fm/Ab. So in that case, the bass note is Ab, and the chord is F minor.

Similarly, Cdim/F# – C diminished chord with F# in the bass. So Cdim is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass, so notes are F#, C, Eb, Gb. But F# is enharmonic to Gb? In some contexts, yes. Gb and F# are the same pitch. So if the bass is F#, then the chord Cdim/F# would be F#, C, Eb, Gb. But Gb and F# are equivalent, so maybe the notes are F#, C, Eb, F#? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's see: Cdim chord is C, Eb, Gb. So if bass is F#, then the notes are F# (bass), C, Eb, Gb. But since F# is the same as Gb, then Gb in the chord is the same as the bass note F#, but the bass is F# and the chord has Gb, which is the same. So maybe it's F# as the bass, and F# C Eb. But that's a diminished triad on F#, but with root on F#? Wait, F# dim chord would be F#, A, C. No, wait: a diminished triad is root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th. So F# dim triad = F#, A, C. But that's different.

Wait, Cdim is C, Eb, Gb. If the bass is F#, then the notes are F# (bass), C, Eb, Gb. Since Gb is the same scale degree as F#, it's a bit confusing. But F# and Gb are enharmonically same. So the chord Cdim/F# would have F# as the bass, and the same pitch as Gb in the chord. So the chord would contain F# (as bass and as Gb component), which doesn't make much sense. Maybe this needs a different approach.

Perhaps instead of looking at the slash chords as individual chords, we can think of the bass notes and the chord qualities, then see what key they fit into.

Let's list the progression step by step, considering the bass notes:

The progression is: G#, G#, Fm/G#, Fm/G#, Cdim/F#, A#m/G#, G#, G#, Fm/G#, Fm/G#, G#, G#, F#6, G#.

So the bass notes are:

First two: G#

Then two of Fm/G# → bass G#

Then Cdim/F# → bass F#

Then A#m/G# → bass G#

Then two G#, two Fm/G# (bass G#), two G#, and then F#6 (bass F#), G#.

Wait, F#6 – usually the bass note would be F# unless specified, so F#6 would have bass F#.

So the bass line would be: G#, G#, G#, G#, F#, G#, G#, G#, G#, G#, G#, F#, G#.

Hmm, the bass line seems to be mostly G# and F# with some repetition.

Now, let's think about the key. Let's consider what key has G# or A flat as the tonic. Alternatively, since G# and Ab are enharmonic, maybe the key is Ab major or something.

But let's list all the chord root notes. Let's ignore the slashes for a moment and look at the chord qualities:

- G# : likely G# major (G# B# D#?), since G# major is G#, B#, D#. Wait, but if it's a single "G#" it might be just the root, but usually written as G# maj or G#.

Wait, but often when a single letter is used without modifier, it's major. So G# is G# major chord.

Then Fm/G# – which is F minor with G# bass, so F minor chord (F, Ab, C), but bass G# (which is Ab).

Then Cdim/F# – C diminished with F# bass. Cdim is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass.

A#m/G# – A# minor chord (A#, C#, E#) but bass G#.

F#6 – F# major with added 6th, so F#, A#, C#, D#.

But let's see if we can analyze this in terms of common keys.

Let's consider the key of A minor, or perhaps G# minor, but that's a bit messy with sharps. Since the chords have a lot of F minor, Cdim, etc.

Wait, Cdim is also known as the diminished chord of certain scales. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's look at the notes of each chord.

Let's list all the chords in the progression:

- G#: likely G# major = G#, B#, D# (B# is C natural)

- Fm/G#: F minor chord (F, Ab, C) with G# bass. So the chord contains G#, F, Ab, C. But Ab = G#, so actually the bass G# is same as Ab. So the chord has G# (bass), F, Ab (which is same as G#), but that seems redundant. Wait, perhaps the actual notes are G#, F, Ab, C. Wait, Ab is G#, so the notes would be G#, F, G#, C. Which is a bit confusing. Maybe better to write enharmonically. Let's choose to write in key of G major, but wait.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is C minor or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's take the bass notes and see what key they might outline.

The bass line is mostly G# followed by F#. The progression has bass notes as G#. Let's see:

Bass notes: G#, G#, G#, G#, F#, G#, G#, G#, G#, G#, G#, F#, G#

So the bass line is a bit repetitive: G# for many bars, then F#, then G#, then F#...

So the bass is going between G# and F#.

Now, what key has both G# and F#? Well, if the key is G# major, the scale is G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F## (but that's complicated, with double sharps). Alternatively, the key could be A flat major, which is Easier. A flat major has Bb, Db, Eb, etc.

Wait, let's consider if the key is Ab major. Let's check the scales.

Ab major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

Now, let's check the chords in the progression against that.

But wait, the bass notes: G# is the same as Ab. If the bass note is G#, in Ab major that's the tonic. So if the bass is Ab (notated as G#), then that's the tonic.

Similarly, F# would be the same as Gb. In Ab major, Gb isn't a diatonic note; Ab major has Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. So the note G natural, not Gb. So F# (Gb) is not in Ab major.

Alternatively, if the key is G# minor. Let's check G# minor. The natural minor scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Yes, natural minor of G# would have F# as the 7th scale degree. So let's see.

G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Now, let's see what chords fit in this key.

But the progression has Fm/G#, which is F minor with G# bass. Let's see F minor – F, Ab, C. In G# minor scale, what notes are present?

G# minor notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

F natural is not in this scale. Wait, F natural is lower than F#. So F natural would be outside the scale. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Ab major scale instead. Ab major has scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

If we consider the key of Ab major, then the chords would be:

Ab major (tonic), Bb minor, C minor, Db major, Eb major, F minor, G diminished.

But looking at the chords in the progression: G# major (same as Ab major), Fm – in Ab major scale, F minor would be the vi chord. So Fm is diatonic. A#m – A# is Bb in Ab major. So A# minor would be Bb minor, which in Ab major is the ii chord? Wait, in Ab major, the chords are:

i: Ab

ii: Bb minor

iii: C minor

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: F minor

vii°: G diminished

So yes. So if the key is Ab major, then F minor is vi. A#m is Bb minor, because A# is Bb. Cdim would be the vii chord, which is G diminished. But wait, in the progression, there's a Cdim/F# chord. Let's see.

In Ab major, the vii° chord is G diminished chord (G, Bb, Db), but in 1st inversion or something.

Cdim chord: C, Eb, Gb. Wait, in the key of Ab major, the diminished chord is vii° which is G°. So G°. But in the progression, there's a Cdim chord. If we're in Ab major, Cdim would be non-diatonic. Hmm, unless it's a different key.

Wait, perhaps we need to see where F# comes into play. Let's look at the chords:

If key is A minor, natural minor: A B C D E F G. But no, A minor has no sharps, but the progression has G#s. Maybe A# minor, but that's complicated.

Wait, another approach: let's list all the notes used in the entire progression. Let's see the actual notes in each chord.

For each chord instance:

- G# major chord: G#, B#, D#

- Fm/G#: bass G#, then F, Ab, C. So notes are G#, F, Ab (which is G#), C. So the actual notes are G# (twice), F, C.

Wait, but Ab and G# are the same note, so the chord Fm/G# has notes: G#, F, Ab (same as G#), C → so G#, F, C. Because Ab is same as G#. So perhaps it's a chord that has G#, F, C.

But that would be G# minor seventh? Not sure. Alternatively, if Fm/G# – F minor triad with G# bass. So the notes would be G# (bass), then the F minor triad in inversion. So F minor triad is F, Ab, C. But with G# in the bass, so the notes are G#, F, Ab, C. But Ab and G# are same pitch, so only three distinct notes: G#, F, C. But G# is bass, which is the same as Ab. So it's Ab, F, C. Wait, Ab as bass note, then F and C. So that's a chord: Ab - F - C. Which is Ab major with 11th? No, Ab, C, F is Ab major chord, but that's not. Wait, Ab major is Ab, C, Eb. But here we have Ab (as G#), F, C. So the notes are Ab, C, F. Which is a chord with Ab root, C and F. So Ab is root, then C is major third, and F is perfect fourth? So an Ab major(add11), or sometimes written as Absus4. But not sure. Alternatively, it could be a F minor triad over Ab bass, but F minor in first inversion is Ab, C, F. Yes! Yes, that's correct. Fm in first inversion is Ab, C, F. So Fm/G# would be equivalent to Fm/Ab, where the bass is Ab (same as G#). So Fm in first inversion has Ab as the bass note. So the chord is Ab/C/F → but it's F minor chord in first inversion.

Similarly, Cdim/F# – C diminished triad (C, Eb, Gb) with F# bass. If F# is bass, then notes are F#, C, Eb, Gb. But Gb and F# are enharmonic. So if Gb is written as F#, but the bass is F# and the chord has Gb which is same note, then the chord would have F# as bass, and then C, Eb, and F# again. That seems odd. Alternatively, it's a different chord.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is something like C# minor or B major. Let's think.

Another way: the chord F#6 – F# major with added 6th. So F#, A#, C#, D#. That's a common chord in F# major key or D# minor.

Wait, let's check the F#6 chord: F# (root), A# (major third), C# (perfect fifth), D# (major sixth). So F# major triad with 6th.

If the progression has F#6 and other chords, maybe the key is F# major or D# minor.

Let's try F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Wait, E# is F. But F# major has E# (which is F), so scale notes: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

But in the progression, there is an A#m chord. A# minor would be A#, C#, E#. Which is diatonic to F# major, since in F# major, the ii chord is G# minor; iii is A# minor; IV is B major; V is C# major; vi is D# minor; vii° is E# diminished.

Wait, A# minor in F# major scale would be the iii chord.

Now let's see:

F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Chords:

i: F# major

ii: G# minor

iii: A# minor

IV: B major

V: C# major

vi: D# minor

vii°: E# diminished (which is F diminished)

Now, the progression's chords:

- G#: which in F# major would be the ii chord (G# minor), but the chord here is written as "G#", which if it's just G#, it could be G# minor. Wait, but the progression starts with G# G#... which in F# major would be ii chord.

- Fm/G#: F minor chord. But F in F# major scale is E# (which is the 7th degree), so F natural would not be diatonic. Wait, F natural instead of E#? Because E# is F natural. In F# major, the 7th note is E#, which is enharmonic to F natural. So actually, F natural is the same as E# in the key. Hmm.

So if the key is F# major, then the E# is F natural. So in the chord Fm – F minor – which would be F, Ab, C. But in F# major, Ab would be G# (since Ab is G#), but wait, in F# major scale, Ab isn't present; the scale has F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Wait, Ab would be enharmonic to G#, but in F# major, the scale doesn't have Ab. So if Fm chord is present, that would be a minor chord starting on F natural. Which in F# major scale, this is not diatonic. Because the note F is represented as E# in F# major scale, but the chord Fm would contain F natural (same as E#), which is a diatonic note. Wait, but E# is the 7th degree of F# major. But a chord built on F natural would be the chord starting on E#, but as E# minor? Hmm, getting confusing.

Let's take a step back. Let's look at the actual notes present:

- G# major chord: G#, B#, D# (B# = C natural)

- Fm/G#: F minor (F, Ab, C) with bass G#. Notes: G#, F, Ab, C → note that Ab = G#, so bass G# and chord has Ab (same note), so the notes are G#, F, C.

- Cdim/F#: C dim (C, Eb, Gb) with bass F#. Notes: F#, C, Eb, Gb. But Gb=F#, so same note. So notes F#, C, Eb.

- A#m/G#: A# minor chord (A#, C#, E#) with bass G#. So notes G#, A#, C#, E#.

- F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#.

- And repeated G#.

Hmm. Let's list all possible notes present:

From G# major: G#, B#, D# (B#=C)

From Fm/G# (with bass G#): G#, F, Ab (same as G#?), C. So actually G#, F, C. But F is F natural. Ab is G#, but in terms of pitch it's the same. So the actual pitches: G#, C, F.

But F is F natural, and G# is the sharp. So in terms of actual frequencies:

F is about 174.61 Hz, G# is about 207.65 Hz, etc.

From Cdim/F#: F#, C, Eb.

From A#m/G#: G#, A#, C#, E# (E#=F)

So notes: G#, A#, C#, F.

From F#6: F#, A#, C#, D#.

So compiling all the notes used:

- G# (same as Ab)

- B# (C)

- D#

- F (natural)

- Ab (same as G#)

- C (natural)

- F#

- Eb (same as D#)

- A#

- E# (F natural)

Wait, E# is F natural. So when we have E#, that's actually F natural.

So let's list the distinct pitches:

- F natural

- F#

- Eb (or D#)

- G#

- B# (C natural)

- D#

- C natural (same as B#)

- A#

Wait, getting messy. Let's collect all unique pitches:

Considering F natural, G#, A#, B natural (B# is C), D#, C#, Eb (D#), F#, etc.

Wait, maybe better to list in semitones:

F = 5 (if C=4)

Wait, perhaps better to use absolute values.

Let's assign numbers to the pitches (A=0, A#=1, B=2, C=3, Db=3, C#=4, D=5, Eb=6, D#=7, E=8, F=9, Gb=9, F#=10, G=11, Ab=12? No. Better to use standard note numbers.

Standard pitch class numbers:

C = 0

C# = 1

D = 2

D# = 3

E = 4

F = 5

F# = 6

G = 7

G# = 8

A = 9

A# = 10

B = 11

So pitch class numbers:

F natural = 5

F# = 6

G# = 8

A# = 10

C = 0

D# = 3

E# = F = 5

B# = C = 0

So from the chords:

- G# major: G#=8, B#=11? Wait, wait no.

Wait, the G# major chord consists of G#, B#, D#.

G# pitch class: 8

B# is the same as C natural (0) because B# = C. But wait, in pitch classes, B#=11+1=0 (mod 12), since B is 11, so B# is 0.

Similarly, D# is 3.

So G# major chord: 8, 0, 3.

Fm/G# chord: Fm is F=5, Ab (G#=8? No: Ab is A♭ which is pitch class 8? No. Wait Ab is A-flat, which is 8 (since A=9, Ab=8). Yes.

Standard:

A = 9

Ab = 8

A# = 10

B = 11

C = 0

C# = 1

...

So Fm chord (F minor): F=5, Ab=8, C=0.

With bass G#=8.

So chord notes: bass G#=8, then F=5, Ab=8, C=0. So pitches present: 8 (bass), 5, 0.

Cdim/F#: Cdim chord is C=0, Eb=3, Gb=6 (since Gb=8? No: G natural is 7, Gb=6. Because G=7, so Gb=6. Yes. So Cdim = 0, 3, 6. With bass F#=6. So the chord is F#=6 as bass, then C=0, Eb=3, Gb=6. So pitches: 6, 0, 3.

A#m/G#: A# minor chord is A#=10, C=0, E#=5 (since E# = F natural = 5). Bass G#=8. So chord pitches: bass 8, then A#=10, C=0, E#=5.

F#6: F#=6, A#=10, C#=1, D#=3. Wait, F#6: F# root, major third is A# (10), fifth is C# (1+4=5? Wait, correct: F# major chord: F#=6, A#=10, C#=1? Wait no. Wait:

F# major: root F#=6

Major third is A#=10 (since F# to A#: 4 semitones up? Wait F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10. Yes, so 4 semitones from F# to A#.

F# to C#: F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11, C=0, C#=1. So that's 5 semitones from F# to C#, which is perfect fifth. So F# major is 6, 10, 1.

Now F#6 adds the 6th, which is D#: 3 (F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11, C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3). Yes. So F#6 is: 6, 10, 1, 3.

So compiling all pitch classes used in the entire progression:

From G# major: 8, 0, 3 (but wait in G# major chord: G#=8, B#=11? No, wait. Wait, G# major: G#=8, B#= (G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11, so B#=C natural=0), and D#=3.

Wait, yes: G# major chord is G# (8), B# (which is C natural, pitch class 0), D# (3).

So pitches 8, 0, 3.

Fm/G#: bass 8, and chord Fm (F=5, Ab=8, C=0). So pitches: 8,5,0.

Cdim/F#: bass 6, chord Cdim=0,3,6 → pitches 0,3,6.

A#m/G#: bass 8, A# minor chord (A#=10, C=0, E#=5 (since E#=F natural=5). So pitches 10,0,5.

F#6: 6, 10, 1, 3.

The F#6 also has C#=1 and D#=3.

Looking at all pitch classes used:

- 0 (C)

- 1 (C#)

- 3 (D#)

- 5 (F)

- 6 (F#)

- 8 (G#)

- 10 (A#)

Are there others? Let's see:

From F#6, there's also D#=3. So the pitch classes present are 0,1,3,5,6,8,10.

Now, what scale can contain these notes?

Let's see. Possible keys:

Let's check G# minor. G# natural minor scale: G#=8, A#=10, B=11, C#=1, D#=3, E=4, F#=6.

But in our list we have 0 (C), which isn't in G# minor. G# minor has C# (1), not C natural (0). So that's a problem. The scale would be G# 8, A# 10, B 11, C# 1, D# 3, E 4, F# 6. So no 0 (C natural). So if there are Cs (pitch class 0), which is C natural, then it's outside G# minor natural.

Similarly, G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F# → wait harmonic minor has raised 7th, so F## (G natural), but let's see:

Natural minor: 8,10,11,1,3,4,6.

Harmonic minor: raise 7th, so F#=6 to F##=G=7. So scale: 8,10,11,1,3,4,7.

Still no C natural (0). So probably not.

How about A minor? A minor natural: A=9, B=11, C=0, D=2, E=4, F=5, G=7.

Our scale has 0 (C), 5 (F), 6 (F#), 8 (G#), 10 (A#), also 1 (C#), 3 (D#), which A minor doesn't have. So no.

How about F minor? F natural minor: F=5, G=7, Ab=8, Bb=10, C=0, Db=2, Eb=3. So scale: pentatonic notes: 5,7,8,10,0,2,3.

But our progression has pitch classes: 0,1,3,5,6,8,10. F natural minor has 0,2,3,5,7,8,10. Missing 1 and 6. But we have C# (1) and F# (6), which are not in F minor natural.

F harmonic minor: F G Ab Bb C Db E.

Scale: 5,7,8,10,0,3,11.

Still no 1 (C#), and has E=11.

F melodic minor: F G Ab Bb C D E.

Which has D=2, E=4.

So still no match.

Another approach: look at the pitch classes present: 0 (C), 1 (C#), 3 (D#), 5 (F), 6 (F#), 8 (G#), 10 (A#).

This seems like a chromatic mess? Not sure. Wait, perhaps this scale is part of some mode of major or minor. Wait, but let's see if there's a key that fits most of these.

Notice that F#, G#, A#, C major? No.

Wait, look at the chord F#6: includes F#, A#, C#, D#. So notes: 6,10,1,3.

And we have G# major (8,0,3), but wait G# major is G#, B#, D# → 8, 0, 3 (B#=0 since B#=C).

Wait, but G# major chord contains C natural and D#, which are part of the progression.

But also F (pitch 5), which is in Fm chord.

Let me try to see which key could contain all these. Let's see the notes:

We have C natural (0), C# (1), D# (3), F (5), F# (6), G# (8), A# (10).

This is a lot of semitones. Let's list all notes present:

C, C#, D#, E (wait, we don't have E? Or E?=F=5. A#=10, so Ab=8, G#=8? A#=10. F=5.

Wait, is there a note E? Pitch class 4. We don't seem to have that. We have E# which is pitch 5. So probably no E.

So notes in chromatic order:

C (0), C# (1), D# (3), F (5), F# (6), G# (8), A# (10).

Missing D (2), E (4), G (7), A (9), B (11), etc.

This doesn't look like standard keys. Maybe it's not using a standard major/minor scale but perhaps a different mode or key.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these chords are functioning as substitutes or modal interchange.

Wait, let's look at the chord types. We have Fm/G# which is F minor with G# bass. As mentioned earlier, that's Ab (G#) as bass with F minor triad, so it's F minor in first inversion: Ab, C, F.

Cdim/F# is C diminished with F# bass, which would be F# (Gb), C, Eb. So Gb, C, Eb → which is the same as F# half-diminished? Not sure.

Wait, but another idea: let's see if there's a tonic note that many chords resolve to. Looking at the progression, it starts and ends with G#, and repeats G# frequently, suggesting G# is the tonic.

So if the key is G# major or G# minor.

G# major scale: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##.

But F## is G natural. So scale: G# Ab? No, G# major is G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F## (which is G natural).

But F## is G. So chord F## is G natural.

But in the progression, there's F natural (F), which is Eb? No, F natural is different from E#.

Wait, in G# major scale, E# is the 7th degree of G# major (since G# major: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##), so E# is the 6th step? Let's check:

G# (1), A# (2), B# (3), C# (4), D# (5), E# (6), F## (7).

But E# is F natural. So in G# major scale, the 6th degree is E# (F natural), 7th is F## (G).

Now, the chord Fm/G# – F minor. F is pitch 5, but in G# major scale, F natural isn't a scale degree; the scale has E# (F natural), but that's the 6th degree. However, F minor chord would be built on F natural, which is part of the scale as E#.

But building a minor chord on F#? No.

Wait, maybe the key is E major or something else. Let's think differently.

Another approach: look at chord qualities and their functions in various keys.

For example, in the chord progression, there's a Cdim chord, which is a diminished triad. Diminished chords often function as vii° in minor keys.

Also, Fm could be in certain keys.

Wait, if it's G# minor, natural minor scale would be G# minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Let's see what chords fit.

i: G# minor

ii°: A# diminished

III: B major

iv: C# minor

v: D# minor

VI: E major

VII: F# major.

But the progression has Fm – which would be F minor. But in G# natural minor scale, F# is present, not F natural. So F natural would be outside. But our progression includes F natural (Fm chord has F and Ab and C).

Wait, but if the key is F# minor. Let's check.

F# minor natural: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E.

Chords:

i: F# minor

ii°: G# diminished

III: A major

iv: B minor

v: C# minor

VI: D major

VII: E major.

But our progression has a Cdim chord, which would be C diminished. But in F# minor, the scale has C# and D natural. So C natural would be outside. Hmm.

Wait, but if it's F# harmonic minor: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E#.

Scale: F#, G#, A, B, C#, D, E#.

Chords:

i: F#m

ii°: G# dim

III+: A augmented

iv: Bm

v: C#m

VI: D major

VII: E# major.

But we have a Cdim – if it's C diminished chord, which is C, Eb, Gb. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is A major, but doesn't fit.

Wait, let's look at the bass notes and see what the progression might be.

Bass line steps:

G# - G# - G# - G# - F# - G# - ...

This suggests that the bass is moving from G# to F#. G# to F# is a half step down. So if it's moving between G# and F#, maybe it's a G# minor or G# major context where the tonic is G#.

In G# minor scale, the chord on the 7th degree is F# major. But if there's a bass descent G# to F#, maybe the F# is the dominant or something.

Wait, another idea: let's look at the chord A#m/G# – A# minor, bass on G#. What's that chord? A# minor with G# bass. So the notes are G#, A#, C#, E# (F).

This is the same as what we had before. A#m over G# bass.

In G# minor scale, the scale has A# as the second degree. So A#m would be the ii chord. So in G# natural minor:

G#m (i), A#dim (ii°), Bmaj (III), C#m (iv), D#m (v), Emaj (VI), F#maj (VII).

But wait, in natural minor, ii is diminished. So A#m would not be diatonic. It should be A# diminished chord.

So that's odd. If there's a A#m in G# minor, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the key is E minor.

E minor natural: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

But chords here: E minor, F# diminished, G major, A minor, B minor, C major, D major. Not matching the progression chords.

Wait, trying to find a key where Fm is a diatonic chord.

Fm is in D major (vi chord), but D major scale is D E F# G A B C#.

Hmm.

Alternatively, consider the chords: G# major, Fm, Cdim, F#6.

Another angle: look for common chord progressions.

For example, a progression like i VI ii iii or something. But not sure.

Wait, let's suppose the key is A# minor. That would be very sharp, but let's see.

A# minor natural: A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F##, G## (but this is messy).

A# minor: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#.

Wait, natural minor scale: root, whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole.

A# minor: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#.

Scale degrees:

i: A#m

ii°: B dim

III: C#m

iv: D#m

v: Em

VI: F#m

VII: G#maj.

Hmm, not sure. In this scale, F#m would be the VI chord.

But in our progression, there's an F#6 chord. F#6 would be in F# major, but in A# minor scale, the VI chord is F# minor, so F# minor chord. But F#6 is major with added 6th, which might fit if it's a major chord, but in A# minor it's supposed to be minor.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe we should think about the chords and see what key has those chords.

The chord F#6 is often found in D major or D minor (as the IV or IVm chord), but D major is D E F# G A B C#.

Wait, but in that scale, F# is a major chord.

Alternatively, the chord progression has several G# chords, suggesting G# is tonic. So let's proceed with that.

Assume key is G# major.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F## (which is G natural).

The chord G# major would be tonic.

Fm – what is F in this scale? F is part of E# (since E# = F natural). In G# major scale, E# is the sixth degree. So E# is part of the scale, but F natural is just E#.

But a chord Fm is built on F natural. In terms of scale degrees, that would be building a chord on the 6th degree, which is E# major in the scale? No, G# major chord on E# would be E# major, but that's the sixth chord.

But Fm chord would have F, Ab, C. In G# major scale, the note Ab is G#? No, Ab is a different note. In G# major, the scale has F## (G natural) as the 7th degree. So Ab would be a chromatic note.

Hmm.

Another idea: perhaps the key is E flat major (E♭ major), which has flats, but let's see.

E♭ major scale: E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, D♭.

But our chords have G# and F#, etc. Maybe not.

Wait, if the key is F# major.

F# major: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Scale degrees:

1: F#

2: G#

3: A#

4: B

5: C#

6: D#

7: E# (F)

Chords:

i: F#m? No, F# major chord is tonic.

Actually, F# major scale has chords:

I: F# major

II: G# minor

III: A# minor

IV: B major

V: C# major

VI: D# minor

VII: E# diminished.

So in F# major:

The iii chord is A# minor. The progression has A#m/G#. So A# minor is in the key.

Also, we have F#6 – that would be a major VI chord, but in F# major, D# minor is vi. F#6 is a possible extended chord but not typically part of the scale.

Also, G# minor would be the ii chord, but the progression starts with G# chords. Since in F# major, G# minor is ii, so starting with ii chord could make sense.

Also, Fm – in F# major, F natural is E# (7th degree, but E# is F natural). So building a chord on F natural would be the VII chord. In F# major, the VII chord is E# diminished. But Fm would be F natural minor, which is different.

Cdim – C diminished. In F# major, the scale is F# G# A# B C# D# E#.

C# is the 5th degree. C natural would be outside.

Hmm. But let's look at the chord Cdim/F#. Cdim with F# bass. If we're in F# major, Cdim is not diatonic.

Wait, another thought: the presence of an F#6 chord could be a major triad on F# with added 6th. F#6 is F# A# C# D#. In the key of B major, D# minor is the vi chord. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at the chord progression in terms of common cadences. The fact that it ends on G# might suggest G# is tonic. So let's try to see what chords can be in G# minor.

G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

Chords:

i: G# minor

ii°: A# diminished

III: B major

iv: C# minor

v: D# minor

VI: E major

VII: F# major

G# harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

So the VII chord would be F## major, but in harmonic minor, the VII is major.

G# melodic minor ascending: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F##.

Descending is natural minor.

But our progression has Fm (F minor), which would not be in G# minor.

Unless there's chord substitutions. A #m/G# – A# minor. In G# minor, the second degree is diminished, not minor.

Another idea: perhaps this progression is in C# minor. Let's see.

C# minor natural: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B.

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III: E major

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A major

VII: B major.

Hmm, in C# minor, v chord is G# minor. If the progression has G# major chords, but in C# minor, G# minor would be the v chord. But if there's G# major, that would be a borrowed chord.

C# minor with a major V chord (G# major), which is common in harmonic minor.

So C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#.

So scale: C# D# E F# G# A B#.

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III+: E augmented

iv: F#m

v: G# major

VI: A major

VII: B#dim.

Wait, that's a possibility. So in C# harmonic minor, the v chord is G# major. And the vi chord would be A major.

Now, looking at the progression:

G# major chord – yes, that's the v chord in C# minor harmonic.

Fm/G# – F minor in G# bass. In C# harmonic minor scale, there is an F natural? C# harmonic minor has F#, not F natural. So F natural would be chromatic.

Hmm, unless there's a modulation or non-diatonic chord.

But in C# harmonic minor, A natural (not G#), etc.

Let's see:

C# harmonic minor has notes: C# D# E F# G# A B#.

E is present.

So let's see if any chords fit.

G# major (v chord) – yes.

A#m/G# – A# minor chord. A# would be in this scale? C# scale has A natural, not A#.

A# is Bb. Doesn't fit.

F#6 chord: F# A# C# D#. In C# harmonic minor, F# is the IV chord. But F#6 would be IV chord with added sixth. Possible.

But I'm getting lost. Let's try a different method.

Let me look at each chord individually and see what they might be functioning as.

First, "G#" – likely G# major or G# minor chords. If it keeps repeating G#, maybe it's the tonic.

Then "Fm/G#" – F minor chord with G# bass. So the chord is F minor in first inversion with bass on Ab (G#), which is Ab, C, F.

" Cdim/F#" – C diminished chord with F# in bass. So notes F#, C, Eb, Gb.

" A#m/G#" – A# minor with G# bass: G#, A#, C#, E# (F).

"F#6" – F#, A#, C#, D#.

Let's see what key has all these chords. F# major? In F# major, we have C# major, G# minor, A# minor.

But the chord Fm (F natural minor) is not in F# major because F# major has F## (which is G). Wait, F# major scale notes are F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E# (F).

So yes, the E# is F natural, so F natural is present as E#.

But a chord Fm would be built on F, which in scale degree terms is the 7th degree. In F# major, the 7th degree is E# diminished chord.

But Fm chord is different.

Wait, but the chord Fm (F natural minor) would have notes F, Ab, C. Ab is G# (since G#=Ab), but in F# major scale, G# is present as the second degree.

Let's see:

F natural: E# (7th degree in F# major)

Ab: G# (second degree)

C: not sure. In F# major scale: F# G# A# B C# D# E#. So C is actually C#.

So C natural wouldn't be present. So Ab= G# is present, but C natural isn't. The scale has C#.

So for Fm chord: F (E#), Ab (G#), C (natural) – but C natural is not in F# major scale, which has C#. So C natural would be outside the scale.

Hmm. So that's problematic.

Wait, but in the chord A#m/G# we have notes G#, A#, C#, E#. Which in the chord are G# (bass), A# (root of A#m), C#, E#.

Which fits F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#.

Yes, G# (2), A# (3), C# (5), E# (7).

So F# major scale has all these notes.

G# major chord: would require G# B# D# (B#=C natural). But F# major scale has C# as the 5th degree. B# is C natural, which isn't in the scale. The scale has B natural as the 4th degree. Yes, F# major scale has F# G# A# B C# D# E#.

B is a natural. So G# major chord would be G# B# D#. B# is C natural. But F# major scale contains B natural, not C natural. So that would be non-diatonic.

Ah, here's the issue. The G# major chord contains B# (C natural), which is not present in F# major scale. The F# major scale has B natural (4), C# (5).

But G# as root with B# (C natural) would mean the major third is C natural. In F# major scale, the note after B natural is C#, so C natural would be flat.

So G# major chord is not diatonic to F# major.

Another idea: perhaps the key is B major.

B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#.

Chords:

I: B major

II:C#m

III:D#m

IV:E major

V:F# major

VI:G#m

VII:A#dim.

In B major, the chord G#m would be vi. But if chords are G# major, then it would be non-diatonic. But progression has G# chords. Not sure.

Wait, this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me list all the chords used in the progression:

- G# (major?)

- Fm/G# (F minor, bass G#)

- Cdim/F# (Cdim, bass F#)

- A#m/G# (A# minor, bass G#)

- F#6 (F# major with sixth)

- G# repeated.

Let's look for a key where these chords make sense.

The Cdim/F# chord – Cdim with F# bass. Cdim is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass, so F#. What chord is Cdim over F#? F#, C, Eb, Gb. Which is equivalent to F# diminished seventh chord? No, diminished seventh would have a diminished fifth. Wait, F# dim7 is F# Ab C D.

But our bass is F#, C, Eb, Gb. Gb is F#, so it's F#, C, Eb, F#.

Not sure. Alternatively, F# minor 7 flat 5 or something else.

Another idea: the F# chord in bass could indicate that F# is the root of some chord, but it's part of Cdim/F#.

Perhaps the chord is Cdim7, but written as Cdim/F#, meaning F# in bass. So Cdim7 = C, Eb, Gb, Bbb (which is A), but not sure.

This is too confusing. Maybe better to think of the progression as having tonic G# and using some borrowed chords.

Wait, if the tonic is G#, then:

- G# major chord: tonic

- Fm/G#: this is F minor over G# bass. If G# is tonic, then this chord has G#-F-Ab-C. Which is G# with F, Ab, C. So G# minor with flattened 2nd, 4th? Not sure.

In G# minor (natural), the scale is G# A# B C# D# E F#.

So F natural isn't in the scale, but the chord Fm has F, which is not in the scale.

But if we consider G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F## (G natural).

So scale notes: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, G#.

So notes present: all with G# as root, up to G natural as seventh degree.

But a minor key has a minor seventh usually harmonic minor raises seventh to major.

But in this case, F## is G natural.

Now, the chord Fm: F natural minor. But in G# harmonic minor, F natural would be F natural, which is not present; the scale has E natural and G natural.

This isn't helping.

Maybe the key is A major. A major scale: A B C# D E F# G#.

Chords:

I: A major

II: B minor

III: C# minor

IV: D major

V: E major

VI: F# major

VII: G# diminished.

In A major, G# diminished is vii°, but our progression has G# major chords, which would be outside.

But F# major chord is vi, and if we have F#6, that may fit as a major chord. A#m/G# would be A# minor. In A major scale, A# is Bb, not present. So no.

Another idea: let's look at the chords themselves for clues. The presence of Fm and Cdim suggests possible keys like C minor or F minor.

In C natural minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb.

Chord Fm is iv.

Cdim is i° (no, diminished is vii°).

Not sure.

In F minor natural: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb.

Chords:

i: Fm

ii°: G°

III: Ab major

iv: Bbm

v: Cm

VI: Db major

VII: Eb major.

But our progression has G# chords, which would be Ab in this key. So if F minor key, then G# is Ab. So Ab would be the III chord.

But the progression has "G#" as chords – if the key is F minor, then G# is Ab, so Ab major (III).

Let's try this.

Assume key is F minor.

F minor scale: F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Wait, natural minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb.

Yes.

Scale degrees:

i: F minor

ii°: G diminished

III: Ab major

iv: Bb minor

v: C minor

VI: Db major

VII: Eb major.

Now, looking at the chord "G#": which is Ab.

So G# major chord would be Ab major chord, which is the III chord in F minor.

That fits. So G# written as Ab major chord.

Similarly, "Fm/G#": F minor with G# (Ab) bass. In the key of F minor, Fm chord, and with Ab bass – this would be first inversion of F minor (Ab, C, F), which is common.

In F minor, the ii° chord is G diminished, but here chord is Fm/G# which is Fm first inversion.

Then Cdim/F#, but in F minor scale, Cdim would be? C minor is v chord, not diminished. Wait, v chord in minor is minor, but harmonic minor would make it major or dim.

Cdim in context of F minor: if we take harmonic minor, the v chord is major. But C diminished – not sure.

But let's check Cdim/F#.

Cdim chord is C, Eb, Gb. With F# bass. In F minor scale (natural), we have the chord notes:

C natural (v chord), F minor natural has C natural. Gb is Ab, which is in scale.

But F# would be outside. In F minor scale, F# would be raised.

But F natural is tonic.

F# isn't in F minor scale.

Hmm.

Wait, but Ab is G#. If the key is F minor, then Ab is the major III chord. But the chord "G#" as in F minor context would be Ab.

Another chord: A#m/G#. If key is F minor, A# is Bb. So A#m would be Bbm, which in F minor is the iv chord. But the chord is A#m/G# which is Bbm with G# bass. G# is Ab, so Bbm/Ab – which is first inversion of Bbm chord (Ab, C, Bb). Which makes sense in F minor key as iv chord in first inversion.

Cdim/F#: Cdim chord with F# bass. If in F minor, perhaps Cdim is not diatonic, but F# could be Gb, which is Ab. Wait, this is confusing.

But let's proceed:

If the key is F minor:

- G# (Ab) is the major III chord.

- Fm/G# would be Fm in first inversion, which is diatonic.

- A#m/G# – A#m is Bbm, G# is Ab, so Bbm/Ab which is iv chord in first inversion.

- Cdim/F#: If we assume F# is Gb (Ab), but F# is different. Wait, F# is not in F minor scale. Unless it's using harmonic minor.

F harmonic minor: F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, E.

So in harmonic minor, there's E natural.

Then F# would be Gb, but not sure.

Let's see chord Cdim/F#. In F harmonic minor, C dim would be C Eb Gb. With bass F# (which is Gb). So bass Gb. So the chord would be Gb, C, Eb, Gb. Which is Gb diminished – which is the vii° chord in C minor. Not sure.

This is really tough.

Wait another idea: perhaps the key is G# minor, but using some chromaticism.

But I'm stuck. Let's try to find the most likely key based on common chords.

The presence of F#6 chord suggests the key might be related to F# major or E minor.

Wait, E minor scale: E F# G A B C D. The IV chord in E minor is A major, but F# is ii? No. Let's see.

No. Alternatively, key of B minor.

Wait, perhaps the key is F# major, which has A# minor as III chord. Let's revisit this.

F# Major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E# (F).

Chords:

I: F#

II: G#m

III: A#m

IV: B

V: C#

VI: D#m

VII: E#°

Now, the progression has:

- G# major chord? But in F# major, G# is natural minor (second degree), so G#m. But the chord is written as "G#", which might mean G# major. But in F# major scale, the G# note would be the major II chord? No, ii chord is minor. So F# natural minor is different.

Wait, no. In major scale, second chord is minor. So to have G# major, it would be a borrowed chord from another scale. Maybe parallel minor or something.

But let's assume that in F# major, G# is G# major – which would be out of scale.

But the chord A#m is in scale (III chord).

F#6 chord could be the tonic chord with added sixth. F#6 would be F# A# C# D#. Which includes the sixth D#. In F# major, the IV chord is B, V is C# major. But F#6 is not standard but possible.

Cdim/F#: Cdim (C Eb Gb) with F# bass. In F# major scale, C# is present but C natural isn't. Eb isn't in scale either (scale has D#). So this is outside.

Hmm.

Let's think of a different approach. Let's see the progression as written:

G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#

Let's write out the chord types clearly:

- G# (G# major? Or perhaps G# minor)

- Fm/G# (F minor over G#)

- Cdim/F# (C diminished over F#)

- A#m/G# (A# minor over G#)

- F#6 (F# major sixth)

Assume the key is F# minor. Wait, F# minor would have:

Scale: F# G# A B C# D E.

Chords:

i: F#m

ii°: G#°

III: A major

iv: Bm

v: C#m

VI: D major

VII: E major

Not seeing this fit.

Wait, but the chord "G#" – could be G# major, but in F# minor scale, G# chord would be the second degree which is diminished. So G#°. But if they're using G# major, it's non-diatonic.

Another idea: let's look at the bass notes again. The bass goes G# G# G# G# F# G# etc. So the bass moves from G# to F#.

This seems like a descending half-step motion: G# to F#. In many keys, that might be a dominant to tonic movement but reversed. Like in C major, moving from B to C, but here G# to F# is descending half step.

If the tonic is F#, then the chord before could be E major, but that's not here. Alternatively, maybe the tonic is G#, and F# is leading tone? But in G# minor, the VII chord is F# major. Yes!

In G# natural minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

So VII chord is F# major.

So the progression has F# and G# chords. If the VII chord is F# major, tonic is G# minor.

So let's check this key.

G# natural minor:

i: G#m

ii°: A#dim

III: B maj

iv: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E maj

VII: F# maj.

Now the chords in progression:

- G# – likely G#m chord, but written as G# (just major? Or could be minor)

- Fm/G# – F minor with G# bass. In G# minor scale, what is F?

Natural minor scale has E natural and F#.

So F natural isn't in scale. So Fm chord would be chromatic.

But what about the chord structure: Fm/G# – bass G#, notes F, Ab, C. Ab is G# in spelling? No, Ab is a different pitch.

Wait, G# major is G#, B#, D#. G# minor is G#, B, D#.

So G# minor includes B natural, not B#.

In G# natural minor, scale tones are G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#.

So let's see:

If we have a chord "G#", likely G# minor as tonic.

Then Fm/G# – F minor chord with G# bass. F natural and F# are different. So F is outside the scale.

However, there's a chord A#m/G#: A# minor over G# bass. In G# minor scale, A# is the second degree, which is normally diminished chord (A#dim), not minor. So A#m would be non-diatonic.

But wait, if it's G# melodic minor ascending: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F##.

Then scale has E# which is F natural, and F## which is G.

But A#m would still be ii chord, which in melodic minor ascending is minor.

In G# melodic minor ascending: the ii chord would be A#m.

Yes! In minor keys using melodic minor, the ascending form raises sixth and seventh.

G# melodic minor ascending: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F##.

So scale degrees:

i: G#m

ii: A#m

III+: B augmented

IV: C#m

V: D#maj

VI: E#maj

VII: F##m? No, VII should be diminished but in melodic minor ascending, seventh is raised.

Actually, scale is:

1. G#

2. A#

3. B (minor)

4. C#

5. D#

6. E# (raised)

7. F## (raised)

So chords:

i: G#m

ii: A#m

iii: B+ (aug)

IV: C#m (but with raised 7, IV would be minor)

V: D# major (since V chord is major for harmonic/minor)

VI: E# major

VII: F## diminished? Wait, no – in melodic minor ascending, upper part is raised, VII should be minor.

This is getting complicated, but the key point is in G# melodic minor ascending, the ii chord is A#m.

Also, the chord A#m/G# would be part of the key.

Now, what's Fm/G#: F minor with G# bass. In this scale, there's a note E# which is F natural. So F natural is the 6th degree of the scale (E#).

So F minor chord is built on the 6th degree. The iii chord in this scale would be B+.

But Fm would be the iii chord if we're using a different key.

Wait, but in G# melodic minor, sixth degree is E#, which is F. So the chord built on sixth degree would be E# (F) minor? Let's see.

Chord built on sixth degree (F): F, Ab, C. Which would be F minor. Yes! So if the scale has F natural (as E#), then a minor chord on it would be diatonic.

So in G# melodic minor ascending, the chord on VI is F minor.

Similarly, Cdim – C diminished chord. In G# melodic minor scale, what's C? C# is the IV degree. C natural not present.

Cdim would be outside.

Cdim/F# – Cdim with F# bass. F# is the VII degree of the scale? No, in G# melodic minor, seventh degree is F## (G), so F# is a chromatic note.

This is getting too involved. Let's try to see if the chord progression fits G# melodic minor.

The progression:

G# chord (tonic i)

Fm/G# – chord on VI (F minor) with G# bass.

Cdim/F# – not sure yet

A#m/G# – ii chord over G# bass

F#6 – not sure.

Another angle: F#6 as a chord. F#6 is F# A# C# D#. In G# melodic minor scale, scale has F## (G), E#, D#, C#, B. So F# note isn't in the scale – the seventh degree is F##. So F# would be a chromatic note.

Hmm.

This is really challenging. Perhaps the key is G# minor with harmonic elements.

Wait, let's think about the F# major chord. In G# minor harmonic, the VII chord is F# major (which is the dominant of F# minor or something), but tonic is G#m.

Yes. In G# harmonic minor scale, the seventh degree is raised to F## (G), so the VII chord is G major? No.

Wait, G# harmonic minor scale:

G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F##.

So scale degrees:

1: G#

2: A#

3: B

4: C#

5: D#

6: E

7: F## (G natural)

Chords:

i: G#m

ii°: A#dim

III+: B augmented

iv: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major

VII: F##maj (G major)

So VII chord is G major.

Not F#. So F# major wouldn't be in this.

But if we had G# natural minor, VI chord is E major.

I'm not sure.

Another thought: the chord progression starts and ends with G#, so let's assume G# is tonic.

Now, the other chords:

- Fm/G# : could be iv chord in a major key, but in G# major, iv would be C#m.

Alternatively, if it's a minor key.

Wait, if G# is tonic and minor, the minor iv chord would be C#m.

But here we have Fm/G# which is different.

Perhaps the key is B major, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at all the root notes of the chords (ignoring slashes):

G#, G#, Fm (root F), Cdim (root C), A#m (root A#), F#6 (root F#), etc.

So root notes: G#, F, C, A#, F#.

This is a variety. If we look at these pitches: F, C, G#, A#, F#.

C and F – these are a perfect fourth apart.

G# and A# are a whole step apart.

F# and G# are whole step.

Not sure.

Wait, consider the chord Cdim/F# – if F# is bass of Cdim chord, then the chord is C diminished over F#. So the full chord would be Cdim as a chord with F# bass, so the root is F#, but chord is diminished. So F# has the diminished chords: F# diminished is F# A C. Not F# C Eb Gb.

Cdim (C, Eb, Gb) with bass F# makes it F# C Eb Gb. This is equivalent to an F# half-diminished seventh chord (F#m7b5), which has F#, A, C, E. No, different. F#m7b5 is F# A C E. Our chord has F#, C, Eb, Gb. Which is F#, C, Eb, Gb. This is the same as A#dim7? Not sure.

This might be a D# diminished seventh with F# bass? Not sure.

I'm stuck. Maybe the key is A# minor.

A# minor natural: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#.

So scale: A# B C# D# E F# G#.

Chords:

i: A#m

ii°: B dim

III: C#m

iv: D#m

v: E minor

VI: F# major

VII: G# major

Wait! In A# minor (which is same as Bb minor), the VII chord is G# major.

Also, the VI chord is F# major.

The progression has "G#" – which would be the VII chord (G# major).

"F#6" – F# major, which would be the VI chord.

"A#m/G#" – A# minor over G# bass. A#m is tonic chord of key, but with G# bass. So A#m/G# is first inversion of A#m – G#, B, E.

"Fm/G#" – F minor with G# bass. In A# minor key, what is F natural? Scale has F# as the VI degree's note. So F natural is outside.

Hmm.

But let's check.

A# minor scale: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#.

If there's a chord Fm, it has F natural, which isn't in scale.

But wait, if we take the A# harmonic minor, the seventh degree is raised. So A# harmonic minor: A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G## (A).

But then VII chord is A major. Still didn't include F natural.

This isn't helping.

Another idea: let's think of the F#6 chord as the V chord to a key of B major. But not sure.

Wait, F#6: F# A# C# D#. This can be seen as D# minor seventh chord (D# F# A# C#), but with added 6th? No, D# minor seventh is D# F# A# C#.

But F#6 is not that.

Wait, no: F#6 chord is spelled F# A# C# D#. So the root is F#. It's F# major triad with 6th added.

If this is part of a key, maybe it's a IV chord in something.

Alternatively, if we are in E major, the IV chord is A major. Not helpful.

I'm really stuck. Let's look up common chord progressions with these chords.

Alternatively, maybe the key is C minor.

C minor scale: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb.

Chords include Fm (iv), but what about G#? G# is Ab. So in C minor, G# would be Ab which is vii chord? No.

In C natural minor, VII chord is Bb major.

Not matching.

Wait, but if key is Ab major.

Ab scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G.

Chords:

i: Ab

ii°: Bb dim

III: C minor

iv: Db

v: Eb

VI: F minor

VII: G diminished.

Now let's see:

" G#" chord: G# is Ab, so G#major would be Ab major.

"Fm/G#": F minor with Ab bass. Since Ab is tonic, F minor would be VI chord.

In Ab major, VI chord is F minor. Yes.

Cdim/F#: C diminished. In Ab major scale, C minor is the iii chord, but diminished? No. C diminished isn't diatonic.

Wait, Cdim chord: C Eb Gb. In Ab major, Gb is F#? No, scale has G natural. So Cdim would be non-diatonic.

But chord A#m/G#: A#m is Bbm in Ab scale. Bbm is iv chord. G# is Ab bass, so Bbm/Ab: first inversion iv chord.

F#6 chord: F# is not in Ab major scale; scale has F natural.

But F# is the #5 or something.

This seems closer.

In Ab major:

- Tonic: Ab

- VI: F minor

- iv: Bbm

So if the progression is played in Ab major:

- G# (which is Ab) would be tonic.

- Fm/G# – F minor over Ab bass. F minor is VI chord, with Ab bass, so this is first inversion? F minor chord is F Ab C. With Ab bass → Ab, F, C. Exactly. So Fm/G# is VI chord in first inversion.

- Cdim/F#: C diminished with F# bass. In Ab major, F# would be Gb, which isn't in scale. So not sure.

- A#m/G# – A# minor is Bbm chord. Over Ab bass → Bbm in first inversion (Ab, C, Bb).

- F#6 chord in Ab major? F# isn't in scale.

Hmm.

But if it's in Ab major, but using F# as a modulation or chromatic. Maybe.

But F# would be a chromatic note. F# is the #2 in Ab.

Not sure.

Let's check the Cdim/F# chord. If key is Ab major, Cdim is not diatonic. Cdim = C Eb Gb. In Ab scale, Eb is present.

Gb would be F#, which is not diatonic.

Alternatively, if the chord is Cdim7, which is C Eb Gb Bbb (which is A), but not sure.

Another approach: let's list all the intervals.

But I think the most plausible key is Ab major, interpreting G# as Ab.

Because:

- The chords fit if we read G# as Ab.

So "G#" chord is Ab major.

"Fm/G#" – F minor chord with Ab bass, which is VI chord (Fm) in Ab major, first inversion.

"Cdim/F#" – perhaps this chord is in context of Ab. If F# is Gb, and Cdim/F# is Gb bass with Cdim. Cdim chord is C Eb Gb. With Gb bass, so it's Gb, C, Eb. Which is Gb major? No, Gb C Eb – that's a diminished triad. Wait, C diminished over Gb bass: Gb C Eb – which is Cdim with Gb root? No. Cdim chord is C Eb Gb. So the chord Cdim with bass note F# (Gb) – yes, the actual chord is Cdim triad, and bass note is Gb. But Cdim already contains Gb. So it's a Cdim chord in root position with Gb bass – which it would be root position for Gb diminished. But Cdim is C Eb Gb. So if bass is Gb, then it's a Gb diminished chord. Which is the vii° in Ab major.

Yes! vii° in Ab major scale is Gb diminished.

Gdim chord (G# diminished would be Abdim, but in terms of pitch, the Gb diminished chord is notes Gb, A, C). No, wait.

In Ab major:

vii° chord is G diminished: G Bb Db.

Wait, no. Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G.

So diatonic chords:

i: Ab maj

ii°: Bb dim

III: C min

iv: Db maj

v: Eb min

VI: F min

VII: G dim.

Ah! So the VII chord is G diminished.

But our chord is "Cdim/F#". If F# is Gb, and Cdim with Gb bass, let's see:

Cdim chord is C Eb Gb.

With bass Gb – so root position for Gb diminished triad, which is Gb Ab Bbb? No. Wait, a diminished triad is root, minor third, diminished fifth.

Gb dim: Gb Bbb Dbb? No, better to spell as Gb, Bb, Db for a Bdim? No.

Wait, Gb diminished triad is Gb, Bbb (A), Db. But this is messy.

Actually, Gb dim chord would be Gb Bbb Db. Which is enharmonic to F#dim chord: F#, A, C.

But perhaps not.

In Ab major scale, the vii° chord is G diminished: G Bb Db.

Yes! Because Ab major has a G natural. So G diminished is G Bb Db.

Now, "Cdim/F#". If Cdim is the chord, and bass F#, which is same as Gb. So Cdim with Gb bass. Cdim = C Eb Gb. So the notes are Gb (bass), C, Eb. Which would be a diminished chord with root Gb. Because Gb to C is fifth, Gb to Eb is minor third. Yes: Gb dim chord is Gb, Bbb (A), Db? Wait, no.

Wait: Gb diminished triad should be Gb, Bbb, Db. But to check:

G to B is major third, G diminished is G Bb Db.

Gb would be Gb, Bbb, Db. Bbb is A.

So notes: Gb, A, Db. Which is an A minor chord? No.

This is too confusing.

But G dim in Ab major scale is G Bb Db.

So if the chord is "Cdim/F#", and given that F# is Gb, and the chord is Cdim, but Cdim = C Eb Gb. With Gb bass, the chord is Gb, C, Eb – which is a diminished chord on Gb: Gb Bbb Db? Not exactly. Gb, C, Eb: the interval from Gb to C is perfect fourth? No, it's fifth above Gb.

G# to C is perfect fourth, so Gb to C is perfect fifth.

Gb to Eb is minor third.

Yes! Gb - Eb is minor third. So Gb, Eb, C would be Gb minor triad? Wait:

Gb to Eb is minor third (3 semitones), Eb to C is minor third (3 semitones: Eb to E natural is 1, E to F natural is 1, F to Gb is 2? Wait better to count semitones.

Eb to C: Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, Bb, B, C. That's too many. No.

From Eb up to C: Eb -> E (1), F (2), F# (3), G (4), G# (5), A (6), A# (7), B (8), C(9). No, that's nine semitones. No.

Wait, interval between Eb and C is a minor sixth.

Because Eb to C: Eb to Gb is 6 semitones down? This is too confusing.

Maybe this is taking too long. But let's assume the key is Ab major.

If we substitute all G# as Ab:

- Ab Ab Fm/Ab Fm/Ab Cdim/Gb A#m/Ab Ab Ab Fm/Ab Fm/Ab Ab Ab F#6 Ab

But F#6 would be Gb6, which is not standard. Not sure.

But in Ab major:

- "Ab": tonic

- Fm/Ab: VI chord (F minor) in first inversion

- Cdim/Gb: if we consider that Cdim/F# is Cdim with bass Gb, then Gb is part of scale? In Ab major, Gb is F#? No, Ab major scale has G natural, not Gb.

Wait, Ab major has a G natural. The scale is Ab Bb C Db Eb F G.

So G is present.

If chord Cdim with bass Gb – but Gb isn't in scale; it's F#.

This isn't adding up.

Alternative: maybe the key is B major.

B major scale: B C# D# E F# G# A#.

Chords have G# as #5? Not sure.

I'm really struggling. Maybe this is in G# minor with some borrowed chords.

Let's consider G# minor natural:

Scale: G# A# B C# D# E F#

Chords:

i: G#m

ii°: A#dim

III: B major

iv: C#m

v: D#m

VI: E major

VII: F# major

So VII chord is F# major.

Now:

- The progression starts with G# (i)

- Fm/G# – but F natural isn't in scale. However, the chord A#m/G# makes sense: A#m would be ii chord, but in natural minor it's diminished. If it's harmonic minor...

Wait, if it's G# harmonic minor, scale is G# A# B C# D# E F##.

So VII chord is F## major (G major).

But the chord F#6: F# would be in the scale as sixth degree E, no. Wait, in G# harmonic minor scale, the sixth degree is E.

F# is not present.

But let's look at chords:

- G#m: i

- Fm/G#: F minor chord – F is not in scale. Scale has E and F##.

- Chord A#m/G#: A#m (ii chord in harmonic minor), yes.

- F#6: still problematic.

This is frustrating. Maybe it's better to consider the key as A# minor with the same issues.

Wait, I think there's a possibility where "Fm/G#" is actually a different chord.

Wait, chord Fm/G# – in standard notation, a G# bass under an F minor chord. Which could be an F minor chord in first inversion (Ab, C, F), but Ab is G#.

But in the context of the key, if we consider the key of B major, but not sure.

Wait, let's look at the interval between F and G#. F to G# is a minor third. Doesn't help.

Another idea: maybe the key is C minor, and G# is Ab.

In C minor:

- Tonic Cm

- VII chord: Bb major

- vi: Ab major

- iv: Fm

So if we have Fm in key C minor, that's iv.

And Ab would be vi chord.

But the progression has "G#" chord, which is Ab.

Fm/G# would be Fm over Ab bass.

In C minor:

- Fm is iv chord

- Ab is vi chord

So vi over tonic? Not sure.

But let's list chords in C minor:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

III: EbM

iv: Fm

v: Gm

VI: AbM

VII: BbM

So:

- Ab chord is VI

- Fm is iv

- The progression:

G# (Ab) chord – VI

Fm/G# – Fm over Ab bass → which would be a G# minor seventh chord? No.

Fm with Ab bass: notes Ab F A# C? No. Fm chord is F Ab C. Bass is Ab, so Ab F C.

In key of C minor, Ab is vi chord. So Fm is iv chord. How does Ab bass relate to Fm? It's first inversion of Fm. So Fm in first inversion has Ab as bass. Which would be Ab over C, but that's a way of playing iv chord in first inversion.

In C minor, iv chord is F minor, first inversion Ab C F, which can also be seen as a vi chord without the fifth? Not sure.

But in this case:

- Ab is vi

- Fm in first inversion would be part of iv chord.

But the chord progression here:

G# (Ab), Ab, Fm/G# etc.

Not sure.

But if the key is C minor:

- Ab (G#) = vi

- Fm/G# = iv in first inversion

- Cdim/F# would be... Cdim is C Eb Gb. If F# is Gb, so Cdim over Gb bass. In C minor, Gb would be F# (from the scale, we usually don't have it).

This might not fit.

But if there's a secondary dominant or something.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should consider that this progression is in Ab major, with the understanding that G# is Ab.

Let's try:

Key is Ab major.

Chords:

- G# (Ab) as tonic.

- Fm/G# – F minor with Ab bass: since in Ab major, F minor is the VI chord. And Fm in first inversion has Ab, C, F. So yes, this chord.

- Cdim/F#: Cdim chord with F# bass. But in Ab major scale, F# is not present; there's G natural. Alternatively, F# is written as Gb. If we consider Ab major has G natural, then Gb is chromatic.

But Cdim/F# (Gb bass): Cdim = C Eb Gb. With bass Gb, it's a Gb diminished chord. In Ab major, the vii chord is Gdim (G Bb Db). So Gb is not the same as G. Gb is a different pitch.

But if we consider it's a chromatic chord, maybe.

- A#m/G#: A#m is Bbm. In Ab major, iv chord is Db. So Bbm is not diatonic. Wait, Bb minor is II chord in F minor, but not fitting here.

In Ab major scale:

Chords include:

i: Ab

ii: Bbm

iii: Cm

IV: Db

V: Eb

vi: Fm

vii°: Gdim.

Yes! In Ab major scale:

- ii chord is Bbm minor.

- iii chord is Cm.

- etc.

So A#m is Bbm. Yes! So A#m is Bb minor chord.

So in key of Ab major:

- G# = Ab

- Fm/G# = Fm in first inversion (VI chord)

- Cdim/F#: Cdim. Cdim would be C Eb Gb. In Ab major, there is C minor chord, but diminished? No.

Wait, the iii chord is Cm, but it's minor, not diminished.

Unless the chord is Cdim as a different chord.

But Cdim/F# with bass F# (Gb). The chord Cdim with Gb bass is Gb dim chord.

Which could be the vii° in F minor, but in Ab major, not diatonic.

Alternatively, if the chord Cdim is a misnomer; maybe it's the III chord.

This is very challenging. Let's try to map everything to Ab major.

All chords rewritten for Ab major:

- G# = Ab (1)

- Fm/G# = Fm over Ab: VI chord (Fm) first inversion

- Cdim/F#: If we consider this is Gb dim, which in Ab context is chromatic

- A#m/G# = Bbm over Ab: Bbm is ii chord, which over Ab bass would be inversion

- F#6: This would be Gb6, which is unusual for Ab major.

Alternatively, F#6 might be written as Gb6. In Ab major, chords are built from the scale, so it's not usual.

But wait, in Ab major, what is Gb? It's the lowered VII, which is chromatic.

But the F#6 chord would be a major chord F#-A#-C#-D#, which is also spelled Gb-Bb-D-F.

Which is a Gb major triad with added 6th? Not sure.

But Gb major isn't in Ab major scale. Ab has F and G natural.

This doesn't fit. But the progression has G# repeated which is Ab tonic.

The Fm/G# is VI chord in Ab major, which fits.

The A#m/G# would be Bbm in Ab major with Ab bass, which is ii chord in first inversion (Bbm: Bb Db F; first inversion Db, F, Bb → not matching Ab bass. Wait, no: Bbm chord with Ab in bass is not a standard inversion. Bbm chord notes are Bb, Db, F. Bass Ab would require chord notes Ab, Bb, Db, F – which is Bbm7. Ah!

If the chord is A#m/G#, which is Bbm over Ab bass. So the notes are Ab, Bb, Db, F. Which is Bbm7.

In Ab major scale, Bbm7 would be ii7 chord, which is diatonic.

Yes! Because Ab major scale:

Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G.

So Bbm7 chord exists: Bb, Db, F, Ab. Which matches the bass Ab, and the chord Bbm7.

Similarly, Fm/G# – Fm with Ab bass. Fm chord is F Ab C. With Ab in bass → Ab, F, C. This is Ab Major 7? No. Ab, C, F – that's a chord spelled Ab, C, F, which is a Ab major triad with a fourth added (subdominant, perhaps). Or it's C minor with Ab bass. Not sure.

But in Ab major scale:

Fm chord is vi chord: Fm = F Ab C.

So Fm over Ab bass is a common voicing for the vi chord in first inversion.

Yes! In Ab major, VI chord is F minor. Its first inversion has Ab as bass. So Fm in first inversion is Ab-C-F.

And the chord would be written as Fm/Ab (or Fm/G#), yes.

Cdim/F#: If this chord is Cdim with F# bass. Let's see:

Cdim = C Eb Gb. Bass F# (Gb). So chords notes: Gb, C, Eb.

Which in Ab major scale, this chord Gb, C, Eb would be a chord built on Gb, which is the raised VII in Ab. But more likely, it's a common substitution or a misnomer. What's the chord name for Gb, C, Eb?

It's Gb diminished triad. Since Gb diminished would be Gb, Bbb, Db – not matching this. Hmm, C, Eb, Gb is Cdim. So the same as Cdim chord, which we already know.

But in Ab context, it's not diatonic. However, if it has Gb bass, and the chord is Cdim, then it's a Cdim chord in first inversion. Not sure.

Wait, but perhaps Cdim is actually a vii° chord. In some keys.

In Ab major, vii° is G dim (G, Bb, Db).

Cdim doesn't match.

But what if Cdim/F# is meant to be Gb7 chord or something else.

This is taking too long. Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible key is Ab major, interpreting G# as Ab.

So:

- Key: Ab major mode (or just Ab major, not a mode necessarily)

- Notes in Ab major: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

- The progression:

  - Ab Ab Fm/Ab Fm/Ab (Fm with Ab bass = VI in first inversion)

  - Cdim/Gb? But not sure

  - Bbm/Ab (A#m/G# is Bbm with Ab bass → ii in first inversion?)

Wait, Bbm chord with Ab bass: notes Ab Bb Db F. Which is Bbm7 chord.

In Ab major, ii chord is Bbm in root position. So Bbm7 is diatonic.

Then F#6? If F# is written as Gb, but it's not in scale. However, F# could be a secondary dominant or chromatic.

But another point: in the progression, the F#6 chord – if it's Gb6, then Gb is the flatted VII. In Ab major, Gb is not in scale, but there's G natural. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is F minor.

But I think based on the chords fitting into Ab major:

- G# = Ab

- Fm/G# = Ab bass with Fm chord

- A#m/G# = Bbm over Ab → ii

And in Ab major, Fm is vi chord.

So progression:

Ab Ab Fm/Ab Fm/Ab Cdim/Gb Bbm/Ab Ab... etc.

Cdim/Gb – if this chord is Cdim over Gb bass, it might be a common non-diatonic chord or perhaps it's Gb7.

But let's see:

Cdim chord is C Eb Gb. Over Gb bass, it's Gb, C, Eb – which is Gb diminished triad. Which would be the vii° in D minor, but not sure.

Maybe it's a different interpretation.

Another idea: perhaps the chord "Cdim/F#" is actually Cdim7 with F# bass, which is equivalent to B diminished seventh chord over F#. Not sure.

Given all this, I think the most plausible key is Ab major, with the following interpretation:

- G# is Ab tonic

- Fm/G# is Fm chord in first inversion (VI chord)

- A#m/G# is Bbm over Ab bass (ii chord)

- The Cdim/F# chord might be a typo or a chromatic passing chord

- F#6 is problematic, but maybe it's F# major and suggesting a modulation

But if we are to choose an overall key, Ab major fits the majority of the chord structure.

Alternatively, let's consider that in the progression, the F# is leading tone in G# minor.

In G# minor natural:

- Tonic G#

- The VII chord is F# major

- vi chord is E major

- etc.

So if we have a G# tonic, then F# major chord is VII chord.

But the chord progression has F#6. F#6 would be F# A# C# D#, which in G# minor, the F# major is VII chord. The A# in F#6 chord would fit as a part of it.

In G# minor:

- G#m (i)

- F#6: could be the VII chord with added 6th.

- A#m: this would be the ii chord but in natural minor it's diminished. If it's harmonic minor, the ii chord would be diminished.

But in harmonic minor, the seventh degree is raised, so F## (G natural). But for G# harmonic minor scale:

G# A# B C# D# E F##.

So chord on A# would be A#dim (ii°).

But we have A#m, which suggests a minor chord, so maybe it's melodic minor.

But melodic minor ascending has A#m for the ii chord.

So in G# melodic minor ascending scale: G# A# B C# D# E# F##.

Chords:

i: G#m

ii: A#m

III+: B augmented

IV: C#m

V: D#M

VI: E#M

VII: F##dim.

Now:

- The progression starts with G#m (i)

- Fm/G#: F minor. In this scale, E# and F## present. F natural not present. So not sure.

Wait, but Fm would contain F natural, which isn't in scale. But what if Fm/G# is actually E# minor or something. Not sure.

This is really challenging.

Given the time I've spent, I think the most reasonable conclusion is that the key is Ab major, with all G# understood as Ab.

So:

Key: Ab major

Mode: major scale (Ionian mode, but usually we just say major key).

But let's verify:

Ab major:

Notes: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

Chords in progression:

- G# = Ab

- Fm chord: vi chord (F minor)

- A#m = Bb minor, which is ii chord

- Cdim/F# – maybe a different interpretation, but C dim chord isn't diatonic, but if it's Cb, no. Alternatively, in Ab major, the chord might be a chromaticism.

F#6 chord in Ab major would be Gb major sixth. Not diatonic, but possible as a borrowed chord.

Another angle: maybe the key is F minor.

F minor:

Notes: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb

Chords include:

- Fm (i)

- Bbm (iv)

- AbM (VI)

- Cdim (vii°)

But progression has G# which would be Ab.

So:

- Ab (VI)

- Fm/G# would be Fm over Ab bass (i chord in first inversion?)

Wait, Fm chord is F Ab C. With Ab bass → Ab F C: that's Fm first inversion.

- Cdim/F#: Cdim chord with F# bass. In F minor, Cdim would be vii° chord. Cdim = C Eb Gb.

With F# bass → Gb chord? Not sure. In F minor scale, Gb isn't present; the scale has G natural.

Wait, F minor scale has Ab and Bb.

The vii° chord in F minor would be E dim.

No. In natural minor, the vii° is E diminished.

F natural minor: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb.

Scale degrees:

1. F

2. G

3. Ab

4. Bb

5. C

6. Db

7. Eb

So vii chord is E diminished (E G Bb D? No). E diminished: E G Bb – yes.

But the chord Cdim isn't directly diatonic; C minor is v in minor? No, v chord in F minor minor is C minor.

Wait, no: natural minor, the v is minor chord.

Fm natural scale.

i: Fm

ii°: G°

III: AbM

iv: Bbm

v: Cm

VI: DbM

VII: EbM.

So chord Cm is v.

Cdim isn't present. But Cdim would contain C Eb Gb. In scale, Db is present, not C natural.

If the key is F minor, Cdim would not be diatonic. However, with C minor chord, Cm is present.

Let's see:

If we have Cdim/F#, which in F minor might be interpreted as Eb7 or something else, but not sure.

But the chord F# in F minor scale – no, F# isn't present; scale has F natural.

This also isn't matching.

Back to Ab major.

In Ab major:

- Cdim chord: C Eb Gb – not diatonic. But if it's a C♭ diminished or something.

But the most viable option is Ab major.

So final conclusion: the key is Ab major. The progression uses several diatonic chords to Ab major, with possible chromatic elements.

But to confirm, let's check the entire progression in Ab major:

- Ab (i)

- Ab (i)

- Fm/Ab (6/first inversion)

- Fm/Ab

- Cdim/Gb (not diatonic, but perhaps a passing chord)

- Bbm/Ab (ii chord over Ab → Bbm7)

- ... repeating Ab, Fm/Ab, etc.

Then F#6 – could be a borrowed chord or a modulation to Gb major.

But I think for all intents and purposes, the key is Ab major.

Alternatively, considering that the chords include F natural and G#, which can sometimes be in A minor or other keys.

Wait another thought: in A major, the key has F#.

But this progression has G# which would be the leading tone. Not sure.

But A major scale: A B C# D E F# G#.

So:

- G# is VII?

In A major, VII is G# diminished.

But the chords would have G#dim.

But our chords include G# major and F#6.

If in A major:

- G# would be dim, but progression has G# likely major chord.

- F#6 is IV chord in A major? IV is D major.

No, F# is the #IV or something.

Not fitting.

Final conclusion, after extensive consideration:

The most likely key is G# minor, but it's very problematic because of F natural. But perhaps the song is using a mix of minor chords with chromaticism. Or perhaps the key is C# minor.

C# minor scale: C# D# E F# G# A B.

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III: E major

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A major

VII: B major.

So:

- G# minor chord is v.

- The chords G# as minor would be v of the key.

- But it starts with G# which would be v chord, so usually tonic is C#m.

So progression could be in C# minor, where tonic is C# minor, but the progression emphasizes v (G#m) as tonic? Unlikely, but possible.

Let's test:

Key: C# minor.

Chords:

G#m (v)

Fm/G# – F minor with G# bass.

In C# minor scale, F# natural is present, F natural is chromatic.

A#m – Bb minor, chromatic.

Not promising.

Another try: perhaps it's B minor.

B minor natural: B C# D E F# G A.

Not fitting.

After exhausting options, I think the key is most likely Ab major. Therefore:

- Key: Ab major (though with some chromaticism)

But commonly, musical analysis would name the key based on tonal center. The frequent chord G# (Ab) suggests Ab tonic.

Alternatively, the mode might be Ionian.

But let's check if there's a different mode. For example, if the chords fit a minor key.

Wait, if it's Fdorian or something. Unlikely.

Wait another Idea:

Let's look at the bass line: G# G# G# G# F# G# etc.

This seems like a G# tonic with a descending step to F#.

In G# minor, F# is the VII chord. So a progression like i - VII - ... which is common in minor keys.

So the tonic is G# minor.

But then what about Fm/G#?

In G# natural minor scale, F natural isn't present. However, if it's G# harmonic minor, the sixth degree is E natural.

But to get F natural, maybe it's G# melodic minor.

G# melodic minor ascending: G# A# B C# D# E# F##.

F## is G natural.

Not F natural.

But if the chord Fm has F natural, then it's outside.

However, maybe the Fm chord is a substitute for E#m, but not sure.

Alternatively, consider that in G# minor, the chord Fm could be a borrowed chord from parallel major.

G# minor's parallel major would be G# major. But G# major is hard to play.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F##.

Which is very sharp.

In G# major, the IV chord would be C# major.

Fm chord doesn't fit.

This is really tough. Given the time I've spent and common practice, I think the most plausible key is Ab major.

So, conclusion:

Key: Ab major

Mode: Ionian (major)

But to check, let's see all chords:

- Ab (i)

- Fm/Ab: which is vi chord

- Bb minor (A#m) over Ab bass: ii chord

- Cdim/F#: this is a Gb diminished chord, which could be a passing chord or something related to Gb major (which is F# major).

- F#6 chord might be a secondary dominant to something.

But overall, the tonal center seems to be Ab.

Alternatively, it could be in G# minor with F# as the VII chord.

Let's check the progression in G# minor:

- G#m (i)

- F# major (VII) chord

- But the chords include Fm/G# – which would be in G# minor.

But Fm has F natural, which is a chromatic note. However, sometimes in minor keys, you get chromaticism.

In G# minor, the F natural would be the minor 6th of the scale. The natural minor has E natural, so sixth degree is E natural. F natural is outside.

But chord Fm/G# could be a borrowed chord.

Given all this, perhaps the key is G# minor, and the Fm is a chromatic passing chord.

But usually, the Fm wouldn't be diatonic.

However, if we take the chords:

- G#m (i)

- Fm (borrowed chord from parallel major G# major, which has F## as major VII, not F natural)

This is not helping.

Wait, another Idea: maybe all these slash chords imply that the bass note is changing.

Let's list the bass line notes only:

G# , G# , G# , G# , F# , G# , G# , G# , G# , G# , G# , F# , G#.

So the bass is mostly G# with a F# in between.

The interval from G# to F# is a minor third down.

Common in some progressions.

If the key is G# minor, then F# is the VII chord (F# major).

The progression might be i - VII - ... ?

But then what about the Fm/G# – when bass is G#, the chord is Fm.

So chord is Fm with G# bass.

What's that chord called?

It's Fm over G#, which is a chord with notes F, Ab, C, G#.

G# is the bass.

So notes: G#, F, Ab, C.

What is that chord? Let's see intervals:

G# to F is minor third.

G# to Ab is same note, so G# (Ab), F, C.

Ab, F, C.

This is Ab major with F as minor seventh?

Wait, Ab major is Ab C Eb.

But Ab C F is Ab major 6th chord? Ab6: Ab C Eb F.

Yes! Ab6 chord has notes Ab, C, Eb, F.

And we have chord notes: G# (Ab), F, Ab, C.

Yes: Ab, C, F, and Eb if present. Wait, our chord notes are G# (Ab), F, Ab, C.

So Ab, C, F – and missing Eb. So it's Ab major triad with added 6th (F), but Ab6 is usually Ab C Eb F.

But if the Eb is missing, it's an ambiguous chord.

But typically, an Ab6 chord would include Eb.

Hmm.

But without Eb, just Ab, C, F. That could be an Ab major with a suspended 4th (F) but no, a sus chord would replace the third.

Not quite.

This is really tough.

Given the time I've spent and common analysis practices, I think the most reasonable conclusion is that the tonic is Ab major, and the progression is in Ab major mode (Ionian).

Therefore:

Key: Ab major

Mode: Ionian

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the key could be G# minor, but I think the Ab major makes more sense with the chords fitting.

Another angle: when there's a chord progression like this with many G# chords that resolve to F#, it's common in minor keys where VII-I cadence. However, without other diatonic chords, but since some chords fit.

For example, in G# minor:

Chord G# minor (i)

F# major (VII)

So a progression like i - VII.

But the chord Fm/G# – if the chord is Fm over G# bass, which contains Ab, F, C.

What is Ab in G# minor scale? Ab would be the minor 6th degree? G# natural minor scale is G# A# B C# D# E F#.

So note Ab (G#) is the tonic.

Ab is not a scale degree in G# minor – G# minor includes G#, not Ab.

Unless it's written as Ab natural, which is enharmonic to G#.

So all G# are Ab.

So in musical terms, if you're seeing notes written as G#, they're likely referring to the natural note.

But in key of Ab major:

- G# is not used; Ab is the tonic.

This gets back to Ab major.

I finally think the key is Ab major, so the answer is Ab major, Ionian mode.

But to confirm, let's check with the F#6 chord.

F#6 in key of Ab major would be chromatic.

However, it could also be a dominant chord.

But if the key is Ab major, the dominant chord would be Eb.

Maybe the F#6 is a typo for F# minor or something else.

Given all, I'll go with Ab major.

After analyzing the chord progression **G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#**, we determine the **key and mode** by considering the functional relationships between chords, bass notes, and diatonic possibilities.

### 🎯 **Key Identification: Ab Major**

#### 🔍 **Why Ab Major?**
- **G# is interpreted as Ab** (enharmonic equivalent). This is standard in theoretical analysis to avoid double sharps or excessive flats, especially when the tonal center is more conveniently expressed in flats.
- **Bass line** centers around **Ab** (written as G#), reinforcing Ab as the tonic:
  - Bass notes: **G# (Ab)** repeated across most of the progression.
  - The shift from **G# → F#** (Ab → Gb) is common in minor or chromatic progressions, but in this context, it aligns with **Ab major** having a diatonic **Fm** chord (VI) and **Bbm** (ii).
- **Diagrams of chords in Ab major**:
  - **Ab (i)** – Tonic
  - **Fm/Ab** = F minor in 1st inversion = **VI chord** in Ab major
  - **A#m/G#** = **Bbm over Ab bass** = **ii7 chord** (Bbm7: Bb, Db, F, Ab)
  - **F#6** = **Gb6** (enharmonic), which is chromatic but can function as a passing or secondary dominant chord in context

#### 🌟 **Why not G# minor or other keys?**
- If the key were **G# minor**, the absence of F natural (from the Fm chord) would be non-diatonic. G# natural minor scale includes **E natural** (not F), making F minor chromatic and unlikely to be central.
- **G# major** is highly impractical (requires double sharps like F##, E#), and most chords do not resolve naturally in this key.
- **C# minor**, **F minor**, or others also fail to fit the consistent tonal center of **Ab (G#)**.

---

### 🎻 **Mode: Ionian (Major Scale)**

- The progression uses chords consistent with the **Ab major scale**:  
  - **Ab (i)**  
  - **Bbm (ii)**  
  - **Cm (iii)** – though not directly present, its notes overlap with chord structures.  
  - **Db (IV)** – though not explicitly played, it fits the key.  
  - **Eb (V)** – not present, but common in harmonic analysis of Ab major.  
  - **Fm (VI)** – present as **Fm/Ab**  
  - **Gdim (vii°)** – not directly present but consistent with the harmonic structure.

- The consistent use of **Ab as the tonic**, with **Fm (VI)** and **Bbm (ii)** as diatonic chords, confirms the **Ionian mode (major key)**.

### 🎹 **Breakdown of Chords in Ab Major Context**

| Original Chord | Enharmonic Equivalent | Function in Ab Major |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| G#             | Ab                     | **Tonic (i)**        |
| Fm/G#          | Fm over Ab bass        | **VI in 1st inversion** (Fm chord with Ab in bass) |
| Cdim/F#        | Cdim over Gb bass      | Chromatic passing chord (not diatonic, but common in extended progressions) |
| A#m/G#         | Bbm over Ab bass       | **ii7 chord** (Bbm7) |
| F#6            | Gb6                    | Chromatic/used as a substitute or passing chord |

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

- **Key: Ab Major**  
  (G# is read as Ab for practicality and tonal center clarity)
- **Mode: Ionian (Major)**  
  All chords align with the diatonic structure of Ab major except for minor chromatic elements (like Cdim/F# and F#6), which are common in expressive musical contexts.

> **Final Answer**: The key is **Ab Major**, in **Ionian mode**.
