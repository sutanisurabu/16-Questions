Let’s break this down step by step.

## 1. List the chords clearly

The progression is:

G#  G#  Fm/G#  Fm/G#  Cdim/F#  A#m/G#  G#  G#  Fm/G#  Fm/G#  G#  G#  F#6  G#

We can first rewrite slash chords to understand their bass notes vs. chord quality:

- **G#** = G# major (G# B# D#)
- **Fm/G#** = F minor chord (F Ab C) over G# bass → Fm(add9)/G#? Actually G# is the 9th of Fm, so it's Fm9 without the 5th? Let's check: F Ab C G# → G# = Ab enharmonic, which is the minor 3rd of F? Wait, Ab is already in Fm (F-Ab-C). G# = Ab, so the bass is the same as the minor 3rd of the chord? That’s unusual — means the bass is the same pitch as the chord's Ab. So Fm/G# is just Fm with Ab in bass — but Ab is G# enharmonically, so it's actually Fm in first inversion: Fm/Ab. So they wrote Fm/G# meaning Fm/Ab.

So Fm/G# = Fm/Ab.

- **Cdim/F#** = C dim chord (C Eb Gb) over F# bass. Cdim = C Eb Gb (A? fully diminished would be C Eb Gb Bbb=A). But here bass is F#, which is the dim7 note if it were Cdim7 (C Eb Gb Bbb=A) — F# is enharmonic to Gb? No, F# is a half step above F, Gb is a half step above F? Wait, Gb = F#. So F# is the same as Gb, which is already in the chord (C Eb Gb). So Cdim/F# means Cdim with Gb in bass — but Gb is already the dim5 of Cdim, so it's just second inversion Cdim. But they wrote F# not Gb — so maybe they are thinking in key of G# minor? Let's keep going.

- **A#m/G#** = A# minor chord (A# C# E#) over G# bass. G# is the minor 7th of A#m, so it's A#m7 in third inversion.

- **F#6** = F# A# C# D#.

---

## 2. Look for tonal center

The progression starts and ends on G#, and G# appears many times. Likely tonic is G#.

Possible keys containing G# major: G# major (6 sharps) or E# minor (G# is mediant) — but more likely enharmonic to Ab major (4 flats) or F minor (Ab is relative major of F minor).

But G# major chord is I in G# major, but also V in C# major, but here it feels like tonic.

Fm chord in G# major? Fm = F Ab C. In G# major (G# A# B# C# D# E# Fx G#) — no F natural, so Fm is foreign. But if we think in G# minor (G# A# B C# D# E F# G#), Fm would be ♭VI chord (F Ab C) — yes, in G# minor, F is F natural, Ab = G#, C is C natural. But G# minor has F# and C# in natural minor, so F and C are from G# harmonic/melodic minor? Actually F is in G# natural minor? Let's check: G# natural minor: G# A# B C# D# E F# — F# not F. So F natural is ♭6 in G# minor — so Fm is ♭VI in G# minor.

So G# minor key:  
i = G#m  
♭VI = Fm  
etc.

But our first chord is G# **major**, not G# minor. So maybe we are in G# **harmonic minor** or G# **melodic minor**, where the I chord can be major (raised 7 → leading tone D#), common in minor keys.

So likely: **Key of G# minor**, using G# major chord (I major from harmonic minor).

## 3. Check other chords in G# minor context

G# minor scale (harmonic): G# A# B C# D# E F## (F## = G natural? Wait, F## is G? No, F## is enharmonic to G, but in G# minor harmonic, 7th is F## = G? Let's spell correctly: G# A# B C# D# E Fx (Fx = E#? No, Fx = G natural). Actually simpler: G# harmonic minor: G# A# B C# D# E F## (F## = G). So chords:

G# major (I) = G# B# D# (B# = C, D#) — B# is C? Wait, B# is C natural, but in G# harmonic minor, the 7th is F## (G), and the 3rd of G# major is B# (C)? That’s wrong — 3rd of G# major is B# (C), but in G# harmonic minor, the leading tone is F## (G natural), so the triad G# B D# would be G# minor. For G# major, we need B#, not B. So G# major in G# harmonic minor is actually borrowing from major? No — in minor key, the I chord is only major if we use the Picardy third, but here it's throughout the progression, so maybe we are in G# **Mixolydian b6**? Or G# Dorian? Let's check F#6: F# A# C# D# — in G# minor, F# is VII (F# A# C#) is F# major, add D# (7th) = F#7. But they say F#6 = F# A# C# D#. D# is the major 6th of F#, but in G# minor, D# is the 5th of G# minor harmonic scale. So F#6 contains D# which is the leading tone in G# minor. So F#6 = F# A# C# D# = D# dim triad over F# bass? Actually F#6 = D#m7b5/F#.

So maybe key is G# minor but with major I (common in rock, minor key with major tonic).

## 4. Try enharmonic simplification

G# major = Ab major  
Fm/G# = Fm/Ab  
Cdim/F# = Cdim/Gb (since F#=Gb)  
A#m/G# = Bbm/Ab  
F#6 = Gb6

Rewriting in Ab for simplicity:

Ab  Ab  Fm/Ab  Fm/Ab  Cdim/Gb  Bbm/Ab  Ab  Ab  Fm/Ab  Fm/Ab  Ab  Ab  Gb6  Ab

Now in Ab major key:  
Ab = I  
Fm = vi  
Bbm = ii  
Gb6 = Gb Bb Db Eb — in Ab major, Gb is ♭VII, Gb6 is ♭VII6.

Cdim/Gb = Cdim/F# in original: C Eb Gb — that’s vii°7 rootless? Actually Cdim is symmetric. In Ab major, Cdim = ? It’s not in Ab major diatonically. But Cdim = Ebdim = Gbdim = Adim, all same notes. In Ab major, the leading tone is G, so Gdim would be vii° — but Cdim shares notes with Gdim7 (G Bb Db Fb) — no, not matching. Let's check: Cdim = C Eb Gb; Gdim7 = G Bb Db Fb(E); no common.

Better: Cdim/Gb = Gb C Eb — that’s Gb7(b9) without root? Actually Gb7 = Gb Bb Db Fb(E); Cdim = C Eb Gb — that’s the upper structure of Gb7b9: Gb Bb Db Fb A (Cbb) — messy.

But given the sound: Fm is vi in Ab major, but then Gb6 is ♭VII, common in Mixolydian or minor key bVII. So maybe mode is **Ab Mixolydian**? Ab Mixolydian scale: Ab Bb C Db Eb F Gb. Chords:  
I = Ab  
vi = Fm  
♭VII = Gb  
ii = Bbm (not in Mixolydian — Bbm would be biii in Ab major) — so Bbm is from Ab minor? So maybe Ab **Dorian**? Ab Dorian: Ab Bb Cb(Db?) wait, Ab Dorian: Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F Gb — Cb = B. So Bbm (Bbm = Bb Db F) is ii in Ab Dorian. Yes! And Fm is vi in Ab Dorian? Let's check: In Ab Dorian, chords:  
i = Abm  
But we have Ab major, so maybe mixed Ab major and Ab Dorian? Actually if we take the progression: Ab, Fm, Bbm, Gb — all from Ab Dorian except Ab major instead of Abm. So they’re using a major I in a Dorian context — common in pop (major tonic with minor iv and minor ii).

So:  
Key = **Ab major with Dorian mixture** (borrowing Bbm, Fm from Ab Dorian).  
Gb6 is ♭VII from Mixolydian or Dorian (both have ♭VII).

## 5. Final answer

Given the original was in G# notation, the key is **G# major with Dorian mixture** — but functionally, the tonic is G# major, and the chords F#m (Fm enharmonic?), A#m, F#6 fit G# Dorian mode but with a major I.

So:

**Key: G# major (with modal mixture from G# Dorian)**  
**Mode: Mostly Dorian ♭3?** Wait, Dorian has minor tonic — but here tonic is major, so it's **Mixolydian**? Let's check: G# Mixolydian: G# A# B# C# D# E# F# — chords: I = G#, vi = Fm? No, Fm is F A C — not in G# Mixolydian. So not pure mode.

Given complexity, safest:  
**Key: G# major**  
**Modal color: Dorian b3?** No — actually they’re using Fm (♭VI in G# minor) and G# major tonic — that’s common in rock: minor key with major I — so it’s **G# minor key but with major I chord**, so the scale is **G# Mixolydian ♭6** (Fifth mode of C# melodic minor). Yes:  
C# melodic minor: C# D# E F# G# A# B#  
Fifth mode: G# A# B# C# D# E F# — that’s G# A# C C# D# E F# — so G# major with F natural and E natural — gives Fm and E chord? We have Fm and A#m and F#6. A#m = Bbm in Ab — in this scale, A#m not present (we need A# C# E# — but E#=F, so A# C# F = A# dim). So not quite.

Given time, the most consistent:  
**Tonal center: G#**  
**Mode: G# minor (but with Picardy third throughout — so G# major tonic in minor key)**  
Common in modern music: "Minor key with major tonic" — sometimes called "Major-minor" or "Hybrid mode".

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{G\# \text{ minor with major I}}
\]
