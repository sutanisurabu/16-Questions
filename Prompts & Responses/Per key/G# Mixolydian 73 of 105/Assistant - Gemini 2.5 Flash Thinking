### Reasoning

**Deciphering the Chords**

\n\n

I've started the chord analysis. The progression repeats, which is a good starting point. I'm focusing on identifying the function of each chord within the sequence, specifically looking at how the alterations from the original key add color and tension. I’ll map out potential key centers and look for any interesting secondary dominants.


**Mapping the Harmonic Landscape**

\n\n

I've made headway in determining the key and mode. The repeated G# at the beginning and end strongly suggests it's the tonic. Analyzing each chord's relationship to G# reveals a complex interplay. The Fm/G# seems to suggest a borrowed chord. Cdim/F# creates intriguing chromaticism. The supertonic minor (A#m/G#) reinforces a G# major or harmonic minor. I must now determine how to interpret the F#6.


**Unraveling Chord Functions**

\n\n

The analysis continues to evolve. That Fm/G# remains puzzling; it pulls hard away from a diatonic interpretation. I'm reassessing its potential function, perhaps as a borrowed chord from a parallel minor or some other related key. The diminished chord is also tricky, pushing towards harmonic minor territory. The F#6 adds a complex chromatic pull, and further exploration of this point is paramount.


**Confirming the Tonal Center**

\n\n

My current focus is on finding the most appropriate key signature. While G# is the root, I'm now certain that the overall framework is G# major, due to the prevalence of G# as the tonic. I'm exploring the implications of the F#6 and how it harmonizes with the rest of the key, especially when considering the diminished chord.


**Refining the Key Signature**

\n\n

My current key analysis leans definitively toward G# major, with a strong case for borrowing chords. I'm reassessing the function of the diminished and major sixth chords, and I'm looking at their impact on the overall harmonic direction. The repeated chord changes highlight a clear framework, allowing for deeper dives into the chromatic elements that give the progression its unique color.


**Unveiling the Key's Identity**

\n\n

My understanding solidified, the underlying key is undeniably G# major, with significant influences from modal borrowing. The diminished chord continues to suggest harmonic minor, but is best understood within the framework of a G# major, with a key focus on the implications of a $bVII$ chord. The challenge now is to determine how the unusual changes enhance the overall feel of the tonal center.


**Defining the Tonal Framework**

\n\n

My current focus is on the tonic's stability. After careful analysis, I've confirmed G# as the foundation, with the mode leaning heavily toward major, even if some of the chords don't seem to make sense. My analysis of the bVII (F#6) makes me believe it's borrowed, adding a sense of modal color. I must now reassess the progression and all its complexities.


**Reassessing Chord Functions**

\n\n

My current focus is interpreting the diminished chord, particularly the F# bass. The bVII chord adds a unique color, likely borrowed from the parallel minor or the Mixolydian mode. While G# is the root, its major tonality is evident. I'm carefully evaluating how these borrowed chords affect the overall feel, making sure the key remains stable.




The tonal center of the progression is clearly **G#**, as it is the starting, ending, and most frequently used chord.

To determine the key and mode accurately, it is helpful to analyze the chords using the enharmonic equivalent **Ab Major**, as this simplifies the relationship between the chord voicings (Fm, A#m) and the tonic.

1.  **Tonic Center:** G# Major (Ab Major)

2.  **Chromatic Analysis (using Ab Major scale: Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G):**
    *   **G# (Ab):** Tonic ($\text{I}$) – Major
    *   **Fm/G# (Fm/Ab):** Submediant minor ($\text{vi}$) – Diatonic to Major
    *   **A#m/G# (Bbm/Ab):** Supertonic minor ($\text{ii}$) – Diatonic to Major
    *   **F\#6 (Gb6):** Subtonic/Flat VII ($\text{bVII}$) – Borrowed (Modal Mixture)
    *   **Cdim/F\# (Cdim/Gb):** This chord (C-Eb-Gb) combines degrees $b\text{III}$, $\text{V}$, and $b\text{VII}$. This often functions as a highly chromatic passing chord or is borrowed from the parallel natural minor ($\text{Ab}$ Minor).

3.  **Mode Determination:**
    The core chords ($\text{I}$, $\text{ii}$, $\text{vi}$) are strongly diatonic to the **Major** key. However, the presence of the **F\#6 ($\text{bVII}$)** chord, which is heavily featured late in the progression, indicates borrowing from the parallel minor scale (Mixolydian or Natural Minor).

**Conclusion:**

*   **Key:** **G-sharp Major** (or Ab Major)
*   **Mode:** **Major** (with strong modal mixture/borrowing of the $b\text{VII}$ degree).
