### Reasoning

**Defining the Input Parameters**

I'm focused on the input now. The chord progression is the central piece, of course, and I'm parsing the information. So far, the input seems straightforward, but I want to be certain about the format and any potential nuances, such as inversions. I'll need to define what the request is asking me to do with this input.


**Deconstructing the Chords**

I've been working through the chord transformation. I'm taking the chords and putting them into the key of Ab. This is to avoid those ridiculous double sharps. Already, I can see Ab major is a much better fit for the harmonic functions. Looking closely at the chords now, and how they relate.


**Identifying the Key and Mode**

Now I'm looking at the key. Initially, I noted G# but the excessive sharps are a deterrent. Considering the enharmonic equivalent, I'm leaning heavily towards Ab major. I'm cross-checking the chord functions within that context and re-evaluating each chord. The transition of the chords is critical for understanding this.


**Revising Chord Functions**

I'm now revising the chord functions, particularly focusing on the "odd" chords. I've re-evaluated Cdim/F# (or Cdim/Gb) and F#6. I'm taking the context of the progression to derive the functionality of each chord. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic chords, which I believe add a particular character.


**Re-evaluating the Options**

I'm leaning towards Ab major, but the bVII chord is still a puzzle. I've re-examined the F#6 and Cdim/F# chords, considering their harmonic functions within the key. I'm focused on the tension this brings. I'm carefully charting each chord's relationship.


**Refining Key and Mode**

Now I'm completely sure on the tonic, G#. The analysis strongly indicates a major key, due to the major tonic. Translating the chords to Ab major clarifies everything. The non-diatonic chords add color, but the tonal center is firmly established, and the mode is clear.


**Summarizing the Cadences**

Now, I'm analyzing the cadences. The F#6 to G# cadence is of interest. It's a clear marker of a major key, especially when considering the bVII-I progression. I'm focusing on the pull of the subdominant. The use of borrowed chords is now clear.


**Defining the Solution Framework**

I'm now formulating a detailed response. I'll need to answer the key and mode while addressing the harmonic context. To clarify the writing, I will use Ab major. I'm focusing on the non-diatonic chords as they add color. I will then summarize the overall feel of the piece.




Based on the chords provided, the key is **G# Major**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### Key Determination (Tonic)

1.  **Starts and Ends on G#:** The progression begins and ends on a G# major chord. This is the strongest indicator that G# is the tonic, or the "home" chord of the piece.
2.  **Tonic Pedal:** Many of the chords (Fm/G#, A#m/G#) have G# in the bass. This is called a "tonic pedal," where the root note of the key is held in the bass while the chords change above it, further solidifying G# as the tonal center.

### Mode Determination (Major)

The mode is **Major**, but with significant use of **modal interchange** (borrowing chords from the parallel minor or other modes).

Let's analyze the chords using Roman numerals in the key of G# Major. For easier analysis, we can think in its enharmonic equivalent, **Ab Major**, which has fewer accidentals (Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G).

*   **G# (or Ab):** This is the **I** chord, the tonic. It's a major chord, which establishes the major mode.
*   **Fm/G# (or Fm/Ab):** Fm is the **vi** chord in the key of Ab Major. This is a standard diatonic chord. The G# in the bass makes it a **vi/I** (a vi chord over the tonic root).
*   **A#m/G# (or Bbm/Ab):** A#m is enharmonically Bbm. Bbm is the **ii** chord in Ab Major. This is another standard diatonic chord, here presented as **ii/I**.
*   **F#6 (or Gb6):** F# is enharmonically Gb. In the key of Ab Major, the Gb chord is the **bVII** (flatted seventh). This is a "borrowed" chord, often taken from the Mixolydian or Aeolian (natural minor) mode. The progression **bVII - I** (Gb to Ab, or F# to G#) is a very common and powerful cadence in rock, pop, and blues, creating a "plagal" or subdominant-like feel.
*   **Cdim/F# (or Cdim/Gb):** This is the most complex chord. The bass note (F#/Gb) is the same bVII note mentioned above. The C diminished triad (C-Eb-Gb) contains the 3rd, 5th, and b7th of the home key (Ab). It functions as a chromatic, non-diatonic passing chord that adds bluesy color and tension.

### Summary

The core of the progression is built on standard chords from a major key (I, vi, ii). However, the inclusion of the **F#6 (bVII6)** and the **Cdim/F#** chords introduces chromatic notes borrowed from other modes. This technique, called modal interchange, gives the progression a modern, slightly bluesy, and less strictly "classical" sound.

**Final Answer:**
*   **Key:** **G# Major**
*   **Mode:** **Major with modal interchange** (borrowing from parallel modes).
