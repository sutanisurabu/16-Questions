**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507 Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a sequence of chords: G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#. They want me to determine the key and mode. 

First, I need to unpack what this chord sequence really means. The notation uses slash chords (like Fm/G#), which indicate inversions or added bass notes. For example, Fm/G# means an F minor chord with G# in the bass. That's actually a G# diminished 7th chord because F minor (F-Ab-C) with G# bass creates G#-F-Ab-C, which stacks minor thirds. 

Hmm, the user might be a musician or student analyzing a song. They probably encountered this sequence and got confused by the unusual chord labels. Their real need is likely to understand the harmonic structure—maybe for composition, transcription, or theory study. They might be frustrated by the slash chords masking simpler chord functions. 

Let me decode these properly. Listing all chords with enharmonic equivalents for clarity:
- G# → Ab (I'll use flats for simplicity since sharps get messy)
- Fm/G# → Abm/Bb? Wait no—Fm is F-Ab-C, G# bass is Ab, so Ab-F-Ab-C? Better to think enharmonically: G# = Ab, F = E#, but that's messy. Actually, Fm/G# is G#-F-Ab-C = Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gb? No... Simpler: G# bass + F minor (F-Ab-C) = Ab + F-Ab-C → Ab-Db-F? Wait, no—Ab (G#) + F minor = notes G#, F, Ab, C. Stacked: G# to F is minor 7th? But intervals: G# to Ab is unison? Enharmonic chaos! 

*Pauses to reorient* 
Standard approach: Fm/G# = G# bass with F minor triad → notes G#, F, Ab (since Fm = F-Ab-C, but C isn't sounding? Slash chords usually imply the triad over bass). So pitches: G# (bass), F, Ab, C. Now, G# to F is minor 7th, G# to Ab is minor 2nd (G#-Ab = same note enharmonically? Wait G#=Ab, so Ab bass + F is... Ab and F? Ab to F is major 6th. I'm confusing myself. 

Key insight: Fm/G# is functionally a G# diminished 7th chord. Why? Dim7 chords are symmetrical. G# dim7 = G#-B-D-F. But here we have G# (bass), F, Ab, C. Ab is G#, C is B#? No: Ab = G#, but C natural is not in G# dim7. G# dim7 should be G#-B-D-F. F is enharmonic to E#, but here it's F natural. F natural is the minor 7th of G#? G# to F natural is minor 7th interval (G#-A-B-C-D-E-F = 10 semitones), so G#-F is minor 7th, but dim7 requires diminished 7th (G# to Fb = 9 semitones). This isn't working. 

Alternative: Fm/G#. F minor = F-G#-C (since Ab=G# enharmonically for simplicity). So bass G# (Ab), triad F-Ab-C → notes: Ab, F, Ab, C. So Ab (root), F (6th), C (5th). That's Ab major triad? Ab major is Ab-C-Eb. Here we have Ab, F, C → F and C are the 6th and 5th of Ab, but no Eb. So it's Ab major? But F is the 6th, so Ab6? But written as Fm/G#. Aha! Fm/G# is actually an Ab6 chord: Ab (bass)-C-Eb-F, but here bass is G#=Ab, and "Fm" part gives F-Ab-C → so Ab (bass), F, Ab, C. That's Ab6 without the 3rd (Eb missing). But typically slash chords include the triad. This is messy. 

*Searches for standard interpretation* 
I recall that Fm/G# is a common misnotation for G#°7. Because Fm is F-Ab-C, G# bass: G#-F-Ab-C. Intervals: G# to F = minor 7th (10 semitones), but dim7 should be diminished 7th (9 semitones). G# to F is actually minor 7th, not diminished. Unless... F is enharmonic to E#, but E# is F, same pitch. G# to E# is minor 7th? G#-A-B-C-D-E-F = G# to F is minor 7th. Dim7 would be G# to Fb (Enharmonic E). But here it's F natural, so it's not dim7. 

Perhaps it's a German augmented sixth chord? German +6 in C is Ab-C-Eb-F#, but here we have Ab-F-Ab-C → no F#. Not matching. 

Another idea: Maybe the slash is inverted. Fm/G# means G# is the bass, but Fm is the chord, so it's F minor with G# bass. But G# is the minor 9th of F minor? F minor: F-Ab-C, G# is Ab (same as Ab), so it's F minor add 9 (Ab), but Ab is already in F minor, so it's F minor with added 9th (G#), but G#=Ab, so it's F minor add #9? F-Ab-C-Ab → redundant. 

*Realization* 
F minor with G# bass: G#=Ab, so bass Ab with Fm chord → Ab and Fm. Ab is the major third of Fm? No, Fm is F-Ab, so Ab is the minor third. So bass note is the minor third of the chord, making it first inversion Fm. But written as Fm/G#, which is unusual because G#=Ab, so Fm/Ab would be standard for first inversion. But why write G# instead of Ab? Probably key context. 

Similarly, Cdim/F# → C diminished chord with F# bass. C dim = C-Eb-Gb, F# bass. F#=Gb, so Gb bass with C dim → C-Eb-Gb-Gb, which is Gb major? Gb bass (root), C dim (C-Eb-Gb) → notes Gb, C, Eb, Gb. So Gb-C-Eb → C is the 4th, Eb the 6th, so it's Gb7? Gb-Bb-Db-Fb, but here we have Gb, C, Eb → C is 11th, Eb is 13th? Messy. 

C diminished with F# bass: F# = Gb, C dim = C-Eb-Gb, so pitches: Gb (bass), C, Eb, Gb. Stacked: Gb to C is augmented fourth, Gb to Eb is minor sixth. This is actually an F# half-diminished 7th? F# half-dim = F#-A-C-E. Here we have F#-C-Eb? Eb= D#, not matching. 

Standard trick: Cdim/F# is the same as F#ø7 (half-diminished). Because F# half-dim = F#-A-C-E, but C dim = C-Eb-Gb, and F# bass: F# (Gb), C, Eb (D#), Gb. So pitches: Gb, C, D#, Gb? D# is Eb, so Gb-C-D#-Gb. Intervals: Gb to C = dim5? Gb to C is perfect 5th enharmonically? Gb to C is augmented 4th (6 semitones). Gb to D# is major 6th (9 semitones? Gb-A-Bb-B-C-D-D# = 10 semitones). Not matching F#ø7. F#ø7 should be F#-A-C-E. So pitches F#, A, C, E. But here we have F# (bass), C, Eb (from C dim), and Gb (from C dim, but Gb=F#? C dim is C-Eb-Gb, Gb=F#, so pitches: F# (bass), C, Eb, F#. So F#, C, Eb. Three notes: F#, C, Eb. Which is F# half-diminished 7th without the 7th? F#ø7 needs E natural, but we have Eb. Eb is D#, so it's F#-C-D#, which is F# diminished triad, not half-diminished. 

F# diminished triad is F#-A-C. Here we have F#-C-Eb (D#), so F#-C-D#. D# is the minor third? F# to D# is minor 7th interval (F#-G-A-Bb-C-D-D# = 10 semitones), so F#-C-D# is F# minor 7th flat 5? F#-A-C-E is half-diminished, but here third is C? No, F# to C is diminished 5th, not minor third. 

List notes: Bass F#, chord C dim = C-Eb-Gb. Gb = F#, so the chord is C-Eb-F#. So pitches: F# (bass), C, Eb. That's three notes. Which chord is F#-C-Eb? F# to C is diminished 5th (6 semitones), F# to Eb is minor 7th (10 semitones), C to Eb is minor 3rd. So it's a half-diminished 7th chord with root F#: F#-A-C-Eb. But here we have F#-C-Eb — missing the A. So it's F# half-diminished without the third? But typically, the third is essential. In practice, this slash chord might imply the full chord, so Cdim/F# = F#ø7. That's standard jazz notation: any diminished chord over a bass note a minor third below is a half-diminished. C dim over F# bass: F# is minor third below C? C to F# is augmented 4th, not minor third. Minor third below C is Ab. 

C to Ab is minor third (C-Bb-Ab). But here bass is F#, which is tritone from C. So Cdim/F# is actually a common substitution for F#7(b9) or something. But let's check intervals: notes F#, C, Eb. F#-C = dim5, F#-Eb = min7, C-Eb = min3. So it's a G7(b9) without root? G7(b9) = G-B-D-F-Ab. Not matching. 

*Epiphany* 
I remember that diminished chords are often used as passing chords. Specifically, Fm/G# is likely a mishearing of G#°7. G#°7 = G#-B-D-F. But the user wrote Fm/G#, which would be G#-F-Ab-C. If we consider Ab = G#, but Ab is not G#, it's the enharmonic equivalent only if we're sloppy. Ab is G#, yes, but in chord terms, Fm/G# = G# bass, F-Ab-C = G#, F, Ab, C. Now, Ab = G#, so notes are G#, F, G#, C. But G# and Ab are the same pitch, so it's G# (bass), F, G# (Ab), C. So pitches: G#, F, C. Which is G#-F-C. G# to F is min7, G# to C is dim5, F to C is perfect 5th. So it's C#7(b9) or something? C#7 = C#-E#-G#-B, but here G#, F, C. C is B#, F is E#, messy. 

Better to respell enharmonically: 
G# = Ab 
F = F 
Ab = G# = Ab 
C = C 
So pitches: Ab, F, Ab, C → Ab, F, C. Which is Ab major triad? Ab-C-Eb, but here we have Ab, F, C — so it's Ab6 (Ab-C-Eb-F, but Eb missing). In jazz, Ab/C is Cm7/Ab, but not standard. 

I think the key is to ignore the slash notation as misleading and look at the actual notes. Let's compile the pitch classes for each chord: 

- G#: G# (Ab) 
- Fm/G#: G# bass + Fm (F-Ab-C) → notes: G#, F, Ab, C → Ab, F, C (since G#=Ab) → Ab, C, F? Wait Ab to C is major 3rd, Ab to F is minor 6th, so it's F minor? No, F-Ab-C is F minor, with bass Ab. So it's F minor first inversion. Written as Fm/Ab, but user wrote Fm/G# (since G#=Ab). So it's Fm in first inversion. Similarly, Cdim/F#: Cdim = C-Eb-Gb, F# bass = Gb, so notes: Gb, C, Eb, Gb → Gb, C, Eb. Gb to C is augmented 4th, Gb to Eb is minor 6th. This is actually an F7 chord: F-A-C-Eb, but here we have Gb (F#), C, Eb — so F#, C, Eb. Which is B7? B-D#-F#-A, not matching. 

Gb, C, Eb: C to Gb is diminished 5th, C to Eb is minor 3rd, so it's C half-diminished with bass Gb? But Gb is the fifth. Standard: Cø7 = C-Eb-Gb-Bb. Here we have Gb, C, Eb — so it's Cø7 without the Bb. But in context, it might imply the full chord. 

Perhaps all these slashes indicate secondary dominants or altered chords. Let's list the sequence with standard interpretations: 

1. G# (Ab) major? But G# is rare; likely Ab. 
2. G# 
3. Fm/G# → first inversion F minor (Ab bass) 
4. Fm/G# 
5. Cdim/F# → let's say F# half-diminished (F#-A-C-E) but spelled as Cdim/F# is common for F#ø7 
6. A#m/G# → A# minor with G# bass. A#m = A#-C#-E#, G# bass = Ab. So pitches: Ab, A#, C#, E# → enharmonic: Ab, Bb, Db, F. Which is Bb7? Bb-Db-F-Ab. Yes! A#m/G# = G# bass + A#m triad = G#, A#, C#, E# → Ab, Bb, Db, F → Bb7 (Bb-Db-F-Ab). So it's Bb dominant 7th. 

Ah! This is crucial. A#m/G# is actually Bb7. Because: 
- G# = Ab (bass) 
- A#m = A#-C#-E# = Bb-Db-F (enharmonically) 
- So notes: Ab, Bb, Db, F → Bb-Db-F-Ab = Bb7. 

Similarly, Fm/G# = Fm with Ab bass: 
- Fm = F-Ab-C 
- Bass Ab 
- Notes: Ab, F, Ab, C → Ab, C, F (since Ab repeats) — but Ab to C is major 3rd, Ab to F is minor 6th, so it's Ab6 (Ab-C-Eb-F, but Eb missing? Wait, F minor has Ab (minor third), so it's F-Ab-C with Ab bass → the notes are F, Ab, C with Ab in bass. Which is still F minor, but the bass is the third, so it's first inversion. But the chord is F minor. However, when we play it, we have Ab in bass, so it might function as Ab something. But in context, it's probably just Fm. 

But for A#m/G#, we saw it's Bb7. Let's confirm others: 

- Cdim/F#: Cdim = C-Eb-Gb, F# bass = Gb. Notes: Gb, C, Eb, Gb → Gb, C, Eb. Gb to C is augmented 4th (tritone), Gb to Eb is minor 6th. This is actually a B7(b9) without root? Or more commonly, this is the dominant of C# minor. But let's spell: pitches Gb, C, Eb. Enharmonic: F#, C, Eb. Which is F#-C-Eb. F# to C is diminished 5th, F# to Eb is minor 7th, so it's F# half-diminished 7th (F#-A-C-Eb), but missing A. In practice, when we play Cdim/F#, it's often interpreted as F#ø7 (F# half-diminished), which is viiø7 in G minor. 

Now, F#ø7 is the diatonic chord in G minor: G natural minor has F#? Natural minor: G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F. So F is natural, not F#. We need harmonic minor for F#. G harmonic minor: G-A-Bb-C-D-Eb-F#. So F#ø7 is viiø7 in G minor. 

Similarly, A#m/G# we decoded as Bb7. Bb7 is V7 of Eb, but in minor keys, it could be deceptive. 

Now, the first chord is G#. If G# is the tonic, but G# minor is unusual; likely Ab. Let's assume the key uses flats for simplicity: Ab instead of G#. 

So sequence: 
Ab, Ab, Fm/Ab (which is Fm first inv), Fm/Ab, Cdim/F# → but F# is Gb, so Cdim/Gb, A#m/Gb (which we saw is Bb7), Ab, Ab, Fm/Ab, Fm/Ab, Ab, Ab, F#6, Ab. 

F#6: F#-A#-C#-D#? But F#6 might mean F# major with 6th, so F#-A#-C#-D#. Enharmonic: Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. Which is Eb minor 7? Eb-Gb-Bb-Db, but here Gb-Bb-Db-Eb → Eb is D#, so Gb-Bb-Db-D#. D# is the major 7th of Eb, so it's Eb major 7th? Eb-Gb-Bb-D. But here we have Gb-Bb-Db-D# → D# is Eb, so Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. That's Eb major 7th with Gb bass? But Eb maj7 = Eb-G-Bb-D, so Gb is not in it. Enharmonic: F# = Gb, A# = Bb, C# = Db, D# = Eb. So F#6 = F#-A#-C#-D# = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. Which is Eb major 7th chord: Eb (root), Gb, Bb, Eb — missing the G? Eb maj7 is Eb-G-Bb-D. Here we have Gb (Ab?), Bb, Db, Eb — so Ab, Bb, Db, Eb. That's Bb minor 7? Bb-Db-F-Ab, not matching. 

Gb-Bb-Db-Eb: intervals from Gb: Gb-Bb = major 3rd, Gb-Db = perfect 5th, Gb-Eb = minor 7th. So it's Gb7 chord! Gb7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Fb (which is E), but here we have Eb, not Fb. Eb is D#, which is minor 7th? Gb to Eb: Gb-G-Ab-Bb-C-D-Eb → 10 semitones, minor 7th. Yes! Gb7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb (since Fb = E natural is not used; Gb7 is Gb-Bb-Db-Fb, and Fb = E, but in chord notation, it's Gb-Bb-Db-Eb? No, Gb7 should have minor 7th: Gb to Fb is minor 7th (10 semitones), and Fb = E. But E is enharmonic to Eb? No, E natural vs Eb. Confusion. 

Standard Gb7: notes Gb, Bb, Db, Fb. Fb is enharmonic to E natural. But the user wrote F#6, which typically for F# major triad with 6th added: F#-A#-C#-D#. D# is E natural. So pitches: F#, A#, C#, D# = Gb, Bb, Db, E. Now, Gb to E is augmented 7th? Gb to E natural is major 7th (11 semitones), not minor. Gb7 requires minor 7th (Gb to Fb = E), which is 10 semitones. But here D# = E natural, which is 11 semitones from Gb — major 7th. So F#6 = F#maj6 = F#-A#-C#-D#, which is a major 6th chord, not dominant. 

F#maj6: F#-A#-C#-D#. Enharmonic: Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. Db is C#, Eb is D#. So Gb-Bb-Db-Eb. Now, Gb to Eb: Gb-G-Ab-Bb-C-D-Eb → 10 semitones? Gb to Ab:2, to Bb:4, to C:6, to Db:7, to Eb:9? Let's count: Gb (0), G (1), Ab (2), A (3), Bb (4), B (5), C (6), Db (7), D (8), Eb (9), E (10). Gb to Eb is minor 7th (10 semitones? Gb to G is 1, to Ab 2, Bb 4, C 6, Db 7, D 8, Eb 9, E 10. Yes, 10 semitones = minor 7th. But Gb to Eb should be minor 7th for Gb7, but Gb7 has Fb (E), not Eb. Gb to Fb: Fb is E, which is 10 semitones from Gb (Gb to E is minor 7th: Gb-A-Bb-C-Db-Eb-E? No: Gb to G:1, G to Ab:2? Better: semitones: Gb=6, E=4? Standard: C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11. So F#=6, D#=3? Messy. 

Absolute semitones: 
F# = 6 
A# = 10 (since A=9, A#=10) 
C# = 1 (C=0, C#=1? No: C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, A#=10, B=11). 
D# = 3? D#=3, but E=4, so D#=3 is correct. 
So F#6 = F#(6), A#(10), C#(1), D#(3). 
Now in standard key: 
- F#(6) 
- A#(10) 
- C#(1) = Db? C#=1 is C#, which is Db=1? Db is C# enharmonic, same pitch class 1. 
- D#(3) = Eb(3) 

So pitches: 6, 10, 1, 3. 
Which are: F#, Bb, C#, D# or Gb, Bb, Db, Eb. 

Chord quality: root F#, but the notes are F#, A#, C#, D# — that's F# major triad (F#-A#-C#) plus D# which is the major 6th (since F# to D# is minor 6th? F# to D: perfect 4th to D, F#-G-A-Bb-B-C-D, so F# to D is minor 6th (8 semitones: F#=6, D=2, difference 8 semitones). Major 6th would be 9 semitones. In chord notation, "6" usually means added 6th, so F#6 = F# major with 6th added, which is F#-A#-C#-D#, and D# is the major 6th above F#? F# to D#: F#-G-A-B-C-D, D is minor 6th (8 semitones), D# would be major 6th (9 semitones). Yes, D# is major 6th above F#. So F#6 = F#maj6. 

But in the context of the song, F#maj6 might be functioning as a IV chord or something. 

Back to key analysis. Let's list all chords with enharmonic respelling to Ab key (since G# is Ab): 

- G# = Ab 
- Fm/G# = F minor over Ab bass → but as pitch, it's F, Ab, C with Ab in bass, so the chord is F minor, but bass is Ab 
- Similarly, Cdim/F# = Cdim over F# bass; F#=Gb, so Cdim/Gb 
- A#m/G# = A#m over G# bass = Bbm over Ab bass, which we decoded as Bb7 
- F#6 = as above, F#maj6 

But for functional harmony, we care about chord roots and qualities. 

From earlier: 
- A#m/G# = Bb7 (dominant chord) 
- Cdim/F# is likely F#ø7 (F# half-diminished) 
- Fm/G# is probably just Fm chord 

And the sequence is: 
Ab, Ab, Fm, Fm, F#ø7, Bb7, Ab, Ab, Fm, Fm, Ab, Ab, F#maj6, Ab 

Now, F#ø7 is a common chord in minor keys. Specifically, in G minor, F#ø7 is the viiø7 chord. But here we have Ab, which is the tonic? Ab major or minor? 

Ab major scale: Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G 
Ab minor natural: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb 
Ab minor harmonic: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-G (G natural) 

In Ab minor harmonic, the leading tone is G natural, so we have G major or diminished chords. F# is Gb? In Ab minor, the notes are: 
Natural minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb 
Harmonic minor: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, G (raised 7th) 

So G natural is the leading tone. G natural to Ab is half step. 

Now, F# is Gb, which is not in Ab minor; it's Cb (B) instead. But in harmonic minor, we have G natural, not Gb. So F#ø7 would be Gbø7, which isn't in Ab minor. 

But F#ø7 = F#-A-C-Eb. Enharmonic to Gb-Ab-Cb-Db. In which key is this a diatonic chord? In Ab minor harmonic, the chords are: 
i: Ab minor 
ii°: Bb diminished 
III+: Cb augmented? Not standard. 
iv: Db minor 
V: Eb major 
VI: Fb major (E) 
vii°: Gb diminished? But Gb dim = Gb-Bbb-Dbb, not matching. 

G natural is the leading tone, so vii° is G° = G-Bb-Db. But here we have F#ø7 = F#-A-C-Eb = Gb-Ab-Cb-Db. Which is not G°. 

In G minor harmonic, we have F#ø7 naturally. G minor: G-Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F#. So F#ø7 = F#-A-C-E. But here we have F#-A-C-Eb — Eb instead of E. So it's F# half-diminished with flattened fifth? No, half-diminished is minor 7 flat 5, which is F#-A-C-E, but E is natural. Here it's Eb, so it's diminished 7th: F#-A-C-Eb is F# diminished 7th, because all intervals are minor thirds: F#-A = min3, A-C = min3, C-Eb = min3. 

Yes! F# dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb. And it's symmetrical. 

Similarly, Cdim is C-Eb-Gb, and with F# bass, it's the same as F# dim7 because dim7 chords are inversions of each other. F# dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb, which is the same as A dim7, C dim7, Eb dim7. So Cdim/F# is just F# dim7. 

In fact, all inversions of a dim7 chord are the same set of notes. So C dim7 over F# bass is still a dim7 chord, root F# (or Gb). 

So now the sequence makes more sense: 
- G# = Ab 
- Fm/G# = F minor first inversion (Ab bass) 
- Cdim/F# = F# dim7 (or Gb dim7) 
- A#m/G# = Bb7 (as we decoded) 
- F#6 = F# major 6th, which is enharmonic to Gb maj6 

But let's write roots: 
- Ab 
- Ab 
- Fm (but bass Ab, so it's Fm, not Ab) 
- Fm 
- Gb dim7 
- Bb7 
- Ab 
- Ab 
- Fm 
- Fm 
- Ab 
- Ab 
- Gb maj6 
- Ab 

Now, Gb maj6 = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb, which is the same as Eb minor 7: Eb-Gb-Bb-Db. Eb min7. 

Gb maj6 with notes Gb, Bb, Db, Eb: if we take Eb as root, it's Eb min7 (Eb-Gb-Bb-Db). Yes! Because Eb to Gb is minor 3rd, Eb to Bb perfect 5th, Eb to Db minor 7th. So Gb maj6 is enharmonic to Eb min7. 

Similarly, F# maj6 = F#, A#, C#, D# = Gb, Bb, Db, Eb = Eb min7. 

Ah! So F#6 is actually Eb minor 7th chord. 

And Bb7 we have, which is dominant of Eb. 

So let's reinterpret the entire sequence with chord roots: 

Original: 
G# (Ab) 
G# (Ab) 
Fm/G# → Fm chord (but in context, likely part of progression) 
Fm/G# → Fm 
Cdim/F# → Gb dim7 (or F# dim7) 
A#m/G# → Bb7 
G# (Ab) 
G# (Ab) 
Fm/G# → Fm 
Fm/G# → Fm 
G# (Ab) 
G# (Ab) 
F#6 → Eb min7 
G# (Ab) 

Now, let's list the root progression: 
Ab, Ab, F, F, Gb, Bb, Ab, Ab, F, F, Ab, Ab, Eb, Ab 

Chord qualities: 
- Ab: ? (probably major, since no indication otherwise) 
- F: minor 
- Gb: diminished 7th 
- Bb: dominant 7th 
- Eb: minor 7th 

Now, what key has these chords? 

Notice Bb7 is the V7 of Eb minor. Eb min7 is the i chord of Eb minor? But Eb min7 is the tonic chord for Eb minor? 

Eb minor scale: Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb-Cb-Db 

Diatonic chords: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III+: Gb aug? Not usually 
iv: Ab min 
v: Bb min 
VI: Cb maj 
VII: Db maj 

But we have Bb7 (Bb dominant 7th), which has D natural (major third), whereas in natural minor, v is Bb minor (Bb-Db-F). So Bb7 suggests harmonic minor, which has D natural in Eb minor. 

Eb minor harmonic: Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb-Cb-D (D natural) 

So chords: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III+: Gb aug 
iv: Ab min (but with harmonic, iv is still minor? No, in harmonic minor, the chords change: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III+: Gb aug (Gb-Bb-Db? Gb to Bb is major 3rd, Gb to Db perfect 5th, so major, not augmented. Mistake. 

Eb harmonic minor: notes Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, D 
Chord on Gb: Gb, Ab, Bb, Db? Gb-Ab-Bb-Db is Gb major 7? Gb-Bb-Db-F, not matching. 

Standard harmonic minor chords: 
- i: Eb min 
- ii°: F dim (F-Ab-Cb) 
- III+: Gb aug? Gb-Bb-Db — Gb to Db is perfect 5th, so major triad, not augmented. 
Actually, in harmonic minor, the III chord is augmented: for C minor harmonic, Eb aug (Eb-G-Bb, but in C harmonic minor: C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-B, so chord on Eb: Eb-G-Bb, which is major, not augmented. I think I'm confusing. 

In minor keys, the harmonic minor raises the 7th, so: 
- The v chord becomes major (if it has the 7th), but in Eb minor natural, v is Bb minor (Bb-Db-F), with harmonic minor (D natural), v becomes Bb dominant 7 (Bb-Db-F-Ab? No, dominant 7 needs major third. Bb with D natural: Bb-D-F-Ab = Bb7. Yes! So in Eb harmonic minor, V is Bb7 (dominant). 

Similarly, the i chord is Eb minor. 

Now, we have Eb min7 as the penultimate chord, which fits as i in Eb minor. 

But the tonic throughout the sequence seems to be Ab: it starts and ends with Ab, and it's repeated. 

Ab is the IV chord in Eb minor! Because Eb minor: 
i: Eb 
ii°: F dim 
III: Gb? (but Gb is major? In Eb natural minor: Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb-Cb-Db, so chord on Gb: Gb-Ab-Bb-Db? Gb major 7? Gb-Bb-Db-F — but F not in scale. Actually, in natural minor, Gb chord is Gb major (since Gb-Ab-Bb is major triad in natural minor? No: Gb to Bb is major 3rd (4 semitones), Gb to Db is perfect 5th (7 semitones), so yes, Gb major. 

Standard natural minor diatonic chords: 
i: minor 
ii°: diminished 
III: major 
iv: minor 
v: minor 
VI: major 
VII: major 

For Eb natural minor: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III: Gb major 
iv: Ab min 
v: Bb min 
VI: Cb major (B) 
VII: Db major 

But we have Bb7, which is not natural minor — it's harmonic minor. 

In Eb harmonic minor (with D natural), the chords are: 
i: Eb min 
ii°: F dim 
III+: Gb augmented (Gb-Bb-D? Gb to D is augmented 5th — yes, because D natural instead of Db) 
iv: Ab min? Ab-Cb-Eb — but Cb=B, so Ab-Bb-Eb? Ab to Cb is minor 3rd? Ab to Bb is major 2nd, not. Notes for iv: Ab, Bb, Cb, Db. With harmonic minor, Cb is still Cb, Db is Db, so iv is Ab minor: Ab-Cb-Eb. 
v: Bb major (Bb-Db-F? Db is C#, but in harmonic minor, 7th is raised to D natural, but that doesn't affect v chord. v is Bb-Db-F, still minor. To get dominant, we need the major third, so only if we borrow or use harmonic. 

Specifically for dominant function, in minor keys, we often use the harmonic minor for the V chord to have a leading tone. So V is major: for Eb minor, V is Bb major, and V7 is Bb7. 

So Bb7 is the V7 in Eb minor. 

Then Eb min7 is the i chord. 

But in our progression, we have Ab as the recurring chord, and Ab is the iv chord in Eb minor (since iv is Ab minor in natural minor). 

But the progression ends with Ab, suggesting it's the tonic. 

Perhaps it's in Ab minor. 

Let's check Ab minor. 

Ab natural minor: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb 
Notes: Ab, Bb, Cb (B), Db, Eb, Fb (E), Gb 

Diatonic chords: 
i: Ab min 
ii°: Bb dim 
III: Cb major (B) 
iv: Db min 
v: Eb min 
VI: Fb major (E) 
VII: Gb major 

But we have Gb dim7 earlier? In the sequence, we have Gb dim7 (from Cdim/F#). Gb dim7 would require Gb-Bb-Db-Fb, but in Ab minor, Gb chord is major (Gb-Bb-Db), not diminished. 

In Ab harmonic minor, we raise Gb to G natural. 
Ab harmonic minor: Ab-Bb-Cb-Db-Eb-Fb-G 

Chords: 
- i: Ab min 
- ii°: Bb dim (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- III+: Cb aug? Cb-Eb-G? Cb to Eb is minor 3rd? Standard: Cb chord in Ab harmonic minor: Cb, Db, Eb, G? Cb-Db-Eb-G — Cb to G is augmented 5th, so Cb augmented. 
- iv: Db min (Db-Fb-Ab) 
- v: Eb min? Eb-Gb-Bb, but Gb is still Gb? In harmonic minor, we only raise the 7th, so the v chord is still minor: Eb-Ab? Eb to Gb is minor 3rd, so Eb minor. 
- VI: Fb major? Fb-Ab-Cb — Fb to Cb is perfect 5th, but Fb is E, Cb is B, so E major. 
- VII°: G° = G-Bb-Db 

Ah! The VII° chord is G diminished, which is G-Bb-Db. Enharmonic to F#-A-C, but that's F# dim triad. We have Gb dim7? Gb is F#, but G natural is the leading tone, so it's G°, not Gb°. 

In the sequence, we have "Cdim/F#" which we interpreted as Gb dim7 or F# dim7. But F# dim triad would be F#-A-C, which is not in Ab minor; we have G° = G-Bb-Db. 

However, diminished 7th chords are often used as passing chords, not always diatonic. 

Another clue: the progression has Bb7, which is V7 of Eb. Eb is the IV of Ab? If Ab is tonic, Eb is dominant? But Ab to Eb is perfect 4th, so Eb would be V in Ab major, but Ab major has Eb major, not minor. 

Perhaps it's in Ab major. 

Ab major scale: Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G 
Chords: 
I: Ab 
ii: Bb min 
iii: C min 
IV: Db 
V: Eb 
vi: F min 
vii°: G dim 

Now, look at our chords: 
- Ab: I 
- Fm: vi 
- Gb dim7: not diatonic — G dim is diatonic, but Gb dim is not 
- Bb7: V7 of Eb, but in Ab major, V is Eb major, not Bb7 
- Eb min7: iv in Ab minor, but in major it's iv minor? Ab major has iv = Db major, not Eb. 

Bb7 could be the V7/vi, i.e., dominant of F minor. In Ab major, vi is F minor, so Bb7 would be V7 of vi, which is a common secondary dominant. 

Similarly, Eb min7 could be iv in Ab minor, but if the key is Ab major, Eb is V, not minor. 

Let's see the progression: 
Ab - Ab - Fm - Fm - Gb°7 - Bb7 - Ab - Ab - Fm - Fm - Ab - Ab - Ebm7 - Ab 

If key is Ab major: 
- Ab: I 
- Fm: vi 
- Gb°7: this is problematic. Gb dim7 = F# dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb. In Ab major, the notes are Ab,Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,G — no A, C, F#, Eb. So not diatonic. 
- Bb7: V7/vi = dominant of vi (Fm), so it's secondary dominant 
- Ebm7: Eb min7 = Eb-Gb-Bb-Db. In Ab major, Eb is V chord, which should be Eb major (Eb-G-Bb-Db), but here it's minor 7th (Eb-Gb-Bb-Db), so it has Gb instead of G. Gb is not in Ab major; Ab major has G natural. So Ebm7 is not diatonic — it's borrowed from minor. 

This suggests modal mixture or a minor key. 

Perhaps the key is Ab minor. 

Assume Ab minor (tonic Ab). 

Ab natural minor: Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb, Gb 
But we have G natural in the harmonic context because of the dim7 chord and the dominant. 

Ab harmonic minor: Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb,G 

Now list chords in Ab harmonic minor: 
- i: Ab min (Ab-Cb-Eb) 
- ii°: Bb dim (Bb-Db-Fb) 
- III+: Cb aug (Cb-Eb-G) 
- iv: Db min (Db-Fb-Ab) 
- V: Eb major? Eb-G-Bb, but in harmonic minor, G is natural, so yes, V is Eb major (or V7= Eb7) 
Wait, V chord: notes on Eb: Eb, G, Bb? Eb to G is major 3rd (4 semitones), so yes, Eb major. But in minor keys, V is often major for cadence. 

But in our progression, we have Bb7, not Eb7. Bb is the v chord in Ab minor, which is minor in natural minor, but in harmonic minor? The v chord is still minor because the 7th is lowered. 

In Ab harmonic minor: scale Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb,G 
Chord on Bb: Bb, Db, Fb, Ab? Bb-Db-Fb-Ab. Db is C#, Fb is E, so Bb-D-F-A? Bb to D is major 3rd? Bb to D is major 3rd (4 semitones), Bb to F is perfect 5th, Bb to Ab is minor 7th. So Bb7 (Bb-D-F-Ab). Yes! In Ab harmonic minor, the v chord is Bb7 dominant 7th. 

Perfect! 

Similarly, the i chord is Ab minor. 

Now check other chords: 
- Fm: F minor = F-Ab-C. In Ab minor, F is the VI degree. In natural minor, VI is major (Fb major = E major), but in harmonic minor, the VI chord is still the same as natural minor for degrees not affected. Ab harmonic minor has G natural, but F is still Fb? No, in Ab minor, the sixth degree is Fb (E), so chord on Fb is Fb major (Fb-Ab-Cb). But F minor has F natural, not Fb. 

Problem: F minor = F-Ab-C, but in Ab minor, the sixth degree is Fb (E), not F natural. F natural is raised sixth, which is characteristic of melodic minor. 

Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab,Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,G 
So chord on F: F, Ab, C — F minor! Yes. 

So if we're using melodic minor, F minor is diatonic. 

But in the progression, we have Fm repeated. 

Also, we have Gb dim7. Gb is F#, which is the flat sixth? In Ab minor, sixth degree is Fb (natural minor) or F natural (melodic). F# is not standard. 

In the sequence, "Cdim/F#" = Gb dim7. Gb dim7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Fb. In Ab minor natural, Db is the fourth degree, Gb is the seventh degree? Ab minor: 1.Ab, 2.Bb, 3.Cb, 4.Db, 5.Eb, 6.Fb, 7.Gb. So Gb is the seventh degree. 

In natural minor, chord on Gb: Gb, Ab, Bb, Db? Gb-Ab-Bb-Db. Intervals: Gb to Ab = major 2nd? Not triad. Standard triad: Gb-Bb-Db, which is Gb major (since Bb is minor third? Gb to Bb is major 3rd, 4 semitones). 

But Gb dim7 would require Gb-Bbb-Dbb-Fbb, not matching. 

However, the diminished seventh chord is often used as a chromatic approach. Specifically, Gb dim7 is the common-tone diminished chord for Ab minor. 

In minor keys, the common-tone diminished chord to tonic is vii°7, but in natural minor it's half-diminished? No, in harmonic minor, vii° is diminished triad, and with the flattened seventh, it becomes half-diminished seventh. 

For Ab minor harmonic: notes Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb,G 
Chord on G: G, Bb, Db, F — G°7 (G-Bb-Db-F). 

But we have Gb dim7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Fb. Fb is E, so Gb-Bb-Db-E. Which is not the same. 

Gb dim7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb? Dim7 should be minor thirds: Gb to Bbb? Standard dim7: root, min3, dim5, dim7. So Gb dim7 = Gb-Bbb-Dbb-Fbb = Gb-A-C-Eb enharmonically. Yes! Gb dim7 = Gb, A, C, Eb. 

In Ab minor harmonic, the notes are Ab,Bb,Cb,Db,Eb,Fb,G. Gb dim7 has Gb,A,C,Eb — A and C are not in the scale (scale has Bb, Cb, Db, etc.). A natural is not in Ab minor; it's Bbb in some contexts, but not standard. 

However, Gb dim7 can function as a leading tone chord to Gb, but in Ab minor, it might be interpreted as the Neapolitan ♭II chord. 

In minor keys, the Neapolitan chord is ♭II, which in Ab minor is Bb major? Let's see. 

Ab minor: tonic Ab. ♭II is Bbb major, which is A major. Not Gb. 

Common usage: Gb dim7 is often used as a passing chord to Ab minor. Specifically, it's the diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone of Ab minor, but the leading tone is G natural, so G°7 = G-Bb-Db-F. 

Gb is not the leading tone. 

But Gb dim7 to Ab minor is a common progression: Gb dim7 resolves to Ab by half step (Gb to Ab), and the other notes: Bb to Bb, Db to Db, Eb to E? But Ab minor has Eb, but the chord has Eb, which is the fifth, so Eb to Eb is common tone. 

Gb dim7: Gb, Bb, Db, Eb 
Resolves to Ab minor: Ab, Cb, Eb 

- Gb → Ab (up half step) 
- Bb → Bb? But Ab minor has Bb, so it can stay, but usually it goes to Ab or Cb. 
- Db → Cb (down half step) 
- Eb → Eb (common tone) 

Yes, so Gb dim7 can resolve deceptively or as a chromatic approach to Ab minor. 

In fact, it's a common subdominant function chord in minor keys. 

Now, the progression: 
Ab - Ab - Fm - Fm - Gb°7 - Bb7 - Ab - Ab - Fm - Fm - Ab - Ab - Ebm7 - Ab 

In Ab minor: 
- Ab: i 
- Fm: ? In Ab minor melodic (ascending), F is natural sixth, so chord on F is F minor (F-Ab-C), which is the minor subdominant or something. In melodic minor, the iv chord is minor, but F is not iv. iv is Db. F is VI♭? In natural minor, VI is Fb major (E), but here F minor suggests melodic minor with unraised sixth? Confusing. 

Standard: In minor keys, the VI chord is often minor when borrowed, but diatonically it's different. 

Perhaps it's in G# minor, but let's stick with Ab for simplicity. 

Another observation: the sequence has Fm/G# and G# as tonic. G# minor is impractical; it's Ab minor. 

Let's consider the cadence. The progression often returns to Ab, and ends with Ab. The penultimate chord is Ebm7, which is the iv chord in Ab minor (iv = Db minor in natural minor, not Eb). Eb is V, so Ebm7 would be v minor. 

But earlier we saw that in harmonic minor, v is major (Bb7), but here we have Ebm7, which is not diatonic. 

Notice that Bb7 resolves to Ab, which is the tonic. Bb7 to Ab is a cadence, and in Ab minor, Bb7 is the V7 chord (since v is Bb, and with leading tone G, it becomes Bb7). 

Yes! In Ab minor harmonic, V7 is Bb7, resolving to i (Ab minor). 

And at the end, we have Ebm7 to Ab. Ebm7 is not V7; it should be Bb7 for dominant. But the last two chords are Ebm7 to Ab, which is a iv to i progression in minor, but iv in Ab minor is Db minor, not Eb. 

Ebm7 = Eb-Gb-Bb-Db. In Ab minor, Eb is the V degree, so chord on Eb should be Eb major or minor. In natural minor, v is Eb minor (Eb-Gb-Bb), so Ebm7 is the v7 chord. 

So v7 (Ebm7) resolving to i (Ab minor) — but that's not a strong cadence; the strong cadence is V7 (Bb7) to i. 

In the progression, before the final Ab, we have Ebm7, but earlier we have Bb7 resolving to Ab: look at the sequence: 
... Bb7, Ab, Ab, ... 
So Bb7 to Ab is a clear cadence. 

Then later, Fm, Fm, Ab, Ab, then Ebm7, Ab — so Ebm7 to Ab is also a cadence, but weaker. 

Perhaps the key is Ab minor, and Ebm7 is the v chord in natural minor, while Bb7 is the V chord in harmonic minor. So it's mixing natural and harmonic minor. 

Now for Fm: in Ab minor, if we consider melodic minor ascending (Ab,Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,G), then chord on F is F minor? F-Ab-C. Yes, since F natural, Ab, C natural. In melodic minor, the sixth is natural, so yes, F minor is the minor subdominant or iio? Let's see: 
Ab melodic minor ascending: Ab Bb C Db Eb F G 
Chords: 
i: Ab min 
ii: Bb min 
III: C maj 
iv: Db min 
v: Eb min 
vi: F min 
vii°: G° 

Yes! vi is F minor. 

Perfect. 

And Gb dim7: we have it as a chromatic chord, but it might be functioning as a common-tone diminished or a secondary leading tone. 

Cdim/F# = Gb dim7. As discussed, it resolves to Bb7? In the sequence: ... Fm, Fm, Gb°7, Bb7, Ab ... 

So Gb dim7 to Bb7. 

Gb dim7 = Gb-Bb-Db-Eb 
Bb7 = Bb-Db-F-Ab 

Resolution: 
- Gb → F? Gb to F is minor 7th down, not typical. 
Standard diminished resolution: often resolves by half step. Gb dim7 typically resolves to Gb or Ab. 

Specifically: 
- Gb → Ab (pitches: Gb up to Ab) 
- Bb → Bb? Or to A? 
- Db → C# or Cb? 

Common resolution of Gb dim7: 
- Gb → F# or Gb? To Ab major: Gb->Ab, Bb->B, Db->C, Eb->D. But here it's Bb7, which has Db (not C), F, Ab. 

Bb7: notes Bb, D, F, Ab. 

So resolution: 
- Gb → Ab (in Bb7) 
- Bb → Bb? 
- Db → Db? 
- Eb → D? But Bb7 has D natural, not Db. 

Eb in Gb dim7 to D in Bb7: Eb to D is half step down. 

So: 
- Gb → Ab (up half step) 
- Bb → Bb? But Bb7 has Bb as root, so it could stay, but typically the diminished chord notes move to chord tones. 
- Db → C? But Bb7 has Db? No, Bb7 is Bb-D-F-Ab, so Db is not in it; it's D natural. 

Notes: Gb dim7: Gb, A, C, Eb (since dim7 is minor thirds: Gb to A is min3? Gb to A is aug 2nd, enharmonic to min3). Standard: Gb°7 = Gb-Bbb-Dbb-Fbb = Gb-A-C-Eb (because Bbb=A, Dbb=C, Fbb=Eb). 

Yes: Gb, A, C, Eb. 

Bb7: Bb, D, F, Ab. 

Possible resolution: 
- Gb → F or Ab? Gb to F is major 7th down, not good. Gb to Ab is half step up. 
- A → Bb? A to Bb is half step up. 
- C → Bb or D? C to Bb is whole step down, C to D is whole step up. 
- Eb → D or E? Eb to D is half step down, Eb to E is half step up. 

Typically, diminished chords resolve with each note moving by half step. So: 
- Gb → Gb? Not. To Ab (up) 
- A → Bb (up) 
- C → B (down) but Bb7 has D, not B. 
- Eb → D (down) 

Bb7 has D, not B. So C should resolve to D (up whole step), but that's not half step. 

Perhaps it's resolving to the Bb7 chord: 
- Gb → Ab (Bb7's 7th) 
- A → Bb (root) 
- C → D (3rd) 
- Eb → D? Conflict, Eb to D is down, but C to D is up. 

Eb to D (down half step), C to D (up half step) — C and Eb both resolve to D, which is possible (two voices to same note). 

Yes: common in diminished resolutions. 

So Gb°7 resolves to Bb7: 
- Gb → Ab 
- A → Bb 
- C → D 
- Eb → D 

Bb7 has Ab (7th), Bb (root), D (3rd), F (5th), so yes, it fits: 
- Gb → Ab (7th of Bb7) 
- A → Bb (root) 
- C → D (3rd) 
- Eb → D (3rd, so doubled) 

Perfect. 

And Bb7 resolves to Ab minor: 
- Bb7: Bb, D, F, Ab 
- Ab minor: Ab, Cb, Eb 
- Resolution: Bb → Ab (down minor 3rd? Not standard), but typical: D (3rd) → Cb (down half step), F (5th) → Eb (down half step), Ab (7th) → Ab (common or down), Bb (root) → Ab (down minor 2nd). 

Standard V7 to i in minor: 
- Leading tone G to Ab (but here V7 is Bb7, not Eb7; Bb7 is the V of Ab minor, yes). 

For V7 = Bb7 (Bb-D-F-Ab) resolving to i = Ab minor (Ab-Cb-Eb): 
- D (3rd of V) → Cb (down half step, since Cb is diatonic in minor) 
- F (5th of V) → Eb (down half step) 
- Ab (7th of V) → G or Ab? In minor, the 7th often resolves down by half step to the third of tonic. Tonic third is Cb, so Ab → G? But G natural is the leading tone, which should go to Ab. 
In Ab minor, the notes: tonic Ab, third Cb (B), fifth Eb. 
V7 = Bb7: root Bb, 3rd D, 5th F, 7th Ab. 
Resolution: 
- D (3rd) → Cb (B) (down half step, since Cb is the minor third) 
- F (5th) → Eb (down half step) 
- Ab (7th) → G (down half step? But G is not in tonic chord; tonic has Ab, Cb, Eb. G is the leading tone, which isn't in the tonic triad. Typically, the 7th (Ab) resolves down to G, but in minor, G is natural for harmonic, so it should resolve to G, which might be sustained or resolved, but the chord is Ab minor, so Ab to G is a suspension. Standard is 7th resolves down by half step, so Ab → G. 

But in the sequence, it goes Bb7 to Ab directly, and Ab is the tonic, so it probably works. 

Now, the Ebm7: at the end, Ebm7 to Ab. Ebm7 = Eb-Gb-Bb-Db. Resolving to Ab minor: Eb → Eb (common), Gb → Fb or G? But Ab minor has Cb, not G. Typically, Ebm7 is the iv chord in minor? No, iv is Db minor. 

In Ab minor, Eb is V, so Eb minor is v. v minor to i is a cadence in natural minor. 

So the progression uses both harmonic minor (for Bb7) and natural minor (for Ebm7), which is common. 

Fm: as we said, in melodic minor, it's the vi chord. Ab minor melodic ascending: Ab,Bb,C,Db,Eb,F,G, so F minor is vi. 

And Fm appears before the cadence: Fm to Gb°7 to Bb7 to Ab. 

Fm to Gb°7: F minor to Gb dim7. 

F minor: F, Ab, C 
Gb dim7: Gb, A, C, Eb 

Common tones: Ab and C? Fm has Ab and C, Gb dim7 has A (which is enharmonic to G#, not Ab) and C. 

Fm: F, Ab, C 
Gb dim7: Gb, A, C, Eb 

Shared note: C. 

Resolution: F → Eb or Gb? F to Eb is half step down, F to Gb is minor 2nd up. Typically, F might go to Eb (in Gb dim7). 

In the sequence: Fm - Fm - Gb°7, so it's a progression. 

Now, to confirm the key and mode: 

- The tonic chord is Ab minor (G# minor). 
- The progression uses characteristic chords of minor: 
  - i (Abm) - tonic 
  - vi (Fm) - from melodic minor 
  - vii°7 (Gb°7) - chromatic leading tone chord, but in this context it's acting as a secondary leading tone to V 
  - V7 (Bb7) - dominant seventh, indicating harmonic minor 
  - v7 (Ebm7) - natural minor dominant chord 

The use of both V7 (Bb7) and v7 (Ebm7) suggests a minor key with mixture, but the dominant function is clearly present with Bb7 resolving to tonic. 

The mode is minor, specifically a blend, but the tonic is Ab minor. 

Since the sequence emphasizes Ab as the home chord, and has the leading tone G (implied by Bb7's third being D, but wait: Bb7 has D natural, which is the major third, so it assumes the leading tone to Ab is G natural. 

In Ab minor, the leading tone is G natural (raised 7th), which is used to create the dominant chord Bb7 (Bb-D-F-Ab), where D natural comes from the leading tone scale. 

The presence of F natural (in Fm) indicates the sixth degree is raised, characteristic of melodic minor. 

However, the Ebm7 at the end has Gb (Ab minor's minor sixth), which is lowered, so it's using natural minor for that chord. 

Overall, the key is Ab minor, and the mode is minor with melodic and harmonic variations. 

But to specify the mode: since it's not strictly one mode but a minor key with mixture, we say the key is Ab minor. 

Now, why is the last chord before tonic Ebm7? In many minor key progressions, a iv chord (which would be Db minor, but Ebm7 is not iv; iv is Db minor in Ab minor). Eb is V, so Ebm7 is v7. 

v to i is a valid cadence in minor, though weaker than V to i. 

In the sequence, the primary cadence is Bb7 to Ab (V7 to i), which is strong. The final cadence is Ebm7 to Ab, which might be a plagal cadence or just a weaker resolution. 

Given all this, the key is G# minor (enharmonically Ab minor). 

But G# minor is uncommonly notated; usually Ab minor. 

The user wrote all chords with sharps, so probably they want G# minor. 

Confirm with the original notation: 
Roots: G# (not Ab), Fm, Cdim/F# (F#=G#? F# is sixth degree), A#m/G# (A#=Bb), etc. 

In G# minor: 
Tonic: G# 
Scale: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, F# 
Harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, Fx (but Fx is G, so G natural? Messy. 

Standard minor key notation: G# minor is impractical because it requires double sharps in harmonic minor. For example, harmonic minor: G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E, Fx (F double sharp = G natural). So it's usually respelled as Ab minor. 

Therefore, the key is Ab minor. 

But the user might expect the answer in sharps since the input uses sharps. 

So G# minor, but it's better to say Ab minor. 

Now for the mode: it's minor (Aeolian mode), but with harmonic and melodic characteristics. However, the fundamental mode is minor. 

The question asks for "key and mode". Mode typically refers to the scale type, like Aeolian, Dorian, etc. 

In traditional terms, "key" implies major or minor, and "mode" might specify Greek modes, but often in this context, "mode" means minor or major. 

Looking at the chords, it's clearly minor. 

To confirm: 
- Tonic chord is minor (G# minor, though written as G# major? Wait, the root is G#, but is it minor? 

Problem: the first chord is written as "G#", which typically implies major triad. Similarly, the last chord is "G#". 

In standard notation, "G#" means G# major. 

But in the sequence, we have "A#m/G#", which suggests A# minor, so minor is used, but the tonic is written as major. 

Ah, critical point: the tonic chord G# is written without "m", so it's probably major. 

But in minor keys, the tonic chord is minor, so "G#" should be G# minor, but it's written as G#, implying major. 

In the sequence: 
"G# G# Fm/G# ..." — "G#" with no specification usually means major in chord notation. 

But if the key is minor, the tonic chord should be minor. 

Unless it's in a major key? 

Perhaps it's in a major key, and G# is not the tonic. 

Let's rethink. 

The progression might not be in G# minor. 

Look at the chord roots: Ab, Ab, F, F, Gb, Bb, Ab, Ab, F, F, Ab, Ab, Eb, Ab 

If Ab is not tonic, what could it be? 

The chord that feels like tonic: it starts and ends with it, and has cadences to it (like Bb7 to Ab, Ebm7 to Ab). 

But if Ab major is tonic, then: 
- Ab major 
- Fm is vi 
- Gb dim7: not diatonic 
- Bb7 is V7/vi (since vi is Fm) 
- Ebm7: Eb minor 7, which is iv in Ab minor, but not in major 

Bb7 resolving to Ab is a deceptive cadence if Ab is tonic; Bb7 is V7/vi, so it should resolve to vi (Fm), but here it resolves to Ab (I). 

In the sequence: ... Gb°7, Bb7, Ab ... so Bb7 to Ab. 

If key is Ab major, Bb7 is V7/vi, which typically resolves to vi (Fm), not to I. 

But it's resolving to I, which is a common substitution (deceptive resolution). 

Then the progression makes sense in Ab major: 
- I: Ab 
- vi: Fm 
- Gb°7: chromatic passing chord 
- V7/vi: Bb7, but resolving deceptively to I instead of vi 
- Then back to I 

At the end: ... Ab, Ab, Ebm7, Ab 

Ebm7: in Ab major, Eb is V, so Ebm7 is a minor version of V, not diatonic. 

Perhaps Ebm7 is IV in F minor, but not here. 

Another idea: the Ebm7 might be a borrowed chord from minor. 

In Ab major, borrowing Ebm7 from Ab minor. 

So the key is Ab major, with modal mixture (borrowing chords from parallel minor). 

Check the chords: 
- Ab: I 
- Fm: vi (diatonic in major) 
- Gb°7: not diatonic, but common as Neapolitan? In major, Neapolitan is ♭II, which for Ab major is Bbb major (A major), not Gb dim. 
Gb dim7 could be vii°7 of Ab major? Ab major has G° = G-Bb-Db, not Gb. 

But in practice, Gb dim7 is often used as a chromatic approach to Ab major. 

Bb7: as V7/vi, normal. 

Ebm7: borrowed iv from minor. 

And the progression I - vi - [chromatic] - V7/vi - I is common, with the V7/vi resolving deceptively to I. 

The final Ebm7 to Ab could be iv - I, a plagal cadence borrowed from minor. 

Moreover, the tonic chord is written as "G#" implying major, which matches Ab major. 

In Ab minor, the tonic chord should be written as "G#m", but here it's "G#", so likely major. 

So key is Ab major. 

Then mode is Ionian (major). 

But let's confirm the borrowed chords. 

In Ab major, parallel minor is Ab minor, which has: 
- iv: Db minor 
- v: Eb minor 
- etc. 

Here we have Ebm7, which is v from minor, borrowed. 

Also, Fm is diatonic as vi. 

Gb dim7: not directly borrowed, but it can be seen as a passing chord or derived from the Neapolitan area. 

Specifically, Gb dim7 = F# dim7, which can function as the leading tone chord to G, but in Ab major, it might be interpreted as ♭VII°7 or something. 

Commonly, dim7 chords on the flat second scale degree. 

In Ab major, the scale is Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. 

Gb is not in scale; it's chord on G is G°. 

But Gb dim7 = Gb, A, C, Eb. 

In Ab major, this could be the vii°7 of Ab major? Ab major's vii° is G° = G-Bb-Db. Gb dim7 is different. 

However, enharmonically, F# dim7 can be respelled as G°7? F# dim7 = F#-A-C-Eb, G°7 = G-Bb-Db-F. Different notes. 

But in practice, this dim7 chord is functioning as a secondary leading tone. 

Earlier we saw it resolves to Bb7: 
- Gb°7 (Gb,A,C,Eb) to Bb7 (Bb,D,F,Ab) 
With Gb->Ab, A->Bb, C->D, Eb->D 

Now, Bb7 is V7/vi in Ab major (since vi is Fm). 

So the progression is: 
I - I - vi - vi - [vii°7/V] - V7/vi - I ... 

Why vii°7/V? The leading tone chord for V. 

V in Ab major is Eb major. 

Leading tone chord for Eb is D°7 = D-F-Ab-Cb. 

But we have Gb°7 = Gb-A-C-Eb. 

Gb to Eb: Gb is the minor sixth of Eb? Eb scale: Eb,F,G, etc. Gb is minor third. 

Not directly. 

Perhaps it's the common-tone dim7 for Ab. 

But earlier resolution to Bb7 makes sense as a chromatic approach. 

Given that, and the fact that the tonic is major, I think the key is Ab major. 

But the very last cadence is Ebm7 to Ab. Ebm7 is iv from minor, so iv-I borrowed from parallel minor. 

Also, Fm is diatonic so no issue. 

And the Gb dim7 fits as a chromatic passing chord. 

Moreover, in many popular songs, this progression occurs in major keys with borrowed chords. 

So final answer: key is Ab major (or G# major, but Ab is standard). 

Mode: Ionian (major). 

But the user might want the answer in sharps since input uses sharps. 

G# major scale: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F## — full of sharps and double-sharps, very impractical. 

So better to say Ab major. 

For the answer, we can say "Ab major" or "G# major", but Ab is conventional. 

Perhaps the user intended G# minor, but the chord "G#" suggests major. 

Another clue: "F#6" — if it's F# major 6th, that would be F#, A#, C#, D#, which is unusual in key signatures, but in Ab major, F# is not in key; Ab major has F natural. 

F#6 = Gb Maj6 = Gb, Bb, Db, Eb, which is the borrowing from minor, but in Ab major, it's not diatonic. 

In our earlier enharmonic, we decoded F#6 as Eb minor 7th, which is the borrowed iv chord? No, iv in Ab major is Db major. 

If key is Ab major, Eb is V, so Ebm7 is borrowed v-minor. 

And F#6 = Gb Maj6, which is enharmonic to Eb minor 7th, yes. 

So it's consistent with Ab major with modal mixture. 

Therefore, key is Ab major, mode is major (Ionian). 

But to specify: "key of Ab major, Ionian mode" or simply "Ab major". 

Since mode is often redundant for major keys, but the question asks for it. 

Final decision: 
- Key: Ab major (or G# major, but Ab is standard) 
- Mode: Ionian 

However, G# is used in input, so perhaps they want G# major. 

But G# major is not practical, so likely they expect Ab major. 

In the answer, we can say "Ab major (G# major is enharmonically equivalent but rarely used)". 

But for brevity, "Ab major". 

Now, the mode is Ionian. 

But let's make sure there's no other mode. 

Could it be in Dorian, Mixolydian? Unlikely, because the tonic is clearly the I chord, and it's major. 

The progression has a major tonic, so Ionian. 

So answer: key is Ab major, mode is Ionian.

Based on the chord sequence you provided—**G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# Cdim/F# A#m/G# G# G# Fm/G# Fm/G# G# G# F#6 G#**—here's a clear, step-by-step analysis to determine the **key and mode**. The sequence contains **enharmonic respelling** and **slash-chord misdirection**, so I'll decode these first before identifying the harmonic context. (All chords are interpreted with standard voice-leading and functional harmony.)

---

### **Step 1: Decode the "messy" slash chords**
The slash chords are **not** literal inversions—they're **enharmonic tricks** for more common harmonic progressions. Here's the correction:

- **Fm/G#** → **F minor chord with G# bass**  
  G# = Ab (enharmonically), so this is **Fm/Ab**.  
  Notes: Ab (bass), F, Ab, C → simplifies to **F minor triad** (F–Ab–C).  
  *Why?* G# (Ab) is the 3rd of F minor, so this is just an inverted F minor chord (no functional mystery).  
  **Actual chord root = Fm (vi chord in Ab major)**.

- **Cdim/F#** → **C diminished chord with F# bass**  
  F# = Gb (enharmonically), so this is **Cdim/Gb**.  
  Notes: Gb (bass), C, Eb, Gb → Cdim7 = **Gb diminished 7th** (Gb–A–C–Eb).  
  *Why?* Dim7 chords are symmetrical and function as chromatic passing chords. Here, it leads smoothly to Bb7 (see step 2).  
  **Actual chord = Gb°7**.

- **A#m/G#** → **A# minor chord with G# bass**  
  A# = Bb, G# = Ab, so notes are Ab (bass), Bb, Db, F → **Bb7** (Bb–Db–F–Ab).  
  *Why?* Ab in the bass + Bb triad = dominant 7th chord (Bb7). This is a classic **V7/vi** (secondary dominant resolving to F minor).  
  **Actual chord = Bb7**.

- **F#6** → **F# major 6th chord**  
  F#6 = F#–A#–C#–D# → enharmonically respelled as **Gb–Bb–Db–Eb**.  
  Notes: Gb, Bb, Db, Eb → **Ebm7** (Eb–Gb–Bb–Db).  
  *Why?* Gb is the 7th of Eb minor, so this is an Eb minor 7th chord (borrowed from the parallel minor key).  
  **Actual chord = Ebm7**.

---

### **Step 2: Full sequence with corrected roots**
After resolving all notational quirks, the sequence is:  
**Ab Ab Fm Fm Gb°7 Bb7 Ab Ab Fm Fm Ab Ab Ebm7 Ab**  
*(using flats for standard notation—G# = Ab, etc.)*

- **Chord qualities**:  
  - Ab = **Ab major** (I)  
  - Fm = **F minor** (vi)  
  - Gb°7 = **Gb diminished 7th** (chromatic passing chord)  
  - Bb7 = **Bb dominant 7th** (V7/vi)  
  - Ebm7 = **Eb minor 7th** (borrowed iv from parallel minor)  

---

### **Step 3: Harmonic analysis (key and mode)**
#### **Why Ab major (Ionian mode)?**
1. **Tonic confirmation**:  
   - The progression **starts/ends on Ab major** (G#).  
   - Strong cadences resolve to Ab:  
     - Bb7 → Ab (V7/vi → I deceptive resolution)  
     - Ebm7 → Ab (borrowed iv → I plagal cadence)  
   - *Critical clue*: The chord is written as **"G#"** (not "G#m"), implying a **major tonic**—standard in chord notation.

2. **Scale diatonicity**:  
   - Ab major scale: **Ab–Bb–C–Db–Eb–F–G**  
   - Diatonic chords:  
     - I = Ab | ii = Bbm | iii = Cm | **vi = Fm**  
     - V = Eb (not Ebm7—this is borrowed)  
   - Fits perfectly:  
     - **Fm** = vi (diatonic)  
     - **Bb7** = V7/vi (standard secondary dominant)  
     - **Gb°7** = chromatic approach to Bb7 (common in jazz/pop)  
     - **Ebm7** = borrowed iv from **Ab minor** (parallel minor blend, typical in many genres).

3. **Why not minor?**  
   - If this were Ab minor, the tonic chord would be **Abm** (written as "G#m" in your sequence), but it's **major** ("G#").  
   - Bb7 functions as **V7/vi** (not V7 of tonic), which only makes sense in a **major key**.

4. **Mode confirmation**:  
   - The tonic chord is major (I), cadences emphasize I, and the viio chord (G° in Ab major) is absent—replaced by borrowed chords.  
   - **Mode = Ionian** (synonymous with major scale in functional harmony).

#### **Why not G# major?**
- G# major = **G#–A#–B#–C#–D#–E#–F##** (requires double sharps, e.g., B# = C, E# = F, F## = G).  
- This is **highly impractical**—standard notation uses **Ab major** (one flat) instead of G# major (8 sharps).  
- Your sequence uses sharps for convenience (common in pop/film scoring), but **Ab is the key signature**.

---

### **Key and Mode Summary**
| **Element** | **Identification** | **Reasoning** |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Key**     | **Ab major** (enharmonically equivalent to G# major, but **Ab is standard**) | Tonic is Ab major (G#), vi = Fm is diatonic, Bb7 = V7/vi. G# major is notated but impractical; Ab major uses a sensible key signature (4 flats). |
| **Mode**    | **Ionian** | Tonic chord is major (I), harmonic function centers on major tonic with characteristic cadences (V7/vi → I, iv → I). No modal alterations (e.g., no Dorian/Lydian shifts). |

---

### **Why this makes sense in music**
- **Gb°7** acts as a chromatic bridge between Fm and Bb7 (e.g., in jazz: vi → #ivo7 → V7/vi → I).  
- **Ebm7 → Ab** is a **borrowed plagal cadence** from Ab minor (very common in blues, pop, and classical—e.g., Beatles' "Let It Be").  
- The sequence **blends major and minor** (using Ebm7 from parallel minor), but the **tonic is major**, so it’s **Ionian mode** with modal mixture.

This is a **classic major-key progression** with chromatic flavor—heard in genres from jazz to film scores. If you have more context (e.g., melody), I can refine this further! 🎹
