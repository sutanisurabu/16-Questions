The given sequence of chords is:

G\# | G\# | Fm/G\# | Fm/G\# | Cdim/F\# | A\#m/G\# | G\# | G\# | Fm/G\# | Fm/G\# | G\# | G\# | F\#6 | G\#

To determine the key and mode, let's analyze the chords and their roots in the context of common scales.

### 1. Chord Roots and Qualities

The roots of the chords are:
*   G\# (Major)
*   F (Minor) (Note: Fm/G\# implies an F minor triad, and the bass note G\# makes it part of the tonality).
*   C (Diminished)
*   A\# (Minor)
*   F\# (Major/Sixth)

The notes present in these triads (ignoring the bass inversion for a moment, as it heavily features G\#):

*   G\# Major: G\#, B\#, D\#
*   F Minor: F, A$\flat$, C (or E\#, G\#, B\# for theoretical consistency with G\# major)
*   C Diminished: C, E$\flat$, G$\flat$
*   A\# Minor: A\#, C\#, E\#
*   F\# Major/Sixth: F\#, A\#, C\#, D\#

### 2. Identifying the Tonal Center

The most prominent and resolving chord is clearly **G\# Major**. It appears most frequently, starts the progression, and ends the progression. This strongly indicates that **G\# is the tonic**.

### 3. Analyzing the Scale and Diatonic Chords

If G\# is the tonic, we look for a scale that accommodates the other major chords (Fm, A\#m, Cdim, F\#6).

A common theoretical key based on G\# tonic would be **G\# Major** (Key Signature: 8 sharps: Fx, Cx, Gx, D\#, A\#, E\#, B\#, G\#).

The diatonic chords in G\# Major are:
*   I: G\# Major (G\#, B\#, D\#) - **Present**
*   ii: A\# minor (A\#, C\#, E\#) - **Present (A\#m/G\#)**
*   iii: B\# minor (B\#, D\#, Fx)
*   IV: C\# Major (C\#, E\#, G\#)
*   V: D\# Major (D\#, Fx, A\#) (or D\#7)
*   vi: E\# minor (E\#, G\#, B\#)
*   vii°: Fx diminished (Fx, A\#, C\#)

Now let's examine the non-diatonic chords:

*   **Fm (F minor):** The notes are F, A$\flat$, C. In G\# Major, the note F is enharmonically E\# (subtonic). An F minor chord contains A$\flat$ (or G\#) and C. If we use the F minor spelling (F, A$\flat$, C), A$\flat$ is the lowered second degree relative to the scale's G\#. If we spell it E\# minor, the notes would be E\#, G\#, B\# (vi). The 'Fm' chord (F, A$\flat$, C) is actually very common as a borrowed chord in major keys, particularly the **i minor chord borrowed from the relative minor** (or parallel minor) when the tonic is interpreted as A$\flat$ Major (A$\flat$ is the enharmonic equivalent of G\#).

*   **Cdim (C diminished):** The notes are C, E$\flat$, G$\flat$. These notes are not diatonic to G\# Major. This chord typically functions as a chromatic chord, often a **secondary diminished chord** or part of a **Neapolitan progression** (though $VI_{b}$ is more common). Its function is highly unstable.

*   **F\#6 (F\# Major with a sixth):** The notes are F\#, A\#, C\#, D\#. The F\# Major triad is the lowered leading tone chord ($bVII$). This is a common borrowed chord, often called the **Subtonic Chord** (or a Mixolydian/Dorian chord), frequently used in pop/rock music to approach the tonic (V–I) or to resolve to the tonic directly.

### 4. Considering Modal Borrowing

Since the progression strongly establishes G\# as the tonic major chord (G\# Major), but frequently uses the $bVI$, $bVII$, and other borrowed chords, the key is definitively **G\# Major**.

However, the borrowed chords (Fm and F\#6) point toward modal mixture, specifically borrowing from the parallel minor or the Mixolydian or Dorian modes.

*   The F\# Major chord ($bVII$) is classic borrowed from **G\# Mixolydian**.
*   The overall stability of G\# Major (I) confirms the **Major quality**.

### Conclusion

The tonic is **G\#**, established by the clear primary emphasis and resolution to the G\# Major chord.

The **Key** is **G\# Major**.

The **Mode** is **Major** with significant **Modal Mixture** (or borrowing), primarily from the parallel Mixolydian (for the F\#6, $bVII$ chord). The use of these color chords is characteristic of "Pop Music Harmony" or "Neo-Riemannian" harmonic movement rather than strict diatonic functional harmony.

**Key and Mode:** **G\# Major** (with substantial Mixolydian/'Pop' borrowing).
