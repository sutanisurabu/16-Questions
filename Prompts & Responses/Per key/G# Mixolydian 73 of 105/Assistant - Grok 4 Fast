**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast**

**Key:** G#  
**Mode:** Mixolydian  

This progression centers on G# (tonic) with characteristic Mixolydian elements, including the ♭7 (F natural) implied in chords like Fm/G# and A#m/G#, and the use of F# (as bass and chord tone in Cdim/F# and F#6) instead of the natural 7 (G natural) from the parallel major scale. All chord tones (e.g., G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, F#) fit the G# Mixolydian scale (G# A# B♮/C C# D# E♮/F F#), creating a modal rock/jazz flavor without major-scale tensions.
