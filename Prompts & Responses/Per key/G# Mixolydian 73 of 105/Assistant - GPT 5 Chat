Let’s analyze the chords step by step:

**Chord progression:**
```
G#   G#   Fm/G#   Fm/G#   Cdim/F#   A#m/G#   G#   G#
Fm/G#   Fm/G#   G#   G#   F#6   G#
```

### 1. Identify likely tonic
- The chord **G# major** appears very frequently and often at structural cadences — strong indicator that the **tonic** is G#.
- Common chords relative to G#:
  - ii = A#m
  - iii = B#m (enharmonic to Cm)
  - IV = C#
  - V = D# or D#7
  - vi = Fm
  - vii° = Gdim

### 2. Look at the other chords
| Chord       | Typical function (in G# major or minor)                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fm/G#        | Fm is the vi chord in G# major, or iv in G# minor (with tonic pedal G#). |
| Cdim/F#      | C° would be vii° in D♭ major, or could be a passing diminished chord between Fm and A#m. The F# in the bass gives it a chromatic feel—non-diatonic. |
| A#m/G#       | A#m is ii minor in G# major, or iv in F# minor. Over G# it functions as a neighbor/passing sonority. |
| F#6          | F#6 could be interpreted as a chromatic subtonic (VII6) borrowed from the parallel minor (G# minor) or Mixolydian flavor. |

### 3. Pattern and modal coloring
- The overwhelming presence of **G# major** and **Fm (vi)** suggests G# *major* as the base key.
- The inclusion of **F#6** (a bVII chord) points toward **G# Mixolydian** inflection — where the 7th scale degree (F## = G natural) is lowered to F#.
- **Cdim/F#** can serve as a chromatic passing diminished chord.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Tonic (key center):** G#  
- **Mode:** Primarily **G# major**, with **Mixolydian** (bVII) coloration due to the F#6 chord.

**Therefore:** the progression is best described as **in G# major with a Mixolydian flavor**.
