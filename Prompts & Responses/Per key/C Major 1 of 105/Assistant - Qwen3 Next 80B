To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

```
C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C
```

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: List the chords (ignoring bass notes for now)

The main chords (ignoring bass inversions like Am/C) are:

- C
- Am
- Em
- Dm
- G7

So we have: **C, Am, Em, Dm, G7**

---

### Step 2: Find the common key that contains these chords

Let’s check which **major key** contains all of these chords:

In **C major** (C D E F G A B):

- C = I
- Am = vi
- Em = iii
- Dm = ii
- G7 = V7

✅ All of these chords are diatonic to **C major**!

- C (I)  
- Am (vi)  
- Em (iii)  
- Dm (ii)  
- G7 (V7) — yes, the dominant 7th is very common in major keys and is diatonic (built on G: G-B-D-F)

So the **key is C major**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the bass notes (inversions)

You have chord inversions:

- **Am/C** = A minor with C in the bass → this is the **first inversion** of Am (C-E-A)
- **Em/B** = E minor with B in the bass → first inversion of Em (B-E-G)
- **Dm/C** = D minor with C in the bass → this is **not** a standard inversion; Dm is D-F-A, so C is not part of the chord. This is a **neutral bass note** — possibly implying a **C major with Dm on top**? Or a passing pedal? But functionally, it’s likely meant to lead to C or imply a **C major harmony with a suspensive bass**.
- **G7/B** = G7 with B in the bass → first inversion of G7 (B-D-F-G)

These inversions are mostly **voice-leading devices** — common in pop/rock to create smooth bass movement.

For example:
- Am/C → C is the 3rd of Am → smooth step from C (previous chord) down to C
- Em/B → B is the 5th of Em → creates a descending bass line: C → B → ...
- Dm/C → C is a **non-chord tone** in Dm, but serves as a lead-in to C
- G7/B → B is the 3rd of G7 → leads nicely to C (B→C)

So the inversions reinforce a **smooth descending bass line**:
> C → C → C (Am/C) → C (Em/B) → B → C (Dm/C) → C → C → C → C → B → C

Actually, let’s trace the **bass line** explicitly:

Chord | Bass note
------|----------
C     | **C**
C     | **C**
Am/C  | **C**
Am/C  | **C**
C     | **C**
C     | **C**
Em/B  | **B**
Dm/C  | **C**
C     | **C**
C     | **C**
Am/C  | **C**
Am/C  | **C**
C     | **C**
C     | **C**
G7/B  | **B**
C     | **C**

So the **bass line** is dominated by **C**, with occasional **B**.

This is a classic **C major** progression with subtle bass motion: the B in Em/B and G7/B creates a **leading tone** motion (B→C) that strongly confirms **C as the tonic**.

The mode: Since all chords are from the **C major scale** and the tonal center is clearly **C**, and no modal alterations (like flattened 3rd or 7th) are present — this is **C major (Ionian mode)**.

---

### Step 4: Confirm tonal center

- Every section begins and ends on C.
- G7 → C is a perfect authentic cadence (V7–I).
- Am and Em are relative minors, but they're used as chords within the major key (vi and iii), not as modal centers.
- No evidence of Aeolian (minor), Lydian, Mixolydian, etc.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: C major**  
> **Mode: Ionian**

This progression is a clean, diatonic C major progression with tasteful bass inversions for voice leading — common in pop, rock, and singer-songwriter styles.
