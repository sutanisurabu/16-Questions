### Reasoning

First, I need to determine the key and mode of this chord progression. The chords are: C, C, Am/C, Am/C, C, C, Em/B, Dm/C, C, C, Am/C, Am/C, C, C, G7/B, C.

I see that most of the chords are based on C, and there are chords like Am, Em, Dm, and G7. These are all diatonic chords in the key of C major. Let me list out the diatonic chords in C major:

- I: C

- ii: Dm

- iii: Em

- IV: F

- V: G

- vi: Am

- viiÂ°: Bdim

In this progression, I have C (I), Am (vi), Em (iii), Dm (ii), and G7 (V7). The G7 is a dominant seventh chord, which is common in major keys.

Now, looking at the progression, it starts and ends with C, and there are multiple C chords throughout. Also, the Am chords are written as Am/C, which means Am with a C bass note. Similarly, Em/B is Em with a B bass, and Dm/C is Dm with a C bass. G7/B is G7 with a B bass.

The bass notes seem to be emphasizing C in many places. Let me list the bass notes based on the chord notations:

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- Em/B: bass B

- Dm/C: bass C

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- G7/B: bass B

- C: bass C

So, the bass is mostly C, with two instances of B. The B bass notes come from Em/B and G7/B. Em/B is the iii chord with a B bass, which is the third of the Em chord, but in terms of scale, B is the seventh note in C major. G7/B is the V7 chord with a B bass, which is the third of the G7 chord.

Since the bass is consistently C except for two B's, and the chords are all from C major, it seems like the key is C major.

But let me check if there's any indication of mode. The progression doesn't have any F chord, which is the IV chord, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not C major. The presence of G7 confirms the dominant function, which is typical in major keys.

Also, Am is the relative minor, but here it's used in a way that the bass is C, so it might be functioning as a tonic prolongation or something.

The progression seems to be centered around C, and it ends with G7/B to C, which is a perfect cadence in C major.

Therefore, I think the key is C major.

But just to be thorough, let's consider if it could be C minor. In C minor, the chords would be different. For example, Am would not be diatonic in C minor; the vi chord in C minor would be Ab major. But here we have Am, which is from C major. Also, Em and Dm are from C major. G7 is also from C major. So, it's definitely C major.

Thus, the key is C major, and the mode is Ionian, but since it's major, we just say major.

So, for the answer, I should say key of C major.

The chord progression provided is primarily based on chords diatonic to the key of C major: C (I), Am (vi), Em (iii), Dm (ii), and G7 (V7). The consistent use of C as the bass note throughout most of the progression, along with the final cadence from G7/B to C (V7 to I), confirms the tonic center as C. Therefore, the key is C major.

The mode is Ionian, which is equivalent to the major scale. The progression does not exhibit any characteristics of minor or other modes, as all chords align with the C major scale.
