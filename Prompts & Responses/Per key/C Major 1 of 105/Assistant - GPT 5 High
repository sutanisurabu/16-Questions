### Reasoning

**Evaluating key and mode**

I’m analyzing a progression centered on C in the bass, noting a passing line of C-C-B. The mode might be Ionian, but could shift to Mixolydian if there was a Bb. However, there isn't one. The G7 chord fits into C major, so the key likely is C major with an Ionian mode. I could expect questions about "key and mode," especially in the context of Gregorian or modal music.**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking at a progression that includes Em and Dm, which fits nicely in C major without any accidentals. So, I’m concluding this is C major, with an Ionian mode, especially since the cadence uses G7/B leading back to C. I wonder about A minor too. In A minor, the G7 chord fits as a VII7, and Em/B becomes v6. Ultimately, though, I think we’re sticking with C major!**Determining key and tonal center**

I'm noticing many chords in A minor, but the typical dominant is E or E7 with G#. Since we only have Em/B, that feels less strong as a dominant in A natural minor. The bass is centered on C, not A, and the final cadence is G7/B to C, which suggests C as the tonic. So, I’m concluding this is definitely in C major, using the Ionian mode, with C as the tonal center and some interesting inversions in play!**Determining key and mode**

The question is about determining the key and mode, so I'll keep it concise. The key is C major, and the mode is Ionian. The reasoning includes diatonic chords to C major, with a cadence from V6/5 (G7/B) to I and a repeated C pedal, which has no accidentals involved. Roman numeral analysis shows C (I), Am/C (vi6), and Em/B (iii6). The Dm/C could be interpreted as a Dm chord over a C bass, creating an interesting sound!**Summarizing progression and mode**

I can concisely conclude that the progression is in C major, featuring a tonic pedal, and the mode is Ionian. If the question is hinting at modal mixture, we should clarify that it’s simply Ionian (major) as opposed to Mixolydian or Dorian. So, the succinct answer would be: C major (Ionian), accompanied by a one-sentence justification to make it clear and informative. That should cover it nicely!

Key: C major
Mode: Ionian

Reason: All chords are diatonic to C major, the bass centers on C (tonic pedal), and the cadence G7/B → C is a V6/5–I resolution in C major.
