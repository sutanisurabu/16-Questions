### Reasoning

1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to know the "key and mode" of a chord progression: `C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C`.

2.  **Initial Scan & Simplification:**
    *   First, I see a lot of repetitions. The core progression seems to be: `C - Am/C - C - Em/B - Dm/C - C - Am/C - C - G7/B - C`.
    *   I also see a lot of slash chords. Let's simplify them to understand the basic harmony.
        *   `C`: C major (C-E-G)
        *   `Am/C`: This is an A minor chord (A-C-E) with a C in the bass. The notes are C-A-C-E. The primary harmony is still A minor, but the bass note C is significant. It creates a specific voice-leading effect.
        *   `Em/B`: This is an E minor chord (E-G-B) with a B in the bass. The notes are B-E-G. This is a standard first inversion E minor chord.
        *   `Dm/C`: This is a D minor chord (D-F-A) with a C in the bass. The notes are C-D-F-A. This is a bit unusual. A Dm chord normally has D, F, A. Adding a C in the bass makes it function differently. It's often analyzed as a `Csus4(b9)` or a `Fmaj9/C` (F-A-C with D and E? No, that's not right). Let's stick with the notes: C-D-F-A. It has the notes of a Dm triad plus a C. It also contains the notes of an F major triad (F-A-C) with a D. The most common interpretation is a Dm with a non-chord tone (pedal point C) in the bass. The bass note C is a constant pedal point through a lot of this progression. Let's note that.
        *   `G7/B`: G dominant 7th (G-B-D-F) with B in the bass. Standard first inversion.

3.  **Identify the Tonal Center (Key):**
    *   The progression starts and ends on C.
    *   The most frequent chord is C.
    *   The bass note C is used as a pedal point for `Am/C` and `Dm/C`. This strongly suggests C is the tonal center.
    *   The final chord is `G7/B` resolving to `C`. This is a classic V-I cadence (G7 to C) in the key of C major, even though it's in first inversion. The V chord (G7) has a strong pull to the I chord (C).

    *Conclusion so far:* The key is very likely C major.

4.  **Analyze the Chords within the Key of C Major:**
    *   The diatonic chords in C major are:
        *   I: C major (C-E-G)
        *   ii: D minor (D-F-A)
        *   iii: E minor (E-G-B)
        *   IV: F major (F-A-C)
        *   V: G major (G-B-D)
        *   vi: A minor (A-C-E)
        *   viiÂ°: B diminished (B-D-F)

    *   Let's check the chords in the progression against this framework:
        *   `C`: I chord. Fits perfectly.
        *   `Am/C`: This is the vi chord (A minor) over the I chord's root. It's a very common device. The harmony is vi, but the bass is static on I.
        *   `Em/B`: This is the iii chord (E minor) in first inversion. Fits perfectly.
        *   `Dm/C`: This is the ii chord (D minor) over the I chord's root. Again, the harmony is diatonic (ii), but the bass is static on I.
        *   `G7/B`: This is the V7 chord (G7) in first inversion. Fits perfectly.

    *Conclusion reinforced:* All the harmonic functions are diatonic to the key of C major. The use of slash chords is a stylistic choice, creating a "pedal point" effect on the tonic (C), which grounds the entire progression.

5.  **Determine the Mode:**
    *   The major scale is the default (Ionian mode).
    *   To be in a different mode (like Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian), the progression would need to emphasize the characteristic intervals of that mode.
    *   For example, to be in A minor (Aeolian mode), the progression would need to feel "at home" on A, and would likely feature an E7 (V of Am) to resolve to Am. This progression does the opposite; it resolves strongly to C.
    *   The progression uses chords from C major and resolves to C. The overall sound is major, not minor. The `Am` and `Dm` chords provide a temporary minor feel, but they function as subdominant-type chords (vi and ii) within the major key, leading back to the tonic C.
    *   There's nothing in the progression to suggest a flattened 7th (which would point to Mixolydian), a raised 4th (Lydian), or a flattened 2nd (Phrygian).
    *   The progression is a textbook example of a song in the **Ionian mode** (which is just the major scale).

6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: Key is C Major, Mode is Ionian.
    *   Provide the reasoning.
    *   **Key:** Explain that C is the tonal center. Mention the start/end on C, the frequency of C, and most importantly, the V-I cadence (G7 to C).
    *   **Mode:** Explain that Ionian is the major mode. All the chords are diatonic to C major. The use of minor chords (Am, Dm, Em) is standard within a major key, functioning as the vi, ii, and iii chords respectively. They don't make the overall mode minor.
    *   **Analysis of the Slash Chords:** This is the most interesting part of the progression. Explain the concept of a "pedal point" or "static bass." The bass note C is held constant while the harmony changes above it (`Am/C`, `Dm/C`). This is a common technique to create harmonic interest while keeping the tonic firmly established. Mention the other slash chords (`Em/B`, `G7/B`) as standard inversions that create smooth basslines.
    *   **Breakdown:** Provide a chord-by-chord analysis to show how each one fits into the key of C major.
        *   `C`: I (Tonic)
        *   `Am/C`: vi (Submediant) over a C pedal point.
        *   `Em/B`: iii (Mediant) in first inversion.
        *   `Dm/C`: ii (Supertonic) over a C pedal point.
        *   `G7/B`: V7 (Dominant) in first inversion, leading to...
        *   `C`: I (Tonic)
    *   **Summary/Conclusion:** Reiterate that the progression is firmly in C major (Ionian mode), using diatonic chords and a C pedal point in the bass to create its specific harmonic color.

7.  **Final Review:** Read through the generated answer. Is it clear? Is it accurate? Does it directly answer the user's question while also providing valuable context? The answer looks solid. It explains not just *what* the key is, but *why*, and also deciphers the more complex slash chords.



Based on the chord progression provided, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **C Major**
*   **Mode:** **Ionian** (which is the standard major scale)

### Analysis and Reasoning

Here is a detailed breakdown of why this is a C major progression:

1.  **Tonal Center:** The progression starts and, most importantly, ends on a **C major** chord. This establishes C as the "home base" or tonic.

2.  **The Dominant-Tonic Cadence:** The second-to-last chord is **G7/B**, which is a G7 chord (the dominant) in first inversion. The G7 chord has a very strong tendency to resolve to the C chord (the tonic). This classic V-I relationship solidifies C major as the key. Even in first inversion, the pull to C is undeniable.

3.  **Diatonic Chords:** All the chords in the progression are built from the notes of the C major scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B). Let's look at each one's function in the key of C major:
    *   **C**: The **I chord** (tonic).
    *   **Am/C**: An A minor chord (**vi chord**) with a C in the bass. The harmony is vi, but the static C in the bass acts as a **pedal point**.
    *   **Em/B**: An E minor chord (**iii chord**) in first inversion.
    *   **Dm/C**: A D minor chord (**ii chord**) with a C in the bass. Again, this is the ii chord harmony over a C pedal point.
    *   **G7/B**: A G7 chord (**V7 chord** or dominant seventh) in first inversion.

4.  **Mode:** Since the progression is built from the major scale and revolves around the major tonic chord (C), it is in the **Ionian mode**. The presence of minor chords (Am, Dm, Em) is completely normal within a major key; they function as the subdominant and mediant chords (ii, iii, vi) and create harmonic interest but do not change the fundamental major feel.

### The Role of the Slash Chords

The most notable feature of this progression is the use of slash chords, specifically the C pedal point.

*   **Pedal Point:** By holding the bass note C while the harmony changes above it (`Am/C`, `Dm/C`), the composer creates a sense of stability while still allowing the harmony to move. It's a very common and effective technique in many genres, from classical to pop.
*   **Voice Leading:** The slash chords like `Em/B` and `G7/B` are used to create a smooth, flowing bassline that connects the chords together gracefully.

In summary, the progression is firmly in **C major**, using diatonic chords and a C pedal point to create its specific harmonic color.
