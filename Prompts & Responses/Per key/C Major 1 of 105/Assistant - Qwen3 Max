To determine the **key and mode** of the chord progression:

**C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C**

---

### Step 1: List the chords (ignoring bass notes for now)
- C  
- Am  
- Em  
- Dm  
- G7  

These are all **diatonic chords** in the key of **C major**:

| Chord | Quality | Scale degree in C major |
|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| C     | I       | Tonic                    |
| Dm    | ii      | Supertonic               |
| Em    | iii     | Mediant                  |
| Am    | vi      | Submediant               |
| G7    | V7      | Dominant (with 7th)      |

So far, **everything fits in C major**.

---

### Step 2: Consider the bass notes (slash chords)
- Am/C = Am with C in the bass → C is the **root of the key**, gives a stable sound
- Em/B = Em with B in the bass → B is the **leading tone** (7th scale degree), which strongly pulls to C
- Dm/C = Dm with C in the bass → C in the bass under Dm creates a **Cadd9** or **C6/9** sound (still consonant in C major)
- G7/B = G7 with B in the bass → B is the **3rd of G7**, and also the leading tone; smooth voice leading to C

These slash chords are used primarily for **smooth bass motion** or **color**, not to imply a new key.

---

### Step 3: Look at harmonic function
- The progression starts and ends on **C** (tonic)
- It uses **Am** (vi) and **Em** (iii) as tonic substitutes or for color
- **G7** (V7) appears near the end, creating a **dominant → tonic** resolution (G7 → C)
- **Dm** (ii) appears briefly, often part of a ii–V–I or used for modal interchange—but here it's over C bass, softening its function

This strongly supports **C major** as the tonal center.

---

### Step 4: Consider mode
- All chords are **diatonic to C major** (no flats or sharps outside the key)
- No use of characteristic modal chords (e.g., no B♭ for Mixolydian, no F# for Lydian, no E♭ for Dorian, etc.)
- Final cadence is **G7 → C**, a classic **authentic cadence** in **Ionian (major) mode**

Thus, the mode is **Ionian**, i.e., **major**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:
- **Key**: **C major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian (major)**

The progression is firmly rooted in **C major**, using diatonic chords and standard functional harmony, with added color from slash chords for smooth voice leading.
