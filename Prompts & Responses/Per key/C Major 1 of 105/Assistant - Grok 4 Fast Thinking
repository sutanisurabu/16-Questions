**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast Thinking**

### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Overall Key: **C Major**
- This progression is diatonic to the C major scale (C D E F G A B).
- No accidentals (sharps or flats) appear outside this scale, confirming the tonal center is C.
- The progression repeatedly resolves to C (the tonic), with supporting chords like Am (vi), Dm (ii), and Em (iii) that are all native to C major.
- The G7 (V7) chord functions as a strong dominant leading back to C, which is a classic cadential resolution in major keys.

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major)**
- The harmony aligns with the Ionian mode (the standard major scale mode), starting on C.
- No modal mixture (e.g., no borrowed chords like Eb major from C minor or flattened 7th for Mixolydian/Dorian). Everything is "bright" and major-key oriented.
- The Em and Dm chords add some minor flavor but remain within the major key structure, without shifting to a parallel minor mode (Aeolian).

#### Progression Breakdown
For clarity, here's the sequence with Roman numeral analysis (in C major) and notes on function:

1. **C** (I) - Tonic establishment.
2. **C** (I) - Reinforcement.
3. **Am/C** (vi⁶) - Subdominant minor with inverted bass (bass stays on C for smoothness).
4. **Am/C** (vi⁶) - Same, building tension.
5. **C** (I) - Return to tonic.
6. **C** (I) - Sustained tonic.
7. **Em/B** (iii⁶/⁵) - Relative minor, inverted (bass B creates a brief leading-tone pull toward C).
8. **Dm/C** (ii⁶) - Pre-dominant, inverted (bass C keeps continuity).
9. **C** (I) - Tonic resolution.
10. **C** (I) - Reinforcement.
11. **Am/C** (vi⁶) - Repeated subdominant section.
12. **Am/C** (vi⁶) - Builds anticipation.
13. **C** (C) - Tonic.
14. **C** (I) - Sustained.
15. **G7/B** (V7⁶/⁵) - Dominant with tritone tension, inverted (bass B leads strongly to C).
16. **C** (I) - Final resolution.

#### Additional Notes
- **Structure and Feel**: This has a repetitive, hymn-like or jazz-standard quality (e.g., reminiscent of tunes like "I Got Rhythm" variations or "All of Me" in C). The inversions (e.g., /C and /B bass) create smooth voice leading, keeping the root motion minimal and bass-centered on C/B for a grounded, pedal-point effect.
- **No Modal Ambiguity**: If this were in a minor key (e.g., C minor/Aeolian), we'd expect chords like Ab or Eb, which aren't present. The G7 confirms major-key dominant function.
- **Performance Tip**: Play with a steady quarter-note pulse; the inversions suggest a walking bass line emphasizing C and B.

If this is from a specific song or you have more context/melody, I can refine the analysis!
