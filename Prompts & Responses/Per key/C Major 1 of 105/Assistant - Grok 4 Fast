### Key: C Major  
### Mode: Ionian  

This progression uses only diatonic chords from the C major scale (C, Am, Em, Dm, G7), with no accidentals or borrowings that suggest a different mode (e.g., no flattened scale degrees for Aeolian or Dorian). The bass notes (primarily C and occasional B) reinforce a tonal center on C, typical of Ionian (major) harmony.
