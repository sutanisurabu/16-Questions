### Reasoning

Okay, let me tackle this key and mode determination problem. The chord progression given is: C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C. 

First, I need to write down all the chords clearly. Let me list them out with possible simplifications since some have slash notation. Slash chords indicate a different bass note, but sometimes the bass note might not change the fundamental chord quality significantly. Let me parse each chord:

- C (obviously C major)
- Am/C is A minor with C in the bass. But since C is the 5th of Am, this might function similarly to Am, just with a different inversion. So chord quality is still A minor.
- Em/B is E minor with B in the bass. B is the 5th of Em, so inversion, but chord is E minor.
- Dm/C is D minor with C in the bass. C is the 7th of Dm7, but here it's Dm/C, so maybe Dm with a C bass note. Not sure if it's implying Dm7 or just Dm. 
- G7/B is G7 with B in the bass. B is the 3rd of G7, so again inversion. Chord is G7.

So the progression without slash notes (focusing on root chords) would be: C, C, Am, Am, C, C, Em, Dm, C, C, Am, Am, C, C, G7, C.

Now, let's list all the unique chords: C major, A minor, E minor, D minor, G7.

This looks like a typical progression in C major. Let's check:

In C major key, the diatonic chords are:
I - C
ii - Dm
iii - Em
IV - F
V - G (or G7)
vi - Am
viiÂ° - Bdim

So the chords present here: C (I), Am (vi), Em (iii), Dm (ii), G7 (V7). All fit into C major. The progression heavily uses C, Am, Em, Dm, and ends with G7 leading back to C. The G7 is a dominant seventh chord, which is the V7 in C major, so it strongly suggests that C is the tonic. 

Wait, but the progression ends on C, after G7/B which is G7. So the last chord is C, so it's resolving from G7 to C, which is a perfect cadence (V7-I), confirming C as the tonic.

Now, checking for modal mixture or possible modes. The presence of only diatonic chords (no accidentals) points to Ionian mode (major scale). Let's count the frequency of each chord:

C appears 8 times (positions 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,16 â€“ wait, original sequence is: C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C. Let's count each:

1. C
2. C
3. Am/C
4. Am/C
5. C
6. C
7. Em/B
8. Dm/C
9. C
10. C
11. Am/C
12. Am/C
13. C
14. C
15. G7/B
16. C

So C: positions 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,16 â†’ 9 times
Am/C: 3,4,11,12 â†’ 4 times
Em/B:7 â†’1
Dm/C:8â†’1
G7/B:15â†’1

So the tonic chord C is by far the most frequent, which supports C as key center.

The progression has a I - vi - iii - ii - V7 - I structure in parts. For example, the last few chords before the final C are G7/B (V7) to C (I), which is a strong cadence. 

Another thing to check: are there any chords that suggest a different key? For instance, G7 is the dominant of C, so if the key were G major, G7 would be V7, but here the tonic seems to be C because the progression centers around C and ends on C after G7. 

Also, the chords Am, Dm, Em are all diatonic to C major. No unexpected chords (like F major is missing here, but its absence doesn't negate C major; many pop progressions omit IV). 

Possible modes: If it were Dorian, we'd expect a raised 6th, but all chords here fit C Ionian. A minor is the relative minor, but the tonic here is C, not Am, because the progression resolves to C and centers on it. The Am appears but not as the tonic (e.g., no E major as V in A minor; here we have G7 which is not V of A minor; V of A minor would be E or E7).

Wait, in A natural minor, the diatonic V chord is Em, not E major. So if this were in A minor, the progression would need to use E major (V) to have a leading tone, but here the chords include Em (which is diatonic to A natural minor but not the harmonic minor's E major). However, in this progression, the dominant function is served by G7 (which is V of C), not by any E-based chord. There's an Em/B in there, but Em is the iii chord in C major, not a dominant. The only dominant chord is G7, which points to C as tonic.

Therefore, key is C major (Ionian mode).

The chord progression provided is:  
**C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Simplify Slash Chords**:  
   - **Am/C** = A minor (root: A, bass note: C â†’ 1st inversion of Am)  
   - **Em/B** = E minor (root: E, bass note: B â†’ 1st inversion of Em)  
   - **Dm/C** = D minor (root: D, bass note: C â†’ 2nd inversion of Dm)  
   - **G7/B** = G dominant 7 (root: G, bass note: B â†’ 1st inversion of G7)  

   The **core diatonic chords** are: **C, Am, Em, Dm, G7**.

2. **Identify Key Center**:  
   - All chords fit **C major (Ionian mode)**:  
     - **C (I)**  
     - **Am (vi)**  
     - **Em (iii)**  
     - **Dm (ii)**  
     - **G7 (V7)** (dominant 7th chord, strongly pulling to C).  
   - The progression **centers on C** as the tonic:  
     - C appears **9 times** (the most frequent chord).  
     - Ends with **G7 â†’ C** (a perfect cadence: V7-I), confirming C as the tonic.  
   - No chromatic/non-diatonic chords (e.g., no F# for G major, no E major for A minor).  

3. **Rule Out Other Keys/Modes**:  
   - **A natural minor?**  
     - The relative minor of C major, but:  
       - The progression **does not resolve to Am** (it ends on C).  
       - **G7** is **not diatonic** to A natural minor (A minorâ€™s V chord is Em, not G7).  
       - G7 functions as V7 of **C**, not Am.  
   - **Dorian/Aeolian/etc.?**  
     - No raised 6th (Dorian) or other modal alterations.  
     - All chords are strictly **C major diatonic**.  

4. **Mode Confirmation**:  
   - The progressionâ€™s strong **I-IV-V7-I** cadential motion (e.g., **G7 â†’ C**) and diatonic harmony confirm **Ionian mode (major scale)**.  
   - No modal mixture or borrowed chords (e.g., no F major, but its absence is common in pop/rock progressions).

### Final Answer:  
**Key: C Major**  
**Mode: Ionian**  

#### Why?  
- Tonic chord **C** is the gravitational center.  
- **G7** (V7) resolves to **C** (I), defining a major key.  
- All chords fit the **C major scale** (C D E F G A B).  
- No evidence of modal interchange or alternative tonal centers. ðŸŽµ
