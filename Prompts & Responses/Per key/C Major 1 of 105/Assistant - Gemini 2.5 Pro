### Reasoning

**Defining Chord Progressions**

I'm currently focused on the user's chord progression and how it can be defined in terms of its key and mode. I've begun to analyze each chord, noting its root and any inversions. I'm moving toward identifying the key center, which is the most stable chord of the progression. From there, I'll identify the relative major/minor.


**Interpreting Chord Structures**

I've examined the chord roots and their qualities, like major and minor, and now I'm shifting to a diatonic analysis, assessing how these chords align with potential key signatures. I'm focusing on the C major scale, seeing how the chords fit into that scale. I've noted matches and am about to determine the key.


**Identifying the Tonic and Key**

I've examined the chord functions in C major and assessed the progression's structure. The sequence starts and ends on C, reinforcing its role as the tonic. I'm focusing on the harmonic rhythm and the cadences to refine my understanding. The use of G7 as a V7 chord is key to defining the cadence, and I'm analyzing the movement from the V7 to the I.


**Assessing Diatonic Harmony**

I'm now methodically analyzing the chord progression, listing roots and qualities. I've successfully mapped the chords to the C major scale, noting the presence of I, ii, iii, vi, and V7 chords. I'm focusing on the G7 to C resolution for the authentic cadence, seeing how the bassline enhances the movement.


**Identifying Diatonic Relationships**

I'm presently building the diatonic chords, examining how each chord in the progression aligns within the C major scale, like constructing the triads and sevenths for C major. I'm noting the function of each chord, using Roman numerals, to pinpoint the role of each chord within the tonality, focusing on the cadence.


**Decoding the Progression's Key**

I'm starting a detailed analysis, examining the progression's chord structures. I've noted the chords fit a C Major scale, and I'm assessing the role of each chord with Roman numerals. The final G7/B to C cadence is critical for determining the key's strength, which is the cornerstone of this process.




Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **C Major**.

Here's a breakdown of the evidence:

### 1. The Tonic Chord (Home Base)
The progression begins and, most importantly, ends on a **C Major** chord. This strongly establishes C as the tonic, or the musical "home."

### 2. Diatonic Chords
All the chords in the progression belong naturally to the key of C Major. Let's look at their function using Roman numerals:

*   **C Major Scale:** C - D - E - F - G - A - B
*   **Chords in the Key of C Major:**
    *   **C** is the **I** chord (the tonic).
    *   **Dm** is the **ii** chord (the supertonic).
    *   **Em** is the **iii** chord (the mediant).
    *   **Am** is the **vi** chord (the submediant).
    *   **G7** is the **V7** chord (the dominant seventh).

### 3. The Dominant-Tonic Relationship
The most conclusive piece of evidence is the **G7/B to C** movement at the end.

*   **G7** is the dominant (V) chord of C. The function of the dominant chord is to create tension that resolves strongly back to the tonic (I).
*   The `G7 -> C` move is called an **authentic cadence**, which is the most powerful way to confirm a key. The bass note moving from B to C (`G7/B -> C`) makes this resolution even smoother and more definitive.

### 4. Mode
Since the tonic chord (C) is a **major chord**, the mode is **Major**. If the progression had resolved to Am (the relative minor), the mode would be minor. However, all signs point to C as the tonal center.

### Summary:

*   **Key:** **C**
*   **Mode:** **Major**
