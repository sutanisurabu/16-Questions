### Reasoning

**Evaluating key and mode**

I’m analyzing a progression centered on C in the bass, noting a passing line of C-C-B. The mode might be Ionian, but could shift to Mixolydian if there was a Bb. However, there isn't one. The G7 chord fits into C major, so the key likely is C major with an Ionian mode. I could expect questions about "key and mode," especially in the context of Gregorian or modal music.**Analyzing chord progression**

I’m looking at a progression that includes Em and Dm, which fits nicely in C major without any accidentals. So, I’m concluding this is C major, with an Ionian mode, especially since the cadence uses G7/B leading back to C. I wonder about A minor too. In A minor, the G7 chord fits as a VII7, and Em/B becomes v6. Ultimately, though, I think we’re sticking with C major!**Determining key and tonal center**

I'm noticing many chords in A minor, but the typical dominant is E or E7 with G#. Since we only have Em/B, that feels less strong as a dominant in A natural minor. The bass is centered on C, not A, and the final cadence is G7/B to C, which suggests C as the tonic. So, I’m concluding this is definitely in C major, using the Ionian mode, with C as the tonal center and some interesting inversions in play!**Determining key and mode**

The question is about determining the key and mode, so I'll keep it concise. The key is C major, and the mode is Ionian. The reasoning includes diatonic chords to C major, with a cadence from V6/5 (G7/B) to I and a repeated C pedal, which has no accidentals involved. Roman numeral analysis shows C (I), Am/C (vi6), and Em/B (iii6). The Dm/C could be interpreted as a Dm chord over a C bass, creating an interesting sound!**Summarizing progression and mode**

I can concisely conclude that the progression is in C major, featuring a tonic pedal, and the mode is Ionian. If the question is hinting at modal mixture, we should clarify that it’s simply Ionian (major) as opposed to Mixolydian or Dorian. So, the succinct answer would be: C major (Ionian), accompanied by a one-sentence justification to make it clear and informative. That should cover it nicely!

Key: C major
Mode: Ionian

Reason: All chords are diatonic to C major, the bass centers on C (tonic pedal), and the cadence G7/B → C is a V6/5–I resolution in C major.

### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to analyze the chord progression: "C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C." These are slash chords, indicating bass notes like C major and A minor over C. Em/B represents E minor over B, Dm/C is D minor over C, and G7/B is G dominant 7 over B. It looks like it's in C major (Ionian). The diatonic chords are C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, and present chords suggest C major and A minor over C.**Analyzing chord inversions**

I’m looking at the chord Am/C, which is an A minor triad in first inversion since C is the bass note. That makes it vi6. Em/B is another first inversion for E minor over B, also iii6. Then I have Dm/C, which is a D minor triad over C. But is it a Dm7? Dm7 includes a C, making it a third inversion. However, Dm/C suggests it’s just a D minor triad over C. The notes D, F, and A imply a C6add9. But for a C6sus2, I would need the C in the chord too.**Examining chord structure**

The slash indicates that I have Dm triad notes over C bass, making it a Dm7/C, essentially a Dm7 with C as the bass note. The chord tones are D, F, A, C, verifying it as a third inversion Dm7/C. My progression features inversions like I, vi6, iii6, and ii7. G7/B is a G7 in first inversion with B in the bass, leading back to C. This feels classic for C major, but I wonder if someone might perceive it as C Lydian, given the B bass notes and static C pedal.**Confirming key and mode**

I’ve determined that there’s no F# present in the chords, which are all diatonic to C major. So it seems like I'm in the Ionian mode. I should check for any non-diatonic degrees; G7 features an F natural, so it fits. Thus, the key is C major with mode Ionian. If someone asks for the key and mode, I’d say "C major, Ionian." The bassline functions through I, vi6, iii6, and ii7. G7/B is V6/5 in C major, while Em/B is iii6 and Am/C is vi6. So, overall: Key: C major, Mode: Ionian.**Summarizing key and progression**

I’m analyzing the chord progression based on C major and the cadence V6/5-I. The frequent use of slash chords shows inversions and a C pedal. It's important to note that if someone thought of this as being in C mixolydian, it doesn't work since there’s no Bb present. I’ve decided to keep things simple. 

The key is C major (Ionian). The Roman numerals would be: I – I – vi6 – vi6 – I – I – iii6 – ii4/2 – I – I – vi6 – vi6 – I – I – V6/5 – I. In summary, Dm/C implies a seventh, making it functionally ii4/2.

Key: C major
Mode: Ionian (C Ionian)

All chords are diatonic to C major, mostly over a C pedal, with a V7 (G7/B) resolving to I. Roman numerals: I – I – vi6 – vi6 – I – I – iii6 – ii4/2 – I – I – vi6 – vi6 – I – I – V6/5 – I.

### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to determine the key and mode based on the chord progression with slash bass notes: C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C. It looks like we’re in the key of C major, as most of the chords are centered around C. The presence of G7 suggests a dominant chord leading to the tonic. The mode is likely Ionian, which is the major mode. So, definitely C major, mode Ionian!**Analyzing slash chords and bass lines**

I see that slash chords with non-root bass might imply inversions, creating a stepwise bass line. For example, C (C bass), Am/C (C bass), Em/B (B in bass), Dm/C (C bass), and G7/B (B bass). The bass alternates between C and B, which is fine. I’m determining the key and mode: it’s C major, Ionian. Am/C is actually a first inversion of Am, and Dm/C suggests a different function, maybe as a quartal structure. It’s all about understanding how the harmony connects!**Summarizing key and mode**

I’ve been working through the progression, noting that D-F-A over C creates a Csus2(add4/6. It’s diatonic and could interpret as IV/V, but that’s not necessary. The G7/B is a first inversion of V7 that resolves strongly to C, confirming we're in C major and mode is Ionian. 

So, to sum it up:  
- Key: C major  
- Mode: Ionian  
- Reason: Diatonic chords to C major; the cadential V7/B resolves to I, with a strong emphasis on the tonic C.**Adding bass line commentary**

I should add a comment about the optional bass line, noting that alternating between C and B creates a smooth, stepwise motion underneath the inversions. This enhances the harmonic progression without overwhelming the reader with formatting. Keeping it simple but effective is key. I think a bullet list could work well here for clarity. Alright, I’m ready to deliver this information concisely and effectively!

- Key: C major
- Mode: Ionian (C Ionian)

Reason: The progression is overwhelmingly centered on C and ends on C. All chords are diatonic to C major, and the presence of G7/B (V7 in first inversion) resolving to C confirms the C major (Ionian) tonality. The slash chords mostly create smooth bass motion (C–B–C) via first inversions (Am/C, Em/B, G7/B).

### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Overall Key: **C Major**
- This progression is diatonic to the C major scale (C D E F G A B).
- No accidentals (sharps or flats) appear outside this scale, confirming the tonal center is C.
- The progression repeatedly resolves to C (the tonic), with supporting chords like Am (vi), Dm (ii), and Em (iii) that are all native to C major.
- The G7 (V7) chord functions as a strong dominant leading back to C, which is a classic cadential resolution in major keys.

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major)**
- The harmony aligns with the Ionian mode (the standard major scale mode), starting on C.
- No modal mixture (e.g., no borrowed chords like Eb major from C minor or flattened 7th for Mixolydian/Dorian). Everything is "bright" and major-key oriented.
- The Em and Dm chords add some minor flavor but remain within the major key structure, without shifting to a parallel minor mode (Aeolian).

#### Progression Breakdown
For clarity, here's the sequence with Roman numeral analysis (in C major) and notes on function:

1. **C** (I) - Tonic establishment.
2. **C** (I) - Reinforcement.
3. **Am/C** (vi⁶) - Subdominant minor with inverted bass (bass stays on C for smoothness).
4. **Am/C** (vi⁶) - Same, building tension.
5. **C** (I) - Return to tonic.
6. **C** (I) - Sustained tonic.
7. **Em/B** (iii⁶/⁵) - Relative minor, inverted (bass B creates a brief leading-tone pull toward C).
8. **Dm/C** (ii⁶) - Pre-dominant, inverted (bass C keeps continuity).
9. **C** (I) - Tonic resolution.
10. **C** (I) - Reinforcement.
11. **Am/C** (vi⁶) - Repeated subdominant section.
12. **Am/C** (vi⁶) - Builds anticipation.
13. **C** (C) - Tonic.
14. **C** (I) - Sustained.
15. **G7/B** (V7⁶/⁵) - Dominant with tritone tension, inverted (bass B leads strongly to C).
16. **C** (I) - Final resolution.

#### Additional Notes
- **Structure and Feel**: This has a repetitive, hymn-like or jazz-standard quality (e.g., reminiscent of tunes like "I Got Rhythm" variations or "All of Me" in C). The inversions (e.g., /C and /B bass) create smooth voice leading, keeping the root motion minimal and bass-centered on C/B for a grounded, pedal-point effect.
- **No Modal Ambiguity**: If this were in a minor key (e.g., C minor/Aeolian), we'd expect chords like Ab or Eb, which aren't present. The G7 confirms major-key dominant function.
- **Performance Tip**: Play with a steady quarter-note pulse; the inversions suggest a walking bass line emphasizing C and B.

If this is from a specific song or you have more context/melody, I can refine the analysis!

### Key: C Major  
### Mode: Ionian  

This progression uses only diatonic chords from the C major scale (C, Am, Em, Dm, G7), with no accidentals or borrowings that suggest a different mode (e.g., no flattened scale degrees for Aeolian or Dorian). The bass notes (primarily C and occasional B) reinforce a tonal center on C, typical of Ionian (major) harmony.

### Reasoning

**Defining Chord Progressions**

I'm currently focused on the user's chord progression and how it can be defined in terms of its key and mode. I've begun to analyze each chord, noting its root and any inversions. I'm moving toward identifying the key center, which is the most stable chord of the progression. From there, I'll identify the relative major/minor.


**Interpreting Chord Structures**

I've examined the chord roots and their qualities, like major and minor, and now I'm shifting to a diatonic analysis, assessing how these chords align with potential key signatures. I'm focusing on the C major scale, seeing how the chords fit into that scale. I've noted matches and am about to determine the key.


**Identifying the Tonic and Key**

I've examined the chord functions in C major and assessed the progression's structure. The sequence starts and ends on C, reinforcing its role as the tonic. I'm focusing on the harmonic rhythm and the cadences to refine my understanding. The use of G7 as a V7 chord is key to defining the cadence, and I'm analyzing the movement from the V7 to the I.


**Assessing Diatonic Harmony**

I'm now methodically analyzing the chord progression, listing roots and qualities. I've successfully mapped the chords to the C major scale, noting the presence of I, ii, iii, vi, and V7 chords. I'm focusing on the G7 to C resolution for the authentic cadence, seeing how the bassline enhances the movement.


**Identifying Diatonic Relationships**

I'm presently building the diatonic chords, examining how each chord in the progression aligns within the C major scale, like constructing the triads and sevenths for C major. I'm noting the function of each chord, using Roman numerals, to pinpoint the role of each chord within the tonality, focusing on the cadence.


**Decoding the Progression's Key**

I'm starting a detailed analysis, examining the progression's chord structures. I've noted the chords fit a C Major scale, and I'm assessing the role of each chord with Roman numerals. The final G7/B to C cadence is critical for determining the key's strength, which is the cornerstone of this process.




Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **C Major**.

Here's a breakdown of the evidence:

### 1. The Tonic Chord (Home Base)
The progression begins and, most importantly, ends on a **C Major** chord. This strongly establishes C as the tonic, or the musical "home."

### 2. Diatonic Chords
All the chords in the progression belong naturally to the key of C Major. Let's look at their function using Roman numerals:

*   **C Major Scale:** C - D - E - F - G - A - B
*   **Chords in the Key of C Major:**
    *   **C** is the **I** chord (the tonic).
    *   **Dm** is the **ii** chord (the supertonic).
    *   **Em** is the **iii** chord (the mediant).
    *   **Am** is the **vi** chord (the submediant).
    *   **G7** is the **V7** chord (the dominant seventh).

### 3. The Dominant-Tonic Relationship
The most conclusive piece of evidence is the **G7/B to C** movement at the end.

*   **G7** is the dominant (V) chord of C. The function of the dominant chord is to create tension that resolves strongly back to the tonic (I).
*   The `G7 -> C` move is called an **authentic cadence**, which is the most powerful way to confirm a key. The bass note moving from B to C (`G7/B -> C`) makes this resolution even smoother and more definitive.

### 4. Mode
Since the tonic chord (C) is a **major chord**, the mode is **Major**. If the progression had resolved to Am (the relative minor), the mode would be minor. However, all signs point to C as the tonal center.

### Summary:

*   **Key:** **C**
*   **Mode:** **Major**

### Reasoning

Okay, let me tackle this key and mode determination problem. The chord progression given is: C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C. 

First, I need to write down all the chords clearly. Let me list them out with possible simplifications since some have slash notation. Slash chords indicate a different bass note, but sometimes the bass note might not change the fundamental chord quality significantly. Let me parse each chord:

- C (obviously C major)
- Am/C is A minor with C in the bass. But since C is the 5th of Am, this might function similarly to Am, just with a different inversion. So chord quality is still A minor.
- Em/B is E minor with B in the bass. B is the 5th of Em, so inversion, but chord is E minor.
- Dm/C is D minor with C in the bass. C is the 7th of Dm7, but here it's Dm/C, so maybe Dm with a C bass note. Not sure if it's implying Dm7 or just Dm. 
- G7/B is G7 with B in the bass. B is the 3rd of G7, so again inversion. Chord is G7.

So the progression without slash notes (focusing on root chords) would be: C, C, Am, Am, C, C, Em, Dm, C, C, Am, Am, C, C, G7, C.

Now, let's list all the unique chords: C major, A minor, E minor, D minor, G7.

This looks like a typical progression in C major. Let's check:

In C major key, the diatonic chords are:
I - C
ii - Dm
iii - Em
IV - F
V - G (or G7)
vi - Am
vii° - Bdim

So the chords present here: C (I), Am (vi), Em (iii), Dm (ii), G7 (V7). All fit into C major. The progression heavily uses C, Am, Em, Dm, and ends with G7 leading back to C. The G7 is a dominant seventh chord, which is the V7 in C major, so it strongly suggests that C is the tonic. 

Wait, but the progression ends on C, after G7/B which is G7. So the last chord is C, so it's resolving from G7 to C, which is a perfect cadence (V7-I), confirming C as the tonic.

Now, checking for modal mixture or possible modes. The presence of only diatonic chords (no accidentals) points to Ionian mode (major scale). Let's count the frequency of each chord:

C appears 8 times (positions 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,16 – wait, original sequence is: C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C. Let's count each:

1. C
2. C
3. Am/C
4. Am/C
5. C
6. C
7. Em/B
8. Dm/C
9. C
10. C
11. Am/C
12. Am/C
13. C
14. C
15. G7/B
16. C

So C: positions 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,16 → 9 times
Am/C: 3,4,11,12 → 4 times
Em/B:7 →1
Dm/C:8→1
G7/B:15→1

So the tonic chord C is by far the most frequent, which supports C as key center.

The progression has a I - vi - iii - ii - V7 - I structure in parts. For example, the last few chords before the final C are G7/B (V7) to C (I), which is a strong cadence. 

Another thing to check: are there any chords that suggest a different key? For instance, G7 is the dominant of C, so if the key were G major, G7 would be V7, but here the tonic seems to be C because the progression centers around C and ends on C after G7. 

Also, the chords Am, Dm, Em are all diatonic to C major. No unexpected chords (like F major is missing here, but its absence doesn't negate C major; many pop progressions omit IV). 

Possible modes: If it were Dorian, we'd expect a raised 6th, but all chords here fit C Ionian. A minor is the relative minor, but the tonic here is C, not Am, because the progression resolves to C and centers on it. The Am appears but not as the tonic (e.g., no E major as V in A minor; here we have G7 which is not V of A minor; V of A minor would be E or E7).

Wait, in A natural minor, the diatonic V chord is Em, not E major. So if this were in A minor, the progression would need to use E major (V) to have a leading tone, but here the chords include Em (which is diatonic to A natural minor but not the harmonic minor's E major). However, in this progression, the dominant function is served by G7 (which is V of C), not by any E-based chord. There's an Em/B in there, but Em is the iii chord in C major, not a dominant. The only dominant chord is G7, which points to C as tonic.

Therefore, key is C major (Ionian mode).

The chord progression provided is:  
**C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Simplify Slash Chords**:  
   - **Am/C** = A minor (root: A, bass note: C → 1st inversion of Am)  
   - **Em/B** = E minor (root: E, bass note: B → 1st inversion of Em)  
   - **Dm/C** = D minor (root: D, bass note: C → 2nd inversion of Dm)  
   - **G7/B** = G dominant 7 (root: G, bass note: B → 1st inversion of G7)  

   The **core diatonic chords** are: **C, Am, Em, Dm, G7**.

2. **Identify Key Center**:  
   - All chords fit **C major (Ionian mode)**:  
     - **C (I)**  
     - **Am (vi)**  
     - **Em (iii)**  
     - **Dm (ii)**  
     - **G7 (V7)** (dominant 7th chord, strongly pulling to C).  
   - The progression **centers on C** as the tonic:  
     - C appears **9 times** (the most frequent chord).  
     - Ends with **G7 → C** (a perfect cadence: V7-I), confirming C as the tonic.  
   - No chromatic/non-diatonic chords (e.g., no F# for G major, no E major for A minor).  

3. **Rule Out Other Keys/Modes**:  
   - **A natural minor?**  
     - The relative minor of C major, but:  
       - The progression **does not resolve to Am** (it ends on C).  
       - **G7** is **not diatonic** to A natural minor (A minor’s V chord is Em, not G7).  
       - G7 functions as V7 of **C**, not Am.  
   - **Dorian/Aeolian/etc.?**  
     - No raised 6th (Dorian) or other modal alterations.  
     - All chords are strictly **C major diatonic**.  

4. **Mode Confirmation**:  
   - The progression’s strong **I-IV-V7-I** cadential motion (e.g., **G7 → C**) and diatonic harmony confirm **Ionian mode (major scale)**.  
   - No modal mixture or borrowed chords (e.g., no F major, but its absence is common in pop/rock progressions).  

---

### Final Answer:  
**Key: C Major**  
**Mode: Ionian**  

#### Why?  
- Tonic chord **C** is the gravitational center.  
- **G7** (V7) resolves to **C** (I), defining a major key.  
- All chords fit the **C major scale** (C D E F G A B).  
- No evidence of modal interchange or alternative tonal centers. 🎵

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the given chord progression to determine the **key** and possible **mode**:

### Chord progression:
```
C   C   Am/C   Am/C   C   C   Em/B
Dm/C   C   C   Am/C   Am/C   C   C   G7/B   C
```

First, simplify the chords by considering the **bass note** and identifying each chord:

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords

We need to interpret slashes like **Am/C**, **Em/B**, **Dm/C**, and **G7/B**:

- **Am/C**: A minor with C in the bass → **C-E-G** → This is **C major 6th** (C6), since C-E-G-A is C6. So Am/C ≈ **C6** or functionally **C major with an added 6th**. But harmonically, it's still rooted in **C major** or **A minor**.
- **Em/B**: E minor with B in the bass → **B-D-E-G** → This is like a **Bm7♭5 (half-diminished)** without the 7th (B-D-F-G), but E minor over B is **Bm7♭5 (B half-diminished)** if extended. Actually, E minor over B: B-D-E-G → B D E G → intervals: B to D (m3), D to E (M2), E to G (m3). So it's **B-D-F-G** would be Bm7♭5, but here it's **B-D-E-G** — that's not a standard 7th chord. Wait: Em is E-G-B, so Em/B is B-D-E-G → notes: **B, D, E, G**. That's **Bm7♭5 (B half-diminished)** missing the **F**? No — Em has **G**, not **F**.

Wait: Em is **E-G-B**, so Em/B = **B, E, G, B** → bass is B, with E, G, B. Notes: **B, E, G, B** → B-D-E-G missing D? No: Em is E, G, B, so Em/B = **B, E, G, B** → that’s **B, E, G**. So the notes are **B, E, G**. That’s **B diminished** (B-D-F), but we have **B, E, G** → B to E is a **perfect 4th**, E to G is **minor 3rd**. Not a standard triad. Actually, **B-E-G** is the second inversion of **Em**, so it's just **Em** chord with **B in the bass** — functionally **Em**, but bass emphasizes the 5th.

Similarly:
- **Dm/C** = Dm (D-F-A) over C → **C, D, F, A** → C major 9th **without the third and 7th**? Not quite. C-D-F-A → that’s like **C9 sus4** or **Cadd9 (no 3rd)**. But Dm/C = **C-D-F-A** → it emphasizes a **Dorian** flavor or a **Cadd9**.
- **G7/B** = G7 with B in bass → G7 = G-B-D-F, so G7/B = **B, D, F, G** → B-D-F-G → that’s **Bm7♭5 (B half-diminished)**, a common **vii°7** in C major.

So, let’s re-interpret all chords in terms of root and function:

| Chord     | Notes             | Interpretation                         |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| C         | C-E-G             | Tonic (I)                              |
| Am/C      | C-E-G-A           | C6 (I6) or Am in first inversion         |
| Em/B      | B-D-E-G? Wait — Em is E-G-B, so Em/B = B, E, G → notes: B, E, G → not a full 7th. |
Wait: Let's fix this.

### Clarify slash chords:

- **Am/C**: A minor triad (A-C-E) over C bass → **C-A-C-E** → notes: **C, A, E** → **C major 6th (C6)** chord. Functionally, this is **C6**, which is a **C major** chord with an added 6th. So it's still tonic harmony.
- **Em/B**: E minor (E-G-B) over B bass → **B-E-G-B** → notes: **B, E, G**. B to E is a P4, E to G is m3. This is **Em/B**, a voicing, but the chord is still **Em**, just with B (the 5th) in bass. Harmonically, it's **Em (ii chord in C major)**.
- **Dm/C**: D minor (D-F-A) over C → **C-D-F-A** → notes: C, D, F, A → this is **Cadd9**, again a tonic variant.
- **G7/B**: G7 (G-B-D-F) over B → **B, G, B, D, F** → notes: **B, D, F, G** → that’s **Bm7♭5** (B-D-F-G), which is the **vii°7** chord in C major.

So all the slash chords are just inversions or extensions of diatonic chords in **C major**.

---

### Simplified Chord Progression:

Let’s rewrite the progression replacing slash chords with their harmonic function in C major:

```
C     → I
C     → I
Am/C → C6 (I6) or just C with A → still tonic
Am/C → same
C     → I
C     → I
Em/B → Em in first inversion → ii (but Em is iii in C major!)
Wait! In C major: chords are:

C (I), Dm (ii), Em (iii), F (IV), G (V), Am (vi), Bdim (vii°)

So:
- Em is **iii**
- Dm is **ii**
- G7 is **V7**
```

So let's map:

```
C       → I
C       → I
Am/C    → vi chord over C bass → Am is vi, so vi/C → but functionally, still **vi** with pedal tone
Am/C    → same
C       → I
C       → I
Em/B    → iii/B → B is the 5th of Em, so Em chord, bass on 5th → still **iii**
Dm/C    → ii/C → Dm chord over C bass → **ii** with pedal
C       → I
C       → I
Am/C    → vi
Am/C    → vi
C       → I
C       → I
G7/B    → V7/iii? No → G7 is **V7**, B in bass → **V7**
C       → I
```

Wait — G7 is **dominant of C**, so **V7**, not V7/iii.

So the full progression:

```
C – C – Am/C – Am/C – C – C – Em/B – Dm/C – C – C – Am/C – Am/C – C – C – G7/B – C
```

Grouped:

Bars (say, 4/4) – likely 2 beats per chord?

Let’s assume 2-chord per bar (16 chords = 8 bars).

Progression:
1. C     C     | Am/C  Am/C  |
2. C     C     | Em/B  Dm/C  |
3. C     C     | Am/C  Am/C  |
4. C     C     | G7/B  C     |

Now, analyze harmonic function in **C major**:

- C (I)
- Am/C → vi over C → could be **vi**, but with pedal C, might sound like **C6** → tonic
- Em → iii
- Dm → ii
- G7 → V7
- C → I

So the **underlying harmonic movement**:
I – vi – I – iii – ii – V7 – I

That’s a very common progression in **C major**.

In fact:
**I – vi – I – iii – ii – V – I** is a classic “pop” or jazz sequence.

Example: “Heart and Soul”, “Blue Moon”, etc.

Also, **ii – V – I** is a standard cadence.

Here, before the final cadence, we have:
C – C – Am/C – Am/C → I – I – vi – vi  
C – C – Em/B → I – I – iii  
Dm/C → ii  
C – C – Am/C – Am/C → I – I – vi – vi  
C – C – G7/B – C → I – I – V7 – I

So the overall structure moves from I to vi to iii to ii to V to I.

All chords are **diatonic to C major**:
- C (I)
- Dm (ii)
- Em (iii)
- Am (vi)
- G7 (V7) — G7 is dominant, diatonic to C major

No accidentals. All chords use only white keys.

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: **C major**
- **Mode**: The progression uses chords from the **Ionian mode** (major scale). There is no modal mixture or characteristic modal movement (like avoiding the leading tone, or emphasizing the 6th or 7th).

G7 contains **B natural**, the leading tone, which strongly points to **tonic C**. This is characteristic of **major key** tonality, not Dorian or Mixolydian.

For example:
- If it were **C Mixolydian**, we’d expect G major, not G7 (G7 has F, which is ♭7 — wait, no: G7 is G-B-D-F → F is ♭7 of G, but in C, F is just the 4th). G7 is perfectly diatonic to C major.

No chords suggest another mode.

The repeated use of **C** as pedal or tonic, and the **ii–V–I** cadence, confirms a **tonic center on C**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **Key**: **C major**
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (the natural major mode)

This progression is firmly in **C major (Ionian mode)**.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B Thinking**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at the chords used. The chords listed are C, Am/C, Em/B, Dm/C, and G7/B. Wait, actually, some of these are chord symbols with bass notes. Like Am/C means an A minor chord with C in the bass. Similarly, Am/C is just A minor with C as the bass note. So the actual chords are:

- C (probably C major, root position)
- Am (A minor) but with C in the bass, so it's still A minor
- Em/B - E minor with B in bass
- Dm/C - D minor with C in bass
- G7/B - G7 chord with B in bass

So let's list all the actual chords without the slash:

- C major
- A minor
- E minor
- D minor
- G7

The chord progression has multiple repetitions. Let me map out the progression step by step.

The sequence is:

C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C

So translating the slashes:

- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Am/C (A minor chord with C in bass, so A minor)
- Am/C (same)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Em/B (E minor with B bass)
- Dm/C (D minor with C bass)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Am/C (A minor)
- Am/C (A minor)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- G7/B (G7 with B bass)
- C (C major)

Now, what are the actual chords here? When we have slash chords like Am/C, it's still an A minor chord, but the bass note is C. That means it's the first inversion of A minor. Similarly, Em/B is first inversion of E minor (since E minor is E-G-B; B is the fifth, so it's second inversion? Wait no: E minor chord has notes E, G, B. If B is in the bass, that's E-B-G, which is actually the third inversion? Wait, no. Let's see:

For a triad, the inversions are:

- Root position: root as bass (e.g., E minor: E, G, B)
- First inversion: third in bass (G, B, E)
- Second inversion: fifth in bass (B, E, G)

Yes. So for E minor chord, if the bass is B, which is the fifth of E minor, that's second inversion. Similarly, Dm/C: D minor chord has D, F, A. If bass is C, then it's Dm/C which is not a standard inversion because C isn't part of the chord. Oh wait, D minor chord is D-F-A. So if the bass is C, which is not in the chord, then this is actually a different chord? Wait, maybe Dm/C means a D minor chord with C in the bass. But C isn't part of D minor, so that would be a different chord. Wait, but typically, slash chords indicate the bass note regardless, so the chord would be D minor with C bass. So perhaps it's a D minor 7th? Or maybe it's just a D minor triad but with C as the bass note. But that would mean the chord is D minor with C in the bass, which is unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a C9 or something else? Wait, but usually slash chords just denote the bass note. So Dm/C means D minor triad with C in the bass. So the notes would be C, D, F, A. Wait, but D minor chord is D, F, A. Adding a C in the bass, so the notes are C, D, F, A. That would actually be a C major 7th? Wait, C major 7th is C, E, G, B. Wait, no. If the bass is C, and the upper structure is D minor, then the notes are C, D, F, A. But that's a chord which includes C, D, F, A. That's actually a Cmaj7 with no 5th? Or maybe a D minor 7th? Wait D minor 7th is D, F, A, C. So if the bass is C, then that's Dm7 with C in the bass, which is actually a C9 chord? Wait, no. Dm7 chord is D-F-A-C. If the bass is C, then it's C-D-F-A. So C as bass, then D, F, A above. That would be a C major 7th chord with a 9th? Wait, no. C major 7th is C-E-G-B. Dm7 is D-F-A-C. So if the chord is Dm/C, meaning Dm triad with C in bass, then we have notes C (bass), D, F, A. Which is exactly a Dm7 chord. Because Dm7 is spelled D, F, A, C. So if the bass note is C, then it's a Dm7 chord in third inversion. Similarly, Em/B: E minor chord is E, G, B. If the bass is B, then notes are B, E, G. So B, E, G is a Bdim chord? Wait B, E, G: E is the fourth above B, B to E is a perfect fourth. Wait, actually, the notes B, E, G – B to E is perfect fourth, E to G is minor third. So it's a B minor 7th? Wait no. Let's see. If it's Em/B, then the chord is E minor triad (E, G, B) with B as bass. So B, E, G. So B as root, then E is a perfect fourth, G is a minor sixth. So that would be a B half-diminished chord? B, D, F, A is B half-diminished. Wait, B, E, G – that's B root, E, G. So B to E is 4th, B to G is minor 6th. So the chord is Bsus4? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an Em triad in second inversion. Because the notes are E, G, B; when B is bass, the order is B, E, G. Which is second inversion of E minor. So it's still E minor triad. Similarly, Am/C: A minor triad is A, C, E; with C as bass: C, A, E. So it's Am in first inversion. G7/B: G7 chord is G, B, D, F. If bass is B, then B, G, D, F. Which is B, D, F, G. So that's a B half-diminished chord? Wait, B, D, F is B diminished triad, and G is a major second above B. Wait, no. B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, F to G is major second. So B diminished triad would be B, D, F. But adding G would make it B diminished with added 9th? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, G7/B means G7 chord with B in bass. So the notes would be B, G, D, F. So B as bass, then G (a major 6th above B), D (a perfect 4th), F (a minor 7th). But a G7 chord has notes G, B, D, F. So when B is in the bass, the notes are B, D, F, G. Which is a Bm7b5 chord? Let's check: Bm7b5 would be B, D, F, A. But here we have B, D, F, G. So it's B, D, F, G, which is B7(b9)? No. Maybe just G7 with B as bass, which is a common inversion. In terms of chord function, it's still a G7 chord.

So regardless of the slash notation, when considering the actual chord quality and function, the chords are:

- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Am (A minor, with C bass)
- Am (A minor)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Em (E minor, with B bass)
- Dm (D minor, with C bass – which is actually Dm7)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Am (A minor)
- Am (A minor)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- G7 (G dominant 7th, with B bass)
- C (C major)

So the chord progression is primarily using chords from the key of C major. Let's list the chords used:

C major, A minor, E minor, D minor, G7.

All of these are diatonic to C major. Let's check:

C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B.

Chords in C major:

I: C major

ii: D minor

iii: E minor

IV: F major

V: G major

vi: A minor

vii: B diminished

But in the progression, we have G7 instead of G major. G7 is the dominant seventh in C major. So V7 chord.

So the chords used are:

I (C), vi (A minor), iii (E minor), ii (D minor), V7 (G7).

All of these are diatonic chords in C major. There's no non-diatonic chords here. The slash chords are just inversions, which don't change the key.

So the key is C major. Now, the mode. Wait, mode usually refers to whether it's ionian (major), dorian, phrygian, etc., based on the scale. But since all the chords are diatonic to C major, and the tonic seems to be C (as the progression starts and ends on C), then the key is C major, which is the Ionian mode. But sometimes people talk about mode when a different chord might be the tonic. But in this progression, C seems to be the tonal center because it's the starting chord and the ending chord. Also, the G7 to C resolution is a strong V-I cadence. So that reinforces C as the tonic.

Wait, let's check the progression's cadences. After G7/B, it goes to C. That's V7-I, which is the strongest cadence in major keys. So yes, this progression seems to be in C major.

Are there any other possibilities? Let's see. For example, if someone thought it was in A minor. Let's check. A minor is the relative minor of C major. But the chords in A minor natural would be: i: Am, ii°: Bdim, III: C, iv: Dm, v: Em, VI: F, VII: G. So Am, C, Dm, Em, F, G are all diatonic. But in this progression, the chords used are C, Am, Em, Dm, G7. So in A minor, the G would be a major chord (V), but sometimes in minor keys, the V chord is often raised to G# (for harmonic minor), but here it's G7, which is G-B-D-F. If it's A minor, V chord is traditionally E major (E-G#-B), but G7 is not the V chord in A minor. G7 would be the VII chord in A minor. But in natural minor, the chords are: Am (i), Bdim (ii°), C (III), Dm (iv), Em (v), F (VI), G (VII). So G in natural minor is major? Yes, G major. But G7 would be a dominant 7th chord. In A minor, the V chord is Em, or sometimes E major in harmonic minor. The G7 would be VII7 chord. But usually in minor keys, to get a stronger cadence, you'd use E major or Em7. But here the progression ends on C with G7-B resolving to C. So V7-I to C. That makes it more likely C major. Because in A minor, the V chord would be Em, not G7. If it were in A minor, the dominant chord would be E major (V), but here we have G7 resolving to C. G7 to C is actually V7-I in C major. Wait, no. If the key was A minor, G7 would be VII7 (since in natural minor, VII is G), but G7 chord in A minor would be G-B-D-F, which is a diminished 7th? Wait no. G7 chord. In the key of A minor, the natural minor scale has G as the VII degree, which is a major chord. So G major. But G7 would have a minor 7th (F), so G-B-D-F. Yes, that's the VII7 chord. But typically, in a minor key, the cadence from VII to i is common, but here the progression ends on C, not on Am. Wait the progression here ends on C. So the last chord is C. So if the key was A minor, the tonic is Am, but the progression ends on C, which is the III chord. That wouldn't make sense as a resolution. Whereas if it's C major, ending on C is tonic.

The progression starts and ends on C, and uses the V7-I cadence (G7 to C), which is the strongest possible resolution in major keys. So this is definitely C major.

Now, about mode. Since it's using the major scale, it's the Ionian mode. But sometimes people confuse the key with mode. But typically, when people say "key", they refer to the tonic and major/minor. In this case, C major. There's no indication of a different mode being used here. All the chords are from the C major scale. If there were a different chord, like F# or something, that might shift. But here everything is diatonic C major.

Wait, let me see again: the chords used are C, Am, Em, Dm, G7. All diatonic to C major. The scale is C D E F G A B. All chords fit.

So the key is C major. Mode would be Ionian (which is the same as major key).

But let me check if there's a different possible mode. For example, if the progression were emphasizing A minor as the tonic, but the progression ends on C, which doesn't support that. If the progression had a lot of Am chords and ended on Am, then maybe Aeolian mode. But here it's C major. So the key is C major, mode is Ionian.

Alternatively, sometimes people might refer to the mode based on scale, but if it's a major key, Ionian.

Wait, but the user might not know the difference between key and mode. So perhaps they're asking for key (tonic and major/minor) and mode. So key would be C major, mode is Ionian.

But perhaps some would just say the key is C major and not specify mode since major key is Ionian. But technically, yes.

Wait, but let me check the progression for any modal characteristics. Are there any chords that wouldn't be diatonic in C major? Let's see: all chords used are C, Em (iii), Dm (ii), Am (vi), G7 (V7). In C major, yes. So no non-diatonic chords.

What about the G7: dominant 7th is common in major keys for the V chord. So it's definitely a major key.

Another way to check: what is the tonic chord? C. Cadences: G7 to C is V7-I. That's a perfect cadence in C major.

Another cadence: let's see the progression. After the Am, it goes to C, which is vi-I, also a common resolution. But the strongest resolution is G7 to C.

So yes, C major.

Is there any chance of it being in a different key? Let's see. Suppose the key was G major. But chords in G major would have F#, but no F# in here. The chords are all C, Am, Em, Dm, G. In G major, the chords would be G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim. But here, there's a Dm instead of D major. So D minor is not diatonic in G major. So no. So it's not G major.

If it were F major. In F major, chords would include Bb. But here, no Bb. G7 chord is G-B-D-F, which in F major, B is a note in the scale? F major scale is F G A Bb C D E. So Bb is flat. But G7 has a B natural, which is not in F major. So that's not diatonic. So no.

E major: too many sharps. Not likely. A minor: as before, but the progression ends on C, not A.

So definitely C major.

Therefore, key is C major, mode is Ionian.

But the user asked to determine key and mode. So key = C major, mode = Ionian. But sometimes people just refer to the key as C major, since Ionian is the major scale. So perhaps the answer is key C major, mode Ionian.

Alternatively, maybe they just want to know the key as in the tonic note and major/minor. But in this case, since it's major, the key is C major, and mode is Ionian.

But in some contexts, people might say the mode is major, but technically Ionian is the mode for major. Aeolian for natural minor.

So the answer should be Key: C major (Ionian mode). But maybe just "C Major Ionian" or "Key: C, Mode: Ionian".

Wait, let me make sure. Let's check if any of the chords are outside of C major. No. G7 is V7, which is standard in major keys. C major has a G7 as the dominant. Yes.

Another check: looking at the bass line. Let's see the bass notes for each chord.

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C (since slash C means C is the bass)

- Am/C: bass C

- C: C

- C: C

- Em/B: bass B (since Em/B, B is the bass note)

- Dm/C: bass C

- C: C

- C: C

- Am/C: C

- Am/C: C

- C: C

- C: C

- G7/B: bass B

- C: C

Wait, the bass line: C, C, C, C, C, C, B, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, B, C.

So the bass goes mostly C, with some B notes. The B in the bass for Em/B and G7/B.

In C major, the bass notes would typically be notes from C major scale. B is in C major. So yes.

The progression has a lot of C in bass, which reinforces C as tonic. The G7/B chord has B as bass, which is the 3rd of G7, so it's the third inversion. And then resolves to C. So the V7 to I cadence.

So everything points to C major.

Is there any chance it's in another key? Suppose someone thought it was D Dorian. D Dorian is D E F G A B C D. So scale has B natural. Then the chords. Dm is i, Em is ii, but then in D Dorian, the chords would be: Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, C. But G chord is major, which is part of Dorian. Wait Dorian mode has natural 6th and minor 7th? Wait Dorian: root, major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, major 6th, minor 7th. So D Dorian: D E F G A B C. So yes. So chords in D Dorian:

i: Dm

ii: Em

III: F

IV: G

v: Am

vi°: Bdim

VII: C

But in that case, the VI chord (Bdim) is diminished, but in the given progression, there's no Bdim. The chords present: C, Am, Em, Dm, G, G7.

If in D Dorian, G is IV, but C would be VII chord. A C chord as a resolution in D Dorian? Not typical. Usually, Dorian mode would have cadences back to Dm. But here the progression ends on C. So that's less likely.

If we look at the progression ending on C, it would sound like C is the tonal center. If it were D Dorian, the tonic would be D, but the progression isn't ending on D. So probably not.

Similarly, if it were A Aeolian: A B C D E F G. Then the chords would be Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G. So similar to natural minor. But again, the progression ends on C, not A. So not likely.

So definitely C major.

Another check: the chord G7 is a dominant seventh, typically used to resolve to I. In C major, yes. So V7-I.

So yes.

Therefore, the key is C major and the mode is Ionian.

But sometimes, the mode is just specified as major if it's the Ionian. But technically, the mode is Ionian.

So the answer should be: Key: C, Mode: Ionian.

Alternatively, "Key: C major (Ionian mode)".

But to be precise.

Wait, maybe the user expects just the key, and mode is not always specified. But they asked for both. So I think the answer is C Major Ionian. Or Key: C major, Mode: Ionian.

Yes.

But to check if there's any accidental modulation or something, but looking at the entire progression, it's very consistently C major chords, with strong cadences to C.

So final answer: the key is C major and the mode is Ionian.

The chord progression provided is:  
**C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C**

### Step 1: Analyze the chords (ignoring slash notation for simplicity):
- **C** = C major (I)  
- **Am/C** = A minor (vi) with C in bass (first inversion)  
- **Em/B** = E minor (iii) with B in bass (second inversion)  
- **Dm/C** = D minor (ii) with C in bass (third inversion of Dm7, but functionally D minor)  
- **G7/B** = G dominant 7th (V7) with B in bass (third inversion)  

All chords are **diatonic to the C major scale** (C, D, E, F, G, A, B). Here's the breakdown of their functions:  
- **C** = Tonic (I)  
- **Am** = Submediant (vi)  
- **Em** = Mediant (iii)  
- **Dm** = Supertonic (ii)  
- **G7** = Dominant 7th (V7)  

### Step 2: Check for tonal center:
- The progression **starts and ends on C**, the tonic pitch.  
- The cadence **G7 → C** is a classic **dominant-to-tonic (V7-I) resolution**, the strongest indicator of a major key.  
- No non-diatonic chords (e.g., no F♯, B♭, etc.) appear, confirming the scale is purely **C major**.  

### Step 3: Determine mode:
- **C major** uses the **Ionian mode** (the standard major scale: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7).  
- There is no evidence of modal inflection (e.g., no lowered 3rd, 6th, or 7th for aeolian/dorian/etc.). The progression consistently resolves to C as the tonal center with typical major-key harmony.  

---

### Final Answer:  
- **Key**: **C major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian**  

This progression is a straightforward example of the **C major key** with no modal ambiguity. The G7 → C cadence solidifies C as the tonic, and all chords align with diatonic harmony in C major (Ionian mode).

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

To determine the **key** and **mode** of this chord progression:

```
C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C
```

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: List the chords (ignoring bass notes for now)

The main chords (ignoring bass inversions like Am/C) are:

- C
- Am
- Em
- Dm
- G7

So we have: **C, Am, Em, Dm, G7**

---

### Step 2: Find the common key that contains these chords

Let’s check which **major key** contains all of these chords:

In **C major** (C D E F G A B):

- C = I
- Am = vi
- Em = iii
- Dm = ii
- G7 = V7

✅ All of these chords are diatonic to **C major**!

- C (I)  
- Am (vi)  
- Em (iii)  
- Dm (ii)  
- G7 (V7) — yes, the dominant 7th is very common in major keys and is diatonic (built on G: G-B-D-F)

So the **key is C major**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the bass notes (inversions)

You have chord inversions:

- **Am/C** = A minor with C in the bass → this is the **first inversion** of Am (C-E-A)
- **Em/B** = E minor with B in the bass → first inversion of Em (B-E-G)
- **Dm/C** = D minor with C in the bass → this is **not** a standard inversion; Dm is D-F-A, so C is not part of the chord. This is a **neutral bass note** — possibly implying a **C major with Dm on top**? Or a passing pedal? But functionally, it’s likely meant to lead to C or imply a **C major harmony with a suspensive bass**.
- **G7/B** = G7 with B in the bass → first inversion of G7 (B-D-F-G)

These inversions are mostly **voice-leading devices** — common in pop/rock to create smooth bass movement.

For example:
- Am/C → C is the 3rd of Am → smooth step from C (previous chord) down to C
- Em/B → B is the 5th of Em → creates a descending bass line: C → B → ...
- Dm/C → C is a **non-chord tone** in Dm, but serves as a lead-in to C
- G7/B → B is the 3rd of G7 → leads nicely to C (B→C)

So the inversions reinforce a **smooth descending bass line**:
> C → C → C (Am/C) → C (Em/B) → B → C (Dm/C) → C → C → C → C → B → C

Actually, let’s trace the **bass line** explicitly:

Chord | Bass note
------|----------
C     | **C**
C     | **C**
Am/C  | **C**
Am/C  | **C**
C     | **C**
C     | **C**
Em/B  | **B**
Dm/C  | **C**
C     | **C**
C     | **C**
Am/C  | **C**
Am/C  | **C**
C     | **C**
C     | **C**
G7/B  | **B**
C     | **C**

So the **bass line** is dominated by **C**, with occasional **B**.

This is a classic **C major** progression with subtle bass motion: the B in Em/B and G7/B creates a **leading tone** motion (B→C) that strongly confirms **C as the tonic**.

The mode: Since all chords are from the **C major scale** and the tonal center is clearly **C**, and no modal alterations (like flattened 3rd or 7th) are present — this is **C major (Ionian mode)**.

---

### Step 4: Confirm tonal center

- Every section begins and ends on C.
- G7 → C is a perfect authentic cadence (V7–I).
- Am and Em are relative minors, but they're used as chords within the major key (vi and iii), not as modal centers.
- No evidence of Aeolian (minor), Lydian, Mixolydian, etc.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

To determine the **key and mode** of the chord progression:

**C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C**

---

### Step 1: List the chords (ignoring bass notes for now)
- C  
- Am  
- Em  
- Dm  
- G7  

These are all **diatonic chords** in the key of **C major**:

| Chord | Quality | Scale degree in C major |
|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| C     | I       | Tonic                    |
| Dm    | ii      | Supertonic               |
| Em    | iii     | Mediant                  |
| Am    | vi      | Submediant               |
| G7    | V7      | Dominant (with 7th)      |

So far, **everything fits in C major**.

---

### Step 2: Consider the bass notes (slash chords)
- Am/C = Am with C in the bass → C is the **root of the key**, gives a stable sound
- Em/B = Em with B in the bass → B is the **leading tone** (7th scale degree), which strongly pulls to C
- Dm/C = Dm with C in the bass → C in the bass under Dm creates a **Cadd9** or **C6/9** sound (still consonant in C major)
- G7/B = G7 with B in the bass → B is the **3rd of G7**, and also the leading tone; smooth voice leading to C

These slash chords are used primarily for **smooth bass motion** or **color**, not to imply a new key.

---

### Step 3: Look at harmonic function
- The progression starts and ends on **C** (tonic)
- It uses **Am** (vi) and **Em** (iii) as tonic substitutes or for color
- **G7** (V7) appears near the end, creating a **dominant → tonic** resolution (G7 → C)
- **Dm** (ii) appears briefly, often part of a ii–V–I or used for modal interchange—but here it's over C bass, softening its function

This strongly supports **C major** as the tonal center.

---

### Step 4: Consider mode
- All chords are **diatonic to C major** (no flats or sharps outside the key)
- No use of characteristic modal chords (e.g., no B♭ for Mixolydian, no F# for Lydian, no E♭ for Dorian, etc.)
- Final cadence is **G7 → C**, a classic **authentic cadence** in **Ionian (major) mode**

Thus, the mode is **Ionian**, i.e., **major**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:
- **Key**: **C major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian (major)**

The progression is firmly rooted in **C major**, using diatonic chords and standard functional harmony, with added color from slash chords for smooth voice leading.

### Reasoning

**Assessing Musical Key and Mode**

I'm currently focused on the chords provided: C, Am/C, Em/B, Dm/C, G7/B. Analyzing their relationships is key, given their prevalence. My hypothesis leans towards a major key, possibly C major or G major, but the presence of Em and Am suggests a possible minor variation, as well.


**Identifying The Tonic and Mode**

Now, I'm examining chord progressions and bass movement to reinforce my conclusion of C major. The repeating C-Am/C patterns and the G7 resolving to C strongly suggest a definitive key. I'm noting the lack of a strong minor-key cadence and reinforcing the importance of the G7 chord in establishing the major mode.


**Confirming the Mode and Key**

I'm solidifying the conclusion now, and considering the repeated cadences. Examining the bass movement and the frequent occurrence of the G7 chord leading to C, I'm finding the major mode is very clearly defined. The other harmonic relationships (Dm to C, Em to B) reinforce a robust diatonic framework, without any strong inclination toward a minor tonality. C Major is the strongest possible conclusion.




This phrase is clearly centered around **C**.

Here is the determination:

1.  **Tonic (Key Center):** The progression begins and ends on the **C** major chord, which is heavily featured throughout.
2.  **Chord Functionality:** The inventory of chords ($C$, $Dm$, $Em$, $Am$, $G7$) are all diatonic to $C$ Major. The $G7$ (V7) chord resolving to $C$ (I) provides the strongest possible dominant-tonic confirmation for $C$ Major.
3.  **Bass Movement:** The use of inversions like $Em/B$ and $G7/B$ creates strong stepwise bass motion leading into the tonic, a common feature of major key harmony.

**Key and Mode:**

*   **Key:** C
*   **Mode:** Major

The key is **C Major**.

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

The provided chord progression is:

**C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C**

To determine the key and mode, we look at the primary chords and the harmonic movement, especially the final cadence.

### 1. Identify the Chords and Potential Key Centers

The main chords used are:
* **C Major (I)**
* **A minor (Am) (vi)**
* **E minor (Em) (iii)**
* **D minor (Dm) (ii)**
* **G7 (V7)**

All these chords (C, Dm, Em, F [implied], G7, Am) are diatonic to the key of **C Major**.

### 2. Analyze the Harmonic Movement and Cadence

The progression begins and ends on **C Major**.

* **Tonic Function:** C acts as the tonic throughout, grounding the progression.
* **Dominant Function:** The progression ends with the cadence **G7/B -> C** (V7 -> I). This is a strong **Authentic Cadence** which firmly establishes **C** as the tonic.

### 3. Determine the Mode

Since the key center is C, and the harmonic language uses the standard major chords and the V7-I cadence, the mode is **Major**.

### Conclusion

Based on the diatonic chords and the strong V7-I cadence establishing C as the tonic, the key and mode are:

* **Key:** **C**
* **Mode:** **Major**

(The chord progression is essentially a variation on the C major scale, focusing on the I, vi, ii, iii, and V chords.)

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

To determine the **key and mode** of this progression, let's analyze it step by step:

---

### **Chord Progression:**
```
C  |  C  |  Am/C  |  Am/C  
C  |  C  |  Em/B  |  Dm/C  
C  |  C  |  Am/C  |  Am/C  
C  |  C  |  G7/B  |  C
```

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Tonal Center**
Every phrase **starts and ends on C**, and **C major** is the most stable chord throughout. This strongly suggests **C is the tonal center**.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Chords**
All chords are **diatonic to C major**, even with the bass notes:
- **C major** (I)
- **Am** (vi)
- **Em** (iii)
- **Dm** (ii)
- **G7** (V7)

Even with **inversions** (e.g., Am/C, Em/B, Dm/C, G7/B), the **harmonic content** does not leave the **C major scale**.

---

### **Step 3: Check for Mode vs. Key**
There is **no emphasis on A minor** (e.g., no E7 leading to Am), and **no use of B♭ or F♯**, which would imply **modal borrowing** or **modulation**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
- **Key:** C major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (the major mode)

This is a **diatonic progression in C major**, despite the inverted bass lines.

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let’s analyze this chord progression step by step.

### Chord list
C | C | Am/C | Am/C | C | C | Em/B | Dm/C |  
C | C | Am/C | Am/C | C | C | G7/B | C

---

### Step 1: Identify the possible tonic
- The chord **C** is overwhelmingly present.
- The final cadence is **G7/B → C**, which strongly suggests a V–I resolution in **C major**.

So, **C** is likely the tonic.

---

### Step 2: Examine the other chords in relation to C major

| Chord  | Function in C major | Notes   |
|:------:|:-------------------:|:--------|
| C      | I                  | tonic |
| Am/C   | vi in 1st inversion | shares notes with C major (A–C–E) |
| Em/B   | iii in 1st inversion | diatonic to C major |
| Dm/C   | ii⁷ (without the 3rd) or ii in 3rd inversion | diatonic |
| G7/B   | V⁷ in 1st inversion | leads to C strongly |

All of these chords are diatonic to **C major**.

---

### Step 3: Check the mode
No accidentals or modal inflections appear (no F♯ or B♭), so this is plainly **C major**, not C Mixolydian or C Ionian with alterations.

---

✅ **Conclusion**

- **Key:** C major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major)  

**Reasoning:** The strong presence of C major, the G7/B → C cadence, and all-diatonic harmony confirm the C major tonality.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, I need to determine the key and mode of this chord progression. The chords are: C, C, Am/C, Am/C, C, C, Em/B, Dm/C, C, C, Am/C, Am/C, C, C, G7/B, C.

I see that most of the chords are based on C, and there are chords like Am, Em, Dm, and G7. These are all diatonic chords in the key of C major. Let me list out the diatonic chords in C major:

- I: C

- ii: Dm

- iii: Em

- IV: F

- V: G

- vi: Am

- vii°: Bdim

In this progression, I have C (I), Am (vi), Em (iii), Dm (ii), and G7 (V7). The G7 is a dominant seventh chord, which is common in major keys.

Now, looking at the progression, it starts and ends with C, and there are multiple C chords throughout. Also, the Am chords are written as Am/C, which means Am with a C bass note. Similarly, Em/B is Em with a B bass, and Dm/C is Dm with a C bass. G7/B is G7 with a B bass.

The bass notes seem to be emphasizing C in many places. Let me list the bass notes based on the chord notations:

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- Em/B: bass B

- Dm/C: bass C

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- G7/B: bass B

- C: bass C

So, the bass is mostly C, with two instances of B. The B bass notes come from Em/B and G7/B. Em/B is the iii chord with a B bass, which is the third of the Em chord, but in terms of scale, B is the seventh note in C major. G7/B is the V7 chord with a B bass, which is the third of the G7 chord.

Since the bass is consistently C except for two B's, and the chords are all from C major, it seems like the key is C major.

But let me check if there's any indication of mode. The progression doesn't have any F chord, which is the IV chord, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not C major. The presence of G7 confirms the dominant function, which is typical in major keys.

Also, Am is the relative minor, but here it's used in a way that the bass is C, so it might be functioning as a tonic prolongation or something.

The progression seems to be centered around C, and it ends with G7/B to C, which is a perfect cadence in C major.

Therefore, I think the key is C major.

But just to be thorough, let's consider if it could be C minor. In C minor, the chords would be different. For example, Am would not be diatonic in C minor; the vi chord in C minor would be Ab major. But here we have Am, which is from C major. Also, Em and Dm are from C major. G7 is also from C major. So, it's definitely C major.

Thus, the key is C major, and the mode is Ionian, but since it's major, we just say major.

So, for the answer, I should say key of C major.

The chord progression provided is primarily based on chords diatonic to the key of C major: C (I), Am (vi), Em (iii), Dm (ii), and G7 (V7). The consistent use of C as the bass note throughout most of the progression, along with the final cadence from G7/B to C (V7 to I), confirms the tonic center as C. Therefore, the key is C major.

The mode is Ionian, which is equivalent to the major scale. The progression does not exhibit any characteristics of minor or other modes, as all chords align with the C major scale.

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s go step-by-step.

---

**1. Look at the chords given:**

C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C

---

**2. Simplify to root-position chords to see the progression:**

- C = C major  
- Am/C = A minor with C in bass → still Am functionally  
- Em/B = E minor with B bass → still Em functionally  
- Dm/C = D minor with C bass → still Dm functionally  
- G7/B = G7 with B bass → still G7 functionally  

So the progression in terms of roots is:

C – Am – Am – C – C – Em – Dm – C – C – Am – Am – C – C – G7 – C

---

**3. Check for key signature possibilities:**

Chords: C, Am, Em, Dm, G7

- C major scale: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim  
- G7 is V7 in C major (V7–I is G7–C)  
- All chords belong to C major except none outside.

---

**4. Look at cadences:**

- The piece ends with G7 → C (V7–I perfect cadence in C major)  
- Dm (ii) and Em (iii) are both in C major.  
- No F major chord, but that’s fine.

---

**5. Check for A minor (relative minor) possibility:**

A minor key would have E7 or G#dim for V–i cadence, but here we have Em and G7, which are from the natural minor but without a leading-tone cadence.  
However, the piece starts and ends on C, and the V7–I is strong in C major, not A minor.

---

**6. Bass line consideration:**

Some chords have non-root bass notes, but that doesn’t change the key.  
For example:  
Am/C = I⁶ in A minor? No, in C major it’s vi with C bass.  
Dm/C = ii with C bass — a common passing pedal tone C in the bass.  
G7/B = V⁶₅ in C major.

---

**7. Conclusion:**

All evidence points to **C major**:

- Tonic chord C begins and ends the piece.  
- Dominant G7 resolves to C at the final cadence.  
- All chords diatonically from C major scale.

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{C\ \text{major}}

### Reasoning

1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to know the "key and mode" of a chord progression: `C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C`.

2.  **Initial Scan & Simplification:**
    *   First, I see a lot of repetitions. The core progression seems to be: `C - Am/C - C - Em/B - Dm/C - C - Am/C - C - G7/B - C`.
    *   I also see a lot of slash chords. Let's simplify them to understand the basic harmony.
        *   `C`: C major (C-E-G)
        *   `Am/C`: This is an A minor chord (A-C-E) with a C in the bass. The notes are C-A-C-E. The primary harmony is still A minor, but the bass note C is significant. It creates a specific voice-leading effect.
        *   `Em/B`: This is an E minor chord (E-G-B) with a B in the bass. The notes are B-E-G. This is a standard first inversion E minor chord.
        *   `Dm/C`: This is a D minor chord (D-F-A) with a C in the bass. The notes are C-D-F-A. This is a bit unusual. A Dm chord normally has D, F, A. Adding a C in the bass makes it function differently. It's often analyzed as a `Csus4(b9)` or a `Fmaj9/C` (F-A-C with D and E? No, that's not right). Let's stick with the notes: C-D-F-A. It has the notes of a Dm triad plus a C. It also contains the notes of an F major triad (F-A-C) with a D. The most common interpretation is a Dm with a non-chord tone (pedal point C) in the bass. The bass note C is a constant pedal point through a lot of this progression. Let's note that.
        *   `G7/B`: G dominant 7th (G-B-D-F) with B in the bass. Standard first inversion.

3.  **Identify the Tonal Center (Key):**
    *   The progression starts and ends on C.
    *   The most frequent chord is C.
    *   The bass note C is used as a pedal point for `Am/C` and `Dm/C`. This strongly suggests C is the tonal center.
    *   The final chord is `G7/B` resolving to `C`. This is a classic V-I cadence (G7 to C) in the key of C major, even though it's in first inversion. The V chord (G7) has a strong pull to the I chord (C).

    *Conclusion so far:* The key is very likely C major.

4.  **Analyze the Chords within the Key of C Major:**
    *   The diatonic chords in C major are:
        *   I: C major (C-E-G)
        *   ii: D minor (D-F-A)
        *   iii: E minor (E-G-B)
        *   IV: F major (F-A-C)
        *   V: G major (G-B-D)
        *   vi: A minor (A-C-E)
        *   vii°: B diminished (B-D-F)

    *   Let's check the chords in the progression against this framework:
        *   `C`: I chord. Fits perfectly.
        *   `Am/C`: This is the vi chord (A minor) over the I chord's root. It's a very common device. The harmony is vi, but the bass is static on I.
        *   `Em/B`: This is the iii chord (E minor) in first inversion. Fits perfectly.
        *   `Dm/C`: This is the ii chord (D minor) over the I chord's root. Again, the harmony is diatonic (ii), but the bass is static on I.
        *   `G7/B`: This is the V7 chord (G7) in first inversion. Fits perfectly.

    *Conclusion reinforced:* All the harmonic functions are diatonic to the key of C major. The use of slash chords is a stylistic choice, creating a "pedal point" effect on the tonic (C), which grounds the entire progression.

5.  **Determine the Mode:**
    *   The major scale is the default (Ionian mode).
    *   To be in a different mode (like Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian), the progression would need to emphasize the characteristic intervals of that mode.
    *   For example, to be in A minor (Aeolian mode), the progression would need to feel "at home" on A, and would likely feature an E7 (V of Am) to resolve to Am. This progression does the opposite; it resolves strongly to C.
    *   The progression uses chords from C major and resolves to C. The overall sound is major, not minor. The `Am` and `Dm` chords provide a temporary minor feel, but they function as subdominant-type chords (vi and ii) within the major key, leading back to the tonic C.
    *   There's nothing in the progression to suggest a flattened 7th (which would point to Mixolydian), a raised 4th (Lydian), or a flattened 2nd (Phrygian).
    *   The progression is a textbook example of a song in the **Ionian mode** (which is just the major scale).

6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: Key is C Major, Mode is Ionian.
    *   Provide the reasoning.
    *   **Key:** Explain that C is the tonal center. Mention the start/end on C, the frequency of C, and most importantly, the V-I cadence (G7 to C).
    *   **Mode:** Explain that Ionian is the major mode. All the chords are diatonic to C major. The use of minor chords (Am, Dm, Em) is standard within a major key, functioning as the vi, ii, and iii chords respectively. They don't make the overall mode minor.
    *   **Analysis of the Slash Chords:** This is the most interesting part of the progression. Explain the concept of a "pedal point" or "static bass." The bass note C is held constant while the harmony changes above it (`Am/C`, `Dm/C`). This is a common technique to create harmonic interest while keeping the tonic firmly established. Mention the other slash chords (`Em/B`, `G7/B`) as standard inversions that create smooth basslines.
    *   **Breakdown:** Provide a chord-by-chord analysis to show how each one fits into the key of C major.
        *   `C`: I (Tonic)
        *   `Am/C`: vi (Submediant) over a C pedal point.
        *   `Em/B`: iii (Mediant) in first inversion.
        *   `Dm/C`: ii (Supertonic) over a C pedal point.
        *   `G7/B`: V7 (Dominant) in first inversion, leading to...
        *   `C`: I (Tonic)
    *   **Summary/Conclusion:** Reiterate that the progression is firmly in C major (Ionian mode), using diatonic chords and a C pedal point in the bass to create its specific harmonic color.

7.  **Final Review:** Read through the generated answer. Is it clear? Is it accurate? Does it directly answer the user's question while also providing valuable context? The answer looks solid. It explains not just *what* the key is, but *why*, and also deciphers the more complex slash chords.



Based on the chord progression provided, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **C Major**
*   **Mode:** **Ionian** (which is the standard major scale)

---

### Analysis and Reasoning

Here is a detailed breakdown of why this is a C major progression:

1.  **Tonal Center:** The progression starts and, most importantly, ends on a **C major** chord. This establishes C as the "home base" or tonic.

2.  **The Dominant-Tonic Cadence:** The second-to-last chord is **G7/B**, which is a G7 chord (the dominant) in first inversion. The G7 chord has a very strong tendency to resolve to the C chord (the tonic). This classic V-I relationship solidifies C major as the key. Even in first inversion, the pull to C is undeniable.

3.  **Diatonic Chords:** All the chords in the progression are built from the notes of the C major scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B). Let's look at each one's function in the key of C major:
    *   **C**: The **I chord** (tonic).
    *   **Am/C**: An A minor chord (**vi chord**) with a C in the bass. The harmony is vi, but the static C in the bass acts as a **pedal point**.
    *   **Em/B**: An E minor chord (**iii chord**) in first inversion.
    *   **Dm/C**: A D minor chord (**ii chord**) with a C in the bass. Again, this is the ii chord harmony over a C pedal point.
    *   **G7/B**: A G7 chord (**V7 chord** or dominant seventh) in first inversion.

4.  **Mode:** Since the progression is built from the major scale and revolves around the major tonic chord (C), it is in the **Ionian mode**. The presence of minor chords (Am, Dm, Em) is completely normal within a major key; they function as the subdominant and mediant chords (ii, iii, vi) and create harmonic interest but do not change the fundamental major feel.

### The Role of the Slash Chords

The most notable feature of this progression is the use of slash chords, specifically the C pedal point.

*   **Pedal Point:** By holding the bass note C while the harmony changes above it (`Am/C`, `Dm/C`), the composer creates a sense of stability while still allowing the harmony to move. It's a very common and effective technique in many genres, from classical to pop.
*   **Voice Leading:** The slash chords like `Em/B` and `G7/B` are used to create a smooth, flowing bassline that connects the chords together gracefully.

In summary, the progression is firmly in **C major**, using diatonic chords and a C pedal point to create its specific harmonic color.
