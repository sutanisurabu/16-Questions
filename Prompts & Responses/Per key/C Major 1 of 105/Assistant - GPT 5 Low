### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to determine the key and mode based on the chord progression with slash bass notes: C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C. It looks like we’re in the key of C major, as most of the chords are centered around C. The presence of G7 suggests a dominant chord leading to the tonic. The mode is likely Ionian, which is the major mode. So, definitely C major, mode Ionian!**Analyzing slash chords and bass lines**

I see that slash chords with non-root bass might imply inversions, creating a stepwise bass line. For example, C (C bass), Am/C (C bass), Em/B (B in bass), Dm/C (C bass), and G7/B (B bass). The bass alternates between C and B, which is fine. I’m determining the key and mode: it’s C major, Ionian. Am/C is actually a first inversion of Am, and Dm/C suggests a different function, maybe as a quartal structure. It’s all about understanding how the harmony connects!**Summarizing key and mode**

I’ve been working through the progression, noting that D-F-A over C creates a Csus2(add4/6. It’s diatonic and could interpret as IV/V, but that’s not necessary. The G7/B is a first inversion of V7 that resolves strongly to C, confirming we're in C major and mode is Ionian. 

So, to sum it up:  
- Key: C major  
- Mode: Ionian  
- Reason: Diatonic chords to C major; the cadential V7/B resolves to I, with a strong emphasis on the tonic C.**Adding bass line commentary**

I should add a comment about the optional bass line, noting that alternating between C and B creates a smooth, stepwise motion underneath the inversions. This enhances the harmonic progression without overwhelming the reader with formatting. Keeping it simple but effective is key. I think a bullet list could work well here for clarity. Alright, I’m ready to deliver this information concisely and effectively!

- Key: C major
- Mode: Ionian (C Ionian)

Reason: The progression is overwhelmingly centered on C and ends on C. All chords are diatonic to C major, and the presence of G7/B (V7 in first inversion) resolving to C confirms the C major (Ionian) tonality. The slash chords mostly create smooth bass motion (C–B–C) via first inversions (Am/C, Em/B, G7/B).
