Let’s go step-by-step.

---

**1. Look at the chords given:**

C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C

---

**2. Simplify to root-position chords to see the progression:**

- C = C major  
- Am/C = A minor with C in bass → still Am functionally  
- Em/B = E minor with B bass → still Em functionally  
- Dm/C = D minor with C bass → still Dm functionally  
- G7/B = G7 with B bass → still G7 functionally  

So the progression in terms of roots is:

C – Am – Am – C – C – Em – Dm – C – C – Am – Am – C – C – G7 – C

---

**3. Check for key signature possibilities:**

Chords: C, Am, Em, Dm, G7

- C major scale: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim  
- G7 is V7 in C major (V7–I is G7–C)  
- All chords belong to C major except none outside.

---

**4. Look at cadences:**

- The piece ends with G7 → C (V7–I perfect cadence in C major)  
- Dm (ii) and Em (iii) are both in C major.  
- No F major chord, but that’s fine.

---

**5. Check for A minor (relative minor) possibility:**

A minor key would have E7 or G#dim for V–i cadence, but here we have Em and G7, which are from the natural minor but without a leading-tone cadence.  
However, the piece starts and ends on C, and the V7–I is strong in C major, not A minor.

---

**6. Bass line consideration:**

Some chords have non-root bass notes, but that doesn’t change the key.  
For example:  
Am/C = I⁶ in A minor? No, in C major it’s vi with C bass.  
Dm/C = ii with C bass — a common passing pedal tone C in the bass.  
G7/B = V⁶₅ in C major.

---

**7. Conclusion:**

All evidence points to **C major**:

- Tonic chord C begins and ends the piece.  
- Dominant G7 resolves to C at the final cadence.  
- All chords diatonically from C major scale.

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{C\ \text{major}}
\]
