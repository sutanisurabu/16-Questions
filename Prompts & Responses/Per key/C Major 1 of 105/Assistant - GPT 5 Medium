### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to analyze the chord progression: "C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C." These are slash chords, indicating bass notes like C major and A minor over C. Em/B represents E minor over B, Dm/C is D minor over C, and G7/B is G dominant 7 over B. It looks like it's in C major (Ionian). The diatonic chords are C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, and present chords suggest C major and A minor over C.**Analyzing chord inversions**

I’m looking at the chord Am/C, which is an A minor triad in first inversion since C is the bass note. That makes it vi6. Em/B is another first inversion for E minor over B, also iii6. Then I have Dm/C, which is a D minor triad over C. But is it a Dm7? Dm7 includes a C, making it a third inversion. However, Dm/C suggests it’s just a D minor triad over C. The notes D, F, and A imply a C6add9. But for a C6sus2, I would need the C in the chord too.**Examining chord structure**

The slash indicates that I have Dm triad notes over C bass, making it a Dm7/C, essentially a Dm7 with C as the bass note. The chord tones are D, F, A, C, verifying it as a third inversion Dm7/C. My progression features inversions like I, vi6, iii6, and ii7. G7/B is a G7 in first inversion with B in the bass, leading back to C. This feels classic for C major, but I wonder if someone might perceive it as C Lydian, given the B bass notes and static C pedal.**Confirming key and mode**

I’ve determined that there’s no F# present in the chords, which are all diatonic to C major. So it seems like I'm in the Ionian mode. I should check for any non-diatonic degrees; G7 features an F natural, so it fits. Thus, the key is C major with mode Ionian. If someone asks for the key and mode, I’d say "C major, Ionian." The bassline functions through I, vi6, iii6, and ii7. G7/B is V6/5 in C major, while Em/B is iii6 and Am/C is vi6. So, overall: Key: C major, Mode: Ionian.**Summarizing key and progression**

I’m analyzing the chord progression based on C major and the cadence V6/5-I. The frequent use of slash chords shows inversions and a C pedal. It's important to note that if someone thought of this as being in C mixolydian, it doesn't work since there’s no Bb present. I’ve decided to keep things simple. 

The key is C major (Ionian). The Roman numerals would be: I – I – vi6 – vi6 – I – I – iii6 – ii4/2 – I – I – vi6 – vi6 – I – I – V6/5 – I. In summary, Dm/C implies a seventh, making it functionally ii4/2.

Key: C major
Mode: Ionian (C Ionian)

All chords are diatonic to C major, mostly over a C pedal, with a V7 (G7/B) resolving to I. Roman numerals: I – I – vi6 – vi6 – I – I – iii6 – ii4/2 – I – I – vi6 – vi6 – I – I – V6/5 – I.
