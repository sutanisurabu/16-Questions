### Reasoning

**Assessing Musical Key and Mode**

I'm currently focused on the chords provided: C, Am/C, Em/B, Dm/C, G7/B. Analyzing their relationships is key, given their prevalence. My hypothesis leans towards a major key, possibly C major or G major, but the presence of Em and Am suggests a possible minor variation, as well.


**Identifying The Tonic and Mode**

Now, I'm examining chord progressions and bass movement to reinforce my conclusion of C major. The repeating C-Am/C patterns and the G7 resolving to C strongly suggest a definitive key. I'm noting the lack of a strong minor-key cadence and reinforcing the importance of the G7 chord in establishing the major mode.


**Confirming the Mode and Key**

I'm solidifying the conclusion now, and considering the repeated cadences. Examining the bass movement and the frequent occurrence of the G7 chord leading to C, I'm finding the major mode is very clearly defined. The other harmonic relationships (Dm to C, Em to B) reinforce a robust diatonic framework, without any strong inclination toward a minor tonality. C Major is the strongest possible conclusion.




This phrase is clearly centered around **C**.

Here is the determination:

1.  **Tonic (Key Center):** The progression begins and ends on the **C** major chord, which is heavily featured throughout.
2.  **Chord Functionality:** The inventory of chords ($C$, $Dm$, $Em$, $Am$, $G7$) are all diatonic to $C$ Major. The $G7$ (V7) chord resolving to $C$ (I) provides the strongest possible dominant-tonic confirmation for $C$ Major.
3.  **Bass Movement:** The use of inversions like $Em/B$ and $G7/B$ creates strong stepwise bass motion leading into the tonic, a common feature of major key harmony.

**Key and Mode:**

*   **Key:** C
*   **Mode:** Major

The key is **C Major**.
