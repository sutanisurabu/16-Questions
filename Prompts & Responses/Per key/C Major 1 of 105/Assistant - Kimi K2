To determine the **key and mode** of this progression, let's analyze it step by step:

---

### **Chord Progression:**
```
C  |  C  |  Am/C  |  Am/C  
C  |  C  |  Em/B  |  Dm/C  
C  |  C  |  Am/C  |  Am/C  
C  |  C  |  G7/B  |  C
```

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Tonal Center**
Every phrase **starts and ends on C**, and **C major** is the most stable chord throughout. This strongly suggests **C is the tonal center**.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Chords**
All chords are **diatonic to C major**, even with the bass notes:
- **C major** (I)
- **Am** (vi)
- **Em** (iii)
- **Dm** (ii)
- **G7** (V7)

Even with **inversions** (e.g., Am/C, Em/B, Dm/C, G7/B), the **harmonic content** does not leave the **C major scale**.

---

### **Step 3: Check for Mode vs. Key**
There is **no emphasis on A minor** (e.g., no E7 leading to Am), and **no use of B♭ or F♯**, which would imply **modal borrowing** or **modulation**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
- **Key:** C major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (the major mode)

This is a **diatonic progression in C major**, despite the inverted bass lines.
