### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at the chords used. The chords listed are C, Am/C, Em/B, Dm/C, and G7/B. Wait, actually, some of these are chord symbols with bass notes. Like Am/C means an A minor chord with C in the bass. Similarly, Am/C is just A minor with C as the bass note. So the actual chords are:

- C (probably C major, root position)
- Am (A minor) but with C in the bass, so it's still A minor
- Em/B - E minor with B in bass
- Dm/C - D minor with C in bass
- G7/B - G7 chord with B in bass

So let's list all the actual chords without the slash:

- C major
- A minor
- E minor
- D minor
- G7

The chord progression has multiple repetitions. Let me map out the progression step by step.

The sequence is:

C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C

So translating the slashes:

- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Am/C (A minor chord with C in bass, so A minor)
- Am/C (same)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Em/B (E minor with B bass)
- Dm/C (D minor with C bass)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Am/C (A minor)
- Am/C (A minor)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- G7/B (G7 with B bass)
- C (C major)

Now, what are the actual chords here? When we have slash chords like Am/C, it's still an A minor chord, but the bass note is C. That means it's the first inversion of A minor. Similarly, Em/B is first inversion of E minor (since E minor is E-G-B; B is the fifth, so it's second inversion? Wait no: E minor chord has notes E, G, B. If B is in the bass, that's E-B-G, which is actually the third inversion? Wait, no. Let's see:

For a triad, the inversions are:

- Root position: root as bass (e.g., E minor: E, G, B)
- First inversion: third in bass (G, B, E)
- Second inversion: fifth in bass (B, E, G)

Yes. So for E minor chord, if the bass is B, which is the fifth of E minor, that's second inversion. Similarly, Dm/C: D minor chord has D, F, A. If bass is C, then it's Dm/C which is not a standard inversion because C isn't part of the chord. Oh wait, D minor chord is D-F-A. So if the bass is C, which is not in the chord, then this is actually a different chord? Wait, maybe Dm/C means a D minor chord with C in the bass. But C isn't part of D minor, so that would be a different chord. Wait, but typically, slash chords indicate the bass note regardless, so the chord would be D minor with C bass. So perhaps it's a D minor 7th? Or maybe it's just a D minor triad but with C as the bass note. But that would mean the chord is D minor with C in the bass, which is unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a C9 or something else? Wait, but usually slash chords just denote the bass note. So Dm/C means D minor triad with C in the bass. So the notes would be C, D, F, A. Wait, but D minor chord is D, F, A. Adding a C in the bass, so the notes are C, D, F, A. That would actually be a C major 7th? Wait, C major 7th is C, E, G, B. Wait, no. If the bass is C, and the upper structure is D minor, then the notes are C, D, F, A. But that's a chord which includes C, D, F, A. That's actually a Cmaj7 with no 5th? Or maybe a D minor 7th? Wait D minor 7th is D, F, A, C. So if the bass is C, then that's Dm7 with C in the bass, which is actually a C9 chord? Wait, no. Dm7 chord is D-F-A-C. If the bass is C, then it's C-D-F-A. So C as bass, then D, F, A above. That would be a C major 7th chord with a 9th? Wait, no. C major 7th is C-E-G-B. Dm7 is D-F-A-C. So if the chord is Dm/C, meaning Dm triad with C in bass, then we have notes C (bass), D, F, A. Which is exactly a Dm7 chord. Because Dm7 is spelled D, F, A, C. So if the bass note is C, then it's a Dm7 chord in third inversion. Similarly, Em/B: E minor chord is E, G, B. If the bass is B, then notes are B, E, G. So B, E, G is a Bdim chord? Wait B, E, G: E is the fourth above B, B to E is a perfect fourth. Wait, actually, the notes B, E, G – B to E is perfect fourth, E to G is minor third. So it's a B minor 7th? Wait no. Let's see. If it's Em/B, then the chord is E minor triad (E, G, B) with B as bass. So B, E, G. So B as root, then E is a perfect fourth, G is a minor sixth. So that would be a B half-diminished chord? B, D, F, A is B half-diminished. Wait, B, E, G – that's B root, E, G. So B to E is 4th, B to G is minor 6th. So the chord is Bsus4? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an Em triad in second inversion. Because the notes are E, G, B; when B is bass, the order is B, E, G. Which is second inversion of E minor. So it's still E minor triad. Similarly, Am/C: A minor triad is A, C, E; with C as bass: C, A, E. So it's Am in first inversion. G7/B: G7 chord is G, B, D, F. If bass is B, then B, G, D, F. Which is B, D, F, G. So that's a B half-diminished chord? Wait, B, D, F is B diminished triad, and G is a major second above B. Wait, no. B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, F to G is major second. So B diminished triad would be B, D, F. But adding G would make it B diminished with added 9th? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, G7/B means G7 chord with B in bass. So the notes would be B, G, D, F. So B as bass, then G (a major 6th above B), D (a perfect 4th), F (a minor 7th). But a G7 chord has notes G, B, D, F. So when B is in the bass, the notes are B, D, F, G. Which is a Bm7b5 chord? Let's check: Bm7b5 would be B, D, F, A. But here we have B, D, F, G. So it's B, D, F, G, which is B7(b9)? No. Maybe just G7 with B as bass, which is a common inversion. In terms of chord function, it's still a G7 chord.

So regardless of the slash notation, when considering the actual chord quality and function, the chords are:

- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Am (A minor, with C bass)
- Am (A minor)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Em (E minor, with B bass)
- Dm (D minor, with C bass – which is actually Dm7)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- Am (A minor)
- Am (A minor)
- C (C major)
- C (C major)
- G7 (G dominant 7th, with B bass)
- C (C major)

So the chord progression is primarily using chords from the key of C major. Let's list the chords used:

C major, A minor, E minor, D minor, G7.

All of these are diatonic to C major. Let's check:

C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B.

Chords in C major:

I: C major

ii: D minor

iii: E minor

IV: F major

V: G major

vi: A minor

vii: B diminished

But in the progression, we have G7 instead of G major. G7 is the dominant seventh in C major. So V7 chord.

So the chords used are:

I (C), vi (A minor), iii (E minor), ii (D minor), V7 (G7).

All of these are diatonic chords in C major. There's no non-diatonic chords here. The slash chords are just inversions, which don't change the key.

So the key is C major. Now, the mode. Wait, mode usually refers to whether it's ionian (major), dorian, phrygian, etc., based on the scale. But since all the chords are diatonic to C major, and the tonic seems to be C (as the progression starts and ends on C), then the key is C major, which is the Ionian mode. But sometimes people talk about mode when a different chord might be the tonic. But in this progression, C seems to be the tonal center because it's the starting chord and the ending chord. Also, the G7 to C resolution is a strong V-I cadence. So that reinforces C as the tonic.

Wait, let's check the progression's cadences. After G7/B, it goes to C. That's V7-I, which is the strongest cadence in major keys. So yes, this progression seems to be in C major.

Are there any other possibilities? Let's see. For example, if someone thought it was in A minor. Let's check. A minor is the relative minor of C major. But the chords in A minor natural would be: i: Am, ii°: Bdim, III: C, iv: Dm, v: Em, VI: F, VII: G. So Am, C, Dm, Em, F, G are all diatonic. But in this progression, the chords used are C, Am, Em, Dm, G7. So in A minor, the G would be a major chord (V), but sometimes in minor keys, the V chord is often raised to G# (for harmonic minor), but here it's G7, which is G-B-D-F. If it's A minor, V chord is traditionally E major (E-G#-B), but G7 is not the V chord in A minor. G7 would be the VII chord in A minor. But in natural minor, the chords are: Am (i), Bdim (ii°), C (III), Dm (iv), Em (v), F (VI), G (VII). So G in natural minor is major? Yes, G major. But G7 would be a dominant 7th chord. In A minor, the V chord is Em, or sometimes E major in harmonic minor. The G7 would be VII7 chord. But usually in minor keys, to get a stronger cadence, you'd use E major or Em7. But here the progression ends on C with G7-B resolving to C. So V7-I to C. That makes it more likely C major. Because in A minor, the V chord would be Em, not G7. If it were in A minor, the dominant chord would be E major (V), but here we have G7 resolving to C. G7 to C is actually V7-I in C major. Wait, no. If the key was A minor, G7 would be VII7 (since in natural minor, VII is G), but G7 chord in A minor would be G-B-D-F, which is a diminished 7th? Wait no. G7 chord. In the key of A minor, the natural minor scale has G as the VII degree, which is a major chord. So G major. But G7 would have a minor 7th (F), so G-B-D-F. Yes, that's the VII7 chord. But typically, in a minor key, the cadence from VII to i is common, but here the progression ends on C, not on Am. Wait the progression here ends on C. So the last chord is C. So if the key was A minor, the tonic is Am, but the progression ends on C, which is the III chord. That wouldn't make sense as a resolution. Whereas if it's C major, ending on C is tonic.

The progression starts and ends on C, and uses the V7-I cadence (G7 to C), which is the strongest possible resolution in major keys. So this is definitely C major.

Now, about mode. Since it's using the major scale, it's the Ionian mode. But sometimes people confuse the key with mode. But typically, when people say "key", they refer to the tonic and major/minor. In this case, C major. There's no indication of a different mode being used here. All the chords are from the C major scale. If there were a different chord, like F# or something, that might shift. But here everything is diatonic C major.

Wait, let me see again: the chords used are C, Am, Em, Dm, G7. All diatonic to C major. The scale is C D E F G A B. All chords fit.

So the key is C major. Mode would be Ionian (which is the same as major key).

But let me check if there's a different possible mode. For example, if the progression were emphasizing A minor as the tonic, but the progression ends on C, which doesn't support that. If the progression had a lot of Am chords and ended on Am, then maybe Aeolian mode. But here it's C major. So the key is C major, mode is Ionian.

Alternatively, sometimes people might refer to the mode based on scale, but if it's a major key, Ionian.

Wait, but the user might not know the difference between key and mode. So perhaps they're asking for key (tonic and major/minor) and mode. So key would be C major, mode is Ionian.

But perhaps some would just say the key is C major and not specify mode since major key is Ionian. But technically, yes.

Wait, but let me check the progression for any modal characteristics. Are there any chords that wouldn't be diatonic in C major? Let's see: all chords used are C, Em (iii), Dm (ii), Am (vi), G7 (V7). In C major, yes. So no non-diatonic chords.

What about the G7: dominant 7th is common in major keys for the V chord. So it's definitely a major key.

Another way to check: what is the tonic chord? C. Cadences: G7 to C is V7-I. That's a perfect cadence in C major.

Another cadence: let's see the progression. After the Am, it goes to C, which is vi-I, also a common resolution. But the strongest resolution is G7 to C.

So yes, C major.

Is there any chance of it being in a different key? Let's see. Suppose the key was G major. But chords in G major would have F#, but no F# in here. The chords are all C, Am, Em, Dm, G. In G major, the chords would be G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim. But here, there's a Dm instead of D major. So D minor is not diatonic in G major. So no. So it's not G major.

If it were F major. In F major, chords would include Bb. But here, no Bb. G7 chord is G-B-D-F, which in F major, B is a note in the scale? F major scale is F G A Bb C D E. So Bb is flat. But G7 has a B natural, which is not in F major. So that's not diatonic. So no.

E major: too many sharps. Not likely. A minor: as before, but the progression ends on C, not A.

So definitely C major.

Therefore, key is C major, mode is Ionian.

But the user asked to determine key and mode. So key = C major, mode = Ionian. But sometimes people just refer to the key as C major, since Ionian is the major scale. So perhaps the answer is key C major, mode Ionian.

Alternatively, maybe they just want to know the key as in the tonic note and major/minor. But in this case, since it's major, the key is C major, and mode is Ionian.

But in some contexts, people might say the mode is major, but technically Ionian is the mode for major. Aeolian for natural minor.

So the answer should be Key: C major (Ionian mode). But maybe just "C Major Ionian" or "Key: C, Mode: Ionian".

Wait, let me make sure. Let's check if any of the chords are outside of C major. No. G7 is V7, which is standard in major keys. C major has a G7 as the dominant. Yes.

Another check: looking at the bass line. Let's see the bass notes for each chord.

- C: bass C

- C: bass C

- Am/C: bass C (since slash C means C is the bass)

- Am/C: bass C

- C: C

- C: C

- Em/B: bass B (since Em/B, B is the bass note)

- Dm/C: bass C

- C: C

- C: C

- Am/C: C

- Am/C: C

- C: C

- C: C

- G7/B: bass B

- C: C

Wait, the bass line: C, C, C, C, C, C, B, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, B, C.

So the bass goes mostly C, with some B notes. The B in the bass for Em/B and G7/B.

In C major, the bass notes would typically be notes from C major scale. B is in C major. So yes.

The progression has a lot of C in bass, which reinforces C as tonic. The G7/B chord has B as bass, which is the 3rd of G7, so it's the third inversion. And then resolves to C. So the V7 to I cadence.

So everything points to C major.

Is there any chance it's in another key? Suppose someone thought it was D Dorian. D Dorian is D E F G A B C D. So scale has B natural. Then the chords. Dm is i, Em is ii, but then in D Dorian, the chords would be: Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, C. But G chord is major, which is part of Dorian. Wait Dorian mode has natural 6th and minor 7th? Wait Dorian: root, major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, major 6th, minor 7th. So D Dorian: D E F G A B C. So yes. So chords in D Dorian:

i: Dm

ii: Em

III: F

IV: G

v: Am

vi°: Bdim

VII: C

But in that case, the VI chord (Bdim) is diminished, but in the given progression, there's no Bdim. The chords present: C, Am, Em, Dm, G, G7.

If in D Dorian, G is IV, but C would be VII chord. A C chord as a resolution in D Dorian? Not typical. Usually, Dorian mode would have cadences back to Dm. But here the progression ends on C. So that's less likely.

If we look at the progression ending on C, it would sound like C is the tonal center. If it were D Dorian, the tonic would be D, but the progression isn't ending on D. So probably not.

Similarly, if it were A Aeolian: A B C D E F G. Then the chords would be Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G. So similar to natural minor. But again, the progression ends on C, not A. So not likely.

So definitely C major.

Another check: the chord G7 is a dominant seventh, typically used to resolve to I. In C major, yes. So V7-I.

So yes.

Therefore, the key is C major and the mode is Ionian.

But sometimes, the mode is just specified as major if it's the Ionian. But technically, the mode is Ionian.

So the answer should be: Key: C, Mode: Ionian.

Alternatively, "Key: C major (Ionian mode)".

But to be precise.

Wait, maybe the user expects just the key, and mode is not always specified. But they asked for both. So I think the answer is C Major Ionian. Or Key: C major, Mode: Ionian.

Yes.

But to check if there's any accidental modulation or something, but looking at the entire progression, it's very consistently C major chords, with strong cadences to C.

So final answer: the key is C major and the mode is Ionian.

The chord progression provided is:  
**C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C**

### Step 1: Analyze the chords (ignoring slash notation for simplicity):
- **C** = C major (I)  
- **Am/C** = A minor (vi) with C in bass (first inversion)  
- **Em/B** = E minor (iii) with B in bass (second inversion)  
- **Dm/C** = D minor (ii) with C in bass (third inversion of Dm7, but functionally D minor)  
- **G7/B** = G dominant 7th (V7) with B in bass (third inversion)  

All chords are **diatonic to the C major scale** (C, D, E, F, G, A, B). Here's the breakdown of their functions:  
- **C** = Tonic (I)  
- **Am** = Submediant (vi)  
- **Em** = Mediant (iii)  
- **Dm** = Supertonic (ii)  
- **G7** = Dominant 7th (V7)  

### Step 2: Check for tonal center:
- The progression **starts and ends on C**, the tonic pitch.  
- The cadence **G7 → C** is a classic **dominant-to-tonic (V7-I) resolution**, the strongest indicator of a major key.  
- No non-diatonic chords (e.g., no F♯, B♭, etc.) appear, confirming the scale is purely **C major**.  

### Step 3: Determine mode:
- **C major** uses the **Ionian mode** (the standard major scale: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7).  
- There is no evidence of modal inflection (e.g., no lowered 3rd, 6th, or 7th for aeolian/dorian/etc.). The progression consistently resolves to C as the tonal center with typical major-key harmony.  

---

### Final Answer:  
- **Key**: **C major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian**  

This progression is a straightforward example of the **C major key** with no modal ambiguity. The G7 → C cadence solidifies C as the tonic, and all chords align with diatonic harmony in C major (Ionian mode).
