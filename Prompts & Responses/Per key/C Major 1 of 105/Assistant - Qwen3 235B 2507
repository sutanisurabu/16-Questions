Let's analyze the given chord progression to determine the **key** and possible **mode**:

### Chord progression:
```
C   C   Am/C   Am/C   C   C   Em/B
Dm/C   C   C   Am/C   Am/C   C   C   G7/B   C
```

First, simplify the chords by considering the **bass note** and identifying each chord:

---

### Step 1: Identify the chords

We need to interpret slashes like **Am/C**, **Em/B**, **Dm/C**, and **G7/B**:

- **Am/C**: A minor with C in the bass → **C-E-G** → This is **C major 6th** (C6), since C-E-G-A is C6. So Am/C ≈ **C6** or functionally **C major with an added 6th**. But harmonically, it's still rooted in **C major** or **A minor**.
- **Em/B**: E minor with B in the bass → **B-D-E-G** → This is like a **Bm7♭5 (half-diminished)** without the 7th (B-D-F-G), but E minor over B is **Bm7♭5 (B half-diminished)** if extended. Actually, E minor over B: B-D-E-G → B D E G → intervals: B to D (m3), D to E (M2), E to G (m3). So it's **B-D-F-G** would be Bm7♭5, but here it's **B-D-E-G** — that's not a standard 7th chord. Wait: Em is E-G-B, so Em/B is B-D-E-G → notes: **B, D, E, G**. That's **Bm7♭5 (B half-diminished)** missing the **F**? No — Em has **G**, not **F**.

Wait: Em is **E-G-B**, so Em/B = **B, E, G, B** → bass is B, with E, G, B. Notes: **B, E, G, B** → B-D-E-G missing D? No: Em is E, G, B, so Em/B = **B, E, G, B** → that’s **B, E, G**. So the notes are **B, E, G**. That’s **B diminished** (B-D-F), but we have **B, E, G** → B to E is a **perfect 4th**, E to G is **minor 3rd**. Not a standard triad. Actually, **B-E-G** is the second inversion of **Em**, so it's just **Em** chord with **B in the bass** — functionally **Em**, but bass emphasizes the 5th.

Similarly:
- **Dm/C** = Dm (D-F-A) over C → **C, D, F, A** → C major 9th **without the third and 7th**? Not quite. C-D-F-A → that’s like **C9 sus4** or **Cadd9 (no 3rd)**. But Dm/C = **C-D-F-A** → it emphasizes a **Dorian** flavor or a **Cadd9**.
- **G7/B** = G7 with B in bass → G7 = G-B-D-F, so G7/B = **B, D, F, G** → B-D-F-G → that’s **Bm7♭5 (B half-diminished)**, a common **vii°7** in C major.

So, let’s re-interpret all chords in terms of root and function:

| Chord     | Notes             | Interpretation                         |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| C         | C-E-G             | Tonic (I)                              |
| Am/C      | C-E-G-A           | C6 (I6) or Am in first inversion         |
| Em/B      | B-D-E-G? Wait — Em is E-G-B, so Em/B = B, E, G → notes: B, E, G → not a full 7th. |
Wait: Let's fix this.

### Clarify slash chords:

- **Am/C**: A minor triad (A-C-E) over C bass → **C-A-C-E** → notes: **C, A, E** → **C major 6th (C6)** chord. Functionally, this is **C6**, which is a **C major** chord with an added 6th. So it's still tonic harmony.
- **Em/B**: E minor (E-G-B) over B bass → **B-E-G-B** → notes: **B, E, G**. B to E is a P4, E to G is m3. This is **Em/B**, a voicing, but the chord is still **Em**, just with B (the 5th) in bass. Harmonically, it's **Em (ii chord in C major)**.
- **Dm/C**: D minor (D-F-A) over C → **C-D-F-A** → notes: C, D, F, A → this is **Cadd9**, again a tonic variant.
- **G7/B**: G7 (G-B-D-F) over B → **B, G, B, D, F** → notes: **B, D, F, G** → that’s **Bm7♭5** (B-D-F-G), which is the **vii°7** chord in C major.

So all the slash chords are just inversions or extensions of diatonic chords in **C major**.

### Simplified Chord Progression:

Let’s rewrite the progression replacing slash chords with their harmonic function in C major:

```
C     → I
C     → I
Am/C → C6 (I6) or just C with A → still tonic
Am/C → same
C     → I
C     → I
Em/B → Em in first inversion → ii (but Em is iii in C major!)
Wait! In C major: chords are:

C (I), Dm (ii), Em (iii), F (IV), G (V), Am (vi), Bdim (vii°)

So:
- Em is **iii**
- Dm is **ii**
- G7 is **V7**
```

So let's map:

```
C       → I
C       → I
Am/C    → vi chord over C bass → Am is vi, so vi/C → but functionally, still **vi** with pedal tone
Am/C    → same
C       → I
C       → I
Em/B    → iii/B → B is the 5th of Em, so Em chord, bass on 5th → still **iii**
Dm/C    → ii/C → Dm chord over C bass → **ii** with pedal
C       → I
C       → I
Am/C    → vi
Am/C    → vi
C       → I
C       → I
G7/B    → V7/iii? No → G7 is **V7**, B in bass → **V7**
C       → I
```

Wait — G7 is **dominant of C**, so **V7**, not V7/iii.

So the full progression:

```
C – C – Am/C – Am/C – C – C – Em/B – Dm/C – C – C – Am/C – Am/C – C – C – G7/B – C
```

Grouped:

Bars (say, 4/4) – likely 2 beats per chord?

Let’s assume 2-chord per bar (16 chords = 8 bars).

Progression:
1. C     C     | Am/C  Am/C  |
2. C     C     | Em/B  Dm/C  |
3. C     C     | Am/C  Am/C  |
4. C     C     | G7/B  C     |

Now, analyze harmonic function in **C major**:

- C (I)
- Am/C → vi over C → could be **vi**, but with pedal C, might sound like **C6** → tonic
- Em → iii
- Dm → ii
- G7 → V7
- C → I

So the **underlying harmonic movement**:
I – vi – I – iii – ii – V7 – I

That’s a very common progression in **C major**.

In fact:
**I – vi – I – iii – ii – V – I** is a classic “pop” or jazz sequence.

Example: “Heart and Soul”, “Blue Moon”, etc.

Also, **ii – V – I** is a standard cadence.

Here, before the final cadence, we have:
C – C – Am/C – Am/C → I – I – vi – vi  
C – C – Em/B → I – I – iii  
Dm/C → ii  
C – C – Am/C – Am/C → I – I – vi – vi  
C – C – G7/B – C → I – I – V7 – I

So the overall structure moves from I to vi to iii to ii to V to I.

All chords are **diatonic to C major**:
- C (I)
- Dm (ii)
- Em (iii)
- Am (vi)
- G7 (V7) — G7 is dominant, diatonic to C major

No accidentals. All chords use only white keys.

### Conclusion:

- **Key**: **C major**
- **Mode**: The progression uses chords from the **Ionian mode** (major scale). There is no modal mixture or characteristic modal movement (like avoiding the leading tone, or emphasizing the 6th or 7th).

G7 contains **B natural**, the leading tone, which strongly points to **tonic C**. This is characteristic of **major key** tonality, not Dorian or Mixolydian.

For example:
- If it were **C Mixolydian**, we’d expect G major, not G7 (G7 has F, which is ♭7 — wait, no: G7 is G-B-D-F → F is ♭7 of G, but in C, F is just the 4th). G7 is perfectly diatonic to C major.

No chords suggest another mode.

The repeated use of **C** as pedal or tonic, and the **ii–V–I** cadence, confirms a **tonic center on C**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **Key**: **C major**
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (the natural major mode)

This progression is firmly in **C major (Ionian mode)**.
