Let’s analyze this chord progression step by step.

### Chord list
C | C | Am/C | Am/C | C | C | Em/B | Dm/C |  
C | C | Am/C | Am/C | C | C | G7/B | C

---

### Step 1: Identify the possible tonic
- The chord **C** is overwhelmingly present.
- The final cadence is **G7/B → C**, which strongly suggests a V–I resolution in **C major**.

So, **C** is likely the tonic.

### Step 2: Examine the other chords in relation to C major

| Chord  | Function in C major | Notes   |
|:------:|:-------------------:|:--------|
| C      | I                  | tonic |
| Am/C   | vi in 1st inversion | shares notes with C major (A–C–E) |
| Em/B   | iii in 1st inversion | diatonic to C major |
| Dm/C   | ii⁷ (without the 3rd) or ii in 3rd inversion | diatonic |
| G7/B   | V⁷ in 1st inversion | leads to C strongly |

All of these chords are diatonic to **C major**.

---

### Step 3: Check the mode
No accidentals or modal inflections appear (no F♯ or B♭), so this is plainly **C major**, not C Mixolydian or C Ionian with alterations.

---

✅ **Conclusion**

- **Key:** C major  
- **Mode:** Ionian (major)  

**Reasoning:** The strong presence of C major, the G7/B → C cadence, and all-diatonic harmony confirm the C major tonality.
