The provided chord progression is:

**C C Am/C Am/C C C Em/B Dm/C C C Am/C Am/C C C G7/B C**

To determine the key and mode, we look at the primary chords and the harmonic movement, especially the final cadence.

### 1. Identify the Chords and Potential Key Centers

The main chords used are:
* **C Major (I)**
* **A minor (Am) (vi)**
* **E minor (Em) (iii)**
* **D minor (Dm) (ii)**
* **G7 (V7)**

All these chords (C, Dm, Em, F [implied], G7, Am) are diatonic to the key of **C Major**.

### 2. Analyze the Harmonic Movement and Cadence

The progression begins and ends on **C Major**.

* **Tonic Function:** C acts as the tonic throughout, grounding the progression.
* **Dominant Function:** The progression ends with the cadence **G7/B -> C** (V7 -> I). This is a strong **Authentic Cadence** which firmly establishes **C** as the tonic.

### 3. Determine the Mode

Since the key center is C, and the harmonic language uses the standard major chords and the V7-I cadence, the mode is **Major**.

### Conclusion

Based on the diatonic chords and the strong V7-I cadence establishing C as the tonic, the key and mode are:

* **Key:** **C**
* **Mode:** **Major**

(The chord progression is essentially a variation on the C major scale, focusing on the I, vi, ii, iii, and V chords.)
