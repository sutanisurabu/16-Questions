Given chord sequence:

```
F   F   Dm/F Dm/F  
F   F   Am/E G7/F  
F   F   Dm/F Dm/F  
F   F   Cmaj7/E F
```

1. **Identify all the roots appearing in the chords:**  
   F, D, A, G, C – therefore the collection is  
   F G A C D → a 5-note set.  

2. **Arrange those notes as a scale starting on F:**  
   F – G – A – C – D = 1 – 2 – 3 – 5 – 6  
   The 4th (B♭) and 7th (E) are missing, a classic pentatonic
   collection built on the tonic F.

3. **Look at the cadence:**  
   The progression keeps returning to F major triads; the only
   non-diatonic bass note is the passing E under Cmaj7, which simply
   supplies the major 7th of F (E) before the final tonic.  There is
   no B♭ anywhere, hence no Mixolydian colour, and no minor 3rd (A♭)
   that would point to F minor.  All harmonic tension (G7) is
   directed straight back to F.

Therefore the passage is in:

**F Ionian (major) pentatonic.**
