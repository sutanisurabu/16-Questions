### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to identify the key and mode from the chord progression: "F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F." The bass mostly features F and E notes, particularly in Am/E and Cmaj7/E, while G7/F also has F in the bass.

The chords I'm working with are F, Dm/F, Am/E, G7/F, and Cmaj7/E. 

For Dm/F, it’s a D minor triad over F bass, suggesting it’s in first inversion. But I’m contemplating its functional role within F major.**Clarifying chord functions**

I’m analyzing the chord progression further. Dm is indeed the vi chord in F major, which helps me understand that Dm/F is a vi6 with the third in the bass, similar to a tonic pedal.

Then there’s Am/E, which is an A minor chord with E in the bass, acting as the leading tone in F major. This is interesting because it sits outside the F pedal but still connects back to E.

Regarding G7/F, it's a G7 chord over F bass and it functions as V/V within F major.**Examining secondary dominants**

I’m evaluating the G7 chord, which comprises G, B, D, and F. This makes it a dominant seventh chord built on the 2nd degree, but since F major contains Bb, B natural is non-diatonic. Thus, G7 functions as a secondary dominant V/V in the key of F. 

It’s interesting since G7/F is like a third-inversion seventh chord with F as the bass. 

Later, I notice Cmaj7/E also has B natural, serving as the Vmaj7 in F major, common in jazz but less so in classical.**Identifying tonal context**

The presence of B natural suggests a Lydian context or a raised 4 in F. Typically, the V chord in F major is C7 with Bb, instead of B natural. Interestingly, many jazz contexts use Cmaj7 as the V of F Lydian, which isn’t typical. 

This raised fourth alters the usual resolution, as it loses the tritone that resolves to the tonic. Analyzing the progression reveals a lot of F chords, indicating a tonic pedal, while the chords with E in the bass lead to a nice stepwise resolution from E to F.**Determining key and mode**

The presence of B natural strongly indicates F Lydian mode, the 4th degree of C major. Analyzing the chords, F major is the I chord, and Dm is the vi chord in F Lydian. 

G7 is diatonically part of this mode, explaining G7/F as a II7 in third inversion. Dm/F is vi6, while Am/E acts as iii 6/4. Cmaj7/E serves as Vmaj7 in first inversion, supporting F Lydian because all chords are diatonic to this scale. 

Thus, the conclusion is: key center F, mode Lydian.

F Lydian.

Reason: F is the clear tonal center (persistent F/pedal and cadences to F), and the chords are diatonic to F Lydian, notably the presence of B natural in G7 and Cmaj7 (which rules out F major).
