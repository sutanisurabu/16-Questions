**Key:** F  
**Mode:** Lydian  

This progression is diatonic to the F Lydian scale (F G A B C D E), which accommodates the B natural in the G7 and Cmaj7 chords. The tonic is clearly F, as the progression begins and ends there, centers around an F pedal in the bass for most measures, and uses the Cmaj7/E as a subdominant (IVmaj7) leading to a plagal resolution on F. The Am/E G7/F acts as a brief iiiâ€“II7 (or secondary dominant) detour with chromatic tension that resolves back to the tonic, but everything stays within the Lydian framework without needing external borrowing.
