### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to analyze the chord progression: "F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F." The repeated F chord suggests a tonal center likely in F major. The slash chords, like Dm/F and Am/E, provide more context. Dm is the vi chord in F major, with F in the bass. G7 serves as a secondary dominant, hinting at the harmony. Overall, it appears to support F major tonality.**Analyzing chord functions**

I realize that in the key of F major, the ii chord is Gm, and its dominant should be D7, not G7. Although G7 can function as V7/ii in C major, in F major, G7 serves as a secondary dominant of C, meaning it's V/V in F major. The G7/F is a third inversion 7th chord, which adds complexity. As for Cmaj7/E, it functions as V in F major, but Cmaj7 includes B natural, which is outside the F major scale.**Identifying key and mode**

So, Cmaj7 has B natural, which acts as a leading tone to C and gives a Lydian feel. In the context of C major, Cmaj7 is the Imaj7 chord, and with E in the bass, it's in the first inversion. However, the progression predominantly centers around F, which reinforces the tonic. Chords like Dm/F and G7/F contain F in the bass, while Am/E and Cmaj7/E have E in the bass. Given this, the key is likely F major, and with G7 containing B natural, it hints at F Lydian rather than Ionian.**Examining chord functions**

I’m considering whether Cmaj7 functions as V/V and if Cmaj7 includes a major 7th in the context of F major. Typically, C7 would be the dominant seventh, but using Cmaj7 implies V without the flat seventh. This inclusion of B natural suggests Lydian #4. However, Cmaj7 doesn’t act dominantly; instead, it feels more like IV in G. The progression shows Cmaj7/E resolving to F, where E resolves to F and B smoothly moves to C. It creates a nice transition!**Finalizing key and mode**

The repeated F chords clearly indicate F as the tonic, which leads me to conclude that the key is likely F major. However, the presence of B natural in G7 and Cmaj7 points towards a Lydian mode. In F Lydian, G7 is diatonic, becoming a dominant seventh because of the raised fourth. Also, Cmaj7 fits perfectly in Lydian with its major seventh. So my final answer is: Key: F; Mode: Lydian. The F pedal reinforces the tonic relationship nicely!**Crafting the response**

I'm going to keep it clear and concise. I'll state the tonal center as F and the mode as Lydian because of the presence of B natural in G7 and Cmaj7, which makes II7 and Vmaj7 diatonic to Lydian. For added clarity, I might include the optional scale: F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. That should wrap up my answer nicely. It's straightforward and gets the point across!

F Lydian.

Reason: F is the clear tonal center (repeated F chords and F pedal tones in Dm/F and G7/F). The presence of B natural in G7 (G–B–D–F) and Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B) makes these chords diatonic only in F Lydian (scale: F G A B C D E), not in F Ionian.
