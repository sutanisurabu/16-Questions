**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, the user has given a sequence of chords: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

I need to determine the key and mode. This looks like a chord progression in music theory.

Recall that in music, the key refers to the tonal center, and mode refers to whether it's major or minor, or other modes.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- F

- F

- Dm/F

- Dm/F

- F

- F

- Am/E

- G7/F

- F

- F

- Dm/F

- Dm/F

- F

- F

- Cmaj7/E

- F

Some chords have slashes, like Dm/F, which means D minor chord with F in the bass. Similarly, Am/E is A minor with E in the bass, G7/F is G dominant 7th with F in the bass, and Cmaj7/E is C major 7th with E in the bass.

The bass notes are important because they can indicate the root or suggest inversions, but for determining key, I should focus on the chord qualities and their relationships.

Let me extract the root chords without the bass notes for simplicity, but since the bass is part of the harmony, I need to consider the full chord.

Perhaps I can think of the chords as they are and see what key they might belong to.

List the chord types:

- F major (appears multiple times)

- Dm/F: this is D minor chord, but with F in bass, so it's an inversion. D minor is the chord.

- Similarly, Am/E: A minor chord with E bass

- G7/F: G dominant 7th with F bass

- Cmaj7/E: C major 7th with E bass

The progression has a lot of F major chords, and ends on F, so F might be the tonic.

Now, let's see the other chords:

- Dm: D minor

- Am: A minor

- G7: G dominant 7th

- Cmaj7: C major 7th

In the key of F major, the diatonic chords are:

- I: F major

- ii: G minor

- iii: A minor

- IV: Bb major

- V: C major

- vi: D minor

- vii°: E diminished

But here we have:

- Dm: which is vi in F major

- Am: which is iii in F major

- G7: G dominant 7th, which is not diatonic to F major; in F major, the V chord should be C major, not G. G7 is V7 in C major, but here it's in the context of F.

G7/F is G7 with F bass, which is unusual. G7 is dominant to C, but in F key, it might be a secondary dominant or something.

Also, Cmaj7/E is C major 7th with E bass, which could be I in C or IV in G, but in F, C is V.

Let's list all unique chords without inversions for key analysis:

- F major

- D minor

- A minor

- G dominant 7th

- C major 7th

Now, in F major:

- F is I

- Dm is vi

- Am is iii

- G7 is not diatonic; it would be V7/IV or something? G7 is the dominant of C, and in F, C is V, so G7 could be V7/V, meaning dominant of the dominant.

In F major, the dominant is C, so V7/V would be G7, which resolves to C, and then C could resolve to F.

In this progression, we have G7/F, which is G7 with F bass, so it's like a G7 chord but with F in bass, which might be a suspension or something, but let's see the resolution.

The progression ends on F, and there are many F chords, so F is likely the tonic.

Now, look at the sequence: it starts and ends with F, and has Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7.

Dm is vi, Am is iii, G7 is V7/V, Cmaj7 is V with maj7, which is not typical dominant; dominant usually has minor 7th, but Cmaj7 is major 7th, so it's not a dominant chord; it's a tonic or subdominant feel.

In C major, Cmaj7 is I, but here it's in F context.

Perhaps the key is F major, and G7 is a secondary dominant to C, and Cmaj7 is the V chord but with maj7, which might be a borrowed chord or something.

But Cmaj7/E is C major 7th with E bass, so the chord is Cmaj7, and E is the third, so it's in first inversion or something.

Similarly, Am/E is A minor with E bass, E is the fifth of Am, so it's in second inversion? Am chord is A-C-E, so with E in bass, it's Am/E, which is A minor in second inversion.

In chord notation, / means bass note, so Am/E means A minor chord with E in bass.

Similarly, Dm/F means D minor with F in bass, F is the third of Dm, so it's first inversion.

G7/F means G7 with F in bass, F is the minor 7th of G7, so it's third inversion or something? G7 is G-B-D-F, so with F in bass, it's G7 with the 7th in bass.

Cmaj7/E is C-E-G-B with E in bass, so first inversion.

Now, back to key.

Let's see the chord progression in terms of roots and qualities.

Perhaps I can ignore the inversions for key determination and focus on the chord roots and types.

So the chord roots are: F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7.

F major, D minor, A minor, G dominant 7th, C major 7th.

In F major scale: F G A Bb C D E F

Chords: F maj, G min, A min, Bb maj, C maj, D min, E dim

So:

- F maj: I

- D min: vi

- A min: iii

- G7: not diatonic; G7 has B and F, B is not in F major (F major has Bb), so G7 has B natural, which is the leading tone in C major.

Similarly, Cmaj7 has B natural, which is not in F major scale; F major has Bb.

F major scale: F G A Bb C D E F, so B natural is not in the scale; it's Bb.

But in G7, the notes are G B D F, so B natural, and in Cmaj7, C E G B, so B natural.

Whereas in F major, it should be Bb.

So, the presence of B natural suggests that we might be in a key where B natural is part of the scale.

Perhaps the key is C major? Let's check.

In C major: C D E F G A B C

Chords: C maj, D min, E min, F maj, G maj, A min, B dim

But here we have F maj, D min, A min, G7, Cmaj7.

G7 is V7 in C major, and Cmaj7 is I with maj7.

But the progression starts and ends with F, not C. It has many F chords, and ends on F, so F might be the tonic.

In C major, F is IV.

But if it ends on F, and F is not I in C, it might not be tonic.

Perhaps it's in F mixolydian or something.

Mixolydian mode has b7, so in F mixolydian: F G A Bb C D Eb F? No, mixolydian is major scale with b7.

Standard modes:

- Ionian (major): W W H W W W H

- Dorian: W H W W W H W

- Phrygian: H W W W H W W

- Lydian: W W W H W W H

- Mixolydian: W W H W W H W

- Aeolian (natural minor): W H W W H W W

- Locrian: H W W H W W W

For F:

- F Ionian: F G A Bb C D E F

- F Dorian: F G Ab Bb C D Eb F

- F Phrygian: F Gb Ab Bb C Db Eb F

- F Lydian: F G A B C D E F

- F Mixolydian: F G A Bb C D Eb F

- F Aeolian: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb F

- F Locrian: F Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F (but Cb is B, etc., messy)

In the chords, we have B natural in G7 and Cmaj7, so B natural is present.

In F Lydian, the scale is F G A B C D E F, so B natural.

And in F Lydian, the chords would be:

- I: F maj

- ii: G min

- iii: A min

- IV#: B maj? Wait, in Lydian, the fourth is augmented, but chords are built on scale degrees.

F Lydian scale: F G A B C D E F

Chords:

- I: F maj (F A C)

- ii: G min (G B D) — B is natural, so G min has B natural? G min is G Bb D, but in Lydian, B is natural, so G chord would be G B D, which is G major, not G minor.

Let's list diatonic chords in F Lydian:

Scale degrees: 1 F, 2 G, 3 A, 4 B, 5 C, 6 D, 7 E

Chords:

- I: F maj (F A C)

- ii: G maj (G B D) — because 2 is G, major third B

- iii: A min (A C E) — 3 is A, minor third C? A to C is minor third, yes A min

- IV: B dim (B D F) — 4 is B, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, so diminished

- V: C maj (C E G)

- vi: D min (D F A)

- vii: E min (E G B)

In F Lydian:

- I: F maj

- ii: G maj

- iii: A min

- IV: B dim

- V: C maj

- vi: D min

- vii: E min

Now, in the progression, we have:

- F maj (I)

- D min (vi)

- A min (iii)

- G7 — G7 is G B D F, which is dominant 7th, but in Lydian, the ii chord is G maj, not G7. G7 has F, which is the b7, but in Lydian, the 7th is E, so F is not in the scale? F Lydian has F G A B C D E, so notes are F G A B C D E, so F is root, G, A, B, C, D, E. G7 has G B D F, but F is the note, which is the root? No, G7 has notes G B D F, and F is the 7th, but in F Lydian, the scale has F as 1, so the note F is present, but for G chord, the 7th would be F, which is the root of the scale? Let's see intervals.

In F Lydian, the note F is 1, G is 2, A is 3, B is 4, C is 5, D is 6, E is 7.

For a chord on G: G is 2, so if we build a triad: G B D, B is 4, D is 6. In major scale, 2 is minor, but in Lydian, since 4 is augmented? Lydian has #4, so from G, the intervals: G to B is major third (since B is 4 of F, but for G chord, from G to B is a major third because B is three half-steps from G? G to B is two whole steps? G to A is whole, A to B is whole, so G to B is two whole steps, which is major third, yes. G to B is major third.

Then G to D: G to A whole, A to B whole, B to C half, C to D whole, so G to D is perfect fifth? G to D is perfect fifth, yes.

So G B D is G major triad.

Now, for 7th chord, if we add the 7th, which is F? The 7th note from G in the scale: in F Lydian, the notes are F G A B C D E, so from G, the 7th is F? No, the 7th of G is F#, but in this scale, the note after G is A, then B, etc. The scale degrees relative to G: if G is 2, then the 7th of G would be the note that is a minor 7th above G, which is F, but in equal temperament, minor 7th is 10 half-steps, G to F is 10 half-steps? G to F is 10 half-steps? G to G# is 1, to A is 2, to A# is 3, to B is 4, to C is 5, to C# is 6, to D is 7, to D# is 8, to E is 9, to F is 10, yes G to F is 10 half-steps, which is minor 7th.

But in F Lydian, the note F is the tonic, so from G, the minor 7th is F, which is the root of the scale.

In terms of chord, if we build a 7th chord on G in F Lydian: notes G B D F, so G B D F is G7 chord, which is dominant 7th.

G B D F: G to B is major third, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, so it's a major triad with minor 7th, yes dominant 7th.

And in F Lydian, the ii chord is G7? Earlier I said ii is G maj, but with 7th, it's G7.

In diatonic 7th chords in Lydian:

- I maj7: F A C E

- ii7: G B D F — which is G7

- iii7: A C E G — A min7

- IV maj7#5? B D F A — B D F is diminished, A is maj7? B to A is major 7th, but B D F is diminished triad, so B half-dim7? B D F A, B to D min3, D to F min3, F to A maj3? Half-diminished 7th has min3, min3, maj3? Standard half-diminished is min3, min3, maj3, yes, so B D F A is B half-dim7.

- V7: C E G B — C maj7? C E G B is C major 7th

- vi7: D F A C — D min7

- vii7: E G B D — E min7

In F Lydian:

- I: F maj7

- ii: G7

- iii: A min7

- IV: B half-dim7

- V: C maj7

- vi: D min7

- vii: E min7

Now, in the progression, we have:

- F (assume maj, but no 7th specified, could be triads)

- Dm (D min)

- Am (A min)

- G7

- Cmaj7

And the bass inversions, but for key, let's see if they fit.

In F Lydian:

- F maj: I

- D min: vi

- A min: iii

- G7: ii7

- Cmaj7: V maj7

And the progression has many F chords, starts and ends with F, so likely tonic is F.

Moreover, in the sequence, there is Am/E, which is A min with E bass, and in F Lydian, E is the 7th, so it's fine.

Dm/F is D min with F bass, F is tonic.

G7/F is G7 with F bass, which is the 7th of G7 in bass.

Cmaj7/E is C maj7 with E bass, E is the 3rd.

Now, is there any chord that doesn't fit? In F Lydian, all chords seem to fit: F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7 are all diatonic to F Lydian.

F Lydian has B natural, and G7 has B natural, Cmaj7 has B natural, so yes.

In F major, G7 would have B natural which is not diatonic, but in Lydian, it is.

Also, the progression ends on F, and has a plagal feel or something.

The sequence: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

So, it starts with F, then Dm/F (which is vi with I in bass), then back to F, then Am/E (iii with 7th in bass? Am/E is A min with E bass, E is 5th of Am), then G7/F (ii7 with 7th in bass), then F, then Dm/F, then F, then Cmaj7/E (V maj7 with 3rd in bass), then F.

The Cmaj7/E to F: Cmaj7 is V in Lydian, but in Lydian, V is major 7th, which is not dominant; dominant should have minor 7th for tension, but here it's maj7, so it might not have strong dominant function, but in this context, it resolves to F.

In Lydian mode, the V chord is major 7th, which is less tense, but it can still resolve to I.

Moreover, in the progression, G7 is used, which is ii7, and in Lydian, ii7 is dominant 7th, which can have some tension.

But let's see if there's a better fit.

Perhaps it's in C major, but it starts and ends with F, and F is IV in C, so if it ends on IV, it might not feel tonic, but in some progressions, it could be, but less likely.

Another possibility: F mixolydian? F mixolydian has Bb and Eb, but here we have B natural in G7 and Cmaj7, so no Bb, so not mixolydian.

F Ionian has Bb, but here B natural is used, so not Ionian.

F Lydian has B natural, so it fits.

Now, what about the mode? Lydian is a major mode, so key is F Lydian.

But in traditional music, Lydian is less common, but in jazz or modern music, it's possible.

The chord progression has a lot of F and Dm, which are I and vi in Lydian.

Also, Am is iii, G7 is ii7, Cmaj7 is V.

In the sequence, G7/F might be functioning as a passing chord or something.

But overall, it seems to fit F Lydian.

To confirm, let's list the notes used in the chords.

Chords:

- F: F A C

- Dm: D F A (with F bass in Dm/F, but chord is Dm)

- Am: A C E (with E bass in Am/E)

- G7: G B D F (with F bass in G7/F)

- Cmaj7: C E G B (with E bass in Cmaj7/E)

All notes: F, A, C, D, F, A, A, C, E, G, B, D, F, C, E, G, B

Unique notes: F, A, C, D, E, G, B

So notes: F, G, A, B, C, D, E — that's the F Lydian scale: F G A B C D E

Yes, exactly F Lydian.

No Bb or other alterations.

So, the key is F Lydian.

Since Lydian is a mode, the key signature would be that of C major (no sharps or flats), but the tonic is F.

In terms of notation, we might say key of F Lydian.

But in common practice, if it's modal, we specify the mode.

So, for the response, I should say the key is F Lydian.

But let's confirm the mode: Lydian is major with #4, so yes.

The progression ends on F, and has F as tonic.

So, I think that's it.

Based on the chord progression provided:

- **F** (F major)
- **Dm/F** (D minor with F bass)
- **Am/E** (A minor with E bass)
- **G7/F** (G dominant 7th with F bass)
- **Cmaj7/E** (C major 7th with E bass)

The chords used are: F major, D minor, A minor, G dominant 7th, and C major 7th. The notes present in these chords are F, G, A, B, C, D, and E, which form the **F Lydian** scale (F G A B C D E).

- **Key**: F
- **Mode**: Lydian (a major mode with a raised 4th scale degree, B natural)

The progression starts and ends on F, reinforcing F as the tonal center. The use of B natural (instead of B♭) and the diatonic fit of all chords confirm the Lydian mode.
