Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**  
F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Am/E – G7/F –  
F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Cmaj7/E – F

First, note that several chords have slash notation (e.g., Dm/F, Am/E, G7/F, Cmaj7/E), meaning they are **inversions**—they share the same root quality but have different bass notes.

Let’s simplify by identifying the **roots** and **chord qualities**, while noting the bass motion might suggest voice leading or pedal tone use (especially F in the bass).

### Step 1: Identify chord roots and types

- F → F major
- Dm/F → D minor with F in bass (i.e., first inversion of Dm)
- Am/E → A minor with E in bass (second inversion)
- G7/F → G7 dominant 7th with F in bass
- Cmaj7/E → Cmaj7 with E in bass

So the harmonic roots are:
F – F – Dm – Dm – F – F – Am – G7 –  
F – F – Dm – Dm – F – F – Cmaj7 – F

So the actual harmonic progression (ignoring inversions) is:

**F – Dm – F – Am – G7 – F – Dm – Cmaj7 – F**

Wait, more precisely, grouping them:

**F – Dm – F – Am – G7 – F – Dm – Cmaj7 – F**

But let’s list them in order with simplification:

Sequence of chord roots:
1. F
2. F
3. Dm
4. Dm
5. F
6. F
7. Am
8. G7
9. F
10. F
11. Dm
12. Dm
13. F
14. F
15. Cmaj7
16. F

So the **distinct harmonic movement** is centered around:  
**F → Dm → Am → G7 → Cmaj7 → F**

This looks like a **circle of fifths** progression or a **I–vi–ii–V–Imaj7–I** type.

### Step 2: Identify key

Let’s suppose **F major** as the tonic.

Check if all chords fit in **F major**:

- F major (I) ✅
- Dm (vi) ✅
- Am (ii) ✅ (in F major, A is the 2nd scale degree, so Am is ii)
- G7 (V7) ✅ (G is V in C major, wait — not in F major!)

Wait! Hold on: In **F major**, the dominant chord is **C major** or **C7**, not **G7**.

Let’s verify:

**F major scale:** F G A B♭ C D E

Chords built on each degree:

- F (I): F–A–C → F major ✅  
- G (ii): G–B♭–D → G minor (not G7) ❌  
- A (iii): A–C–E → A minor ✅  
- B♭ (IV): B♭–D–F → B♭ major ✅  
- C (V): C–E–G → C major, or C7 (with B♭) ✅  
- Dm (vi): D–F–A → D minor ✅  
- Edim (vii°): E–G–B♭ → diminished ❌

So **G7 = G–B–D–F** — has a **B natural**, which is **not in F major** (F major has B♭).

So **G7 is not diatonic to F major** → this suggests we're either in **C major**, or there's a modulation.

Let’s try **C major**.

**C major scale:** C D E F G A B

Chords:

- C (I): C–E–G
- Dm (ii): D–F–A
- Em (iii): E–G–B
- F (IV): F–A–C ✅
- G (V): G–B–D → or G7 (G–B–D–F) ✅
- Am (vi): A–C–E ✅
- Bdim (vii°): B–D–F

Now check the chords:

- F → IV in C major ✅
- Dm → ii in C major ✅
- Am → vi in C major ✅
- G7 → V7 in C major ✅
- Cmaj7 → I in C major ✅

And the progression ends on F, but with a **Cmaj7** near the end → Cmaj7/E is chord I, and **then back to F (IV)**.

Wait — but the progression ends on **F**, not C.

Final chord is **F**, but the penultimate chord is **Cmaj7/E**, suggesting a motion from C to F.

C → F is **V → I** in **F major**, but **C is not V in C major**, it’s I.

Wait — this is confusing.

Let’s list the last few chords:

... F – F – Dm – Dm – F – F – **Cmaj7/E – F**

So: **Cmaj7 → F**

C to F is a **perfect fourth up**, or equivalently, **a fifth down**.

In tonal harmony, motion from **C to F** is **V → I in F major**.

Ah! Now it makes sense.

### Key insight:
- **Cmaj7 → F** strongly suggests **F major** as tonic, with **C** as V.
- But wait — earlier we saw **G7** in the progression, which contains **B natural** — leading tone to C, not F.

So G7 is **V7 of C**, but C is **V of F**.

Now it clicks: We have a **secondary dominant**!

### Analyze with functional harmony:

Chord progression:

F – Dm – F – Am – **G7** – F – Dm – **Cmaj7** – F

Break it down:

- F → Dm → F → Am → G7 → F  
- Then F → Dm → Cmaj7 → F

First, **G7 → F** is **V7 → I** in **F major** — makes sense if G7 is the **dominant of C**, but it resolves to F? No — G7 resolves to C, not F.

But in the sequence: Am → **G7** → F

That’s **ii – V7/vi – vi?** No, in F major, F is I.

Wait: Am → G7 → F

In **F major**, Am is **iii**, G7 is **not diatonic**, F is I.

But G7 has **B natural**, which is the leading tone to C, so G7 is **V7 of C**.

But it resolves to F, not C. That’s a **deceptive resolution**, or maybe it’s part of a **chain of fifths**?

But wait: Later, we have **Cmaj7 → F**, which is **V → I in F**.

And Cmaj7 is **C–E–G–B**, all of which are diatonic in F major except that E is the leading tone to F — but E is natural in F major (F has E, not E♭). Yes — in F major:

- C major chord: C–E–G → E is natural ✅
- So C is **V** in F major ✅

And **C7** would be **C–E–G–B♭**, also diatonic (B♭ in F major) ✅

But here we have **Cmaj7** → C–E–G–B — **B natural?** No, wait: **Cmaj7** = C–E–G–B

But **B** is not in F major — F major has **B♭**

So Cmaj7 has **a major 7th (B natural)**, which is **not in F major**.

That’s a problem.

In **F major**, the **V chord** is C **major**, yes, but to make a Cmaj7, you'd have C–E–G–B → but **B** is **not** in the F major scale (F has B♭). So **Cmaj7 is not diatonic to F major**.

Similarly, **G7 = G–B–D–F** → has **B natural**, not B♭ → not in F major.

So both **G7** and **Cmaj7** contain **B natural**, which is **not in F major**.

But **B natural** is in **C major**.

Let’s try **C major** again.

C major: C D E F G A B → all chords should use these notes.

- F major (F–A–C): all in C major ✅ IV
- Dm (D–F–A): ✅ ii
- Am (A–C–E): ✅ vi
- G7 (G–B–D–F): G–B is major third, B natural is in C major ✅ — G7 is **V7**
- Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B): all notes in C major ✅ I7

And the progression ends on **F** — which is **IV**, not tonic.

But the very **last chord is F**, after Cmaj7.

So we have: **Cmaj7 → F**

But in **C major**, C is I, F is IV — so I → IV is a **plagal motion**, not a cadence.

But the **progression began and emphasized F** heavily.

Wait — let's count chord durations.

F (2x), Dm (2x), F (2x), Am, G7, F (2x), Dm (2x), F (2x), Cmaj7, F

So **F appears 6 times**, Dm 4 times, and only one Cmaj7 at the end.

Moreover, the **bass note** is often **F** (due to slash chords: Dm/F, G7/F, Cmaj7/E, but F is still root in most).

Slash chords:
- Dm/F: Dm with F in bass → emphasizes F
- G7/F: G7 with F in bass → so G7 chord, but bass is F
- Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 with E in bass → so chord C, bass E

But most **root-position chords are F**

This could be a **plagal (IV–I) movement**, but we need a clear tonic.

Alternative idea: Could this be in **F Lydian mode**?

### Try **F Lydian**:

F Lydian: F G A B C D E — so **B natural**, which supports both **G7 (B natural)** and **Cmaj7 (B natural)**

In F Lydian:
- F major = I ✅
- G7 = ii7 (G–B–D–F) ✅
- Am = iii (A–C–E) ✅
- B major = #IV? (B–D#–F#) → no, we don’t have B chord

But Dm = D–F–A → fits ✅
Cmaj7 = C–E–G–B → fits (C is fifth, E is seventh, G is ninth, B is #4 of F Lydian? No — in F Lydian, #4 is B, so C is 5, E is 7, G is 9, B is #4 → so Cmaj7 uses scale tones ✅

So all chords:
- F = I
- Dm = vi
- Am = iii
- G7 = ii7
- Cmaj7 = Vmaj7

And in F Lydian, the **characteristic note is B natural** (instead of B♭ in F major), which explains both G7 and Cmaj7.

Now check cadence: The progression ends with **Cmaj7 → F**, which is **V → I** — very strong cadence.

Even though Cmaj7 is not the dominant *seventh*, in modal music, **V–I** can be a major chord resolution.

Moreover, the **heavy emphasis on F**, especially with bass note often F (even under Dm and G7), suggests **F is tonic**.

Also, the repeated **F–Dm–F** pattern is like a pedal or drone on F.

Thus, the progression uses chords from **F Lydian**, not F major.

Is this progression typical of Lydian?

Yes — a common Lydian progression is I – II7 – I (e.g., F – G7 – F), which uses the major II chord (from Lydian #4) to create a floating, dreamy sound.

Here we have:
- F (I)
- Dm (vi)
- Am (iii)
- G7 (II7) — characteristic of Lydian (because G7 has B natural, the #4 of F)
- Cmaj7 (V) → can function as predominant or a return to I

But Cmaj7 → F is not V7–I (dominant-tonic), it's a simple major chord motion, but still conclusive.

Alternatively, this could be **C major with modal interchange or a tonicization of IV**, but the **overall weight is on F**, and **final chord is F**, not C.

### Conclusion:

- The **key center is F**
- The chords that require **B natural** (G7, Cmaj7) rule out **F major** (which has B♭)
- The scale that has F, G, A, B (natural), C, D, E is **F Lydian**
- Chords used: F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7 — all fit **F Lydian** (mode of C major)
- The **progression ends with Cmaj7 → F**, which is V → I in F, but with a **major** (not dominant) V chord — common in **modal** harmony

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: F**  
**Mode: Lydian**  

That is, the progression is in **F Lydian**.
