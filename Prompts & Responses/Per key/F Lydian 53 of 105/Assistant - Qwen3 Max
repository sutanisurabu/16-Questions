To determine the **key and mode** of the chord progression:

**F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Am/E – G7/F – F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Cmaj7/E – F**

---

### Step 1: Look at the root notes of chords (especially bass notes)

The chords all have **F in the bass** (either as root or as slash chord: Dm/F, Am/E → wait, Am/E has E in the bass, and Cmaj7/E has E in the bass). So mostly **F in the bass**, with two chords having **E in the bass**: **Am/E** and **Cmaj7/E**.

But let’s focus on **harmonic function** rather than just bass notes.

### Step 2: Identify all the chord qualities and their notes

- **F**: F – A – C  
- **Dm/F**: D – F – A (with F in bass) → notes: D, F, A  
- **Am/E**: A – C – E (with E in bass) → notes: A, C, E  
- **G7/F**: G – B – D – F (with F in bass) → notes: G, B, D, F  
- **Cmaj7/E**: C – E – G – B (with E in bass) → notes: C, E, G, B

So the full set of pitches used:

- F, A, C (from F)
- D, F, A (from Dm)
- A, C, E (from Am)
- G, B, D, F (from G7)
- C, E, G, B (from Cmaj7)

All pitches used:  
**A, B, C, D, E, F, G** → That’s **all seven notes of the C major scale**.

So the underlying scale is likely **C major** or a mode of it.

### Step 3: Determine tonal center

Even though **F appears most often** and is the bass note for most chords, that doesn't automatically make **F** the tonal center. However, the **progression keeps returning to F**, and **ends on F**, which strongly suggests **F is the tonic**.

Now, if the key signature is C major (no sharps/flats), but the tonic is **F**, then the mode is **F Lydian**.

Why?

- C major scale = C D E F G A B  
- Starting on **F** gives the F Lydian mode: **F G A B C D E**

And **F Lydian** contains a **#11 (B natural)**, which we DO see in the chords:
- **G7** contains **B natural**
- **Cmaj7** contains **B natural**

In **F major (Ionian)**, the 4th scale degree is **B♭**, but here we have **B natural**, which is characteristic of **Lydian** (which raises the 4th).

Also, there is **no B♭ anywhere** in the chords — which would be expected in **F major**, but it’s absent.

So:

- Scale: F G A B C D E → **F Lydian**
- Key signature: same as **C major** (no sharps/flats)
- Tonal center: **F**
- Mode: **Lydian**

✅ **Answer: The progression is in F Lydian.**
