Let’s analyze this progression:

```
F   F   Dm/F   Dm/F   F   F   Am/E   G7/F   F   F   Dm/F   Dm/F   F   F   Cmaj7/E   F
```

### Step 1: Identify notes implied by the chords
- **F major** = F–A–C  
- **Dm/F** = F–A–D  
- **Am/E** = E–A–C  
- **G7/F** = F–G–B–D  
- **Cmaj7/E** = E–G–B–C  

The collection of pitch classes: **F, G, A, B, C, D, E**

That’s the **F Lydian** scale (F–G–A–B–C–D–E).

### Step 2: Look at harmonic function
- F is the tonal center: it’s repeated constantly and returns frequently.
- Presence of **B natural** (in G7 and Cmaj7) suggests that this is *not* plain F major (which would have B♭), but rather a **Lydian** sound (raised 4th scale degree).

### Step 3: Test alternatives
If we tried to read it as C major:
- F would act like IV,
- but the constant root F and cadences around F settle the ear there.

So, **the tonal center is F**, and the scale implied is F–G–A–B–C–D–E.

✅ **Key and mode:** **F Lydian** (F major with raised 4th).
