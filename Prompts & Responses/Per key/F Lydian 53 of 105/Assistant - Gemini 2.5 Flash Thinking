### Reasoning

**Examining the Chords**

I've been meticulously dissecting the chord sequence: F - F - Dm/F - Dm/F - F - F - Am/E - G7/F, then repeating. My focus is on identifying any repeating patterns or subtle shifts in harmony. I'm noting the function of each chord within the sequence, looking for potential tonal centers.


**Deciphering Key and Mode**

I've been refining my assessment, concentrating on the role of each chord in establishing a tonal center. I'm leaning toward F major, given the frequent F chord appearances and the resolution patterns. I'm now wrestling with the function of the Cmaj7 chord, considering it could act as a dominant preparation within the F major context. I'm still weighing the implications of a G7/F that doesn't resolve as expected.


**Determining the Modal Structure**

I've been working through the implications of the Cmaj7 chord. Its presence and the overall note collection lead me to believe this piece is written in F Lydian. I'm now verifying the theoretical mode by mapping each chord against an F Lydian scale. It seems to fit; I'm satisfied.


**Concluding the Analysis**

I've just finished the final verification. The inclusion of the B♮ in the Cmaj7 chord, along with the other chordal structures, strongly suggests F Lydian. All the chords align perfectly with the F Lydian scale. The ambiguous bass notes and G7/F fit within the modal structure, reinforcing the overall conclusion. The piece is indeed in F Lydian.


**Synthesizing the Observations**

I'm now integrating all my findings. The frequency of F as the tonic is undeniable. The presence of a Cmaj7 chord, with its B♮, seals the deal, pushing the analysis firmly towards F Lydian. I'm satisfied the modal identity is secure. I am compiling a final summary.




The determination of key and mode for this chord progression relies heavily on identifying the tonic and analyzing any non-diatonic chords that establish a specific modal flavor.

## Analysis of the Chord Progression

The sequence is:
**F | F | Dm/F | Dm/F | F | F | Am/E | G7/F | F | F | Dm/F | Dm/F | F | F | Cmaj7/E | F**

1.  **Identify the Tonic:** The chord **F** is used frequently (starting and ending the progression) and serves as the clear harmonic center. Therefore, **F is the tonic**.

2.  **Evaluate Diatonic Chords (F Major vs. F Minor):**
    *   The chords F (I), Dm (vi), and Am (iii) are all perfectly diatonic to F Major (which has one flat: B♭).
    *   The presence of F Major (F) rules out F Minor as the overarching key.

3.  **Identify the Defining Chord:** The most unusual chord in the context of F Major is **Cmaj7**.
    *   In the key of F Major, the chord built on the 5th degree (V) is C Major (C-E-G) or C7 (C-E-G-B♭).
    *   **Cmaj7** consists of the notes **C - E - G - B natural**.

4.  **Determine the Mode:**
    *   The note **B natural** is the critical factor. It is the defining feature that differentiates **F Lydian** from F Major.
    *   **F Major Scale:** F-G-A-B♭-C-D-E (B♭ is the 4th degree)
    *   **F Lydian Scale:** F-G-A-B-C-D-E (**B natural** is the raised 4th degree)

    In the F Lydian mode, the chord built on the 5th degree (V) is indeed a Major 7th chord (Cmaj7).

5.  **Evaluate Other Chords (G7/F):**
    *   G Major (G-B-D) is the II chord in F Lydian.
    *   G7 (G-B-D-F) uses notes entirely contained within the Lydian scale (and adds the ♭7, F, as a pedal tone or passing tension). This chord does not contradict the Lydian mode and often reinforces the B natural (the Lydian defining note).

## Conclusion

The harmonic vocabulary centers on F and specifically utilizes the Vmaj7 chord (Cmaj7), which contains the raised fourth scale degree (B natural).

**Key and Mode: F Lydian**
