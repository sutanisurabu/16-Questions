### Reasoning

**Exploring musical keys**

I’m analyzing the G7 in the key of F major; it acts as a secondary dominant to C. The bass playing F under G7 might create a G7/F, leading to a suspension with an F pedal. Now, if I consider Cmaj7/E, that’s Cmaj7 with E in the bass, and in F major, C is the V chord. But wait—Cmaj7 includes B natural, which isn't diatonic in F major. This makes me question if we could actually be in F Lydian.**Analyzing F Lydian**

F Lydian uses the C major scale notes: F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. In this context, Cmaj7 is diatonic as Vmaj7. If I consider G7 (G-B-D-F), it functions as V/V in C major. In F Lydian, G7 operates as II7. Since B natural is part of the scale, G7 becomes diatonic. This leads me to realize that the presence of Cmaj7 and G7 really suggests we're operating in F Lydian. Additionally, Am remains diatonic as iii in both F major and F Lydian.**Identifying F Lydian chords**

I'm looking at Dm, which is vi in F major and remains so in F Lydian—diatonic due to the shared scale notes apart from B natural. So the chords F, Dm/F, Am/E, G7/F, and Cmaj7/E are all diatonic in F Lydian. The prevalence of F in the bass suggests that F is our tonal center. There are no Bb chords, and B natural appears in G7 and Cmaj7, confirming we're in Lydian. With this, I conclude that the key is indeed F Lydian, with Cmaj7/E functioning as Vmaj7/iii6.**Confirming F Lydian**

I'm considering the use of Vmaj7 nearby, possibly borrowed from Lydian, or F major with Lydian color. The inclusion of G7, which is V/V in F major and contains B natural, adds complexity. A G7/F introduces that B natural as well, suggesting Lydian strongly, especially with both G7 and Cmaj7 repeating. The progression focuses on F chords, establishing F as the tonal center and confirming the mode as F Lydian, derived from the C major parent key. I find that the presence of B natural and the predominant F bass really point to Lydian.**Finalizing F Lydian analysis**

The key center is F, and the mode is Lydian, which derives from the parent key of C major. The scale notes are F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. In this context, F serves as I, while Dm is vi, Am/E as iii6/4, and G7/F acts as II7. The diatonic chord set includes Fmaj7, G7, and Am7, affirming the presence of B natural from G7 and Cmaj7. So, we confirm we're indeed in F Lydian!

F Lydian (tonal center F, parent key C major).

Why:
- The harmony repeatedly centers on F (lots of F in the bass).
- B natural appears via G7 (G–B–D–F) and Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B), which rules out F major (would have Bb) and is diatonic to F Lydian.
- All chords fit the F Lydian collection: F G A B C D E.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord progression**

I need to identify the key and mode from the chord progression: "F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F." The bass mostly features F and E notes, particularly in Am/E and Cmaj7/E, while G7/F also has F in the bass.

The chords I'm working with are F, Dm/F, Am/E, G7/F, and Cmaj7/E. 

For Dm/F, it’s a D minor triad over F bass, suggesting it’s in first inversion. But I’m contemplating its functional role within F major.**Clarifying chord functions**

I’m analyzing the chord progression further. Dm is indeed the vi chord in F major, which helps me understand that Dm/F is a vi6 with the third in the bass, similar to a tonic pedal.

Then there’s Am/E, which is an A minor chord with E in the bass, acting as the leading tone in F major. This is interesting because it sits outside the F pedal but still connects back to E.

Regarding G7/F, it's a G7 chord over F bass and it functions as V/V within F major.**Examining secondary dominants**

I’m evaluating the G7 chord, which comprises G, B, D, and F. This makes it a dominant seventh chord built on the 2nd degree, but since F major contains Bb, B natural is non-diatonic. Thus, G7 functions as a secondary dominant V/V in the key of F. 

It’s interesting since G7/F is like a third-inversion seventh chord with F as the bass. 

Later, I notice Cmaj7/E also has B natural, serving as the Vmaj7 in F major, common in jazz but less so in classical.**Identifying tonal context**

The presence of B natural suggests a Lydian context or a raised 4 in F. Typically, the V chord in F major is C7 with Bb, instead of B natural. Interestingly, many jazz contexts use Cmaj7 as the V of F Lydian, which isn’t typical. 

This raised fourth alters the usual resolution, as it loses the tritone that resolves to the tonic. Analyzing the progression reveals a lot of F chords, indicating a tonic pedal, while the chords with E in the bass lead to a nice stepwise resolution from E to F.**Determining key and mode**

The presence of B natural strongly indicates F Lydian mode, the 4th degree of C major. Analyzing the chords, F major is the I chord, and Dm is the vi chord in F Lydian. 

G7 is diatonically part of this mode, explaining G7/F as a II7 in third inversion. Dm/F is vi6, while Am/E acts as iii 6/4. Cmaj7/E serves as Vmaj7 in first inversion, supporting F Lydian because all chords are diatonic to this scale. 

Thus, the conclusion is: key center F, mode Lydian.

F Lydian.

Reason: F is the clear tonal center (persistent F/pedal and cadences to F), and the chords are diatonic to F Lydian, notably the presence of B natural in G7 and Cmaj7 (which rules out F major).

### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to analyze the chord progression: "F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F." The repeated F chord suggests a tonal center likely in F major. The slash chords, like Dm/F and Am/E, provide more context. Dm is the vi chord in F major, with F in the bass. G7 serves as a secondary dominant, hinting at the harmony. Overall, it appears to support F major tonality.**Analyzing chord functions**

I realize that in the key of F major, the ii chord is Gm, and its dominant should be D7, not G7. Although G7 can function as V7/ii in C major, in F major, G7 serves as a secondary dominant of C, meaning it's V/V in F major. The G7/F is a third inversion 7th chord, which adds complexity. As for Cmaj7/E, it functions as V in F major, but Cmaj7 includes B natural, which is outside the F major scale.**Identifying key and mode**

So, Cmaj7 has B natural, which acts as a leading tone to C and gives a Lydian feel. In the context of C major, Cmaj7 is the Imaj7 chord, and with E in the bass, it's in the first inversion. However, the progression predominantly centers around F, which reinforces the tonic. Chords like Dm/F and G7/F contain F in the bass, while Am/E and Cmaj7/E have E in the bass. Given this, the key is likely F major, and with G7 containing B natural, it hints at F Lydian rather than Ionian.**Examining chord functions**

I’m considering whether Cmaj7 functions as V/V and if Cmaj7 includes a major 7th in the context of F major. Typically, C7 would be the dominant seventh, but using Cmaj7 implies V without the flat seventh. This inclusion of B natural suggests Lydian #4. However, Cmaj7 doesn’t act dominantly; instead, it feels more like IV in G. The progression shows Cmaj7/E resolving to F, where E resolves to F and B smoothly moves to C. It creates a nice transition!**Finalizing key and mode**

The repeated F chords clearly indicate F as the tonic, which leads me to conclude that the key is likely F major. However, the presence of B natural in G7 and Cmaj7 points towards a Lydian mode. In F Lydian, G7 is diatonic, becoming a dominant seventh because of the raised fourth. Also, Cmaj7 fits perfectly in Lydian with its major seventh. So my final answer is: Key: F; Mode: Lydian. The F pedal reinforces the tonic relationship nicely!**Crafting the response**

I'm going to keep it clear and concise. I'll state the tonal center as F and the mode as Lydian because of the presence of B natural in G7 and Cmaj7, which makes II7 and Vmaj7 diatonic to Lydian. For added clarity, I might include the optional scale: F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. That should wrap up my answer nicely. It's straightforward and gets the point across!

F Lydian.

Reason: F is the clear tonal center (repeated F chords and F pedal tones in Dm/F and G7/F). The presence of B natural in G7 (G–B–D–F) and Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B) makes these chords diatonic only in F Lydian (scale: F G A B C D E), not in F Ionian.

**Assistant - Grok 4 Fast Thinking**

**Key:** F  
**Mode:** Lydian  

This progression is diatonic to the F Lydian scale (F G A B C D E), which accommodates the B natural in the G7 and Cmaj7 chords. The tonic is clearly F, as the progression begins and ends there, centers around an F pedal in the bass for most measures, and uses the Cmaj7/E as a subdominant (IVmaj7) leading to a plagal resolution on F. The Am/E G7/F acts as a brief iii–II7 (or secondary dominant) detour with chromatic tension that resolves back to the tonic, but everything stays within the Lydian framework without needing external borrowing.

### Analysis of Chord Progression
The given progression is: **F  F  Dm/F  Dm/F  F  F  Am/E  G7/F  F  F  Dm/F  Dm/F  F  F  Cmaj7/E  F**

This appears to be a repeating or vamp-like structure with a pedal point (repeated emphasis) on F in the bass for much of the progression, interrupted briefly by E bass notes. I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step, based on standard harmonic analysis.

#### Step 1: Identify the Chords and Their Components
- **Core chords (ignoring slashes for now)**: F (major), Dm (minor), Am (minor), G7 (dominant 7th), Cmaj7 (major 7th).
- **Notes in each**:
  - F: F A C
  - Dm: D F A
  - Am: A C E
  - G7: G B D F
  - Cmaj7: C E G B
- **Slash chords (bass notes)**: Mostly F bass (pedal), with E bass under Am and Cmaj7. This creates a static, hypnotic feel, common in modal or ostinato-based music (e.g., jazz, fusion, or ambient progressions).
- Overall pitch collection: Emphasizes F, A, C, D, E, G, with B natural and no flats (e.g., no Bb). This suggests a major key without chromatic alterations.

#### Step 2: Test Possible Keys
To determine the key, we look for:
- The chord that feels like the "home" or tonic (often the start/end point and/or most stable chord).
- Diatonic fit: Do the chords align naturally with the scale degrees of a key?
- Roman numeral analysis: Assign functions relative to a potential tonic.

**Candidate 1: F Major (Ionian mode)**
- Scale: F G A Bb C D E
- Analysis:
  - F = I (tonic)
  - Dm = vi
  - Am = iii
  - Cmaj7 ≈ IVmaj7 (but IV in F major is Bb major; C major omits Bb, making it incomplete/ambiguous)
  - G7 = ? (V7 would be C7; G7 introduces B natural, which clashes with the key's Bb—it's chromatic, possibly a secondary dominant to C)
- Issues: G7 and Cmaj7 don't fit purely diatonically (B natural vs. expected Bb). The progression starts/ends on F, which could suggest F as tonic, but the G7–Cmaj7 motion pulls toward C as a subdominant or temporary center.
- Fit: Partial (feels like F major with borrowed chords), but not ideal.

**Candidate 2: C Major (Ionian mode)**
- Scale: C D E F G A B
- Analysis:
  - F = IV (subdominant, emphasized via pedal—creates a plagal, grounded feel)
  - Dm = ii (supertonic, common in ii–V–I motions)
  - Am = vi (submediant, adds color)
  - G7 = V7 (dominant 7th, creates tension resolving to C)
  - Cmaj7 = Imaj7 (tonic with added 7th for smoothness)
- Roman numerals for the full progression (relative to C major, with bass notes noted):
  - F (bass F): IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - Dm/F (bass F): ii/IV
  - Dm/F (bass F): ii/IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - Am/E (bass E): vi/III
  - G7/F (bass F): V7/IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - Dm/F (bass F): ii/IV
  - Dm/F (bass F): ii/IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - Cmaj7/E (bass E): Imaj7/III
  - F (bass F): IV
- Fit: Excellent—all chords are diatonic (no accidentals needed). The G7–Cmaj7 is a classic V7–Imaj7 resolution, and the heavy F pedal acts as an extended IV, common in C major (e.g., in hymns, pop, or jazz like "Autumn Leaves" variations). The E bass under Am and Cmaj7 (III in C) adds a smooth voice-leading lift to the final F.

**Other Candidates (Ruled Out)**:
- **F Minor (Aeolian)**: Scale has Eb and Ab; chords like F major and Cmaj7 don't fit (too many naturals).
- **C Minor**: Would expect Eb and Bb; the B natural in G7 and Cmaj7 clashes.
- **Modes like F Mixolydian (F G A Bb C D Eb)**: Introduces Eb (not present) and doesn't explain B natural.
- **F Lydian (F G A B C D E)**: Fits the B natural and raised 4th vibe, but G7 functions oddly (not a standard chord), and the progression resolves better to C than staying in F.

#### Step 3: Confirm Key and Mode
- **Key**: C major.
  - The progression builds tension via G7 (V7) resolving to Cmaj7 (I), then lands on F (IV) as a stable but non-tonic close. The F pedal makes it feel "F-centered" at times, but the overall harmony orbits C as the gravitational center—typical for IV-vamp progressions in C major.
- **Mode**: Ionian (major). All chords align with the major scale; no modal mixture (e.g., no borrowed minors or flattened notes). The maj7 on C adds a bright, extended harmony without shifting modes.
- **Overall Style/Feel**: This has a modal jazz or fusion vibe (e.g., reminiscent of pedal steel or ostinato patterns in Weather Report or Pat Metheny tunes). The E bass insertions create subtle chromatic motion (E to F), enhancing the major mode without altering the key.

If this is from a specific song or genre, more context could refine this (e.g., melody notes), but based on the chords alone, C major Ionian is the strongest fit. Let me know if you'd like a full transcription, variations, or analysis of a similar progression!

### Reasoning

**Dissecting the Progression**

\n\n

I'm now zeroing in on the specific chord progression provided. My initial focus is to parse the input: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F D. Next, I plan to break down each chord, noting its structure and function. Then, I will start to see if this can be placed into any established harmonic archetypes, or if it warrants unique categorization.


**Confirming Key and Function**

\n\n

My assessment of the F Major key is gaining traction, although further validation is needed. I'm now cross-referencing the chords against the diatonic scale degrees of F Major, checking how each functions within the tonal framework. I’ve started exploring potential secondary dominants to explain the presence of G7, and considering if the Am, Dm might be a more likely fit in A minor.


**Unraveling Subtleties**

\n\n

My investigations now center on the chromatic elements within the progression. I'm scrutinizing the functions of each chord, especially the non-diatonic G7, whose presence warrants a deeper dive. I've noted the secondary dominant relationship of G7 (V7/V), and I’m assessing how it impacts the overall tonal landscape. Furthermore, I'm analyzing the voice leading facilitated by the slash chords, and if there are any other possible chord variations.


**Deciphering Chord Function**

\n\n

My current focus is on the G7 chord's role, and I’m finding that it is a deceptive secondary dominant. The progression's movement away from the expected resolution is now highlighted. I'm investigating how the slash chords affect the overall feel, particularly the bass lines' chromatic movement, which I'm seeing as a tool to create interest in the harmonic progression. I've also now tested the Cmaj7 chord as a V chord, to further support the F major key.


**Evaluating Diatonic Relationships**

\n\n

My current focus is on the relationship of each chord to the F major scale. I've confirmed F as the tonic. I'm noting the presence of the V and vi chords, and now considering how the G7, Cmaj7 and Am chords fit into that structure. I'm now making detailed comparisons of the G7's function, particularly its deviation from the F major key signature, and what this implies about the song.


**Refining Key Determinations**

\n\n

My current focus is confirming the key, and refining the mode. Though F Major seems the likely candidate, I'm now exploring alternative key possibilities to ensure the most accurate analysis. I will re-test the hypotheses based on the tonic chord of F, and make sure that is the best fit. I'm also now analyzing the use of secondary dominants, and their deceptive resolutions.




Based on the chords provided, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** F Major
*   **Mode:** Ionian (the modern major scale)

---

### **Analysis:**

Here is a breakdown of why the key is F Major:

1.  **Tonic Center (The "Home" Chord):** The progression begins and ends on an **F major** chord. It also returns to F frequently throughout the sequence. This strongly establishes F as the tonal center or "home base" of the music.

2.  **Diatonic Chords:** Most of the chords in the progression are diatonic to the key of F Major. Let's look at the chords in F Major (which has one flat, Bb):
    *   **I:** **F Major** (F-A-C) - **Present**
    *   **ii:** G minor (G-Bb-D)
    *   **iii:** **A minor** (A-C-E) - **Present** (as Am/E)
    *   **IV:** Bb Major (Bb-D-F)
    *   **V:** **C Major** (C-E-G) - **Present** (as Cmaj7/E)
    *   **vi:** **D minor** (D-F-A) - **Present** (as Dm/F)
    *   **vii°:** E diminished (E-G-Bb)

3.  **The Non-Diatonic Chord (G7):** The one chord that doesn't perfectly fit is **G7** (G-B-D-F). The diatonic `ii` chord in F major should be G minor (G-**Bb**-D). The G7 chord has a **B natural** instead of a Bb.
    *   This is a very common technique called a **secondary dominant**. The G7 is the V7 chord of C major (the V chord of F). In Roman numeral analysis, this is written as **V7/V** ("five-seven of five").
    *   This chord's function is to create a strong pull toward the C major chord. While it resolves back to F in this progression, its presence strongly reinforces the F Major key structure by pointing to its dominant (C).

4.  **Bass Movement (Slash Chords):** The slash chords further cement F as the tonic:
    *   **Dm/F** and **G7/F:** The bass note stays on **F** even when the harmony above it changes. This is called a **pedal point** on the tonic, which strongly emphasizes F as the root of the key.
    *   **Am/E** and **Cmaj7/E:** These create a smooth, stepwise bassline (F -> E -> F) that leads beautifully back to the F chord, a classic voice-leading move.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Cmaj7/E F. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to understand what those chords mean. The chords with slashes, like Dm/F, indicate inversions. So Dm/F means a D minor chord with F in the bass. Similarly, Am/E is A minor with E in the bass, G7/F is G dominant seventh with F in the bass, and Cmaj7/E is C major seventh with E in the bass. The plain F chords are root position.

I should list out all the notes involved to see the scale. Let's take each chord and find their notes:

- F major: F, A, C
- Dm/F: D, F, A (since D minor is D, F, A, and F is the bass note, but the notes are still D, F, A)
- Am/E: A minor is A, C, E; with E in bass, so notes are A, C, E
- G7/F: G dominant seventh is G, B, D, F; with F in bass, so G, B, D, F
- Cmaj7/E: C major seventh is C, E, G, B; with E in bass, so C, E, G, B

Now, let's compile all unique notes from these chords. From F: F, A, C. Dm/F adds D (already have F, A). Am/E adds E. G7/F adds G, B (F is already there). Cmaj7/E adds B (already from G7), E (from Am/E), G (from G7), and C (from F). So the notes are F, G, A, B, C, D, E. That's all seven notes of the C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B. So the key is likely C major.

But the user asked for key and mode. The progression starts and ends on F, which is the IV chord in C major. That might suggest the mode is Lydian? Wait, F Lydian would be based on F, but the notes fit C major. Let me think.

In C major, the diatonic chords are:
I: C, ii: Dm, iii: Em, IV: F, V: G, vi: Am, vii°: Bdim.

Looking at the progression:
- F is IV
- Dm is ii, but written as Dm/F, which is first inversion
- Am is vi
- G7 is V7 (since G is dominant in C major)
- Cmaj7 is I

The progression uses IV, ii, vi, V7, I. That's a common cadence in C major. Starting and ending on IV is a bit unusual for a typical major key song, but it's common in some contexts like gospel or pop where the IV chord is prominent.

But why does the progression emphasize F? It starts with F, has a lot of F chords, ends with F. However, the presence of G7 (which is the dominant V7 in C major) leading to Cmaj7 (the tonic I) suggests that C is the true tonic. The G7 to Cmaj7 is a very strong authentic cadence.

Wait, the progression ends on F, not C. The last chord is F. So it ends on IV. That might create a pedal point or a modal feel. But the G7 is there, which strongly pulls to C. However, if it ends on F, maybe it's F Lydian?

Let me check F Lydian. F Lydian has the notes: F, G, A, B, C, D, E. That's the same as C major, but the tonic is F. The characteristic note of Lydian is the #4, which in F Lydian is B natural. Yes, because C major has B natural, so F Lydian uses the same notes.

In F Lydian, the chords would be:
I: F
ii: Gm
iii: Am
#IV°: Bdim
V: C
vi: Dm
vii: Em

But in the progression, we have Dm/F (which is Dm in first inversion), Am/E (Am first inversion), G7/F (G7 with F bass), Cmaj7/E (Cmaj7 first inversion).

G7 is G-B-D-F. In F Lydian, G is the second scale degree, so G7 would be a secondary dominant. But in C major, G7 is the V7.

Ah, here's the key: G7 is a dominant seventh chord, which typically resolves to C. So in C major, G7 is V7-I. But if the piece ends on F, it might be avoiding the resolution to C. However, the progression includes Cmaj7/E just before the final F. So it goes ... Cmaj7/E to F.

Cmaj7 to F: in C major, that's I to IV, which is a common progression (like in "Let It Be"). But in F Lydian, Cmaj7 is V, so V to I would be C to F. But here it's Cmaj7 to F, which in F Lydian would be V to I. That makes sense for F Lydian.

Wait, in F Lydian, the V chord is C major (since Lydian has a major V). Yes, because the fifth scale degree in F Lydian is C. So C is major, and C to F is a perfect cadence in F Lydian.

But in the progression, it's Cmaj7 to F. In Lydian mode, the V chord is major, so Cmaj7 is the V chord with a major seventh, which fits.

Also, the Dm chord: in F Lydian, Dm is vi (since D is the sixth scale degree). Similarly, Am is iii? Wait, let's list F Lydian scale degrees:

1. F
2. G
3. A
4. B (the #4, which makes it Lydian)
5. C
6. D
7. E

So chords:
I: F (F-A-C)
ii: Gm (G-Bb-D? Wait no, B natural is in the scale. F Lydian has B natural, so G chord would be G-B-D, which is G major, not minor. Oh, right! I made a mistake.

In F Lydian (from C major scale):
- F: F-A-C (I)
- G: G-B-D (II, major)
- A: A-C-E (iii, minor)
- B: B-D-F (iv°, diminished)
- C: C-E-G (V, major)
- D: D-F-A (vi, minor)
- E: E-G-B (vii°, diminished)

But in the progression, we have Dm/F. Dm is D-F-A, which is vi in F Lydian. Am is A-C-E, which is iii in F Lydian. G7 is G-B-D-F. G-B-D-F: G to B is major third (since B natural), D and F. So it's G7, which is a dominant seventh, but in F Lydian, G is II, so G7 would be a secondary dominant. Typically, II7 in major keys is used as a secondary dominant to V, but here it's resolving to F? Not directly.

The progression goes: ... Am/E G7/F F ... so Am to G7 to F. In F Lydian, Am is iii, G7 is II7 (since G is II, and the 7 makes it a dom7), and F is I. But ii chord is G major, so G7 is not diatonic; it has F natural, which is the minor seventh. In F Lydian, the diatonic chord on G would be G major (G-B-D), without the F. Adding F makes it G7, which is borrowed.

But G7 to C is a V7-I in C major, but here it's going to F. So G7 to F is a deceptive cadence? Or perhaps the G7 is acting as a secondary dominant to C, but then it goes to Cmaj7, which resolves the G7, and then to F.

The progression has: ... G7/F F F ... but before that, it's Am/E to G7/F, then F. Then later, Cmaj7/E to F.

So the cadence is Am (iii) - G7 (II7) - F (I), and then separately Cmaj7 (V) to F (I).

The Cmaj7 to F is a V-I cadence in F Lydian. That's strong. Whereas G7 to F is a ii7-I if G is ii, but G7 is a dominant seventh, which isn't diatonic to Lydian. However, in modal harmony, sometimes dominant sevenths are used for color.

But the presence of Cmaj7 (which is V in F Lydian) resolving to F (I) is a clear indicator. Also, the overall note collection is C major, but centered on F.

Another angle: the bass notes. The progression has inversions with specific bass notes: Dm/F (bass F), Am/E (bass E), G7/F (bass F), Cmaj7/E (bass E). So the bass often stays on F or moves to E.

The pedal point on F? The progression starts with F, then Dm/F (still F bass), then F again, etc. So F is a pedal tone.

In modal terms, if F is the tonic, and the scale has B natural (not Bb), that's Lydian. If it had Bb, it would be Mixolydian or something else.

Since all notes match C major, and F is tonic, it's F Lydian.

Confirming with the chords:

- F: I
- Dm: vi (in F Lydian, Dm is vi)
- Am: iii
- G7: This is a bit tricky. G7 is not diatonic to F Lydian because F Lydian has G major (G-B-D), not G7 (which has F). But G7 can be seen as a secondary dominant. However, in the context, it might be functioning as a passing chord. But the Cmaj7 is diatonic (V).
- Cmaj7: V in F Lydian

The progression uses both the V (Cmaj7) and the ii (Gm, but they use G7 which is altered). But the strong resolution of Cmaj7 to F suggests F is tonic.

Also, ending on F after Cmaj7 is a perfect cadence in F Lydian.

So key center is F, mode is Lydian.

But let's double-check for C major. If it were in C major, ending on F (IV) would be a plagal cadence but incomplete, and the piece might feel unresolved. However, the progression has a lot of F chords, so it might be centered on F.

Another test: play the scale. The notes are C major, so if F is the tonic, it's F Lydian.

Yes, I think F Lydian is the answer.

Based on the chord progression you provided (**F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Am/E – G7/F – F – F – Cmaj7/E – F**), I'll break down the analysis step by step to determine the **key center** and **mode**. The short answer is:

- **Key center: F**  
- **Mode: Lydian** (specifically **F Lydian**)  

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Chord Symbols**
- **Slash chords** (e.g., **Dm/F**) indicate **inversions**. The note after the slash is the bass note:
  - **Dm/F** = D minor triad (D-F-A) with **F** in the bass → *still contains D-F-A*.
  - **Am/E** = A minor triad (A-C-E) with **E** in the bass → *still contains A-C-E*.
  - **G7/F** = G dominant 7th (G-B-D-F) with **F** in the bass → *still contains G-B-D-F*.
  - **Cmaj7/E** = C major 7th (C-E-G-B) with **E** in the bass → *still contains C-E-G-B*.
- **Plain chords** (e.g., **F**) are in root position (F-A-C).

---

### **Step 2: Extract All Unique Notes**
List every note from all chords to identify the **scale**:
- **F**: F, A, C  
- **Dm/F**: D, F, A  
- **Am/E**: A, C, E  
- **G7/F**: G, B, D, F  
- **Cmaj7/E**: C, E, G, B  

**Combined unique notes**: **F, G, A, B, C, D, E**.  
→ This is the **C major scale** (C-D-E-F-G-A-B), but **reordered starting on F**.  

This is critical: **F-G-A-B-C-D-E** is **F Lydian** (the 4th mode of C major).  

---

### **Step 3: Identify the Key Center (Tonic)**
- The progression **starts and ends on F** (repeated prominently: 8 out of 12 chords are variations of F).
- **G7/F → F** and **Cmaj7/E → F** act as **cadences resolving to F**:
  - **G7** (dominant 7th) strongly pulls to **C** (in C major), but here it resolves to **F** instead. This suggests **F is the tonic**, not C.
  - **Cmaj7 → F** is a **V-I cadence in F Lydian** (more on this below).
- **Bass pedal point**: The bass often lingers on **F** (e.g., in Dm/**F**, G7/**F**), emphasizing F as the tonal center.
- In **C major**, ending on F (IV chord) would feel unresolved (it's a "plagal cadence" like "Amen," but not a true tonal resolution). Here, the progression **feels complete on F**, confirming F as the tonic.

---

### **Step 4: Confirm the Mode**
The note collection (**F-G-A-B-C-D-E**) matches **F Lydian** because:
- **Lydian mode** is defined by a **raised 4th scale degree** (♮4 instead of ♭4).
  - In F major: 4th degree is **B♭** (F-G-A-**B♭**-C-D-E).
  - In F Lydian: 4th degree is **B♮** (F-G-A-**B♮**-C-D-E).  
  → Your progression uses **B♮** (in G7 and Cmaj7), **not B♭**, ruling out F major.
- **Chord functions in F Lydian**:
  | Chord      | Function in F Lydian | Why?                                                                 |
  |------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **F**      | **I** (tonic)        | Starts/ends the progression; stable resolution point.                |
  | **Dm/F**   | **vi**               | Dm = vi chord (D-F-A = scale degrees 6-1-3).                         |
  | **Am/E**   | **iii**              | Am = iii chord (A-C-E = scale degrees 3-5-7).                        |
  | **G7/F**   | **II7** (altered)    | G7 is not diatonic (G-B-D-F has F, the ♭7), but acts as a **secondary dominant** pulling to C (V). |
  | **Cmaj7/E**| **V**                | Cmaj7 = V chord (C-E-G-B = scale degrees 5-7-2-4#). The **B♮** is the signature ♯4 of Lydian. |

#### Why not C major?
- In C major, F is the **IV chord** (subdominant), but:
  - The progression **avoids resolving to C** as the tonic (it ends on F).
  - **G7** (V7 in C) should resolve to **C**, but here it resolves to **F** (via Am, a deceptive cadence), weakening C as the tonal center.
  - The constant emphasis on **F** (with pedal tones and cadences) shifts the gravity to F.

#### Why not other modes?
- **Mixolydian** (e.g., F Mixolydian = C major scale starting on F): This has **B♭**, but your progression uses **B♮** (in G7 and Cmaj7). ❌  
- **Dorian** (e.g., F Dorian = G minor scale): This has **G♭/F♯**, but your progression uses **G♮**. ❌  
- **Ionian (major)**: F major requires **B♭**, but **B♮** is present. ❌  
- **C major**: F is IV, but the progression feels resolved on F (not C). ❌  

---

### **Step 5: Why F Lydian? The Evidence**
1. **Strong Lydian cadence**: **Cmaj7 (V) → F (I)** is a textbook **V-I resolution in Lydian** (C is the dominant chord in F Lydian).
2. **♯4 (B♮) as a color tone**: The **B♮** in G7 and Cmaj7 is the Lydian "signature" – it creates a bright, floating quality (e.g., "The Simpsons Theme," "Flying in a Blue Dream").
3. **Bass movement**: The inversions (**/F**, **/E**) create smooth voice leading around F:
   - **E** (in Am/**E** and Cmaj7/**E**) is the 7th scale degree (leading tone) in F Lydian, pulling toward F.
   - **F** in bass acts as a pedal, anchoring the mode.

---

### **Summary**
- **Key center**: **F** (all chords resolve to/revolve around F).  
- **Mode**: **Lydian** (due to **B♮** as the 4th scale degree, creating the characteristic raised 4th).  
- **Scale**: **F–G–A–B–C–D–E** (identical to C major but centered on F).  

This progression is a classic example of **modal harmony** where the **Lydian mode** creates a dreamy, uplifting sound (common in jazz, film scores, and progressive rock). If you play this with F as the "home" note, the B♮ will give it that unmistakable Lydian "lift"! 🎵

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression:

**Chords:**  
F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Am/E – G7/F –  
F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Cmaj7/E – F

First, note that several chords have slash notation (e.g., Dm/F, Am/E, G7/F, Cmaj7/E), meaning they are **inversions**—they share the same root quality but have different bass notes.

Let’s simplify by identifying the **roots** and **chord qualities**, while noting the bass motion might suggest voice leading or pedal tone use (especially F in the bass).

### Step 1: Identify chord roots and types

- F → F major
- Dm/F → D minor with F in bass (i.e., first inversion of Dm)
- Am/E → A minor with E in bass (second inversion)
- G7/F → G7 dominant 7th with F in bass
- Cmaj7/E → Cmaj7 with E in bass

So the harmonic roots are:
F – F – Dm – Dm – F – F – Am – G7 –  
F – F – Dm – Dm – F – F – Cmaj7 – F

So the actual harmonic progression (ignoring inversions) is:

**F – Dm – F – Am – G7 – F – Dm – Cmaj7 – F**

Wait, more precisely, grouping them:

**F – Dm – F – Am – G7 – F – Dm – Cmaj7 – F**

But let’s list them in order with simplification:

Sequence of chord roots:
1. F
2. F
3. Dm
4. Dm
5. F
6. F
7. Am
8. G7
9. F
10. F
11. Dm
12. Dm
13. F
14. F
15. Cmaj7
16. F

So the **distinct harmonic movement** is centered around:  
**F → Dm → Am → G7 → Cmaj7 → F**

This looks like a **circle of fifths** progression or a **I–vi–ii–V–Imaj7–I** type.

### Step 2: Identify key

Let’s suppose **F major** as the tonic.

Check if all chords fit in **F major**:

- F major (I) ✅
- Dm (vi) ✅
- Am (ii) ✅ (in F major, A is the 2nd scale degree, so Am is ii)
- G7 (V7) ✅ (G is V in C major, wait — not in F major!)

Wait! Hold on: In **F major**, the dominant chord is **C major** or **C7**, not **G7**.

Let’s verify:

**F major scale:** F G A B♭ C D E

Chords built on each degree:

- F (I): F–A–C → F major ✅  
- G (ii): G–B♭–D → G minor (not G7) ❌  
- A (iii): A–C–E → A minor ✅  
- B♭ (IV): B♭–D–F → B♭ major ✅  
- C (V): C–E–G → C major, or C7 (with B♭) ✅  
- Dm (vi): D–F–A → D minor ✅  
- Edim (vii°): E–G–B♭ → diminished ❌

So **G7 = G–B–D–F** — has a **B natural**, which is **not in F major** (F major has B♭).

So **G7 is not diatonic to F major** → this suggests we're either in **C major**, or there's a modulation.

Let’s try **C major**.

**C major scale:** C D E F G A B

Chords:

- C (I): C–E–G
- Dm (ii): D–F–A
- Em (iii): E–G–B
- F (IV): F–A–C ✅
- G (V): G–B–D → or G7 (G–B–D–F) ✅
- Am (vi): A–C–E ✅
- Bdim (vii°): B–D–F

Now check the chords:

- F → IV in C major ✅
- Dm → ii in C major ✅
- Am → vi in C major ✅
- G7 → V7 in C major ✅
- Cmaj7 → I in C major ✅

And the progression ends on F, but with a **Cmaj7** near the end → Cmaj7/E is chord I, and **then back to F (IV)**.

Wait — but the progression ends on **F**, not C.

Final chord is **F**, but the penultimate chord is **Cmaj7/E**, suggesting a motion from C to F.

C → F is **V → I** in **F major**, but **C is not V in C major**, it’s I.

Wait — this is confusing.

Let’s list the last few chords:

... F – F – Dm – Dm – F – F – **Cmaj7/E – F**

So: **Cmaj7 → F**

C to F is a **perfect fourth up**, or equivalently, **a fifth down**.

In tonal harmony, motion from **C to F** is **V → I in F major**.

Ah! Now it makes sense.

### Key insight:
- **Cmaj7 → F** strongly suggests **F major** as tonic, with **C** as V.
- But wait — earlier we saw **G7** in the progression, which contains **B natural** — leading tone to C, not F.

So G7 is **V7 of C**, but C is **V of F**.

Now it clicks: We have a **secondary dominant**!

### Analyze with functional harmony:

Chord progression:

F – Dm – F – Am – **G7** – F – Dm – **Cmaj7** – F

Break it down:

- F → Dm → F → Am → G7 → F  
- Then F → Dm → Cmaj7 → F

First, **G7 → F** is **V7 → I** in **F major** — makes sense if G7 is the **dominant of C**, but it resolves to F? No — G7 resolves to C, not F.

But in the sequence: Am → **G7** → F

That’s **ii – V7/vi – vi?** No, in F major, F is I.

Wait: Am → G7 → F

In **F major**, Am is **iii**, G7 is **not diatonic**, F is I.

But G7 has **B natural**, which is the leading tone to C, so G7 is **V7 of C**.

But it resolves to F, not C. That’s a **deceptive resolution**, or maybe it’s part of a **chain of fifths**?

But wait: Later, we have **Cmaj7 → F**, which is **V → I in F**.

And Cmaj7 is **C–E–G–B**, all of which are diatonic in F major except that E is the leading tone to F — but E is natural in F major (F has E, not E♭). Yes — in F major:

- C major chord: C–E–G → E is natural ✅
- So C is **V** in F major ✅

And **C7** would be **C–E–G–B♭**, also diatonic (B♭ in F major) ✅

But here we have **Cmaj7** → C–E–G–B — **B natural?** No, wait: **Cmaj7** = C–E–G–B

But **B** is not in F major — F major has **B♭**

So Cmaj7 has **a major 7th (B natural)**, which is **not in F major**.

That’s a problem.

In **F major**, the **V chord** is C **major**, yes, but to make a Cmaj7, you'd have C–E–G–B → but **B** is **not** in the F major scale (F has B♭). So **Cmaj7 is not diatonic to F major**.

Similarly, **G7 = G–B–D–F** → has **B natural**, not B♭ → not in F major.

So both **G7** and **Cmaj7** contain **B natural**, which is **not in F major**.

But **B natural** is in **C major**.

Let’s try **C major** again.

C major: C D E F G A B → all chords should use these notes.

- F major (F–A–C): all in C major ✅ IV
- Dm (D–F–A): ✅ ii
- Am (A–C–E): ✅ vi
- G7 (G–B–D–F): G–B is major third, B natural is in C major ✅ — G7 is **V7**
- Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B): all notes in C major ✅ I7

And the progression ends on **F** — which is **IV**, not tonic.

But the very **last chord is F**, after Cmaj7.

So we have: **Cmaj7 → F**

But in **C major**, C is I, F is IV — so I → IV is a **plagal motion**, not a cadence.

But the **progression began and emphasized F** heavily.

Wait — let's count chord durations.

F (2x), Dm (2x), F (2x), Am, G7, F (2x), Dm (2x), F (2x), Cmaj7, F

So **F appears 6 times**, Dm 4 times, and only one Cmaj7 at the end.

Moreover, the **bass note** is often **F** (due to slash chords: Dm/F, G7/F, Cmaj7/E, but F is still root in most).

Slash chords:
- Dm/F: Dm with F in bass → emphasizes F
- G7/F: G7 with F in bass → so G7 chord, but bass is F
- Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 with E in bass → so chord C, bass E

But most **root-position chords are F**

This could be a **plagal (IV–I) movement**, but we need a clear tonic.

Alternative idea: Could this be in **F Lydian mode**?

### Try **F Lydian**:

F Lydian: F G A B C D E — so **B natural**, which supports both **G7 (B natural)** and **Cmaj7 (B natural)**

In F Lydian:
- F major = I ✅
- G7 = ii7 (G–B–D–F) ✅
- Am = iii (A–C–E) ✅
- B major = #IV? (B–D#–F#) → no, we don’t have B chord

But Dm = D–F–A → fits ✅
Cmaj7 = C–E–G–B → fits (C is fifth, E is seventh, G is ninth, B is #4 of F Lydian? No — in F Lydian, #4 is B, so C is 5, E is 7, G is 9, B is #4 → so Cmaj7 uses scale tones ✅

So all chords:
- F = I
- Dm = vi
- Am = iii
- G7 = ii7
- Cmaj7 = Vmaj7

And in F Lydian, the **characteristic note is B natural** (instead of B♭ in F major), which explains both G7 and Cmaj7.

Now check cadence: The progression ends with **Cmaj7 → F**, which is **V → I** — very strong cadence.

Even though Cmaj7 is not the dominant *seventh*, in modal music, **V–I** can be a major chord resolution.

Moreover, the **heavy emphasis on F**, especially with bass note often F (even under Dm and G7), suggests **F is tonic**.

Also, the repeated **F–Dm–F** pattern is like a pedal or drone on F.

Thus, the progression uses chords from **F Lydian**, not F major.

Is this progression typical of Lydian?

Yes — a common Lydian progression is I – II7 – I (e.g., F – G7 – F), which uses the major II chord (from Lydian #4) to create a floating, dreamy sound.

Here we have:
- F (I)
- Dm (vi)
- Am (iii)
- G7 (II7) — characteristic of Lydian (because G7 has B natural, the #4 of F)
- Cmaj7 (V) → can function as predominant or a return to I

But Cmaj7 → F is not V7–I (dominant-tonic), it's a simple major chord motion, but still conclusive.

Alternatively, this could be **C major with modal interchange or a tonicization of IV**, but the **overall weight is on F**, and **final chord is F**, not C.

### Conclusion:

- The **key center is F**
- The chords that require **B natural** (G7, Cmaj7) rule out **F major** (which has B♭)
- The scale that has F, G, A, B (natural), C, D, E is **F Lydian**
- Chords used: F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7 — all fit **F Lydian** (mode of C major)
- The **progression ends with Cmaj7 → F**, which is V → I in F, but with a **major** (not dominant) V chord — common in **modal** harmony

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Key: F**  
**Mode: Lydian**  

That is, the progression is in **F Lydian**.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at all the chords listed. The progression repeats a pattern, so maybe I should just analyze one cycle. Let me list out the chords in order: F, F, Dm/F, Dm/F, F, F, Am/E, G7/F, then repeats F, F, Dm/F, Dm/F, F, F, Cmaj7/E, F. 

Hmm, some of these have slashes, like Dm/F, which means D minor with F in the bass. Similarly, Am/E is A minor with E in the bass, G7/F is G7 with F in the bass, and Cmaj7/E is C major 7 with E in the bass. Slashed chords indicate the bass note is different from the root of the chord. So for Dm/F, the root is D, but the bass is F. So actually, the chord in the bass is F, so maybe it's an inversion or part of another chord.

I should figure out the actual notes being played. Let me write out each chord with their notes:

- F major: F, A, C
- F major (again, same)
- Dm/F: D minor over F bass. So notes are F (bass), D, F, A? Wait no. D minor is D, F, A. If it's Dm/F, the bass is F, so the notes would be F (bass), D, A. So it's D minor in first inversion. Similarly, Am/E: A minor is A, C, E. E in the bass, so bass note E, then A, C. So notes E, A, C. That's actually E minor? Wait, no. A minor over E bass. So E, A, C. Which is the same as E minor, but E minor has E, G, B. Wait, no. Am is A, C, E. So with E in the bass, the notes are E, A, C. Which is actually a C major chord in second inversion? Wait, C major is C, E, G. But here we have E, A, C. A is not in C major. So E, A, C – that's E minor chord? No. E minor is E, G, B. This has A and C. So perhaps it's C major with A in the bass? Wait, C major chord with A in the bass would be C/A, which is A, C, E? Wait, no: chords in first inversion. C major chord is C-E-G. First inversion is E-G-C. So C in third inversion would be G-C-E? Wait, maybe I should list the intervals.

Wait, maybe better to think of each chord's notes:

- F chord: F, A, C
- Dm/F: D, F, A with F as bass – so notes F (bass), D, A. So the chord is D minor triad in first inversion (since first inversion has the third in the bass; D minor third is F, yes). So Dm/F = F, D, A.
- Am/E: A, C, E with E as bass – so notes E, A, C. Which is the same as C major (C, E, A?) Wait, C major is C, E, G. Here it's E, A, C. So that's A minor, but with E in the bass. A minor chord is A, C, E. So Am/E would be E in bass, then A and C. So the notes E, A, C. That's actually an inversion of an A minor chord. So the root is A, but bass note is E, which is the fifth of A minor. So Am/E is second inversion of A minor.

Similarly, G7/F: G7 chord is G, B, D, F. With F in the bass. So notes F, G, B, D. So that's F as bass, then G, B, D. So G7 in third inversions? G7 chord: root G, 7th F. Inversions: root position, first inversion (B), second inversion (D), third inversion (F). So G7/F is third inversion.

Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. With E in the bass. So E, C, G, B. So that's Cmaj7 in first inversion (since E is the third of Cmaj7 chord). So the bass note E, then C, G, B.

Wait, but all these chords... Let me list all the chords with their full notes:

The progression is written as:

F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

So let's break it down chord by chord with notes:

1. F: F A C
2. F: F A C
3. Dm/F: F (bass), D, A – so notes F, D, A
4. Dm/F: same as above
5. F: F A C
6. F: F A C
7. Am/E: E (bass), A, C – so E, A, C
8. G7/F: F (bass), G, B, D – so F, G, B, D
9. F: F A C
10. F: F A C
11. Dm/F: F, D, A
12. Dm/F: same
13. F: F A C
14. F: F A C
15. Cmaj7/E: E (bass), C, G, B – so E, C, G, B
16. F: F A C

Looking at all the bass notes here. The bass notes are F, F, F, F, F, F, E, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, E, F.

Wait, the bass notes for each chord:

Position 1: F (F chord)
Position 2: F
Position 3: Dm/F → bass F
Position 4: Dm/F → bass F
Position 5: F → bass F
Position 6: F → bass F
Position 7: Am/E → bass E
Position 8: G7/F → bass F
Position 9: F → bass F
Position 10: F → bass F
Position 11: Dm/F → bass F
Position 12: Dm/F → bass F
Position 13: F → bass F
Position 14: F → bass F
Position 15: Cmaj7/E → bass E
Position 16: F → bass F

So the bass notes are mostly F, but there are some E's (at positions 7 and 15). So the bass is moving between F and E.

Now, looking at all the notes in the chords. Let's list all the notes used across all chords. The progression uses:

From F chord: F, A, C

Dm/F: F, D, A

Am/E: E, A, C

G7/F: F, G, B, D

Cmaj7/E: E, C, G, B (since Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B; E in bass, so E, C, G, B)

So possible notes present: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Wait, all notes from F major scale? F major scale is F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E.

Wait, here, looking at the chord G7: G, B, D, F. G7 chord is usually G-B-D-F, which includes B natural. In F major, the B should be Bb, unless it's not F major. Wait, F major scale has a Bb. But G7 chord has a B natural. That's a problem.

F major scale: F, G, A, B♭, C, D, E.

So if there's a B natural, that's from another key. So if there's a B natural in G7 chord, that suggests that the B is not B♭, which would be the case in F major. So maybe F major isn't the key, or maybe it's a different mode.

Wait, maybe it's F Mixolydian? Which has B natural. But let's see.

Wait, G7 chord has a B natural. In F major, B♭ is the fourth, but if it's B natural, then that's not in F major. So for G7 chord to have B natural, the key would have to have B natural. For example, C major has B natural, but G7 is the V chord in C major. But here we have F as the root chord.

Alternatively, maybe it's F Ionian but with a B natural? But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe it's F Mixolydian mode. Let's check:

F Mixolydian is F, G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb? No. Wait, no: Mixolydian mode is major scale with flat 7. So F major scale for F Ionian: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. But wait, F Ionian is same as F major. Wait, but F major scale is F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. Wait, F major: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. Yes. Then Mixolydian mode starting on F would be F, G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb. Wait, no. Wait, the Mixolydian mode is the fifth mode of the major scale. So if the key is C major (C Ionian), then the Mixolydian mode starting on G would be G, A, B, C, D, E, F. So the G Mixolydian would have B natural. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps to get a G7 chord with B natural, which is the V chord in C major. But in this progression, the chords are all around F and some others. Let's see.

If the chord progression has G7 (G, B, D, F), then if B is natural, that would mean it's in a key where B is natural. So if the key is C major, but the root chord here is F, which is IV in C major. But the progression starts with F chord. Let's see: C major has chords: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am. So F is IV. G is V. But if we have F as the starting chord, maybe it's in C major, but starting on IV. But the progression has F as the main chord. Let's check all chords.

We have F chords. Then Dm, which in C major is ii. Then Am/E – Am is vi in C major. G7 is V7 in C major. So if it's C major, but starting on F (the IV), that's possible. So the key would be C major, with F being the tonic? Wait, but if the key is C major, then the tonic is C, but the progression starts with F, which is the fourth. So maybe it's in C major, but the chord progression is using F as the root chord, but the key is C major. But the question is determining the key and mode.

But let's check if all notes fit into C major.

C major: C, D, E, F, G, A, B.

Yes, all the notes we saw in the chords:

- F chord: F, A, C
- Dm: D, F, A
- Am: A, C, E
- G7: G, B, D, F – yes, all in C major (G, B, D, F – but wait, G7 in C major is G, B, D, F, yes. B natural is correct for C major. Because F major would have Bb, but here B natural is present. So that suggests it's not F major but C major.

Wait, for example, if the key were F major, then G7 chord would be G, Bb, D, F. But here we have a G7 chord with B natural, which is G7, but with B natural. So if it's F major, which uses Bb, then the B in G7 would be a borrowed note from another key. But if it's C major, then all notes are consistent. Let's check.

C major has scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B. All natural. So G7 chord in C major is G, B, D, F. Yes. So B natural.

Now, looking at the chords in the progression:

- F (C major's IV chord)
- Dm (ii)
- Am (vi)
- G7 (V7)

Also, Cmaj7 chord appears. Cmaj7 would be C, E, G, B. Which is the I chord in C major.

So the progression has chords that are all diatonic to C major. Let's see:

F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7. All these chords are in C major.

But the key is C major. However, the progression starts with F as the first chord. So the tonic might be C, but the piece centers around F. Wait, but maybe it's a modal interpretation.

Wait, C major is the key, but if the music centers around F, then perhaps it's F Lydian? But wait, F Lydian would have a raised fourth: B natural. C major is the parent scale. Wait, F Lydian would have F, G, A, B natural, C, D, E. Wait, F Lydian has a #4. But in C major, the fourth is F? Wait, no. Let me think again.

If the key is C major, then the mode starting on F would be F Mixolydian. Because C major scale: C D E F G A B, so the modes:

C Ionian (C major)

D Dorian

E Phrygian

F Lydian

G Mixolydian

A Aeolian

B Locrian

Wait, hold on. Yes. If the parent scale is C major, then the modes:

- starting on C: Ionian
- D: Dorian
- E: Phrygian
- F: Lydian (since F Lydian is F G A B C D E; B natural is #4 compared to F Ionian's Bb)
- G: Mixolydian (G A B C D E F)
- A: Aeolian (A B C D E F G)
- B: Locrian

So in this progression, if they're using chords from C major but focusing on F as tonic, then F Lydian because Lydian has a raised fourth, which is B natural. Wait, F Lydian's notes would be F, G, A, B, C, D, E. So yes, B natural. Which matches the G7 chord having B natural.

But in the progression, the key would be C major as the parent scale, but the mode being used is F Lydian if the tonal center is F. However, typically "key" refers to the tonic of the piece. If the piece centers around F, using F Lydian mode.

But let's check the chord progression again.

The chords are:

F, F, Dm/F, Dm/F, F, F, Am/E, G7/F, ... then later Cmaj7/E.

Wait, the Cmaj7 chord at the end before the last F. So when we have Cmaj7, which is the I chord in C major.

But if the tonal center is F, then Cmaj7 would be a V chord? No: in F Lydian, the chords... Wait, perhaps better to list chords of F Lydian.

F Lydian scale: F G A B C D E

So diatonic triads:

F major (I)
G major (II)
A minor (iii)
B diminished (iv°)
C major (V)
D minor (vi)
E minor (vii)

But wait, in F Lydian, the fourth degree is B natural, so the chords built on F would have a major 7th? Let's see.

Triads:

1. F major: F-A-C
2. G major: G-B-D
3. A minor: A-C-E
4. B diminished: B-D-F
5. C major: C-E-G
6. D minor: D-F-A
7. E minor: E-G-B

But in the progression, we have Dm/F which is D minor, F in bass. Dm is vi in C major, or in F Lydian, D minor would be vi.

But in F Lydian, the chords would be like:

I = F major

II = G major (not G minor)

But in the progression, there's a G7 chord. But in F Lydian, the G chord would be G major, but to make it a dominant seventh, G7 would be G-B-D-F, but in F Lydian scale, F is in the scale, so yes. Wait, F is the tonic, the seventh of G7 is F natural. But F Lydian scale has all natural notes. So G-B-D-F would fit into F Lydian, but G dominant seventh? In C major, G7 is V7, and in F Lydian... Wait, the V chord in F Lydian is C major. So in F Lydian, the V chord would be C major. But if there's a G7 chord, which would be the II7 chord? But in F Lydian, G would be major triad with a seventh: G-B-D-F. Yes. So G7 in F Lydian would be the II7 chord. But usually, dominant seventh chords are on the fifth degree. But here, G7 could be a secondary dominant or part of the mode.

However, looking at the chord progression:

F chord (I in F Lydian)

Dm: vi in F Lydian? Wait, D minor is vi in F Lydian. Because F Lydian scale's sixth note is D, so minor triad.

Am/E: A is iii in F lydian.

G7: II7 in F Lydian.

Cmaj7: Vmaj7 in F Lydian (since C major is fifth degree). In F Lydian, fifth degree chord is C major. Cmaj7 would be C-E-G-B, which fits in F Lydian.

But the progression has Cmaj7, which would be Vmaj7, but in standard Lydian, the fifth degree is major triad. So C is the fifth of F, yes. So C major.

So if the entire progression revolves around F, then the key is F Lydian. Let me check the notes.

But wait, in C major, the chords also fit, but the tonal center is F. If the piece starts on F and ends on F, then the tonal center is F. But looking at the progression: it starts with F and ends with F. So the last chord is F. Also, the progression is repeating the pattern. So if we look at the structure:

F F ... and finally ends on F. So the tonic may be F.

Now, in key of F major, the chords would usually have Bb. But here, G7 chord has B natural. So in F major, G7 would be G-Bb-D-F (G minor seven chord), but the user listed G7, which is typically dominant seventh, so G-B-D-F with B natural. But F major has Bb, so that G7 chord with B natural is not in F major. So it's a different key.

So key of C major: all chords fit, and tonal center might be C, but the progression starts on F. Alternatively, the piece could be in F Lydian mode. F Lydian has F as the tonic, and uses B natural. So in F Lydian, the scale is F, G, A, B, C, D, E.

Let's check all chords:

F major chord: yes, I.

Dm: D minor. D is the sixth degree in F Lydian. Yes, D minor chord (D, F, A).

Am: A minor chord (third degree of F Lydian scale). A is third degree.

G7: G dominant seventh chord (G, B, D, F). In F Lydian scale, G is the second degree, so it's a II7 chord. That's typical in Lydian mode, yes.

Am/E: A minor with E in bass. A minor chord is A, C, E. E in bass would be E, A, C. In F Lydian, E is the seventh degree. So chord is A minor in second inversion. Still part of the scale.

Cmaj7: C major seventh chord. C is fifth degree, so Vmaj7. In F Lydian, yes.

So all chords are part of F Lydian mode.

Another point: the use of Cmaj7. If the key was C major, then Cmaj7 is the tonic chord, but the progression starts with F, and there's a lot of F chords. Also, the G7 chord is V in C major. If the piece was in C major, the typical progression would be more like C, G, F, Am etc. But here, the F is the main chord, and the G7 leads to... well, G7 usually leads to C, but in the progression here, after G7/F comes F, so that might be a bit odd. In C major, G7 leads to C, but here after G7 it goes to F. So maybe it's not C major.

In F Lydian mode, the chord progression is moving around F. Let's see: starting on F, then Am, then G7... In F Lydian, the V chord is C, so G7 might be serving as a II chord, which could resolve to C (V), but then after C it goes to F. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a plagal cadence or something else.

Another way: the chord progression could be F - F - Dm/F - etc. So the bass is mostly F. Let's look at the bass notes. The bass notes are F most of the time, with occasional E. Am/E has E bass, so E note in the bass, then Cmaj7/E also has E bass. So when they have Am/E and Cmaj7/E, that gives a bass E.

But in F Lydian mode, the scale is F G A B C D E. So E is the leading tone? Wait, in F major scale (Ionian), leading tone is E natural, but F major has Bb. Wait, in F major, the scale is F G A Bb C D E. So E is the major seventh. But in F Lydian, it's F G A B C D E. So same seventh degree E natural, but the fourth degree is B natural. So in F Lydian, the fourth is raised.

Now, another clue: the G7 chord. In F Lydian, G7 has a B natural and F natural. Since F is in the scale, so yes.

If the tonic is F, then the chords:

F major: I chord

Dm: minor chord on sixth degree (in F Lydian, the vi is D minor)

Am: iii chord

G7: II7 chord

Cmaj7: Vmaj7 chord.

So the progression would be moving from I to II7 to V, which is a pretty standard progression. Wait, but how does it go?

Let's see the chord sequence again:

F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

Breaking it down:

First part: F, F, Dm/F (Dm with F bass), same again, then F, F – so maybe F major chord with bass F through several bars.

Then Am/E: A minor with E bass, then G7/F (G7 with F bass), then repeat of the previous section, then Cmaj7/E (Cmaj7 with E bass), then ending on F.

So in terms of chord functions in F Lydian:

- F: I
- Dm: vi
- Am: iii
- G7: II7 (though usually dominant seventh is on V, but II7 can be used)
- Cmaj7: V

But Cmaj7 and G7? Maybe the progression is F - G7 - Cmaj7 - F, but in the actual progression it's G7 followed by Cmaj7? Wait, in the given sequence: after G7/F comes F F etc., then later Cmaj7/E followed by F. Hmm. Wait, let's look at the progression's exact sequence.

Positions 7-8: Am/E (bass E) and G7/F (bass F). So after Am/E (E, A, C), then G7/F (F, G, B, D). Then later positions 15-16: Cmaj7/E (E, C, G, B) and F.

So the part with Cmaj7/E and then F. So the Cmaj7/E is followed by F. If Cmaj7 is V chord, then F would be I. So a V - I cadence, but in C major, V to I is G to C. But here, if in F Lydian, V chord is C major, then V-I would be C -> F. Yes. So Cmaj7 (V) to F (I) is a V-I cadence in F Lydian mode. That makes sense.

Similarly, G7 chord is followed by Cmaj7? Not exactly in this progression. Because after G7/F it goes to F, F, then later Cmaj7/E. Hmm. Let's see the order:

...G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

So after G7/F comes F chord, then more F's and Dm/F etc., then Cmaj7/E F.

So the Cmaj7/E is followed by F. So maybe a Cmaj7 to F, which in F Lydian is V-I.

Yes. And before that, there's G7/F chord. If G7 is II7 in F Lydian, then II7 to V? But II7 usually goes to V. In some contexts, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe G7 is part of a different function.

But given that all the chords fit into F Lydian (F major scale with B natural and F as tonic), and the progression centers on F as the tonic chord.

In C major, if the tonic were C, then the progression would have a lot of F and G7 chords, but the ending on F would not make sense. Because ending on F (subdominant) in C major would not be typical resolution. Whereas ending on F in F Lydian is the tonic.

Also, the use of B natural throughout is critical. In typical F major, there's a Bb, but here all B's are natural. So if the G7 has B natural, then it's not F major. The presence of B natural points to a mode that has B natural with F as tonic.

Therefore, the most likely key would be F Lydian.

Another check: in F Lydian, the scale has F as tonic. The fourth degree is B natural. F Lydian's notes are F, G, A, B, C, D, E. So yes.

So key: F

Mode: Lydian (since major scale with #4)

Alternatively, is it possible to be in C major with F as the tonic? That's less likely, since C major's tonic is C. But if the piece uses F as tonic within C major, then it's using F Lydian mode, which is the fourth mode of C major. So the key would be C major with mode Lydian on F. But usually we would name the key as F Lydian.

So the answer should be F Lydian.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is C major but the mode being used is F Lydian. But typically the key is named as the tonic plus mode. So F Lydian.

Another point: F major would have a Bb, but none of the chords have Bb. All the chords have B natural, like in G7 (G B D F), so yes, B natural. Cmaj7 has B natural (C E G B). So no Bb anywhere. So it's definitely not F major. So if it's a mode starting on F, it must be Lydian. Because Ionian would be F major with Bb. But B is natural here, so it's Lydian.

So yes, mode is Lydian, key is F.

Wait, sometimes people say the key as F Lydian, meaning the tonic is F and the mode is Lydian.

Yes.

Alternatively, if someone says C major, but F is the tonal center. But usually the key is named by the tonic note and the mode. So the key would be F Lydian.

Yes.

Let me confirm again. F Lydian is F G A B C D E. All the chord notes fit.

F chord: F, A, C.

Dm chord: D, F, A – all in scale.

Am chord: A, C, E – yes.

G7: G, B, D, F – yes.

Cmaj7: C, E, G, B – yes.

B natural is there. F major scale would be F G A Bb C D E, so B natural is outside of F Ionian. So yes, F Lydian is correct.

Another angle: if the tonic chord is F major without any flats. But the F major scale has Bb. So if you have a major F chord with no flats, it's not F major. So the key must be F with some different mode. And Lydian has a raised fourth (B natural).

Yes. So the key is F, mode is Lydian.

Alternatively, sometimes people might say the key of C major but in F Lydian mode. But the standard is to refer to the tonic as the key. So F Lydian.

So the determination: key is F, mode is Lydian.

But let me check if there's another possibility. For example, F Mixolydian. Wait, F Mixolydian would be F G A Bb C D Eb. But then the scale has Bb and Eb. But our progression has B natural, so no. So not Mixolydian.

Lydian mode has #4. Yes. So yes.

Another check: G7/F chord. The bass note is F. So the chord is G B D F with F bass. So the full chord is F G B D. Which is a G7 with bass F. But in terms of the scale of F Lydian, F G B D: F, G, B, D. All within F Lydian.

Yes.

So after considering this, the key is F and mode is Lydian.

The progression centers on F as tonic, all chords diatonic to F Lydian scale.

So the answer should be: key of F, mode Lydian.

The chord progression provided is:  
**F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F**

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### **Key Signature and Chord Notes**
- **F major chord**: F–A–C  
- **Dm/F**: D–F–A (F bass)  
- **Am/E**: A–C–E (E bass)  
- **G7/F**: G–B–D–F (F bass)  
- **Cmaj7/E**: C–E–G–B (E bass)  

All chords contain the following notes: **F, G, A, B, C, D, E**.  

#### **Key Consideration**
- A standard **F major scale** contains **B♭**, but here all **B**s are **natural** (e.g., in G7 and Cmaj7).  
- Thus, **F major cannot be the key**.  
- The presence of **B natural** (instead of B♭) suggests a **modal context**.  

#### **Modal Analysis**
The scale consistent with all notes (F, G, A, B, C, D, E) is:  
**F Lydian** (F–G–A–B–C–D–E).  

This mode is the **4th mode of C major**, but the **tonic (center of gravity)** is **F**, not C. This is confirmed by:  
- The progression starts and ends on **F**.  
- All chords are diatonic to **F Lydian**:  
  - **F (I)**: Tonic chord  
  - **Dm (vi)**: Minor chord on 6th scale degree  
  - **Am (iii)**: Minor chord on 3rd scale degree  
  - **G7 (II⁷)**: Dominant 7th chord on 2nd scale degree  
  - **Cmaj7 (V⁷)**: Major 7th chord on 5th scale degree  
- The **V⁷ to I cadence** (Cmaj7 → F) confirms **F as tonic**.  
- The **B natural** (raised 4th of F) is a hallmark of **Lydian mode** (vs. the B♭ in F Ionian).  

#### **Why Not C Major?**
- While all chords fit **C major**, the **tonal center is not C**.  
- The progression centers on **F** as the resolution point (e.g., Cmaj7 → F), and **F is the tonic** of the mode.  
- In classical theory, the "key" is defined by the **tonic note and mode**, not the parent scale. Thus, **F Lydian** is the accurate description.  

---

### Final Determination
- **Key**: **F**  
- **Mode**: **Lydian**  

This mode is characterized by its **raised 4th degree (B natural)**, which is essential for the harmonic structure of the progression. The use of **G7** (with B natural) and **Cmaj7** confirms the Lydian flavor, as both chords are diatonic to F Lydian.  

> ✅ **Answer**: The key is **F Lydian**.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**

> F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

---

### Step 1: List the unique chords (ignoring bass notes for now, but noting them):

- F
- Dm (D minor)
- Am (A minor)
- G7
- Cmaj7

Bass notes in slashes:
- Dm/F → D minor with F in bass → **F is the bass note**
- Am/E → A minor with E in bass
- G7/F → G7 with F in bass
- Cmaj7/E → C major 7 with E in bass

So we’re dealing with **inverted chords**, especially **bass motion** that’s important for harmonic function.

---

### Step 2: Identify root notes of chords

Let’s list the **chord roots**:

- F
- Dm → D
- F
- F
- Am → A
- G7 → G
- F
- Dm → D
- F
- Cmaj7 → C
- F

So root movement:  
**F → D → F → F → A → G → F → D → F → C → F**

This suggests a kind of **stepwise or modal motion**, not typical diatonic functional harmony.

But let’s look at **keys** these chords belong to.

---

### Step 3: Find common key

Look at the chords: **F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7**

Let’s see what key contains all these:

- F major scale: **F G A Bb C D E**
- D minor: D E F G A B C → **D natural minor** = A minor key signature? Wait, D minor is the **relative minor** of F major.

So **F major** scale has:
- F (I)
- G (II)
- A (III)
- Bb (IV)
- C (V)
- D (VI)
- E (VII)

Chords in F major diatonic:
- I: F
- ii: Gm
- iii: Am
- IV: Bb
- V: C
- vi: Dm
- vii°: Em

But we have:
- F (I) ✅
- Dm (vi) ✅
- Am (iii) ✅
- G7 (not diatonic — G7 has F#, but F major has F natural)
- Cmaj7 (V7 would be C7, but this is Cmaj7 — major 7th, so C E G B — B natural)

Here’s the problem:

- **G7** = G B D F → has **F natural**? No: G7 = G B D **F** — wait, **F is natural, not sharp**.

Wait! **G7 is G-B-D-F** — that’s **F natural**, not F#.

So **G7** with **F natural** is the **dominant 7th chord of C major** — because in C major, the V chord is G7 = G-B-D-F.

But we’re in **F major**, which has B♭.

So G7 = G-B-D-F — that’s **not diatonic to F major** — because F major has B♭, not B natural.

Wait — hold on: **G7** contains **B natural** and **F natural**.

But in **F major**, the 7th scale degree is **E**, not E#.

So **B natural** would be **outside** F major.

But wait — maybe we’re in **C major**?

C major scale: C D E F G A B

Chords:
- C (I)
- Dm (ii)
- Em (iii)
- F (IV)
- G (V)
- Am (vi)
- B° (vii°)

Our chords: **F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7**

- F = IV ✅
- Dm = ii ✅
- Am = vi ✅
- G7 = V7 ✅
- Cmaj7 = I with major 7th — unusual, because C major’s tonic chord is usually just C, not Cmaj7, but it’s acceptable.

So in **C major**, all these chords fit:

- F (IV)
- Dm (ii)
- Am (vi)
- G7 (V7)
- Cmaj7 (I — major 7th, a color variation)

So even though Cmaj7 is “extended,” it’s still within C major.

But what about G7? G7 = G-B-D-F — in C major, F is natural, B is natural — perfect! F major has B♭, but C major has B♮, so **G7 is diatonic to C major**.

Wait — earlier I thought F major — but F major has B♭, so **G7 cannot be in F major** because it contains B natural.

So **G7 implies C as tonic**.

Also, Cmaj7 is strong tonic support.

So key is almost certainly **C major**.

Now check the bass movement:

We’re told:

> F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

So let’s write the bassline:

- F → F → F (in Dm/F) → F (in Dm/F) → F → F → E (in Am/E) → F (in G7/F) → F → F → F (in Dm/F) → F (in Dm/F) → F → F → E (in Cmaj7/E) → F

So bass notes:  
F F F F F F **E** **F** F F F F F F **E** F

Now:  
- **Am/E** = bass E → E is the 5th of A minor — so it’s a first inversion Am.
- **G7/F** = bass F → F is the 7th of G7. This is a **G7 with the 7th in bass** → uncommon, but valid (leads to C, with F resolving to E).
- **Cmaj7/E** = bass E → E is the major 3rd of Cmaj7 → this is a **first inversion Cmaj7**.

So we’re seeing **bass motion E → F → E → F** at the end.

**Analysis of Ending:**

Am/E → G7/F → Cmaj7/E → F

- Am/E = A-C-E (bass E)
- G7/F = G-B-D-F (bass F)
- Cmaj7/E = C-E-G-B (bass E)
- F = F-A-C (bass F)

This **E-F-E-F** motion in the bass is **chromatic neighbor motion** — E and F are a half-step apart.

This sounds like voice leading.

Also, from Am/E → G7/F:  
- Bass: E → F (ascending chromatic)
- Chord: vi → V7

In C major, vi → V7 is typical.

G7/F (G7 with F in bass) is a **common tone voice leading** — the F resolves down to E in the next chord (Cmaj7/E), and E is the 3rd of C.

This is **very characteristic of the iv-V7-I progression in a mode shift or borrowed harmony**?

Wait — hold on.

But earlier we said all chords are diatonic to C major.

Yes:

- Am (vi) → G7 (V7) → Cmaj7 (I)
- All in C major.

G7 is the dominant 7th in C major — standard.

Cmaj7 instead of C — that’s just a color: very common in jazz/pop.

The bass movement: E → F → E → F doesn’t change the key — it’s just smooth bass motion.

Notice: **F** appears as a chord root and also as the 7th of G7.

This sounds like a **modal mixture**? Or just stepwise bass movement?

Actually, the most compelling argument:

✅ All chords are diatonic to **C major**  
✅ G7 fits only if we’re in C — not F (because F major has B♭, G7 requires B♮)  
✅ Cmaj7 is a colorful tonic  
✅ Am and Dm are both diatonic (vi and ii)  
✅ The bass motion, while unusual, is just **inverted chords** with chromatic neighbor motion in bass — NOT key change.

Therefore:

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: C major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (major)**

The progression is in the key of **C major**, using standard diatonic chords with some inversions and color tones (Cmaj7, bass stepwise motion). There is no indication of modulation or minor mode — the tonal center is clearly C, with V7 → I resolution typical of major keys.

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the **key and mode** of the chord progression:

**F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Am/E – G7/F – F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Cmaj7/E – F**

---

### Step 1: Look at the root notes of chords (especially bass notes)

The chords all have **F in the bass** (either as root or as slash chord: Dm/F, Am/E → wait, Am/E has E in the bass, and Cmaj7/E has E in the bass). So mostly **F in the bass**, with two chords having **E in the bass**: **Am/E** and **Cmaj7/E**.

But let’s focus on **harmonic function** rather than just bass notes.

### Step 2: Identify all the chord qualities and their notes

- **F**: F – A – C  
- **Dm/F**: D – F – A (with F in bass) → notes: D, F, A  
- **Am/E**: A – C – E (with E in bass) → notes: A, C, E  
- **G7/F**: G – B – D – F (with F in bass) → notes: G, B, D, F  
- **Cmaj7/E**: C – E – G – B (with E in bass) → notes: C, E, G, B

So the full set of pitches used:

- F, A, C (from F)
- D, F, A (from Dm)
- A, C, E (from Am)
- G, B, D, F (from G7)
- C, E, G, B (from Cmaj7)

All pitches used:  
**A, B, C, D, E, F, G** → That’s **all seven notes of the C major scale**.

So the underlying scale is likely **C major** or a mode of it.

---

### Step 3: Determine tonal center

Even though **F appears most often** and is the bass note for most chords, that doesn't automatically make **F** the tonal center. However, the **progression keeps returning to F**, and **ends on F**, which strongly suggests **F is the tonic**.

Now, if the key signature is C major (no sharps/flats), but the tonic is **F**, then the mode is **F Lydian**.

Why?

- C major scale = C D E F G A B  
- Starting on **F** gives the F Lydian mode: **F G A B C D E**

And **F Lydian** contains a **#11 (B natural)**, which we DO see in the chords:
- **G7** contains **B natural**
- **Cmaj7** contains **B natural**

In **F major (Ionian)**, the 4th scale degree is **B♭**, but here we have **B natural**, which is characteristic of **Lydian** (which raises the 4th).

Also, there is **no B♭ anywhere** in the chords — which would be expected in **F major**, but it’s absent.

So:

- Scale: F G A B C D E → **F Lydian**
- Key signature: same as **C major** (no sharps/flats)
- Tonal center: **F**
- Mode: **Lydian**

✅ **Answer: The progression is in F Lydian.**

### Reasoning

**Examining the Chords**

I've been meticulously dissecting the chord sequence: F - F - Dm/F - Dm/F - F - F - Am/E - G7/F, then repeating. My focus is on identifying any repeating patterns or subtle shifts in harmony. I'm noting the function of each chord within the sequence, looking for potential tonal centers.


**Deciphering Key and Mode**

I've been refining my assessment, concentrating on the role of each chord in establishing a tonal center. I'm leaning toward F major, given the frequent F chord appearances and the resolution patterns. I'm now wrestling with the function of the Cmaj7 chord, considering it could act as a dominant preparation within the F major context. I'm still weighing the implications of a G7/F that doesn't resolve as expected.


**Determining the Modal Structure**

I've been working through the implications of the Cmaj7 chord. Its presence and the overall note collection lead me to believe this piece is written in F Lydian. I'm now verifying the theoretical mode by mapping each chord against an F Lydian scale. It seems to fit; I'm satisfied.


**Concluding the Analysis**

I've just finished the final verification. The inclusion of the B♮ in the Cmaj7 chord, along with the other chordal structures, strongly suggests F Lydian. All the chords align perfectly with the F Lydian scale. The ambiguous bass notes and G7/F fit within the modal structure, reinforcing the overall conclusion. The piece is indeed in F Lydian.


**Synthesizing the Observations**

I'm now integrating all my findings. The frequency of F as the tonic is undeniable. The presence of a Cmaj7 chord, with its B♮, seals the deal, pushing the analysis firmly towards F Lydian. I'm satisfied the modal identity is secure. I am compiling a final summary.




The determination of key and mode for this chord progression relies heavily on identifying the tonic and analyzing any non-diatonic chords that establish a specific modal flavor.

## Analysis of the Chord Progression

The sequence is:
**F | F | Dm/F | Dm/F | F | F | Am/E | G7/F | F | F | Dm/F | Dm/F | F | F | Cmaj7/E | F**

1.  **Identify the Tonic:** The chord **F** is used frequently (starting and ending the progression) and serves as the clear harmonic center. Therefore, **F is the tonic**.

2.  **Evaluate Diatonic Chords (F Major vs. F Minor):**
    *   The chords F (I), Dm (vi), and Am (iii) are all perfectly diatonic to F Major (which has one flat: B♭).
    *   The presence of F Major (F) rules out F Minor as the overarching key.

3.  **Identify the Defining Chord:** The most unusual chord in the context of F Major is **Cmaj7**.
    *   In the key of F Major, the chord built on the 5th degree (V) is C Major (C-E-G) or C7 (C-E-G-B♭).
    *   **Cmaj7** consists of the notes **C - E - G - B natural**.

4.  **Determine the Mode:**
    *   The note **B natural** is the critical factor. It is the defining feature that differentiates **F Lydian** from F Major.
    *   **F Major Scale:** F-G-A-B♭-C-D-E (B♭ is the 4th degree)
    *   **F Lydian Scale:** F-G-A-B-C-D-E (**B natural** is the raised 4th degree)

    In the F Lydian mode, the chord built on the 5th degree (V) is indeed a Major 7th chord (Cmaj7).

5.  **Evaluate Other Chords (G7/F):**
    *   G Major (G-B-D) is the II chord in F Lydian.
    *   G7 (G-B-D-F) uses notes entirely contained within the Lydian scale (and adds the ♭7, F, as a pedal tone or passing tension). This chord does not contradict the Lydian mode and often reinforces the B natural (the Lydian defining note).

***

## Conclusion

The harmonic vocabulary centers on F and specifically utilizes the Vmaj7 chord (Cmaj7), which contains the raised fourth scale degree (B natural).

**Key and Mode: F Lydian**

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

The chord progression is: **F - F - Dm/F - Dm/F - F - F - Am/E - G7/F - F - F - Dm/F - Dm/F - F - F - Cmaj7/E - F**

Here's an analysis of the chords and potential keys:

1.  **Dominant Chords and Resolution:**
    *   The progression uses a **G7/F** chord. This is a G Dominant 7th chord with an F in the bass. This chord is built on the second degree of F Major, the third degree of Eb Major, and the fourth degree of D Minor (in harmonic minor).
    *   If this G7 were functioning as a V/V (dominant of the dominant), it would typically lead to C, but here it leads back to **F**. This suggests the F is the tonic.
    *   The presence of **Am** (iii), **Dm** (vi), and **Cmaj7** (V, although *C* major is typically V) strongly points towards **F Major**.

2.  **Diatonic Chords in F Major:**
    The diatonic chords in F Major are:
    *   F (I)
    *   Gm (ii)
    *   Am (iii)
    *   Bb (IV)
    *   C (V)
    *   Dm (vi)
    *   E° (vii°)

    All the major chords in the progression fit perfectly within F Major:
    *   **F** (I) - Tonic
    *   **Dm/F** (vi/I) - Submediant over Tonic pedal
    *   **Am/E** (iii/vii) - Mediant over a non-tonic bass note
    *   **Cmaj7/E** (V/vii) - Dominant 7th over a non-tonic bass note

3.  **The Anomalous Chords (G7/F):**
    *   The **G7** chord is *not* diatonic to F Major (G minor is). When a major chord or dominant 7th is built on the second scale degree (I, **II**, III, IV...), it often acts as a **secondary dominant (V/V)** leading to the dominant (C). *However, here it immediately returns to F.*
    *   This non-functional use of a G7 (or G major) is relatively common in popular music, sometimes called a "borrowed chord" used for color, or simply a bass line shift over a chord built on G. Given the strong presence of all other F Major diatonic chords, this G7 is likely a temporary chromatic alteration or an extension of the preceding Am (implying a chromatic bass walk) that momentarily resolves back to the tonic.

4.  **Bass Line and Pedal Point:**
    *   Notice the frequent **F** in the bass (**F, Dm/F**). This creates a strong **tonic pedal point** reinforcing F as the center.
    *   The bass moves down chromatically/diatonically (F -> E -> F). The **Am/E** and **Cmaj7/E** are inversions specifically focusing on the descending E in the bass line (F -> E), which is often a feature of approaching the dominant or tonic.

**Conclusion:**

The overwhelming evidence—the use of F, Dm, Am, and Cmaj7, the tonic pedal point on F, and the overall harmonic motion—establishes the key signature and tonic.

*   **Key:** **F**
*   **Mode:** **Major** (Ionian)

Given chord sequence:

```
F   F   Dm/F Dm/F  
F   F   Am/E G7/F  
F   F   Dm/F Dm/F  
F   F   Cmaj7/E F
```

1. **Identify all the roots appearing in the chords:**  
   F, D, A, G, C – therefore the collection is  
   F G A C D → a 5-note set.  

2. **Arrange those notes as a scale starting on F:**  
   F – G – A – C – D = 1 – 2 – 3 – 5 – 6  
   The 4th (B♭) and 7th (E) are missing, a classic pentatonic
   collection built on the tonic F.

3. **Look at the cadence:**  
   The progression keeps returning to F major triads; the only
   non-diatonic bass note is the passing E under Cmaj7, which simply
   supplies the major 7th of F (E) before the final tonic.  There is
   no B♭ anywhere, hence no Mixolydian colour, and no minor 3rd (A♭)
   that would point to F minor.  All harmonic tension (G7) is
   directed straight back to F.

Therefore the passage is in:

**F Ionian (major) pentatonic.**

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let’s analyze this progression:

```
F   F   Dm/F   Dm/F   F   F   Am/E   G7/F   F   F   Dm/F   Dm/F   F   F   Cmaj7/E   F
```

### Step 1: Identify notes implied by the chords
- **F major** = F–A–C  
- **Dm/F** = F–A–D  
- **Am/E** = E–A–C  
- **G7/F** = F–G–B–D  
- **Cmaj7/E** = E–G–B–C  

The collection of pitch classes: **F, G, A, B, C, D, E**

That’s the **F Lydian** scale (F–G–A–B–C–D–E).

### Step 2: Look at harmonic function
- F is the tonal center: it’s repeated constantly and returns frequently.
- Presence of **B natural** (in G7 and Cmaj7) suggests that this is *not* plain F major (which would have B♭), but rather a **Lydian** sound (raised 4th scale degree).

### Step 3: Test alternatives
If we tried to read it as C major:
- F would act like IV,
- but the constant root F and cadences around F settle the ear there.

So, **the tonal center is F**, and the scale implied is F–G–A–B–C–D–E.

✅ **Key and mode:** **F Lydian** (F major with raised 4th).

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, the user has given a sequence of chords: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

I need to determine the key and mode. This looks like a chord progression in music theory.

Recall that in music, the key refers to the tonal center, and mode refers to whether it's major or minor, or other modes.

Let me list out the chords clearly:

- F

- F

- Dm/F

- Dm/F

- F

- F

- Am/E

- G7/F

- F

- F

- Dm/F

- Dm/F

- F

- F

- Cmaj7/E

- F

Some chords have slashes, like Dm/F, which means D minor chord with F in the bass. Similarly, Am/E is A minor with E in the bass, G7/F is G dominant 7th with F in the bass, and Cmaj7/E is C major 7th with E in the bass.

The bass notes are important because they can indicate the root or suggest inversions, but for determining key, I should focus on the chord qualities and their relationships.

Let me extract the root chords without the bass notes for simplicity, but since the bass is part of the harmony, I need to consider the full chord.

Perhaps I can think of the chords as they are and see what key they might belong to.

List the chord types:

- F major (appears multiple times)

- Dm/F: this is D minor chord, but with F in bass, so it's an inversion. D minor is the chord.

- Similarly, Am/E: A minor chord with E bass

- G7/F: G dominant 7th with F bass

- Cmaj7/E: C major 7th with E bass

The progression has a lot of F major chords, and ends on F, so F might be the tonic.

Now, let's see the other chords:

- Dm: D minor

- Am: A minor

- G7: G dominant 7th

- Cmaj7: C major 7th

In the key of F major, the diatonic chords are:

- I: F major

- ii: G minor

- iii: A minor

- IV: Bb major

- V: C major

- vi: D minor

- vii°: E diminished

But here we have:

- Dm: which is vi in F major

- Am: which is iii in F major

- G7: G dominant 7th, which is not diatonic to F major; in F major, the V chord should be C major, not G. G7 is V7 in C major, but here it's in the context of F.

G7/F is G7 with F bass, which is unusual. G7 is dominant to C, but in F key, it might be a secondary dominant or something.

Also, Cmaj7/E is C major 7th with E bass, which could be I in C or IV in G, but in F, C is V.

Let's list all unique chords without inversions for key analysis:

- F major

- D minor

- A minor

- G dominant 7th

- C major 7th

Now, in F major:

- F is I

- Dm is vi

- Am is iii

- G7 is not diatonic; it would be V7/IV or something? G7 is the dominant of C, and in F, C is V, so G7 could be V7/V, meaning dominant of the dominant.

In F major, the dominant is C, so V7/V would be G7, which resolves to C, and then C could resolve to F.

In this progression, we have G7/F, which is G7 with F bass, so it's like a G7 chord but with F in bass, which might be a suspension or something, but let's see the resolution.

The progression ends on F, and there are many F chords, so F is likely the tonic.

Now, look at the sequence: it starts and ends with F, and has Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7.

Dm is vi, Am is iii, G7 is V7/V, Cmaj7 is V with maj7, which is not typical dominant; dominant usually has minor 7th, but Cmaj7 is major 7th, so it's not a dominant chord; it's a tonic or subdominant feel.

In C major, Cmaj7 is I, but here it's in F context.

Perhaps the key is F major, and G7 is a secondary dominant to C, and Cmaj7 is the V chord but with maj7, which might be a borrowed chord or something.

But Cmaj7/E is C major 7th with E bass, so the chord is Cmaj7, and E is the third, so it's in first inversion or something.

Similarly, Am/E is A minor with E bass, E is the fifth of Am, so it's in second inversion? Am chord is A-C-E, so with E in bass, it's Am/E, which is A minor in second inversion.

In chord notation, / means bass note, so Am/E means A minor chord with E in bass.

Similarly, Dm/F means D minor with F in bass, F is the third of Dm, so it's first inversion.

G7/F means G7 with F in bass, F is the minor 7th of G7, so it's third inversion or something? G7 is G-B-D-F, so with F in bass, it's G7 with the 7th in bass.

Cmaj7/E is C-E-G-B with E in bass, so first inversion.

Now, back to key.

Let's see the chord progression in terms of roots and qualities.

Perhaps I can ignore the inversions for key determination and focus on the chord roots and types.

So the chord roots are: F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7.

F major, D minor, A minor, G dominant 7th, C major 7th.

In F major scale: F G A Bb C D E F

Chords: F maj, G min, A min, Bb maj, C maj, D min, E dim

So:

- F maj: I

- D min: vi

- A min: iii

- G7: not diatonic; G7 has B and F, B is not in F major (F major has Bb), so G7 has B natural, which is the leading tone in C major.

Similarly, Cmaj7 has B natural, which is not in F major scale; F major has Bb.

F major scale: F G A Bb C D E F, so B natural is not in the scale; it's Bb.

But in G7, the notes are G B D F, so B natural, and in Cmaj7, C E G B, so B natural.

Whereas in F major, it should be Bb.

So, the presence of B natural suggests that we might be in a key where B natural is part of the scale.

Perhaps the key is C major? Let's check.

In C major: C D E F G A B C

Chords: C maj, D min, E min, F maj, G maj, A min, B dim

But here we have F maj, D min, A min, G7, Cmaj7.

G7 is V7 in C major, and Cmaj7 is I with maj7.

But the progression starts and ends with F, not C. It has many F chords, and ends on F, so F might be the tonic.

In C major, F is IV.

But if it ends on F, and F is not I in C, it might not be tonic.

Perhaps it's in F mixolydian or something.

Mixolydian mode has b7, so in F mixolydian: F G A Bb C D Eb F? No, mixolydian is major scale with b7.

Standard modes:

- Ionian (major): W W H W W W H

- Dorian: W H W W W H W

- Phrygian: H W W W H W W

- Lydian: W W W H W W H

- Mixolydian: W W H W W H W

- Aeolian (natural minor): W H W W H W W

- Locrian: H W W H W W W

For F:

- F Ionian: F G A Bb C D E F

- F Dorian: F G Ab Bb C D Eb F

- F Phrygian: F Gb Ab Bb C Db Eb F

- F Lydian: F G A B C D E F

- F Mixolydian: F G A Bb C D Eb F

- F Aeolian: F G Ab Bb C Db Eb F

- F Locrian: F Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F (but Cb is B, etc., messy)

In the chords, we have B natural in G7 and Cmaj7, so B natural is present.

In F Lydian, the scale is F G A B C D E F, so B natural.

And in F Lydian, the chords would be:

- I: F maj

- ii: G min

- iii: A min

- IV#: B maj? Wait, in Lydian, the fourth is augmented, but chords are built on scale degrees.

F Lydian scale: F G A B C D E F

Chords:

- I: F maj (F A C)

- ii: G min (G B D) — B is natural, so G min has B natural? G min is G Bb D, but in Lydian, B is natural, so G chord would be G B D, which is G major, not G minor.

Let's list diatonic chords in F Lydian:

Scale degrees: 1 F, 2 G, 3 A, 4 B, 5 C, 6 D, 7 E

Chords:

- I: F maj (F A C)

- ii: G maj (G B D) — because 2 is G, major third B

- iii: A min (A C E) — 3 is A, minor third C? A to C is minor third, yes A min

- IV: B dim (B D F) — 4 is B, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, so diminished

- V: C maj (C E G)

- vi: D min (D F A)

- vii: E min (E G B)

In F Lydian:

- I: F maj

- ii: G maj

- iii: A min

- IV: B dim

- V: C maj

- vi: D min

- vii: E min

Now, in the progression, we have:

- F maj (I)

- D min (vi)

- A min (iii)

- G7 — G7 is G B D F, which is dominant 7th, but in Lydian, the ii chord is G maj, not G7. G7 has F, which is the b7, but in Lydian, the 7th is E, so F is not in the scale? F Lydian has F G A B C D E, so notes are F G A B C D E, so F is root, G, A, B, C, D, E. G7 has G B D F, but F is the note, which is the root? No, G7 has notes G B D F, and F is the 7th, but in F Lydian, the scale has F as 1, so the note F is present, but for G chord, the 7th would be F, which is the root of the scale? Let's see intervals.

In F Lydian, the note F is 1, G is 2, A is 3, B is 4, C is 5, D is 6, E is 7.

For a chord on G: G is 2, so if we build a triad: G B D, B is 4, D is 6. In major scale, 2 is minor, but in Lydian, since 4 is augmented? Lydian has #4, so from G, the intervals: G to B is major third (since B is 4 of F, but for G chord, from G to B is a major third because B is three half-steps from G? G to B is two whole steps? G to A is whole, A to B is whole, so G to B is two whole steps, which is major third, yes. G to B is major third.

Then G to D: G to A whole, A to B whole, B to C half, C to D whole, so G to D is perfect fifth? G to D is perfect fifth, yes.

So G B D is G major triad.

Now, for 7th chord, if we add the 7th, which is F? The 7th note from G in the scale: in F Lydian, the notes are F G A B C D E, so from G, the 7th is F? No, the 7th of G is F#, but in this scale, the note after G is A, then B, etc. The scale degrees relative to G: if G is 2, then the 7th of G would be the note that is a minor 7th above G, which is F, but in equal temperament, minor 7th is 10 half-steps, G to F is 10 half-steps? G to F is 10 half-steps? G to G# is 1, to A is 2, to A# is 3, to B is 4, to C is 5, to C# is 6, to D is 7, to D# is 8, to E is 9, to F is 10, yes G to F is 10 half-steps, which is minor 7th.

But in F Lydian, the note F is the tonic, so from G, the minor 7th is F, which is the root of the scale.

In terms of chord, if we build a 7th chord on G in F Lydian: notes G B D F, so G B D F is G7 chord, which is dominant 7th.

G B D F: G to B is major third, B to D is minor third, D to F is minor third, so it's a major triad with minor 7th, yes dominant 7th.

And in F Lydian, the ii chord is G7? Earlier I said ii is G maj, but with 7th, it's G7.

In diatonic 7th chords in Lydian:

- I maj7: F A C E

- ii7: G B D F — which is G7

- iii7: A C E G — A min7

- IV maj7#5? B D F A — B D F is diminished, A is maj7? B to A is major 7th, but B D F is diminished triad, so B half-dim7? B D F A, B to D min3, D to F min3, F to A maj3? Half-diminished 7th has min3, min3, maj3? Standard half-diminished is min3, min3, maj3, yes, so B D F A is B half-dim7.

- V7: C E G B — C maj7? C E G B is C major 7th

- vi7: D F A C — D min7

- vii7: E G B D — E min7

In F Lydian:

- I: F maj7

- ii: G7

- iii: A min7

- IV: B half-dim7

- V: C maj7

- vi: D min7

- vii: E min7

Now, in the progression, we have:

- F (assume maj, but no 7th specified, could be triads)

- Dm (D min)

- Am (A min)

- G7

- Cmaj7

And the bass inversions, but for key, let's see if they fit.

In F Lydian:

- F maj: I

- D min: vi

- A min: iii

- G7: ii7

- Cmaj7: V maj7

And the progression has many F chords, starts and ends with F, so likely tonic is F.

Moreover, in the sequence, there is Am/E, which is A min with E bass, and in F Lydian, E is the 7th, so it's fine.

Dm/F is D min with F bass, F is tonic.

G7/F is G7 with F bass, which is the 7th of G7 in bass.

Cmaj7/E is C maj7 with E bass, E is the 3rd.

Now, is there any chord that doesn't fit? In F Lydian, all chords seem to fit: F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7 are all diatonic to F Lydian.

F Lydian has B natural, and G7 has B natural, Cmaj7 has B natural, so yes.

In F major, G7 would have B natural which is not diatonic, but in Lydian, it is.

Also, the progression ends on F, and has a plagal feel or something.

The sequence: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

So, it starts with F, then Dm/F (which is vi with I in bass), then back to F, then Am/E (iii with 7th in bass? Am/E is A min with E bass, E is 5th of Am), then G7/F (ii7 with 7th in bass), then F, then Dm/F, then F, then Cmaj7/E (V maj7 with 3rd in bass), then F.

The Cmaj7/E to F: Cmaj7 is V in Lydian, but in Lydian, V is major 7th, which is not dominant; dominant should have minor 7th for tension, but here it's maj7, so it might not have strong dominant function, but in this context, it resolves to F.

In Lydian mode, the V chord is major 7th, which is less tense, but it can still resolve to I.

Moreover, in the progression, G7 is used, which is ii7, and in Lydian, ii7 is dominant 7th, which can have some tension.

But let's see if there's a better fit.

Perhaps it's in C major, but it starts and ends with F, and F is IV in C, so if it ends on IV, it might not feel tonic, but in some progressions, it could be, but less likely.

Another possibility: F mixolydian? F mixolydian has Bb and Eb, but here we have B natural in G7 and Cmaj7, so no Bb, so not mixolydian.

F Ionian has Bb, but here B natural is used, so not Ionian.

F Lydian has B natural, so it fits.

Now, what about the mode? Lydian is a major mode, so key is F Lydian.

But in traditional music, Lydian is less common, but in jazz or modern music, it's possible.

The chord progression has a lot of F and Dm, which are I and vi in Lydian.

Also, Am is iii, G7 is ii7, Cmaj7 is V.

In the sequence, G7/F might be functioning as a passing chord or something.

But overall, it seems to fit F Lydian.

To confirm, let's list the notes used in the chords.

Chords:

- F: F A C

- Dm: D F A (with F bass in Dm/F, but chord is Dm)

- Am: A C E (with E bass in Am/E)

- G7: G B D F (with F bass in G7/F)

- Cmaj7: C E G B (with E bass in Cmaj7/E)

All notes: F, A, C, D, F, A, A, C, E, G, B, D, F, C, E, G, B

Unique notes: F, A, C, D, E, G, B

So notes: F, G, A, B, C, D, E — that's the F Lydian scale: F G A B C D E

Yes, exactly F Lydian.

No Bb or other alterations.

So, the key is F Lydian.

Since Lydian is a mode, the key signature would be that of C major (no sharps or flats), but the tonic is F.

In terms of notation, we might say key of F Lydian.

But in common practice, if it's modal, we specify the mode.

So, for the response, I should say the key is F Lydian.

But let's confirm the mode: Lydian is major with #4, so yes.

The progression ends on F, and has F as tonic.

So, I think that's it.

Based on the chord progression provided:

- **F** (F major)
- **Dm/F** (D minor with F bass)
- **Am/E** (A minor with E bass)
- **G7/F** (G dominant 7th with F bass)
- **Cmaj7/E** (C major 7th with E bass)

The chords used are: F major, D minor, A minor, G dominant 7th, and C major 7th. The notes present in these chords are F, G, A, B, C, D, and E, which form the **F Lydian** scale (F G A B C D E).

- **Key**: F
- **Mode**: Lydian (a major mode with a raised 4th scale degree, B natural)

The progression starts and ends on F, reinforcing F as the tonal center. The use of B natural (instead of B♭) and the diatonic fit of all chords confirm the Lydian mode.

Let’s break this chord progression down step by step.

**1. Chord progression given:**

```
F  F  Dm/F  Dm/F  F  F  Am/E  G7/F  F  F  Dm/F  Dm/F  F  F  Cmaj7/E  F
```

---

**2. Identify bass notes and chord qualities**

- `F` = F major triad (F A C)  
- `Dm/F` = D minor triad over F bass → notes: F D F A C? Actually Dm = D F A, plus F bass = F D F A → still Dm chord but first inversion (F in bass).  
- `Am/E` = A minor triad over E bass → Am = A C E, bass E → notes E A C E.  
- `G7/F` = G7 (G B D F) over F bass → F G B D F.  
- `Cmaj7/E` = C E G B over E bass → E C E G B.

---

**3. Look for tonal center**

Most chords are **F major** or closely related.

- F major scale: F G A B♭ C D E  
- Diatonic chords in F major:  
  F (I), Gm (ii), Am (iii), B♭ (IV), C (V), Dm (vi), Edim (vii°).

---

**4. Check each chord’s relation to F major**

- `F` = I  
- `Dm` = vi  
- `Am` = iii  
- `G7` = V7/V (secondary dominant to C, the V chord in F major)  
- `Cmaj7` = IVmaj7 (C E G B) — in F major, C is V, but Cmaj7 is diatonic (C E G B fits F major: B is B♭? Wait — B♮ is not in F major! So C E G B has a B natural, not B♭. That means it’s **C Lydian** chord relative to F major, or borrowed from C major? Actually Cmaj7 in F major key would require B♭, but here it’s B natural, so it’s **C major triad with major 7th** = C E G B. That B natural is the major 7th of C, but in F major scale, the 7th scale degree is E, not B natural. So B natural is the #4 of F (F Lydian). So Cmaj7 in F context = IVmaj7#11? Actually simpler: Cmaj7/E = C E G B — B is not in F major (F ionian), but is in F Lydian (F G A B C D E). So this suggests **F Lydian** mode.

---

**5. Check other chords for F Lydian**

F Lydian: F G A B C D E  
Chords:  
F (I), G (II), Am (iii), Bdim (iv°), C (V), Dm (vi), Em (vii).

Given:  
- F = I  
- Dm = vi  
- Am = iii  
- G7 = G B D F — G7 is not diatonic to F Lydian because G7 has F natural (7th of G7) which is the 4th of C but in F Lydian, F is tonic so F natural is fine, but G7’s B is fine (B is in F Lydian), D is fine, F is tonic. Actually G7 in F Lydian: G B D F — all notes belong to F Lydian except… wait, F Lydian notes: F G A B C D E. G7 = G B D F — all notes are in F Lydian! Yes: G (2nd degree), B (#4), D (6th), F (1st). So G7 is diatonic to F Lydian. Interesting — in major, G7 would have B natural only if key is C major, but here in F Lydian, B natural is the #4, so G7 is the **diatonic II7** in Lydian.  

So progression uses:  
F (I), Dm (vi), Am (iii), G7 (II7), Cmaj7 (Vmaj7) — all diatonic to F Lydian.

---

**6. Final determination**

The presence of B natural (in G7 and Cmaj7) and absence of B♭ confirms **F Lydian** (mode of C major).  
Tonic = F.  
Mode = Lydian (major mode with #4).

\boxed{F\ \text{Lydian}}

### Reasoning

1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user has provided a sequence of chords: `F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F`. They want to know the "key and mode."

2.  **Initial Analysis of the Chords:** Let's list the chords and simplify them by looking at their basic quality (ignoring the bass notes for a moment, but keeping them in mind as they are important).
    *   `F` (Major)
    *   `Dm/F` (D minor over an F bass)
    *   `F` (Major)
    *   `Am/E` (A minor over an E bass)
    *   `G7/F` (G dominant 7th over an F bass)
    *   `F` (Major)
    *   `Dm/F` (D minor over an F bass)
    *   `F` (Major)
    *   `Cmaj7/E` (C major 7th over an E bass)
    *   `F` (Major)

3.  **Identify the Tonal Center:** The most frequent chord is `F`. It appears at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. This strongly suggests that `F` is the tonic, or the "home" chord. So, the key is likely F something (major or minor).

4.  **Analyze the Chord Qualities in the Context of F:**
    *   If the key is **F major**, the diatonic chords are:
        *   I: F major
        *   ii: G minor
        *   iii: A minor
        *   IV: Bb major
        *   V: C major
        *   vi: D minor
        *   vii°: E diminished
    *   If the key is **F minor**, the diatonic chords (natural minor) are:
        *   i: F minor
        *   ii°: G diminished
        *   III: Ab major
        *   iv: Bb minor
        *   v: C minor
        *   VI: Db major
        *   VII: Eb major

5.  **Compare the Given Chords to the Diatonic Possibilities:**
    *   We have `F` (major). This fits the I chord in F major, but not the i chord in F minor. This is a huge clue pointing towards F major.
    *   We have `Dm`. This fits the vi chord in F major. It doesn't fit naturally in F minor.
    *   We have `Am`. This fits the iii chord in F major. It doesn't fit naturally in F minor.
    *   We have `G7`. This is the *only* chord that doesn't fit diatonically in F major. The V chord in F major is `C major` or `C7`. `G7` is the V/V chord (the dominant of the dominant), which is a very common secondary dominant in major keys. It creates a strong pull towards the C chord.
    *   We have `Cmaj7`. This is a I chord in C major, but more importantly, it's the V chord in F major (with a 7th extension). This fits perfectly in F major.

6.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Almost all the chords (`F`, `Dm`, `Am`, `Cmaj7`) are diatonic to the key of F major. The `G7` is a very common non-diatonic chord (secondary dominant) used in major keys. The overall tonality is overwhelmingly pointing to **F major**.

7.  **Now, let's consider the "mode" part of the question and the bass notes.** The user specified "key and mode." This could mean a mode of the major scale (Dorian, Phrygian, etc.) or it could just be a way of asking "is it major or minor?". Given the strong F major feel, it's likely the latter. However, the bass notes are very specific and create a certain harmonic flavor. Let's analyze them.

    *   `F`: Simple root position.
    *   `Dm/F`: This is a first inversion D minor chord. The F is in the bass. Since F is our tonic, this reinforces the tonal center. The notes are F-A-D. This is an F major 6th chord (F6) without the 5th. An F6 chord is very common as a tonic chord. So, `Dm/F` is functioning as a stable, tonic-area chord.
    *   `Am/E`: This is an A minor chord with an E in the bass. The notes are E-A-C. This is an E minor 7th flat 6 chord, but more simply, it creates a strong pull to the next chord. The E in the bass acts as a leading tone down to D (in the next chord, Dm/F). More importantly, it sets up the `G7/F`. The bass line is moving E -> F.
    *   `G7/F`: This is a G7 chord with an F in the bass. The notes are F-G-B-D. This is a G7sus4(b9) chord if you analyze it from G up, but that's overly complex. The simplest way to see it is a G7 chord with the tonic (F) in the bass. This is a very common way to write a dominant chord that has a strong pull to the tonic. The F in the bass keeps the listener grounded on the home base while the upper notes (G-B-D) create the tension. It's a `V7/V` (G7) moving to a `V7` (implied C, but we get Cmaj7/E next). The F in the bass is a pedal point.
    *   `Cmaj7/E`: This is a C major 7th chord with an E in the bass. The notes are E-G-B-C. This is the V chord in the key of F major. The E in the bass is the third of the C chord, and it leads nicely up to F in the next chord. The bass line is moving E -> F.
    *   The final `F` brings it all home.

8.  **Putting it all together for the final answer:**

    *   **Key:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to **F major**. The tonic is F, the chords are mostly from the F major scale, and the non-diatonic chord (G7) is a standard secondary dominant in that key.
    *   **Mode:** The mode is **Ionian**, which is just another name for the major scale. So, the key/mode is **F Ionian**. This is the most accurate and specific answer. Just saying "F major" is also correct and probably what the user is looking for.
    *   **Analysis of the Chord Progression:** The progression uses a lot of slash chords, which means the bass notes are important.
        *   The progression hangs around the tonic (`F` and `Dm/F`, which functions as F6).
        *   It then moves away with `Am/E` -> `G7/F`. This section has a descending bass line feel (even though it's E->F, the harmony is moving away from the tonic). The `G7/F` is a V7/V that wants to resolve to C.
        *   It resolves to the dominant chord, `Cmaj7/E`.
        *   Finally, it returns strongly to the tonic, `F`.
        *   The use of slash chords creates a more sophisticated, "pedal point" or "descending bass line" feel, common in classical, jazz, and pop music. The `F` in the bass of `G7/F` is a classic example of a dominant chord over a tonic bass, creating tension while still referencing the home key.

9.  **Structure the final answer:**
    *   Start with the direct answer: Key is F Major (or F Ionian).
    *   Provide a clear explanation of why. List the diatonic chords of F major and show how the given chords fit.
    *   Address the non-diatonic chord (G7) and explain its function as a secondary dominant (V/V). This shows a deeper understanding.
    *   Discuss the role of the slash chords. Explain how the bass notes create a specific effect (pedal point, harmonic interest) and how chords like `Dm/F` can be re-interpreted as `F6`.
    *   Conclude with a summary of the progression's feel: it's an F major progression with sophisticated voice leading in the bass.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **F Major**.

The mode is **Ionian**, which is just the formal name for the major scale.

### **Detailed Analysis**

Here’s a breakdown of why F Major is the correct key and how the chords function within it.

**1. Identifying the Tonic (The "Home" Chord)**

The most frequently occurring chord is **F major**. It appears at the beginning, in the middle, and at the very end of the progression, strongly establishing it as the tonic or "home" chord.

**2. Checking Diatonic Chords**

The diatonic chords (the chords built naturally from the notes) of the F major scale are:
*   **I:** F major
*   ii: G minor
*   iii: **A minor**
*   IV: Bb major
*   V: **C major / Cmaj7**
*   vi: **D minor**
*   vii°: E diminished

Now let's see how the chords in your progression fit into this key:

*   **F**: This is the **I** chord (the tonic). Perfect fit.
*   **Dm/F**: This is a D minor chord with an F in the bass. D minor is the **vi** chord in F major. When you put the tonic (F) in the bass, this chord functions as a stable tonic-area chord. It's essentially an **F major 6th chord** (F-A-C-D) without the 5th (C).
*   **Am/E**: This is an A minor chord with an E in the bass. A minor is the **iii** chord in F major. This chord acts as a pre-dominant, leading into the next chord.
*   **G7/F**: This is the only chord that is not diatonic to F major. In F major, the V chord is C major. However, **G7 is the V of C (V/V)**, or the "secondary dominant." It's a very common chord in major keys used to add tension and pull strongly towards the C chord. Placing the tonic F in the bass (a pedal point) keeps the progression grounded while the upper notes create tension.
*   **Cmaj7/E**: This is a C major 7th chord with an E in the bass. C is the **V chord** (the dominant) in F major. This chord creates the primary tension that wants to resolve back to the tonic, F. The E in the bass is the 3rd of the chord and leads up nicely to the F in the final chord.

**3. Summary of the Progression's Function**

The progression has a classic feel:

*   **Tonic Area (Home):** `F` and `Dm/F` (functioning as F6) establish the key.
*   **Departure & Tension:** `Am/E` -> `G7/F` creates a sense of movement away from the tonic. The `G7` is a secondary dominant that builds tension to resolve to the dominant chord.
*   **Dominant (Climax of Tension):** `Cmaj7/E` is the dominant chord, creating the strongest pull back home.
*   **Resolution:** The final `F` chord provides the satisfying release and return to the tonic.

The prominent use of slash chords indicates that the bassline is important for the harmonic effect, creating a sophisticated, flowing sound common in jazz, pop, and classical music.
