Let’s break this chord progression down step by step.

**1. Chord progression given:**

```
F  F  Dm/F  Dm/F  F  F  Am/E  G7/F  F  F  Dm/F  Dm/F  F  F  Cmaj7/E  F
```

---

**2. Identify bass notes and chord qualities**

- `F` = F major triad (F A C)  
- `Dm/F` = D minor triad over F bass → notes: F D F A C? Actually Dm = D F A, plus F bass = F D F A → still Dm chord but first inversion (F in bass).  
- `Am/E` = A minor triad over E bass → Am = A C E, bass E → notes E A C E.  
- `G7/F` = G7 (G B D F) over F bass → F G B D F.  
- `Cmaj7/E` = C E G B over E bass → E C E G B.

---

**3. Look for tonal center**

Most chords are **F major** or closely related.

- F major scale: F G A B♭ C D E  
- Diatonic chords in F major:  
  F (I), Gm (ii), Am (iii), B♭ (IV), C (V), Dm (vi), Edim (vii°).

---

**4. Check each chord’s relation to F major**

- `F` = I  
- `Dm` = vi  
- `Am` = iii  
- `G7` = V7/V (secondary dominant to C, the V chord in F major)  
- `Cmaj7` = IVmaj7 (C E G B) — in F major, C is V, but Cmaj7 is diatonic (C E G B fits F major: B is B♭? Wait — B♮ is not in F major! So C E G B has a B natural, not B♭. That means it’s **C Lydian** chord relative to F major, or borrowed from C major? Actually Cmaj7 in F major key would require B♭, but here it’s B natural, so it’s **C major triad with major 7th** = C E G B. That B natural is the major 7th of C, but in F major scale, the 7th scale degree is E, not B natural. So B natural is the #4 of F (F Lydian). So Cmaj7 in F context = IVmaj7#11? Actually simpler: Cmaj7/E = C E G B — B is not in F major (F ionian), but is in F Lydian (F G A B C D E). So this suggests **F Lydian** mode.

**5. Check other chords for F Lydian**

F Lydian: F G A B C D E  
Chords:  
F (I), G (II), Am (iii), Bdim (iv°), C (V), Dm (vi), Em (vii).

Given:  
- F = I  
- Dm = vi  
- Am = iii  
- G7 = G B D F — G7 is not diatonic to F Lydian because G7 has F natural (7th of G7) which is the 4th of C but in F Lydian, F is tonic so F natural is fine, but G7’s B is fine (B is in F Lydian), D is fine, F is tonic. Actually G7 in F Lydian: G B D F — all notes belong to F Lydian except… wait, F Lydian notes: F G A B C D E. G7 = G B D F — all notes are in F Lydian! Yes: G (2nd degree), B (#4), D (6th), F (1st). So G7 is diatonic to F Lydian. Interesting — in major, G7 would have B natural only if key is C major, but here in F Lydian, B natural is the #4, so G7 is the **diatonic II7** in Lydian.  

So progression uses:  
F (I), Dm (vi), Am (iii), G7 (II7), Cmaj7 (Vmaj7) — all diatonic to F Lydian.

**6. Final determination**

The presence of B natural (in G7 and Cmaj7) and absence of B♭ confirms **F Lydian** (mode of C major).  
Tonic = F.  
Mode = Lydian (major mode with #4).

**Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{F\ \text{Lydian}}
\]
