### Analysis of Chord Progression
The given progression is: **F  F  Dm/F  Dm/F  F  F  Am/E  G7/F  F  F  Dm/F  Dm/F  F  F  Cmaj7/E  F**

This appears to be a repeating or vamp-like structure with a pedal point (repeated emphasis) on F in the bass for much of the progression, interrupted briefly by E bass notes. I'll break down the key and mode determination step by step, based on standard harmonic analysis.

#### Step 1: Identify the Chords and Their Components
- **Core chords (ignoring slashes for now)**: F (major), Dm (minor), Am (minor), G7 (dominant 7th), Cmaj7 (major 7th).
- **Notes in each**:
  - F: F A C
  - Dm: D F A
  - Am: A C E
  - G7: G B D F
  - Cmaj7: C E G B
- **Slash chords (bass notes)**: Mostly F bass (pedal), with E bass under Am and Cmaj7. This creates a static, hypnotic feel, common in modal or ostinato-based music (e.g., jazz, fusion, or ambient progressions).
- Overall pitch collection: Emphasizes F, A, C, D, E, G, with B natural and no flats (e.g., no Bb). This suggests a major key without chromatic alterations.

#### Step 2: Test Possible Keys
To determine the key, we look for:
- The chord that feels like the "home" or tonic (often the start/end point and/or most stable chord).
- Diatonic fit: Do the chords align naturally with the scale degrees of a key?
- Roman numeral analysis: Assign functions relative to a potential tonic.

**Candidate 1: F Major (Ionian mode)**
- Scale: F G A Bb C D E
- Analysis:
  - F = I (tonic)
  - Dm = vi
  - Am = iii
  - Cmaj7 ≈ IVmaj7 (but IV in F major is Bb major; C major omits Bb, making it incomplete/ambiguous)
  - G7 = ? (V7 would be C7; G7 introduces B natural, which clashes with the key's Bb—it's chromatic, possibly a secondary dominant to C)
- Issues: G7 and Cmaj7 don't fit purely diatonically (B natural vs. expected Bb). The progression starts/ends on F, which could suggest F as tonic, but the G7–Cmaj7 motion pulls toward C as a subdominant or temporary center.
- Fit: Partial (feels like F major with borrowed chords), but not ideal.

**Candidate 2: C Major (Ionian mode)**
- Scale: C D E F G A B
- Analysis:
  - F = IV (subdominant, emphasized via pedal—creates a plagal, grounded feel)
  - Dm = ii (supertonic, common in ii–V–I motions)
  - Am = vi (submediant, adds color)
  - G7 = V7 (dominant 7th, creates tension resolving to C)
  - Cmaj7 = Imaj7 (tonic with added 7th for smoothness)
- Roman numerals for the full progression (relative to C major, with bass notes noted):
  - F (bass F): IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - Dm/F (bass F): ii/IV
  - Dm/F (bass F): ii/IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - Am/E (bass E): vi/III
  - G7/F (bass F): V7/IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - Dm/F (bass F): ii/IV
  - Dm/F (bass F): ii/IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - F (bass F): IV
  - Cmaj7/E (bass E): Imaj7/III
  - F (bass F): IV
- Fit: Excellent—all chords are diatonic (no accidentals needed). The G7–Cmaj7 is a classic V7–Imaj7 resolution, and the heavy F pedal acts as an extended IV, common in C major (e.g., in hymns, pop, or jazz like "Autumn Leaves" variations). The E bass under Am and Cmaj7 (III in C) adds a smooth voice-leading lift to the final F.

**Other Candidates (Ruled Out)**:
- **F Minor (Aeolian)**: Scale has Eb and Ab; chords like F major and Cmaj7 don't fit (too many naturals).
- **C Minor**: Would expect Eb and Bb; the B natural in G7 and Cmaj7 clashes.
- **Modes like F Mixolydian (F G A Bb C D Eb)**: Introduces Eb (not present) and doesn't explain B natural.
- **F Lydian (F G A B C D E)**: Fits the B natural and raised 4th vibe, but G7 functions oddly (not a standard chord), and the progression resolves better to C than staying in F.

#### Step 3: Confirm Key and Mode
- **Key**: C major.
  - The progression builds tension via G7 (V7) resolving to Cmaj7 (I), then lands on F (IV) as a stable but non-tonic close. The F pedal makes it feel "F-centered" at times, but the overall harmony orbits C as the gravitational center—typical for IV-vamp progressions in C major.
- **Mode**: Ionian (major). All chords align with the major scale; no modal mixture (e.g., no borrowed minors or flattened notes). The maj7 on C adds a bright, extended harmony without shifting modes.
- **Overall Style/Feel**: This has a modal jazz or fusion vibe (e.g., reminiscent of pedal steel or ostinato patterns in Weather Report or Pat Metheny tunes). The E bass insertions create subtle chromatic motion (E to F), enhancing the major mode without altering the key.

If this is from a specific song or genre, more context could refine this (e.g., melody notes), but based on the chords alone, C major Ionian is the strongest fit. Let me know if you'd like a full transcription, variations, or analysis of a similar progression!
