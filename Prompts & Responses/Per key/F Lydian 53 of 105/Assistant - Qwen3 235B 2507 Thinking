### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Cmaj7/E F. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to understand what those chords mean. The chords with slashes, like Dm/F, indicate inversions. So Dm/F means a D minor chord with F in the bass. Similarly, Am/E is A minor with E in the bass, G7/F is G dominant seventh with F in the bass, and Cmaj7/E is C major seventh with E in the bass. The plain F chords are root position.

I should list out all the notes involved to see the scale. Let's take each chord and find their notes:

- F major: F, A, C
- Dm/F: D, F, A (since D minor is D, F, A, and F is the bass note, but the notes are still D, F, A)
- Am/E: A minor is A, C, E; with E in bass, so notes are A, C, E
- G7/F: G dominant seventh is G, B, D, F; with F in bass, so G, B, D, F
- Cmaj7/E: C major seventh is C, E, G, B; with E in bass, so C, E, G, B

Now, let's compile all unique notes from these chords. From F: F, A, C. Dm/F adds D (already have F, A). Am/E adds E. G7/F adds G, B (F is already there). Cmaj7/E adds B (already from G7), E (from Am/E), G (from G7), and C (from F). So the notes are F, G, A, B, C, D, E. That's all seven notes of the C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B. So the key is likely C major.

But the user asked for key and mode. The progression starts and ends on F, which is the IV chord in C major. That might suggest the mode is Lydian? Wait, F Lydian would be based on F, but the notes fit C major. Let me think.

In C major, the diatonic chords are:
I: C, ii: Dm, iii: Em, IV: F, V: G, vi: Am, vii°: Bdim.

Looking at the progression:
- F is IV
- Dm is ii, but written as Dm/F, which is first inversion
- Am is vi
- G7 is V7 (since G is dominant in C major)
- Cmaj7 is I

The progression uses IV, ii, vi, V7, I. That's a common cadence in C major. Starting and ending on IV is a bit unusual for a typical major key song, but it's common in some contexts like gospel or pop where the IV chord is prominent.

But why does the progression emphasize F? It starts with F, has a lot of F chords, ends with F. However, the presence of G7 (which is the dominant V7 in C major) leading to Cmaj7 (the tonic I) suggests that C is the true tonic. The G7 to Cmaj7 is a very strong authentic cadence.

Wait, the progression ends on F, not C. The last chord is F. So it ends on IV. That might create a pedal point or a modal feel. But the G7 is there, which strongly pulls to C. However, if it ends on F, maybe it's F Lydian?

Let me check F Lydian. F Lydian has the notes: F, G, A, B, C, D, E. That's the same as C major, but the tonic is F. The characteristic note of Lydian is the #4, which in F Lydian is B natural. Yes, because C major has B natural, so F Lydian uses the same notes.

In F Lydian, the chords would be:
I: F
ii: Gm
iii: Am
#IV°: Bdim
V: C
vi: Dm
vii: Em

But in the progression, we have Dm/F (which is Dm in first inversion), Am/E (Am first inversion), G7/F (G7 with F bass), Cmaj7/E (Cmaj7 first inversion).

G7 is G-B-D-F. In F Lydian, G is the second scale degree, so G7 would be a secondary dominant. But in C major, G7 is the V7.

Ah, here's the key: G7 is a dominant seventh chord, which typically resolves to C. So in C major, G7 is V7-I. But if the piece ends on F, it might be avoiding the resolution to C. However, the progression includes Cmaj7/E just before the final F. So it goes ... Cmaj7/E to F.

Cmaj7 to F: in C major, that's I to IV, which is a common progression (like in "Let It Be"). But in F Lydian, Cmaj7 is V, so V to I would be C to F. But here it's Cmaj7 to F, which in F Lydian would be V to I. That makes sense for F Lydian.

Wait, in F Lydian, the V chord is C major (since Lydian has a major V). Yes, because the fifth scale degree in F Lydian is C. So C is major, and C to F is a perfect cadence in F Lydian.

But in the progression, it's Cmaj7 to F. In Lydian mode, the V chord is major, so Cmaj7 is the V chord with a major seventh, which fits.

Also, the Dm chord: in F Lydian, Dm is vi (since D is the sixth scale degree). Similarly, Am is iii? Wait, let's list F Lydian scale degrees:

1. F
2. G
3. A
4. B (the #4, which makes it Lydian)
5. C
6. D
7. E

So chords:
I: F (F-A-C)
ii: Gm (G-Bb-D? Wait no, B natural is in the scale. F Lydian has B natural, so G chord would be G-B-D, which is G major, not minor. Oh, right! I made a mistake.

In F Lydian (from C major scale):
- F: F-A-C (I)
- G: G-B-D (II, major)
- A: A-C-E (iii, minor)
- B: B-D-F (iv°, diminished)
- C: C-E-G (V, major)
- D: D-F-A (vi, minor)
- E: E-G-B (vii°, diminished)

But in the progression, we have Dm/F. Dm is D-F-A, which is vi in F Lydian. Am is A-C-E, which is iii in F Lydian. G7 is G-B-D-F. G-B-D-F: G to B is major third (since B natural), D and F. So it's G7, which is a dominant seventh, but in F Lydian, G is II, so G7 would be a secondary dominant. Typically, II7 in major keys is used as a secondary dominant to V, but here it's resolving to F? Not directly.

The progression goes: ... Am/E G7/F F ... so Am to G7 to F. In F Lydian, Am is iii, G7 is II7 (since G is II, and the 7 makes it a dom7), and F is I. But ii chord is G major, so G7 is not diatonic; it has F natural, which is the minor seventh. In F Lydian, the diatonic chord on G would be G major (G-B-D), without the F. Adding F makes it G7, which is borrowed.

But G7 to C is a V7-I in C major, but here it's going to F. So G7 to F is a deceptive cadence? Or perhaps the G7 is acting as a secondary dominant to C, but then it goes to Cmaj7, which resolves the G7, and then to F.

The progression has: ... G7/F F F ... but before that, it's Am/E to G7/F, then F. Then later, Cmaj7/E to F.

So the cadence is Am (iii) - G7 (II7) - F (I), and then separately Cmaj7 (V) to F (I).

The Cmaj7 to F is a V-I cadence in F Lydian. That's strong. Whereas G7 to F is a ii7-I if G is ii, but G7 is a dominant seventh, which isn't diatonic to Lydian. However, in modal harmony, sometimes dominant sevenths are used for color.

But the presence of Cmaj7 (which is V in F Lydian) resolving to F (I) is a clear indicator. Also, the overall note collection is C major, but centered on F.

Another angle: the bass notes. The progression has inversions with specific bass notes: Dm/F (bass F), Am/E (bass E), G7/F (bass F), Cmaj7/E (bass E). So the bass often stays on F or moves to E.

The pedal point on F? The progression starts with F, then Dm/F (still F bass), then F again, etc. So F is a pedal tone.

In modal terms, if F is the tonic, and the scale has B natural (not Bb), that's Lydian. If it had Bb, it would be Mixolydian or something else.

Since all notes match C major, and F is tonic, it's F Lydian.

Confirming with the chords:

- F: I
- Dm: vi (in F Lydian, Dm is vi)
- Am: iii
- G7: This is a bit tricky. G7 is not diatonic to F Lydian because F Lydian has G major (G-B-D), not G7 (which has F). But G7 can be seen as a secondary dominant. However, in the context, it might be functioning as a passing chord. But the Cmaj7 is diatonic (V).
- Cmaj7: V in F Lydian

The progression uses both the V (Cmaj7) and the ii (Gm, but they use G7 which is altered). But the strong resolution of Cmaj7 to F suggests F is tonic.

Also, ending on F after Cmaj7 is a perfect cadence in F Lydian.

So key center is F, mode is Lydian.

But let's double-check for C major. If it were in C major, ending on F (IV) would be a plagal cadence but incomplete, and the piece might feel unresolved. However, the progression has a lot of F chords, so it might be centered on F.

Another test: play the scale. The notes are C major, so if F is the tonic, it's F Lydian.

Yes, I think F Lydian is the answer.

Based on the chord progression you provided (**F – F – Dm/F – Dm/F – F – F – Am/E – G7/F – F – F – Cmaj7/E – F**), I'll break down the analysis step by step to determine the **key center** and **mode**. The short answer is:

- **Key center: F**  
- **Mode: Lydian** (specifically **F Lydian**)  

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Chord Symbols**
- **Slash chords** (e.g., **Dm/F**) indicate **inversions**. The note after the slash is the bass note:
  - **Dm/F** = D minor triad (D-F-A) with **F** in the bass → *still contains D-F-A*.
  - **Am/E** = A minor triad (A-C-E) with **E** in the bass → *still contains A-C-E*.
  - **G7/F** = G dominant 7th (G-B-D-F) with **F** in the bass → *still contains G-B-D-F*.
  - **Cmaj7/E** = C major 7th (C-E-G-B) with **E** in the bass → *still contains C-E-G-B*.
- **Plain chords** (e.g., **F**) are in root position (F-A-C).

---

### **Step 2: Extract All Unique Notes**
List every note from all chords to identify the **scale**:
- **F**: F, A, C  
- **Dm/F**: D, F, A  
- **Am/E**: A, C, E  
- **G7/F**: G, B, D, F  
- **Cmaj7/E**: C, E, G, B  

**Combined unique notes**: **F, G, A, B, C, D, E**.  
→ This is the **C major scale** (C-D-E-F-G-A-B), but **reordered starting on F**.  

This is critical: **F-G-A-B-C-D-E** is **F Lydian** (the 4th mode of C major).  

---

### **Step 3: Identify the Key Center (Tonic)**
- The progression **starts and ends on F** (repeated prominently: 8 out of 12 chords are variations of F).
- **G7/F → F** and **Cmaj7/E → F** act as **cadences resolving to F**:
  - **G7** (dominant 7th) strongly pulls to **C** (in C major), but here it resolves to **F** instead. This suggests **F is the tonic**, not C.
  - **Cmaj7 → F** is a **V-I cadence in F Lydian** (more on this below).
- **Bass pedal point**: The bass often lingers on **F** (e.g., in Dm/**F**, G7/**F**), emphasizing F as the tonal center.
- In **C major**, ending on F (IV chord) would feel unresolved (it's a "plagal cadence" like "Amen," but not a true tonal resolution). Here, the progression **feels complete on F**, confirming F as the tonic.

---

### **Step 4: Confirm the Mode**
The note collection (**F-G-A-B-C-D-E**) matches **F Lydian** because:
- **Lydian mode** is defined by a **raised 4th scale degree** (♮4 instead of ♭4).
  - In F major: 4th degree is **B♭** (F-G-A-**B♭**-C-D-E).
  - In F Lydian: 4th degree is **B♮** (F-G-A-**B♮**-C-D-E).  
  → Your progression uses **B♮** (in G7 and Cmaj7), **not B♭**, ruling out F major.
- **Chord functions in F Lydian**:
  | Chord      | Function in F Lydian | Why?                                                                 |
  |------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **F**      | **I** (tonic)        | Starts/ends the progression; stable resolution point.                |
  | **Dm/F**   | **vi**               | Dm = vi chord (D-F-A = scale degrees 6-1-3).                         |
  | **Am/E**   | **iii**              | Am = iii chord (A-C-E = scale degrees 3-5-7).                        |
  | **G7/F**   | **II7** (altered)    | G7 is not diatonic (G-B-D-F has F, the ♭7), but acts as a **secondary dominant** pulling to C (V). |
  | **Cmaj7/E**| **V**                | Cmaj7 = V chord (C-E-G-B = scale degrees 5-7-2-4#). The **B♮** is the signature ♯4 of Lydian. |

#### Why not C major?
- In C major, F is the **IV chord** (subdominant), but:
  - The progression **avoids resolving to C** as the tonic (it ends on F).
  - **G7** (V7 in C) should resolve to **C**, but here it resolves to **F** (via Am, a deceptive cadence), weakening C as the tonal center.
  - The constant emphasis on **F** (with pedal tones and cadences) shifts the gravity to F.

#### Why not other modes?
- **Mixolydian** (e.g., F Mixolydian = C major scale starting on F): This has **B♭**, but your progression uses **B♮** (in G7 and Cmaj7). ❌  
- **Dorian** (e.g., F Dorian = G minor scale): This has **G♭/F♯**, but your progression uses **G♮**. ❌  
- **Ionian (major)**: F major requires **B♭**, but **B♮** is present. ❌  
- **C major**: F is IV, but the progression feels resolved on F (not C). ❌  

---

### **Step 5: Why F Lydian? The Evidence**
1. **Strong Lydian cadence**: **Cmaj7 (V) → F (I)** is a textbook **V-I resolution in Lydian** (C is the dominant chord in F Lydian).
2. **♯4 (B♮) as a color tone**: The **B♮** in G7 and Cmaj7 is the Lydian "signature" – it creates a bright, floating quality (e.g., "The Simpsons Theme," "Flying in a Blue Dream").
3. **Bass movement**: The inversions (**/F**, **/E**) create smooth voice leading around F:
   - **E** (in Am/**E** and Cmaj7/**E**) is the 7th scale degree (leading tone) in F Lydian, pulling toward F.
   - **F** in bass acts as a pedal, anchoring the mode.

---

### **Summary**
- **Key center**: **F** (all chords resolve to/revolve around F).  
- **Mode**: **Lydian** (due to **B♮** as the 4th scale degree, creating the characteristic raised 4th).  
- **Scale**: **F–G–A–B–C–D–E** (identical to C major but centered on F).  

This progression is a classic example of **modal harmony** where the **Lydian mode** creates a dreamy, uplifting sound (common in jazz, film scores, and progressive rock). If you play this with F as the "home" note, the B♮ will give it that unmistakable Lydian "lift"! 🎵
