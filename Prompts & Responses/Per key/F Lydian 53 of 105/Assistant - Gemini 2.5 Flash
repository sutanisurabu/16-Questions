The chord progression is: **F - F - Dm/F - Dm/F - F - F - Am/E - G7/F - F - F - Dm/F - Dm/F - F - F - Cmaj7/E - F**

Here's an analysis of the chords and potential keys:

1.  **Dominant Chords and Resolution:**
    *   The progression uses a **G7/F** chord. This is a G Dominant 7th chord with an F in the bass. This chord is built on the second degree of F Major, the third degree of Eb Major, and the fourth degree of D Minor (in harmonic minor).
    *   If this G7 were functioning as a V/V (dominant of the dominant), it would typically lead to C, but here it leads back to **F**. This suggests the F is the tonic.
    *   The presence of **Am** (iii), **Dm** (vi), and **Cmaj7** (V, although *C* major is typically V) strongly points towards **F Major**.

2.  **Diatonic Chords in F Major:**
    The diatonic chords in F Major are:
    *   F (I)
    *   Gm (ii)
    *   Am (iii)
    *   Bb (IV)
    *   C (V)
    *   Dm (vi)
    *   E° (vii°)

    All the major chords in the progression fit perfectly within F Major:
    *   **F** (I) - Tonic
    *   **Dm/F** (vi/I) - Submediant over Tonic pedal
    *   **Am/E** (iii/vii) - Mediant over a non-tonic bass note
    *   **Cmaj7/E** (V/vii) - Dominant 7th over a non-tonic bass note

3.  **The Anomalous Chords (G7/F):**
    *   The **G7** chord is *not* diatonic to F Major (G minor is). When a major chord or dominant 7th is built on the second scale degree (I, **II**, III, IV...), it often acts as a **secondary dominant (V/V)** leading to the dominant (C). *However, here it immediately returns to F.*
    *   This non-functional use of a G7 (or G major) is relatively common in popular music, sometimes called a "borrowed chord" used for color, or simply a bass line shift over a chord built on G. Given the strong presence of all other F Major diatonic chords, this G7 is likely a temporary chromatic alteration or an extension of the preceding Am (implying a chromatic bass walk) that momentarily resolves back to the tonic.

4.  **Bass Line and Pedal Point:**
    *   Notice the frequent **F** in the bass (**F, Dm/F**). This creates a strong **tonic pedal point** reinforcing F as the center.
    *   The bass moves down chromatically/diatonically (F -> E -> F). The **Am/E** and **Cmaj7/E** are inversions specifically focusing on the descending E in the bass line (F -> E), which is often a feature of approaching the dominant or tonic.

**Conclusion:**

The overwhelming evidence—the use of F, Dm, Am, and Cmaj7, the tonic pedal point on F, and the overall harmonic motion—establishes the key signature and tonic.

*   **Key:** **F**
*   **Mode:** **Major** (Ionian)
