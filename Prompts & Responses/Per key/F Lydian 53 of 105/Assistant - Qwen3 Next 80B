Let’s analyze the chord progression:

**Chord sequence:**

> F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

---

### Step 1: List the unique chords (ignoring bass notes for now, but noting them):

- F
- Dm (D minor)
- Am (A minor)
- G7
- Cmaj7

Bass notes in slashes:
- Dm/F → D minor with F in bass → **F is the bass note**
- Am/E → A minor with E in bass
- G7/F → G7 with F in bass
- Cmaj7/E → C major 7 with E in bass

So we’re dealing with **inverted chords**, especially **bass motion** that’s important for harmonic function.

---

### Step 2: Identify root notes of chords

Let’s list the **chord roots**:

- F
- Dm → D
- F
- F
- Am → A
- G7 → G
- F
- Dm → D
- F
- Cmaj7 → C
- F

So root movement:  
**F → D → F → F → A → G → F → D → F → C → F**

This suggests a kind of **stepwise or modal motion**, not typical diatonic functional harmony.

But let’s look at **keys** these chords belong to.

---

### Step 3: Find common key

Look at the chords: **F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7**

Let’s see what key contains all these:

- F major scale: **F G A Bb C D E**
- D minor: D E F G A B C → **D natural minor** = A minor key signature? Wait, D minor is the **relative minor** of F major.

So **F major** scale has:
- F (I)
- G (II)
- A (III)
- Bb (IV)
- C (V)
- D (VI)
- E (VII)

Chords in F major diatonic:
- I: F
- ii: Gm
- iii: Am
- IV: Bb
- V: C
- vi: Dm
- vii°: Em

But we have:
- F (I) ✅
- Dm (vi) ✅
- Am (iii) ✅
- G7 (not diatonic — G7 has F#, but F major has F natural)
- Cmaj7 (V7 would be C7, but this is Cmaj7 — major 7th, so C E G B — B natural)

Here’s the problem:

- **G7** = G B D F → has **F natural**? No: G7 = G B D **F** — wait, **F is natural, not sharp**.

Wait! **G7 is G-B-D-F** — that’s **F natural**, not F#.

So **G7** with **F natural** is the **dominant 7th chord of C major** — because in C major, the V chord is G7 = G-B-D-F.

But we’re in **F major**, which has B♭.

So G7 = G-B-D-F — that’s **not diatonic to F major** — because F major has B♭, not B natural.

Wait — hold on: **G7** contains **B natural** and **F natural**.

But in **F major**, the 7th scale degree is **E**, not E#.

So **B natural** would be **outside** F major.

But wait — maybe we’re in **C major**?

C major scale: C D E F G A B

Chords:
- C (I)
- Dm (ii)
- Em (iii)
- F (IV)
- G (V)
- Am (vi)
- B° (vii°)

Our chords: **F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7**

- F = IV ✅
- Dm = ii ✅
- Am = vi ✅
- G7 = V7 ✅
- Cmaj7 = I with major 7th — unusual, because C major’s tonic chord is usually just C, not Cmaj7, but it’s acceptable.

So in **C major**, all these chords fit:

- F (IV)
- Dm (ii)
- Am (vi)
- G7 (V7)
- Cmaj7 (I — major 7th, a color variation)

So even though Cmaj7 is “extended,” it’s still within C major.

But what about G7? G7 = G-B-D-F — in C major, F is natural, B is natural — perfect! F major has B♭, but C major has B♮, so **G7 is diatonic to C major**.

Wait — earlier I thought F major — but F major has B♭, so **G7 cannot be in F major** because it contains B natural.

So **G7 implies C as tonic**.

Also, Cmaj7 is strong tonic support.

So key is almost certainly **C major**.

Now check the bass movement:

We’re told:

> F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

So let’s write the bassline:

- F → F → F (in Dm/F) → F (in Dm/F) → F → F → E (in Am/E) → F (in G7/F) → F → F → F (in Dm/F) → F (in Dm/F) → F → F → E (in Cmaj7/E) → F

So bass notes:  
F F F F F F **E** **F** F F F F F F **E** F

Now:  
- **Am/E** = bass E → E is the 5th of A minor — so it’s a first inversion Am.
- **G7/F** = bass F → F is the 7th of G7. This is a **G7 with the 7th in bass** → uncommon, but valid (leads to C, with F resolving to E).
- **Cmaj7/E** = bass E → E is the major 3rd of Cmaj7 → this is a **first inversion Cmaj7**.

So we’re seeing **bass motion E → F → E → F** at the end.

**Analysis of Ending:**

Am/E → G7/F → Cmaj7/E → F

- Am/E = A-C-E (bass E)
- G7/F = G-B-D-F (bass F)
- Cmaj7/E = C-E-G-B (bass E)
- F = F-A-C (bass F)

This **E-F-E-F** motion in the bass is **chromatic neighbor motion** — E and F are a half-step apart.

This sounds like voice leading.

Also, from Am/E → G7/F:  
- Bass: E → F (ascending chromatic)
- Chord: vi → V7

In C major, vi → V7 is typical.

G7/F (G7 with F in bass) is a **common tone voice leading** — the F resolves down to E in the next chord (Cmaj7/E), and E is the 3rd of C.

This is **very characteristic of the iv-V7-I progression in a mode shift or borrowed harmony**?

Wait — hold on.

But earlier we said all chords are diatonic to C major.

Yes:

- Am (vi) → G7 (V7) → Cmaj7 (I)
- All in C major.

G7 is the dominant 7th in C major — standard.

Cmaj7 instead of C — that’s just a color: very common in jazz/pop.

The bass movement: E → F → E → F doesn’t change the key — it’s just smooth bass motion.

Notice: **F** appears as a chord root and also as the 7th of G7.

This sounds like a **modal mixture**? Or just stepwise bass movement?

Actually, the most compelling argument:

✅ All chords are diatonic to **C major**  
✅ G7 fits only if we’re in C — not F (because F major has B♭, G7 requires B♮)  
✅ Cmaj7 is a colorful tonic  
✅ Am and Dm are both diatonic (vi and ii)  
✅ The bass motion, while unusual, is just **inverted chords** with chromatic neighbor motion in bass — NOT key change.

Therefore:

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: C major**  
> **Mode: Ionian (major)**

The progression is in the key of **C major**, using standard diatonic chords with some inversions and color tones (Cmaj7, bass stepwise motion). There is no indication of modulation or minor mode — the tonal center is clearly C, with V7 → I resolution typical of major keys.
