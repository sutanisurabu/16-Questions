### Reasoning

Okay, the user has given me a chord progression: F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to look at all the chords listed. The progression repeats a pattern, so maybe I should just analyze one cycle. Let me list out the chords in order: F, F, Dm/F, Dm/F, F, F, Am/E, G7/F, then repeats F, F, Dm/F, Dm/F, F, F, Cmaj7/E, F. 

Hmm, some of these have slashes, like Dm/F, which means D minor with F in the bass. Similarly, Am/E is A minor with E in the bass, G7/F is G7 with F in the bass, and Cmaj7/E is C major 7 with E in the bass. Slashed chords indicate the bass note is different from the root of the chord. So for Dm/F, the root is D, but the bass is F. So actually, the chord in the bass is F, so maybe it's an inversion or part of another chord.

I should figure out the actual notes being played. Let me write out each chord with their notes:

- F major: F, A, C
- F major (again, same)
- Dm/F: D minor over F bass. So notes are F (bass), D, F, A? Wait no. D minor is D, F, A. If it's Dm/F, the bass is F, so the notes would be F (bass), D, A. So it's D minor in first inversion. Similarly, Am/E: A minor is A, C, E. E in the bass, so bass note E, then A, C. So notes E, A, C. That's actually E minor? Wait, no. A minor over E bass. So E, A, C. Which is the same as E minor, but E minor has E, G, B. Wait, no. Am is A, C, E. So with E in the bass, the notes are E, A, C. Which is actually a C major chord in second inversion? Wait, C major is C, E, G. But here we have E, A, C. A is not in C major. So E, A, C – that's E minor chord? No. E minor is E, G, B. This has A and C. So perhaps it's C major with A in the bass? Wait, C major chord with A in the bass would be C/A, which is A, C, E? Wait, no: chords in first inversion. C major chord is C-E-G. First inversion is E-G-C. So C in third inversion would be G-C-E? Wait, maybe I should list the intervals.

Wait, maybe better to think of each chord's notes:

- F chord: F, A, C
- Dm/F: D, F, A with F as bass – so notes F (bass), D, A. So the chord is D minor triad in first inversion (since first inversion has the third in the bass; D minor third is F, yes). So Dm/F = F, D, A.
- Am/E: A, C, E with E as bass – so notes E, A, C. Which is the same as C major (C, E, A?) Wait, C major is C, E, G. Here it's E, A, C. So that's A minor, but with E in the bass. A minor chord is A, C, E. So Am/E would be E in bass, then A and C. So the notes E, A, C. That's actually an inversion of an A minor chord. So the root is A, but bass note is E, which is the fifth of A minor. So Am/E is second inversion of A minor.

Similarly, G7/F: G7 chord is G, B, D, F. With F in the bass. So notes F, G, B, D. So that's F as bass, then G, B, D. So G7 in third inversions? G7 chord: root G, 7th F. Inversions: root position, first inversion (B), second inversion (D), third inversion (F). So G7/F is third inversion.

Cmaj7/E: Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B. With E in the bass. So E, C, G, B. So that's Cmaj7 in first inversion (since E is the third of Cmaj7 chord). So the bass note E, then C, G, B.

Wait, but all these chords... Let me list all the chords with their full notes:

The progression is written as:

F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

So let's break it down chord by chord with notes:

1. F: F A C
2. F: F A C
3. Dm/F: F (bass), D, A – so notes F, D, A
4. Dm/F: same as above
5. F: F A C
6. F: F A C
7. Am/E: E (bass), A, C – so E, A, C
8. G7/F: F (bass), G, B, D – so F, G, B, D
9. F: F A C
10. F: F A C
11. Dm/F: F, D, A
12. Dm/F: same
13. F: F A C
14. F: F A C
15. Cmaj7/E: E (bass), C, G, B – so E, C, G, B
16. F: F A C

Looking at all the bass notes here. The bass notes are F, F, F, F, F, F, E, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, E, F.

Wait, the bass notes for each chord:

Position 1: F (F chord)
Position 2: F
Position 3: Dm/F → bass F
Position 4: Dm/F → bass F
Position 5: F → bass F
Position 6: F → bass F
Position 7: Am/E → bass E
Position 8: G7/F → bass F
Position 9: F → bass F
Position 10: F → bass F
Position 11: Dm/F → bass F
Position 12: Dm/F → bass F
Position 13: F → bass F
Position 14: F → bass F
Position 15: Cmaj7/E → bass E
Position 16: F → bass F

So the bass notes are mostly F, but there are some E's (at positions 7 and 15). So the bass is moving between F and E.

Now, looking at all the notes in the chords. Let's list all the notes used across all chords. The progression uses:

From F chord: F, A, C

Dm/F: F, D, A

Am/E: E, A, C

G7/F: F, G, B, D

Cmaj7/E: E, C, G, B (since Cmaj7 is C, E, G, B; E in bass, so E, C, G, B)

So possible notes present: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Wait, all notes from F major scale? F major scale is F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E.

Wait, here, looking at the chord G7: G, B, D, F. G7 chord is usually G-B-D-F, which includes B natural. In F major, the B should be Bb, unless it's not F major. Wait, F major scale has a Bb. But G7 chord has a B natural. That's a problem.

F major scale: F, G, A, B♭, C, D, E.

So if there's a B natural, that's from another key. So if there's a B natural in G7 chord, that suggests that the B is not B♭, which would be the case in F major. So maybe F major isn't the key, or maybe it's a different mode.

Wait, maybe it's F Mixolydian? Which has B natural. But let's see.

Wait, G7 chord has a B natural. In F major, B♭ is the fourth, but if it's B natural, then that's not in F major. So for G7 chord to have B natural, the key would have to have B natural. For example, C major has B natural, but G7 is the V chord in C major. But here we have F as the root chord.

Alternatively, maybe it's F Ionian but with a B natural? But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe it's F Mixolydian mode. Let's check:

F Mixolydian is F, G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb? No. Wait, no: Mixolydian mode is major scale with flat 7. So F major scale for F Ionian: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. But wait, F Ionian is same as F major. Wait, but F major scale is F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. Wait, F major: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. Yes. Then Mixolydian mode starting on F would be F, G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb. Wait, no. Wait, the Mixolydian mode is the fifth mode of the major scale. So if the key is C major (C Ionian), then the Mixolydian mode starting on G would be G, A, B, C, D, E, F. So the G Mixolydian would have B natural. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps to get a G7 chord with B natural, which is the V chord in C major. But in this progression, the chords are all around F and some others. Let's see.

If the chord progression has G7 (G, B, D, F), then if B is natural, that would mean it's in a key where B is natural. So if the key is C major, but the root chord here is F, which is IV in C major. But the progression starts with F chord. Let's see: C major has chords: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am. So F is IV. G is V. But if we have F as the starting chord, maybe it's in C major, but starting on IV. But the progression has F as the main chord. Let's check all chords.

We have F chords. Then Dm, which in C major is ii. Then Am/E – Am is vi in C major. G7 is V7 in C major. So if it's C major, but starting on F (the IV), that's possible. So the key would be C major, with F being the tonic? Wait, but if the key is C major, then the tonic is C, but the progression starts with F, which is the fourth. So maybe it's in C major, but the chord progression is using F as the root chord, but the key is C major. But the question is determining the key and mode.

But let's check if all notes fit into C major.

C major: C, D, E, F, G, A, B.

Yes, all the notes we saw in the chords:

- F chord: F, A, C
- Dm: D, F, A
- Am: A, C, E
- G7: G, B, D, F – yes, all in C major (G, B, D, F – but wait, G7 in C major is G, B, D, F, yes. B natural is correct for C major. Because F major would have Bb, but here B natural is present. So that suggests it's not F major but C major.

Wait, for example, if the key were F major, then G7 chord would be G, Bb, D, F. But here we have a G7 chord with B natural, which is G7, but with B natural. So if it's F major, which uses Bb, then the B in G7 would be a borrowed note from another key. But if it's C major, then all notes are consistent. Let's check.

C major has scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B. All natural. So G7 chord in C major is G, B, D, F. Yes. So B natural.

Now, looking at the chords in the progression:

- F (C major's IV chord)
- Dm (ii)
- Am (vi)
- G7 (V7)

Also, Cmaj7 chord appears. Cmaj7 would be C, E, G, B. Which is the I chord in C major.

So the progression has chords that are all diatonic to C major. Let's see:

F, Dm, Am, G7, Cmaj7. All these chords are in C major.

But the key is C major. However, the progression starts with F as the first chord. So the tonic might be C, but the piece centers around F. Wait, but maybe it's a modal interpretation.

Wait, C major is the key, but if the music centers around F, then perhaps it's F Lydian? But wait, F Lydian would have a raised fourth: B natural. C major is the parent scale. Wait, F Lydian would have F, G, A, B natural, C, D, E. Wait, F Lydian has a #4. But in C major, the fourth is F? Wait, no. Let me think again.

If the key is C major, then the mode starting on F would be F Mixolydian. Because C major scale: C D E F G A B, so the modes:

C Ionian (C major)

D Dorian

E Phrygian

F Lydian

G Mixolydian

A Aeolian

B Locrian

Wait, hold on. Yes. If the parent scale is C major, then the modes:

- starting on C: Ionian
- D: Dorian
- E: Phrygian
- F: Lydian (since F Lydian is F G A B C D E; B natural is #4 compared to F Ionian's Bb)
- G: Mixolydian (G A B C D E F)
- A: Aeolian (A B C D E F G)
- B: Locrian

So in this progression, if they're using chords from C major but focusing on F as tonic, then F Lydian because Lydian has a raised fourth, which is B natural. Wait, F Lydian's notes would be F, G, A, B, C, D, E. So yes, B natural. Which matches the G7 chord having B natural.

But in the progression, the key would be C major as the parent scale, but the mode being used is F Lydian if the tonal center is F. However, typically "key" refers to the tonic of the piece. If the piece centers around F, using F Lydian mode.

But let's check the chord progression again.

The chords are:

F, F, Dm/F, Dm/F, F, F, Am/E, G7/F, ... then later Cmaj7/E.

Wait, the Cmaj7 chord at the end before the last F. So when we have Cmaj7, which is the I chord in C major.

But if the tonal center is F, then Cmaj7 would be a V chord? No: in F Lydian, the chords... Wait, perhaps better to list chords of F Lydian.

F Lydian scale: F G A B C D E

So diatonic triads:

F major (I)
G major (II)
A minor (iii)
B diminished (iv°)
C major (V)
D minor (vi)
E minor (vii)

But wait, in F Lydian, the fourth degree is B natural, so the chords built on F would have a major 7th? Let's see.

Triads:

1. F major: F-A-C
2. G major: G-B-D
3. A minor: A-C-E
4. B diminished: B-D-F
5. C major: C-E-G
6. D minor: D-F-A
7. E minor: E-G-B

But in the progression, we have Dm/F which is D minor, F in bass. Dm is vi in C major, or in F Lydian, D minor would be vi.

But in F Lydian, the chords would be like:

I = F major

II = G major (not G minor)

But in the progression, there's a G7 chord. But in F Lydian, the G chord would be G major, but to make it a dominant seventh, G7 would be G-B-D-F, but in F Lydian scale, F is in the scale, so yes. Wait, F is the tonic, the seventh of G7 is F natural. But F Lydian scale has all natural notes. So G-B-D-F would fit into F Lydian, but G dominant seventh? In C major, G7 is V7, and in F Lydian... Wait, the V chord in F Lydian is C major. So in F Lydian, the V chord would be C major. But if there's a G7 chord, which would be the II7 chord? But in F Lydian, G would be major triad with a seventh: G-B-D-F. Yes. So G7 in F Lydian would be the II7 chord. But usually, dominant seventh chords are on the fifth degree. But here, G7 could be a secondary dominant or part of the mode.

However, looking at the chord progression:

F chord (I in F Lydian)

Dm: vi in F Lydian? Wait, D minor is vi in F Lydian. Because F Lydian scale's sixth note is D, so minor triad.

Am/E: A is iii in F lydian.

G7: II7 in F Lydian.

Cmaj7: Vmaj7 in F Lydian (since C major is fifth degree). In F Lydian, fifth degree chord is C major. Cmaj7 would be C-E-G-B, which fits in F Lydian.

But the progression has Cmaj7, which would be Vmaj7, but in standard Lydian, the fifth degree is major triad. So C is the fifth of F, yes. So C major.

So if the entire progression revolves around F, then the key is F Lydian. Let me check the notes.

But wait, in C major, the chords also fit, but the tonal center is F. If the piece starts on F and ends on F, then the tonal center is F. But looking at the progression: it starts with F and ends with F. So the last chord is F. Also, the progression is repeating the pattern. So if we look at the structure:

F F ... and finally ends on F. So the tonic may be F.

Now, in key of F major, the chords would usually have Bb. But here, G7 chord has B natural. So in F major, G7 would be G-Bb-D-F (G minor seven chord), but the user listed G7, which is typically dominant seventh, so G-B-D-F with B natural. But F major has Bb, so that G7 chord with B natural is not in F major. So it's a different key.

So key of C major: all chords fit, and tonal center might be C, but the progression starts on F. Alternatively, the piece could be in F Lydian mode. F Lydian has F as the tonic, and uses B natural. So in F Lydian, the scale is F, G, A, B, C, D, E.

Let's check all chords:

F major chord: yes, I.

Dm: D minor. D is the sixth degree in F Lydian. Yes, D minor chord (D, F, A).

Am: A minor chord (third degree of F Lydian scale). A is third degree.

G7: G dominant seventh chord (G, B, D, F). In F Lydian scale, G is the second degree, so it's a II7 chord. That's typical in Lydian mode, yes.

Am/E: A minor with E in bass. A minor chord is A, C, E. E in bass would be E, A, C. In F Lydian, E is the seventh degree. So chord is A minor in second inversion. Still part of the scale.

Cmaj7: C major seventh chord. C is fifth degree, so Vmaj7. In F Lydian, yes.

So all chords are part of F Lydian mode.

Another point: the use of Cmaj7. If the key was C major, then Cmaj7 is the tonic chord, but the progression starts with F, and there's a lot of F chords. Also, the G7 chord is V in C major. If the piece was in C major, the typical progression would be more like C, G, F, Am etc. But here, the F is the main chord, and the G7 leads to... well, G7 usually leads to C, but in the progression here, after G7/F comes F, so that might be a bit odd. In C major, G7 leads to C, but here after G7 it goes to F. So maybe it's not C major.

In F Lydian mode, the chord progression is moving around F. Let's see: starting on F, then Am, then G7... In F Lydian, the V chord is C, so G7 might be serving as a II chord, which could resolve to C (V), but then after C it goes to F. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a plagal cadence or something else.

Another way: the chord progression could be F - F - Dm/F - etc. So the bass is mostly F. Let's look at the bass notes. The bass notes are F most of the time, with occasional E. Am/E has E bass, so E note in the bass, then Cmaj7/E also has E bass. So when they have Am/E and Cmaj7/E, that gives a bass E.

But in F Lydian mode, the scale is F G A B C D E. So E is the leading tone? Wait, in F major scale (Ionian), leading tone is E natural, but F major has Bb. Wait, in F major, the scale is F G A Bb C D E. So E is the major seventh. But in F Lydian, it's F G A B C D E. So same seventh degree E natural, but the fourth degree is B natural. So in F Lydian, the fourth is raised.

Now, another clue: the G7 chord. In F Lydian, G7 has a B natural and F natural. Since F is in the scale, so yes.

If the tonic is F, then the chords:

F major: I chord

Dm: minor chord on sixth degree (in F Lydian, the vi is D minor)

Am: iii chord

G7: II7 chord

Cmaj7: Vmaj7 chord.

So the progression would be moving from I to II7 to V, which is a pretty standard progression. Wait, but how does it go?

Let's see the chord sequence again:

F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

Breaking it down:

First part: F, F, Dm/F (Dm with F bass), same again, then F, F – so maybe F major chord with bass F through several bars.

Then Am/E: A minor with E bass, then G7/F (G7 with F bass), then repeat of the previous section, then Cmaj7/E (Cmaj7 with E bass), then ending on F.

So in terms of chord functions in F Lydian:

- F: I
- Dm: vi
- Am: iii
- G7: II7 (though usually dominant seventh is on V, but II7 can be used)
- Cmaj7: V

But Cmaj7 and G7? Maybe the progression is F - G7 - Cmaj7 - F, but in the actual progression it's G7 followed by Cmaj7? Wait, in the given sequence: after G7/F comes F F etc., then later Cmaj7/E followed by F. Hmm. Wait, let's look at the progression's exact sequence.

Positions 7-8: Am/E (bass E) and G7/F (bass F). So after Am/E (E, A, C), then G7/F (F, G, B, D). Then later positions 15-16: Cmaj7/E (E, C, G, B) and F.

So the part with Cmaj7/E and then F. So the Cmaj7/E is followed by F. If Cmaj7 is V chord, then F would be I. So a V - I cadence, but in C major, V to I is G to C. But here, if in F Lydian, V chord is C major, then V-I would be C -> F. Yes. So Cmaj7 (V) to F (I) is a V-I cadence in F Lydian mode. That makes sense.

Similarly, G7 chord is followed by Cmaj7? Not exactly in this progression. Because after G7/F it goes to F, F, then later Cmaj7/E. Hmm. Let's see the order:

...G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F

So after G7/F comes F chord, then more F's and Dm/F etc., then Cmaj7/E F.

So the Cmaj7/E is followed by F. So maybe a Cmaj7 to F, which in F Lydian is V-I.

Yes. And before that, there's G7/F chord. If G7 is II7 in F Lydian, then II7 to V? But II7 usually goes to V. In some contexts, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe G7 is part of a different function.

But given that all the chords fit into F Lydian (F major scale with B natural and F as tonic), and the progression centers on F as the tonic chord.

In C major, if the tonic were C, then the progression would have a lot of F and G7 chords, but the ending on F would not make sense. Because ending on F (subdominant) in C major would not be typical resolution. Whereas ending on F in F Lydian is the tonic.

Also, the use of B natural throughout is critical. In typical F major, there's a Bb, but here all B's are natural. So if the G7 has B natural, then it's not F major. The presence of B natural points to a mode that has B natural with F as tonic.

Therefore, the most likely key would be F Lydian.

Another check: in F Lydian, the scale has F as tonic. The fourth degree is B natural. F Lydian's notes are F, G, A, B, C, D, E. So yes.

So key: F

Mode: Lydian (since major scale with #4)

Alternatively, is it possible to be in C major with F as the tonic? That's less likely, since C major's tonic is C. But if the piece uses F as tonic within C major, then it's using F Lydian mode, which is the fourth mode of C major. So the key would be C major with mode Lydian on F. But usually we would name the key as F Lydian.

So the answer should be F Lydian.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is C major but the mode being used is F Lydian. But typically the key is named as the tonic plus mode. So F Lydian.

Another point: F major would have a Bb, but none of the chords have Bb. All the chords have B natural, like in G7 (G B D F), so yes, B natural. Cmaj7 has B natural (C E G B). So no Bb anywhere. So it's definitely not F major. So if it's a mode starting on F, it must be Lydian. Because Ionian would be F major with Bb. But B is natural here, so it's Lydian.

So yes, mode is Lydian, key is F.

Wait, sometimes people say the key as F Lydian, meaning the tonic is F and the mode is Lydian.

Yes.

Alternatively, if someone says C major, but F is the tonal center. But usually the key is named by the tonic note and the mode. So the key would be F Lydian.

Yes.

Let me confirm again. F Lydian is F G A B C D E. All the chord notes fit.

F chord: F, A, C.

Dm chord: D, F, A – all in scale.

Am chord: A, C, E – yes.

G7: G, B, D, F – yes.

Cmaj7: C, E, G, B – yes.

B natural is there. F major scale would be F G A Bb C D E, so B natural is outside of F Ionian. So yes, F Lydian is correct.

Another angle: if the tonic chord is F major without any flats. But the F major scale has Bb. So if you have a major F chord with no flats, it's not F major. So the key must be F with some different mode. And Lydian has a raised fourth (B natural).

Yes. So the key is F, mode is Lydian.

Alternatively, sometimes people might say the key of C major but in F Lydian mode. But the standard is to refer to the tonic as the key. So F Lydian.

So the determination: key is F, mode is Lydian.

But let me check if there's another possibility. For example, F Mixolydian. Wait, F Mixolydian would be F G A Bb C D Eb. But then the scale has Bb and Eb. But our progression has B natural, so no. So not Mixolydian.

Lydian mode has #4. Yes. So yes.

Another check: G7/F chord. The bass note is F. So the chord is G B D F with F bass. So the full chord is F G B D. Which is a G7 with bass F. But in terms of the scale of F Lydian, F G B D: F, G, B, D. All within F Lydian.

Yes.

So after considering this, the key is F and mode is Lydian.

The progression centers on F as tonic, all chords diatonic to F Lydian scale.

So the answer should be: key of F, mode Lydian.

The chord progression provided is:  
**F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Am/E G7/F F F Dm/F Dm/F F F Cmaj7/E F**

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### **Key Signature and Chord Notes**
- **F major chord**: F–A–C  
- **Dm/F**: D–F–A (F bass)  
- **Am/E**: A–C–E (E bass)  
- **G7/F**: G–B–D–F (F bass)  
- **Cmaj7/E**: C–E–G–B (E bass)  

All chords contain the following notes: **F, G, A, B, C, D, E**.  

#### **Key Consideration**
- A standard **F major scale** contains **B♭**, but here all **B**s are **natural** (e.g., in G7 and Cmaj7).  
- Thus, **F major cannot be the key**.  
- The presence of **B natural** (instead of B♭) suggests a **modal context**.  

#### **Modal Analysis**
The scale consistent with all notes (F, G, A, B, C, D, E) is:  
**F Lydian** (F–G–A–B–C–D–E).  

This mode is the **4th mode of C major**, but the **tonic (center of gravity)** is **F**, not C. This is confirmed by:  
- The progression starts and ends on **F**.  
- All chords are diatonic to **F Lydian**:  
  - **F (I)**: Tonic chord  
  - **Dm (vi)**: Minor chord on 6th scale degree  
  - **Am (iii)**: Minor chord on 3rd scale degree  
  - **G7 (II⁷)**: Dominant 7th chord on 2nd scale degree  
  - **Cmaj7 (V⁷)**: Major 7th chord on 5th scale degree  
- The **V⁷ to I cadence** (Cmaj7 → F) confirms **F as tonic**.  
- The **B natural** (raised 4th of F) is a hallmark of **Lydian mode** (vs. the B♭ in F Ionian).  

#### **Why Not C Major?**
- While all chords fit **C major**, the **tonal center is not C**.  
- The progression centers on **F** as the resolution point (e.g., Cmaj7 → F), and **F is the tonic** of the mode.  
- In classical theory, the "key" is defined by the **tonic note and mode**, not the parent scale. Thus, **F Lydian** is the accurate description.  

---

### Final Determination
- **Key**: **F**  
- **Mode**: **Lydian**  

This mode is characterized by its **raised 4th degree (B natural)**, which is essential for the harmonic structure of the progression. The use of **G7** (with B natural) and **Cmaj7** confirms the Lydian flavor, as both chords are diatonic to F Lydian.  

> ✅ **Answer**: The key is **F Lydian**.
