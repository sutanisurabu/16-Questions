### Reasoning

**Exploring musical keys**

I’m analyzing the G7 in the key of F major; it acts as a secondary dominant to C. The bass playing F under G7 might create a G7/F, leading to a suspension with an F pedal. Now, if I consider Cmaj7/E, that’s Cmaj7 with E in the bass, and in F major, C is the V chord. But wait—Cmaj7 includes B natural, which isn't diatonic in F major. This makes me question if we could actually be in F Lydian.**Analyzing F Lydian**

F Lydian uses the C major scale notes: F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. In this context, Cmaj7 is diatonic as Vmaj7. If I consider G7 (G-B-D-F), it functions as V/V in C major. In F Lydian, G7 operates as II7. Since B natural is part of the scale, G7 becomes diatonic. This leads me to realize that the presence of Cmaj7 and G7 really suggests we're operating in F Lydian. Additionally, Am remains diatonic as iii in both F major and F Lydian.**Identifying F Lydian chords**

I'm looking at Dm, which is vi in F major and remains so in F Lydian—diatonic due to the shared scale notes apart from B natural. So the chords F, Dm/F, Am/E, G7/F, and Cmaj7/E are all diatonic in F Lydian. The prevalence of F in the bass suggests that F is our tonal center. There are no Bb chords, and B natural appears in G7 and Cmaj7, confirming we're in Lydian. With this, I conclude that the key is indeed F Lydian, with Cmaj7/E functioning as Vmaj7/iii6.**Confirming F Lydian**

I'm considering the use of Vmaj7 nearby, possibly borrowed from Lydian, or F major with Lydian color. The inclusion of G7, which is V/V in F major and contains B natural, adds complexity. A G7/F introduces that B natural as well, suggesting Lydian strongly, especially with both G7 and Cmaj7 repeating. The progression focuses on F chords, establishing F as the tonal center and confirming the mode as F Lydian, derived from the C major parent key. I find that the presence of B natural and the predominant F bass really point to Lydian.**Finalizing F Lydian analysis**

The key center is F, and the mode is Lydian, which derives from the parent key of C major. The scale notes are F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. In this context, F serves as I, while Dm is vi, Am/E as iii6/4, and G7/F acts as II7. The diatonic chord set includes Fmaj7, G7, and Am7, affirming the presence of B natural from G7 and Cmaj7. So, we confirm we're indeed in F Lydian!

F Lydian (tonal center F, parent key C major).

Why:
- The harmony repeatedly centers on F (lots of F in the bass).
- B natural appears via G7 (G–B–D–F) and Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B), which rules out F major (would have Bb) and is diatonic to F Lydian.
- All chords fit the F Lydian collection: F G A B C D E.
