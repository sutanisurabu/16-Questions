### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to analyze the chord progression sequence. It looks like "A#m/C#" indicates A# minor with C# in the bass, so I'm considering slash chords. The overall tonality seems to lean towards C# major. If I look at the C# major scale and its diatonic chords, I can confirm that I have C# major (I), D#m (ii), and A#m (vi). The other chords fit within this context too, including G#7 as the dominant.**Analyzing chord relationships**

I'm looking at the chords and determining their relationships in C# major. For instance, A#m with C# in the bass suggests it's in first inversion since A#m consists of A#, C#, and E#. But then there’s Fm, which is not diatonic to C# major—it's usually spelled with flats. I’m realizing there might be a tonal center shift here. What if the key were C# minor instead? That could change things significantly in our chords' roles, especially for Fm.**Exploring chord diatonicity**

I'm reviewing the C# natural minor scale and its diatonic chords, but the provided chords indicate C# major. So, I'm pondering if C# Mixolydian fits better. The chords might include A#m and Fm, but I notice A#m doesn't match that scale. I should check F minor, as it features Fm and chords that would connect in this context. C# major often appears in Ab major or F minor, adding layers to my exploration.**Examining Ab major chords**

I'm analyzing the Ab major scale and its diatonic chords, which are Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb7, Fm, and Gdim. The chords I've seen include C# (Db) major and A#m (Bbm), both of which fit nicely. However, I'm realizing that while G#7 could act as a dominant, it’s actually not the V chord for this key—it's Eb7. The repeated C# chords seem to suggest that C# (or Db) could be the tonic center, leading me to consider Db major as a possible key.**Finalizing key and mode analysis**

I’m concluding that the key is C# major (which is the enharmonic equivalent of Db major). The affirming chords include C#, A#m/C# (which is vi6), Fm/C (iii6), and D#m/C# (ii6) along with G#7/C (V7/6/5). The progression centers on C#, and I see a predominance of diatonic chords reinforcing this. So, I can present my findings succinctly: Key: C# major (enharmonic Db major), Mode: Ionian (major). The chords function well, leading naturally to the tonic.

Key: C# major (enharmonic to Db major)
Mode: Ionian (major)

Reason: The progression centers on C# and uses diatonic functions: A#m/C# = vi6, Fm/C = iii6, D#m/C# = ii6, and G#7/C (Ab7/C) = V6/5 resolving to I (C#).
