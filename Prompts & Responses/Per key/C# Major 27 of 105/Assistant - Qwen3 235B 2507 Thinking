### Reasoning

Okay, I need to figure out the key and mode for this chord progression in C#: C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#. Let me start by writing out all the chords clearly. The progression repeats sections, so I'll list them in order:

C# | C# | A#m/C# | A#m/C# | C# | C# | Fm/C | D#m/C# | C# | C# | A#m/C# | A#m/C# | C# | C# | G#7/C | C#.

Hmm, the notation uses some slash chords like A#m/C# and Fm/C. That means the bass note is specified. For example, A#m/C# is an A# minor chord with C# in the bass. Similarly, Fm/C is an F minor chord with C as the bass note. And D#m/C# is D# minor with C# bass. G#7/C is G# dominant seventh with C bass.

First, I should convert all these chords to their root notes to understand the harmonic foundation. Let's see:

- C# is just C# major (root: C#)
- A#m/C#: chord is A# minor, but bass is C#. So the chord is A#m (A#, C#, E#) but played with C# as the lowest note. Since C# is the third of A#m (because A# to C# is a minor third), this is a first inversion chord. But the harmonic function still relates to A# minor.
- Fm/C: F minor chord (F, Ab, Cb) with C bass. Wait, F minor is F, Ab, C (since minor triad is root, minor third, perfect fifth; Ab is the minor third, and C is the fifth). But in the key of C# major, which has many sharps, maybe it's better to think in terms of enharmonic equivalents. Wait, C# major scale has C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#. Wait, E# is F natural, B# is C natural? No, wait: C# major scale: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, C#. Wait no, standard major scale: 1 C#, 2 D#, 3 E#, 4 F#, 5 G#, 6 A#, 7 B#. So yes, E# is F natural, B# is C natural. But sometimes in chord symbols, they use flats for minor chords. Let me check the chords again.

A#m is A# (root), C# (minor third), E# (fifth, which is F natural). So A#m/C# is A# minor in first inversion.

Fm/C: F minor chord. F minor is F, Ab, C. But wait, in the context of C# major, which has G# and A# and so on, F# is in the key, but F natural would be a lowered fourth? Wait, maybe this key isn't C# major. Let's see.

But the progression starts and ends on C#, so maybe C# is the tonic. But let's list all the roots considering the slash chords:

Wait, slash chords indicate the bass note, but the chord itself is named after the root. So A#m/C# is an A# minor chord (root A#) with C# in the bass. So the chord root is A#, but the bass is C#. Similarly, Fm/C is F minor chord (root F) with C bass. D#m/C# is D# minor (root D#) with C# bass. G#7/C is G# dominant seventh (root G#) with C bass.

So let's list all chord roots ignoring the bass for a moment:

Original progression chords with roots:

C#, C#, A#m, A#m, C#, C#, Fm, D#m, C#, C#, A#m, A#m, C#, C#, G#7, C#.

Now, let's list the roots: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

Wait, F here is F natural, since Fm is F minor. Similarly, D#m is D# minor (D#, F#, A#), G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#.

But let's note all the roots: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

Now, considering the key, we need to see which key these chords fit into. Since many chords are in the sharp keys, but F natural is a problem because C# major has F# (fourth degree), not F natural. So maybe the key is B major? Wait, C# is the second degree of B major. Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Wait, listing all the roots: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

Let me convert these to enharmonic equivalents to see if that helps:

A# is same as Bb, but in a sharp key context, maybe better to keep as A#.

F is F natural.

D# is enharmonic to Eb.

G# is enharmonic to Ab.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the key is C# minor? Because minor keys often have more flats or lowered notes.

Wait, C# natural minor scale is C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B. So notes: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B.

Check the roots:

C# is tonic.

A# (which would be the major VII in C# minor? Wait, natural minor has diatonic chords: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

Wait, C# natural minor: i = C#m, ii° = D#°, III = E, iv = F#m, v = G#m, VI = A, VII = B.

But in our progression, the chords are major C#, A#m, Fm, D#m, G#7.

Hmm, C# is major here, which is not the i chord in natural minor—it's minor. So if the tonic chord is C# major, then it's a major key.

Wait, but in the progression, the first chord is C# (major), so likely C# is the I chord. Let's see what key has C# as the I.

C# major scale: C# D# E# F# G# A# B# C#

But E# is F natural, B# is C natural.

So diatonic chords in C# major:

I: C# major (C#, E#, G#)

ii: D# minor (D#, F#, A#)

iii: E# minor (E#, G#, B#) which is F minor? Wait, E# is F, B# is C. So E# minor chord would be E#, G#, B# → F, A, C. Which is F major? Wait, no: minor chord is root, minor third, fifth. E# minor: E# to G# is minor third (E#-F-F#-G, so minor third is 3 semitones: E# to G# is D# to F#? Wait, better to count semitones.

E# is F. Minor third up from F is Ab (F, F#, G, Ab). So minor chord would be F, Ab, C. Which is F minor. Hmm, getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of chord roots and see which key they belong to.

Our chord roots are: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

Let's list the notes in C# major:

C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B# → which is C#, D#, F, F#, G#, A#, C.

Wait, E# is F natural, B# is C natural.

So in C# major, the diatonic chords would have roots: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#.

But our progression uses A# (which is diatonic as the sixth degree), F natural (which is E# in C# major, so same note), D# (second degree), G# (fifth degree). Wait, F natural is E#, which is the third degree in C# major. So Fm here would be a chord built on the third degree but as minor? Wait, in major keys, the iii chord is minor.

Wait, in C# major:

I: C# (C#, E#, G#)

ii: D#m (D#, F#, A#)

iii: E#m (E#, G#, B#) → which is F minor (F, A, C)? Wait, no:

E# is F, G# is G#, B# is C.

So E# minor chord: root E# (F), minor third would be G (since minor third is 3 semitones: F → F#, G, Ab? Wait, minor third from F is Ab. So minor triad on F is F-Ab-C. So chord on E# (F) as minor would be F-Ab-C, which is F minor. Therefore, E#m is enharmonically equivalent to F minor. So iii chord in C# major is E# minor, which is written as F minor for simplicity? Maybe, but typically in C# major they would use E#.

But in our progression, we have Fm, which would correspond to the iii chord in C# major, but as a minor chord—which it is, since iii is minor in major keys.

Wait, so in C# major:

- I: C# major

- ii: D# minor

- iii: E# minor (F minor)

- IV: F# major

- V: G# major

- vi: A# minor

- vii°: B# diminished

So our progression has C# (I), A#m (vi), Fm (iii), D#m (ii), G#7 (V7).

Yes! G#7 is the dominant seventh in C# major, since V is G# major, so V7 would be G# dominant seventh (G#, B#, D#, F#).

Wait, G#7 chord is G#, B#, D#, F#. Which matches.

Similarly:

- A#m is vi in C# major.

- Fm is iii (since E#m = Fm)

- D#m is ii

- G#7 is V7

Perfect! So all the chords are diatonic to C# major, except... wait, Fm is iii, which is diatonic minor chord. Yes, in major keys, iii is minor.

Wait, but in the progression, we have Fm/C. So F minor chord with C bass. The root is F, which is the iii, so chord is iii.

Similarly, D#m/C# is D# minor (ii) with C# bass (which is the tonic note), so first inversion ii.

A#m/C# is vi with C# bass (tonic), so first inversion vi.

G#7/C is G# dominant seventh (V7) with C bass (the leading tone B# is C natural, so C is the seventh of the G#7 chord? Wait, G#7: G#, B#, D#, F#. The notes are G#, A## (B#), C## (D#), E#. Wait, no: dominant seventh chord is major triad plus minor seventh. So G# major triad (G#, B#, D#) plus minor seventh which is F#. Wait, minor seventh above G# is F#. Yes. So G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#.

Wait, but G# to F#: G# to F## is major seventh (since G# to F# is major seventh down, but up it's minor seventh). Wait, semitones: G# to A#=1, B=2, C=3, C#=4, D=5, D#=6, E=7, F=8, F#=9. Wait, no:

From G#:

G# to A: 1 semitone

A to A#: 2

A# to B: 3

B to C: 4

C to C#:5

C# to D:6

D to D#:7

D# to E:8

E to F:9

F to F#:10

Wait, actually, the minor seventh interval is 10 semitones. G# + 10 semitones: G# → A (1), A# (2), B (3), C (4), C# (5), D (6), D# (7), E (8), F (9), F# (10). Yes, so minor seventh above G# is F#. Therefore, G#7 chord is G#, B#, D#, F#.

But in the slash chord G#7/C, the bass note is C. So the note C natural (which is B#) would be the third of G#7 chord. Wait, B# is the major third of G# (since G# to B# is a major third: 4 semitones: G#-A-A#-B-B#, yes). So G#7 has notes G#, B#, D#, F#. So C natural is B# enharmonically. So in the key of C# major, B# is the leading tone.

So G#7/C means G# dominant seventh with C (B#) in the bass. That would be the third of the chord, so first inversion? Wait, G#7 in root position is G# bass. First inversion would be B# bass. But here it's C bass, which is B#, so yes, it's first inversion G#7.

But regardless of inversion, the chord is V7.

So compiling this:

Chord roots corresponding to C# major scale degrees:

- C# : I

- A#m : vi

- Fm (E#m) : iii

- D#m : ii

- G#7 : V7

All diatonic chords in C# major. So the key should be C# major.

Wait, but let's confirm:

In C# major:

I = C# (C#, E#, G#)

ii = D#m (D#, F#, A#)

iii = E#m (E#, G#, B#) → which is Fm (F, A, C) enharmonically. Since E#=F, G#=G#, B#=C.

So E# minor chord is E#, G#, B# → F, A, C → F minor. Yes, exactly. So Fm is the iii chord.

Similarly, A#m is the vi chord.

D#m is ii.

G#7 is V7 (with F# as the minor seventh).

So all chords fit perfectly in C# major.

Now, checking the progression:

C# (I) repeated twice,

A#m (vi) twice,

C# (I) twice,

Fm (iii) once [but chord is Fm/C],

D#m (ii) once [D#m/C#],

C# (I) repeated twice,

A#m (vi) twice,

C# (I) twice,

G#7 (V7) [G#7/C] once,

C# (I) to end.

Yes, so the progression uses I, vi, I, iii, ii, I, vi, I, V7, I.

This is a very common chord progression in pop music, often called the "pop-punk progression" or variation of I-V-vi-IV but here it's I-vi-I-iii-ii-I-vi-I-V-I.

Wait, but the specific sequence here seems like it's grouping: I, I, vi, vi, I, I, iii, ii, I, I, vi, vi, I, I, V7, I.

So repeating sections.

Given that all chords fit C# major, and the tonic chord C# is the home base, starting and ending there, the key should be C# major.

Now, about the mode. Since it's a major key, the mode is Ionian (which is the same as major scale). Unless there's some modal mixture, but given all chords are diatonic to C# major, it's straightforward major key.

Wait, but let's double-check if it could be another mode. For example, if the progression centers on A#m, but no, it starts and ends on C# and has V7 (G#7) which strongly points to C# as tonic.

The V7-I is a strong authentic cadence, so G#7 resolving to C# confirms C# as tonic.

Therefore, the key is C# major, mode is Ionian (which is the default major mode).

Wait, but let's check the chord Fm/C. Fm is iii chord. In the progression, after two C# chords, it goes to Fm/C. So iii. Then D#m/C# which is ii. Then back to C#. So iii-ii-I, which is a common cadence.

Similarly, vi-IV-iii etc., but in this case, it's fitting C# major.

Another check: the leading tone in C# major is B#, which is C natural. The G#7 chord contains B# (as the third), which resolves to C#. But since the progression ends with G#7/C resolving to C#, yes, that's a V7-I cadence. Even though the bass is C (B#), the chord is still functioning as V7.

Therefore, all evidence points to C# major.

Just to make sure there isn't a minor key here. If it were C# minor, the chords would be different. C# harmonic minor would have E natural (instead of E#), and the V chord would be G# major (since in harmonic minor, the 5th is raised). But here, we have Fm which would be the iv chord in C# minor natural? Wait:

C# natural minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B.

So chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#°

III: E

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A

VII: B

But in our progression, we have C# major (not minor), so it's not C# natural minor.

C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#

Chords would have V as G# major (since B# is leading tone), but still the chords present don't match as well. Our progression has a major I chord, which in minor keys is not the case unless it's a Picardy third, but here the entire progression is in major.

So definitely the key is C# major.

Thus, Key: C# major, Mode: Ionian.


The chord progression you provided consists of the following chords (simplified by chord root, ignoring inversions):

**C# | C# | A#m | A#m | C# | C# | Fm | D#m | C# | C# | A#m | A#m | C# | C# | G#7 | C#**

---

### **Step 1: Identify Chord Roots**
- **C#** — I (tonic)  
- **A#m** — vi  
- **Fm** — iii (enharmonically equivalent to E#m in C# major)  
- **D#m** — ii  
- **G#7** — V7  

All these chords align perfectly with the **diatonic harmony of C# major**, as follows:

| Scale Degree | Chord Type | Notes in C# Major | Enharmonic Equivalent |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| I            | C# major   | C#, E#, G#         | —                      |
| ii           | D# minor   | D#, F#, A#         | —                      |
| iii          | E# minor   | E#, G#, B#         | Fm (F, A, C)           |
| V7           | G#7        | G#, B#, D#, F#     | —                      |
| vi           | A# minor   | A#, C#, E#         | —                      |

---

### **Step 2: Confirm Tonic and Key**
- The progression **starts and ends on C#**, reinforcing it as the tonic.
- The **G#7 chord (V7)** resolves strongly to C# (I), forming a classic **authentic cadence**, which is definitive of a major key.
- All chords are **diatonic to C# major**, with no chromatic alterations or borrowed chords.

---

### **Step 3: Determine Mode**
- Since the progression uses the **standard major scale harmonization** (I, ii, iii, V7, vi), the mode is **Ionian** (the major scale mode).
- There is no evidence of modal mixture (e.g., borrowing chords from parallel minor), as all chords are native to C# major.

---

### **Final Determination**
- **Key**: **C# major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (the natural major scale)  

This progression is harmonically grounded in **C# Ionian**, with all chords functioning as expected in a major key context, including a strong V7-I cadence confirming C# as the tonic. 🎶
