Let's analyze the given chord sequence:  

```
C#   C#   A#m/C#   A#m/C#   
C#   C#   Fm/C     D#m/C#  
C#   C#   A#m/C#   A#m/C#   
C#   C#   G#7/C    C#
```

### Step 1. Identify pitch content
We have the following chord roots:  
- **C# major**
- **A#m (A# minor)**
- **Fm (F minor)**
- **D#m (D# minor)**
- **G#7 (G# dominant seventh)**  

And most chords are **over a C# bass**.

### Step 2. Look at possible parent keys
These chords all fit neatly in **C# major** (or its relative **A# minor**):

| Degree | In C# major | Chord shown |
|:-------|:-------------|:-------------|
| I      | C# major     | C#           |
| ii     | D#m          | D#m/C#       |
| iii    | E#m (Fm enharmonic) | Fm/C     |
| vi     | A#m          | A#m/C#       |
| V7     | G#7          | G#7/C        |

### Step 3. Bass and function
The bass stays mostly on **C#**, reinforcing **C#** as the tonic center rather than A# minor (which would sound like a vi mode).  
The progression ends and often returns to C#, and G#7 (the dominant) resolves naturally to C#, sealing the sense of **C# major**.

### ✅ Conclusion:
**Key:** C♯ major  
**Mode:** Ionian (major)
