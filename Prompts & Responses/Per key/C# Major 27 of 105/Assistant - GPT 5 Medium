### Reasoning

**Interpreting chord progressions**

I'm looking at a chord progression with slash chords and trying to determine the key and mode. The repeating bass note of C# might indicate a C# pedal bass, and many chords are over that bass.

The sequence includes C#, A#m/C#, Fm/C, etc. So, starting with C#, which likely indicates a major triad. A#m/C# suggests an A# minor chord with C# in the bass, which can also be seen as a Bbm/Db in first inversion. This could orient the piece in C# major.**Analyzing chord functions**

Alright, I've got Fm/C, which indicates F minor with C in the bass. This is important because the bass note is C natural, not C#. If we're looking at Db major, we remember that its scale has C natural. Fm/C acts as the v minor chord over C, fitting in Db major.

In this key, the diatonic chords include F minor as the iii chord. The second inversion of this chord places C in the bass. So, Fm/C is indeed the second inversion of the iii chord in this context!**Interpreting more chords**

Now, I see that Fm/C correctly fits in Db major because C natural is part of that key.

Moving on to D#m/C#: this indicates D# minor over a C# bass. When I consider enhancements, D# translates to Eb, meaning itâ€™s really Ebm/Db, which is the second inversion of the ii chord. So, that checks out!

Lastly, G#7/C means G#7 over a C natural bass. Since this is enharmonically Ab7, it fits as the first inversion of the V7 chord in Db major. Nice!**Analyzing chord progression**

The progression has a mix of chords over bass notes of C# and C natural. Most slash chords sit over C#, except for Fm/C and G#7/C, which feature C natural. The D#m/C# and A#m/C# use C# bass as well. The repeating "C# C#" suggests a root position for the C# major chord. Overall, this fits within the key of Db major, where I see Db as the I chord and Bbm/Db as the vi chord in first inversion, while Ebm/Db serves as ii with Db in the bass.**Examining chord structure**

I see the Ebm chord has notes Eb, Gb, and Bb. In second inversion, Bb would be the bass tone, which leads me to consider Ebm/Db. Since Db isn't a chord tone of Ebm, it might be a polychord rather than an inversion.

For D#m/C#, this correlates with Ebm/Db. The C# acts as a pedal, while many chords toggle between C# and C. Fm/C uses C as the fifth of F minor, and G#7/C reveals the third of Ab7 in first inversion. It seems the overarching structure maintains consistency in C# major, with the bass alternating between C# and C as a tonic pedal across various chords.**Determining key and mode**

The sequence begins with the C# major chord, followed by A#m/C#, then another C#, Fm/C, D#m/C#, and ends with G#7/C. This supports the key of C# major (or enharmonically Db major) and indicates an Ionian mode, which is major.

Given the chord spellings predominantly use sharps, I would confidently choose C# major. However, it's reasonable to mention both C# major and Db major since they are enharmonically equivalent. So, I'll structure my answer like this: 

- Key: C# major (enharmonically Db major). 
- Mode: Major (Ionian). 
- Reason: The chords fit the major scale.

Key: C# major (enharmonic to Db major)
Mode: Ionian (major)

Reason: The chords outline I (C#), vi (A#m/C#), iii (Fm/C), ii (D#m/C#), and V7 (G#7/C) resolving to I, with frequent C#/C bass pedal tones.
