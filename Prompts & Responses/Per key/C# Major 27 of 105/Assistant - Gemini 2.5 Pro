### Reasoning

**Examining Chord Relationships**

I'm currently focused on the initial inventory, cataloging the distinct chords within the progression. Identifying the specific harmonic components is the primary step, allowing for a structured analysis. So far, C# and A#m/C# have been isolated; further examination is required to determine the remaining components.


**Confirming Tonic and Key**

I've confirmed the C# major tonality, as the initial tonic and frequency of the C# chord make it apparent. I've begun to cross-reference the other chords present with the key of C# major. I'm now looking at building a scale to map the corresponding diatonic chords, with emphasis on the relationship between them.


**Decoding Diatonic Functions**

I'm presently translating the chords into the Db major key to establish their function within the scale. The C# chord converts neatly to Db (I). I'm carefully evaluating the Bbm (vi), and Fm chords in relation to the Db major key, making note of their relationships to establish their specific roles in the progression.


**Synthesizing Findings and Analysis**

I've successfully translated the chord progression into Db major, confirming the key signature. All chords align perfectly, functioning diatonically, with no modulations or alterations found. The V7-I cadence is the most effective confirmation of the tonality. Further analysis will concentrate on the role of the slash chords in bass movement and the overall progression's harmonic narrative.


**Investigating Harmonic Framework**

I am now focusing on the harmonic functions of the slash chords. Examining the role of the C and C# bass notes, I'm analyzing the tension and release they create. Specifically, the relationship of each slash chord to the tonic in C# major and how the inversions add to the overall narrative.


**Concluding Analysis and Synthesis**

I'm synthesizing the entire process now. I'm articulating the progression as C# major, with its enharmonic key of Db major as a practical consideration. The chords function diatonically. Analyzing the functions of the slash chords in bass movement confirms the stability and tension-release the progression leverages, particularly the V7-I cadence. My final answer is almost ready.




Based on the analysis of the chord progression, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **C#**
*   **Mode:** **Major**

### **Analysis and Explanation**

1.  **Tonic Center (The "Home" Chord):** The progression begins and ends on **C# Major**. It also returns to C# frequently throughout the sequence. This strong presence establishes C# as the tonic, or the tonal center of the music.

2.  **Chord Functions (Roman Numeral Analysis):** When we analyze the chords in the context of the C# Major scale (C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#), they all fit perfectly.

Let's break down each chord:

*   **C#** (Notes: C#-F-G#) is the **I** chord, the tonic.
*   **A#m** (Notes: A#-C#-F) is the **vi** chord. It is the relative minor of C# Major.
*   **Fm**: This one is slightly tricky. In the key of C# Major, the third degree is E#. F is a half-step higher. However, looking at the notes (F-G#-C), it functions as the **iii** chord (E#m) with one altered note. *Alternatively, and more likely*, this progression is thought of in its simpler enharmonic key, **Db Major**.
*   **D#m** (Notes: D#-F#-A#) is the **ii** chord.
*   **G#7** (Notes: G#-C-D#-F#) is the **V7** chord, the dominant seventh. The most important function of the V7 chord is to create strong tension that resolves back to the I chord. The final `G#7/C -> C#` is a classic dominant-to-tonic cadence, which powerfully confirms C# as the key.

3.  **Analysis in the Enharmonic Key (Db Major):**
    For ease of reading (5 flats vs. 7 sharps), musicians often think of C# Major as Db Major. The analysis is identical:

    *   **Db Major Scale:** Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C
    *   **C#** becomes **Db** (the **I** chord)
    *   **A#m** becomes **Bbm** (the **vi** chord)
    *   **Fm** is the **iii** chord
    *   **D#m** becomes **Ebm** (the **ii** chord)
    *   **G#7** becomes **Ab7** (the **V7** or dominant chord)

4.  **The Role of the Slash Chords (Inversions):**
    *   **A#m/C#** and **D#m/C#**: These chords place the tonic note C# in the bass while the harmony changes above it. This is a common technique called a "tonic pedal," which reinforces the feeling of C# being the root of the key.
    *   **Fm/C** and **G#7/C**: These chords place the note **C** in the bass. In the key of C# Major, the note C is the leading tone (B#). Placing the leading tone in the bass, especially under the V7 chord, creates an even stronger pull towards the tonic (C#).

In summary, every chord has a clear diatonic function within the key of C# Major, and the progression uses the strongest harmonic devices (like the V7-I cadence and tonic pedal) to firmly establish it.
