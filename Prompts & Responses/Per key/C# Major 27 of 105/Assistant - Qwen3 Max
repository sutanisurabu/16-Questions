To determine the key and mode of the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
C# – A#m/C# – A#m/C# – C# – C# – Fm/C – D#m/C# – C# – C# – A#m/C# – A#m/C# – C# – C# – G#7/C – C#

---

### Step 1: Analyze the chords and identify possible key centers

First, notice that **C# major** appears very frequently (as a tonic chord). This suggests **C#** may be the **tonic** (home key).

Now look at the other chords:

- **A#m** (A# minor)  
- **Fm** (F minor)  
- **D#m** (D# minor)  
- **G#7** (G# dominant 7)

All of these can be analyzed relative to **C# major** or **C# minor**.

---

### Step 2: Consider C# major scale

C# major scale:  
**C# – D# – E# – F# – G# – A# – B#**

Chords diatonic to C# major:
- I: C#  
- ii: D#m  
- iii: E#m  
- IV: F#  
- V: G#  
- vi: A#m  
- vii°: B#°

So in C# major:
- **C#** = I ✔️  
- **A#m** = vi ✔️  
- **D#m** = ii ✔️  
- **G#7** = V7 ✔️

But what about **Fm** (F minor)?  
F natural is **not in C# major** (C# major has F#).  
F natural = **♭5** relative to C# → This is **outside** the key.

However, **Fm/C** appears only once. Could it be a chromatic passing chord or borrowed?

---

### Step 3: Consider C# minor

C# natural minor: C# – D# – E – F# – G# – A – B  
Harmonic minor raises B → B# (enharmonic to C)  
Melodic minor raises A and B ascending.

In C# minor:
- i: C#m → but we have **C# major**, not minor.  
So C# **major** chord is not diatonic to C# minor → suggests **not minor key**.

Thus, **C# major** is more likely.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Fm and G#7/C

- **Fm/C**: F–A♭–C, with C in bass.  
  Enharmonically, F = **E#**, A♭ = **G#**, so Fm = **E# minor**? But that’s unusual.

Better: Treat F as **♭VI** in C# major?  
In C# major, VI = A#, so ♭VI = A natural → not F.

Alternative: Think **modally** or as **borrowed chords**.

But note: **Fm** contains **A♭**, which is **G#** enharmonically, and **C** (which is B# in C# major). So:

- F = **F natural** → not in C# major  
- But **Fm/C** = C in bass, with F–A♭–C → intervals from C: F (perfect 4th), A♭ (minor 6th)

Wait—perhaps reinterpret the key enharmonically.

---

### Step 5: Enharmonic reinterpretation

C# is enharmonic to **D♭**. Sometimes analyzing in **D♭ major** is easier.

D♭ major scale: D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭ – C

Chords in D♭:
- I: D♭  
- ii: E♭m  
- iii: Fm  
- IV: G♭  
- V: A♭  
- vi: B♭m  
- vii°: C°

Now, map your chords:

- C# = D♭ → I ✔️  
- A#m = B♭m → vi ✔️  
- D#m = E♭m → ii ✔️  
- G#7 = A♭7 → V7 ✔️  
- **Fm** = iii ✔️

**Aha!** All chords now make sense in **D♭ major**:

- D♭ (I)  
- B♭m (vi)  
- Fm (iii)  
- E♭m (ii)  
- A♭7 (V7)

And the bass notes:
- A#m/C# → B♭m/D♭ → first inversion of vi  
- Fm/C → Fm over C = C is **7th scale degree (C)** in D♭ → this is **iii/7** or just a slash chord with leading tone in bass  
- D#m/C# → E♭m/D♭ → ii/I  
- G#7/C → A♭7/C → V7 with third (C) in bass → common voicing

So all chords are **diatonic to D♭ major**, which is enharmonic to **C# major**.

---

### Step 6: Final determination

- **Key**: C# major (or D♭ major — same pitch class, but C# is used in notation)  
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (i.e., major)

Despite the use of slash chords and one seemingly odd Fm, **Fm is the iii chord in C# major** if we treat F as **E#**? Wait—no: in C# major, the iii chord is **E#m**, not Fm.

But **E# = F**, and **E#m = E#–G#–B#**, whereas **Fm = F–A♭–C**.

Are these enharmonically the same?

- E# = F  
- G# = A♭  
- B# = C

So **E#m = F–A♭–C** = **Fm**

✅ Yes! **E# minor is enharmonically F minor**.

Therefore, **Fm = iii chord in C# major**, just spelled enharmonically for ease.

Similarly:
- A#m = A#–C#–E# = vi chord  
- D#m = D#–F#–A# = ii chord  
- G#7 = G#–B#–D#–F# = V7 chord

All fit **C# major**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

- **Key**: **C# major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian (Major)**

The progression is firmly in **C# major**, using diatonic chords (I–vi–iii–ii–V7), with inversions (slash chords) for voice leading.
