### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Overall Key: **C# Major**
- This progression strongly centers on **C# major** as the tonal center. The repeated C# major chords act as a tonic pedal (all chords share a C# bass note, creating a "pedal point" effect that reinforces C# as home base).
- The harmony resolves repeatedly to C#, and there's no strong pull toward another root. The presence of G#7/C# at the end functions as a V7 chord (dominant) leading back to the tonic C#, which is a classic cadence in major keys.

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major)**
- The mode is **major (Ionian)**, based on the diatonic framework of the C# major scale: **C# D# E# F# G# A# B#**.
  - Most chords fit diatonically:
    - **C# major**: I (tonic).
    - **A#m**: vi (submediant, common in major keys for color).
    - **D#m**: ii (supertonic).
    - **G#7**: V7 (dominant seventh, resolving to I).
  - The progression has a bright, resolved feel typical of major mode, without the darker or more ambiguous tensions of minor modes (e.g., no prominent b3, b6, or b7 scale degrees driving the harmony downward).
- **Fm** is the outlierâ€”it's not fully diatonic to C# major (F major would be IV, but Fm lowers the root to F natural). This is likely a **borrowed chord** (modal mixture) from the parallel minor (C# minor) or C# Mixolydian, adding brief tension or color. It doesn't shift the overall mode or key, as the progression quickly returns to major harmony.

#### Functional Breakdown
Here's the progression with Roman numeral analysis (in C# major, ignoring the /C# bass for function but noting its stabilizing pedal effect):

- C# C# | A#m/C# A#m/C# | C# C# | Fm/C D#m/C# | C# C# | A#m/C# A#m/C# | C# C# | G#7/C C#
  - I I | vi/vi vi/vi | I I | (borrowed iv?)/I ii/I | I I | vi/vi vi/vi | I I | V7/I I

This creates a looping, vamp-like structure (common in pop/rock/jazz), building tension with vi and V7 before resolving to I. The constant C# bass keeps it grounded in major tonality.

If this is from a specific song or genre, more context could refine this (e.g., melody notes might confirm), but based on harmony alone, C# major/Ionian fits best. If you have the melody or more details, I can reassess!
