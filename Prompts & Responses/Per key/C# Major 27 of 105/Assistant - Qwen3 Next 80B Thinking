### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me figure this out step by step.

First, I need to look at the chords and see if there's a pattern or a tonic chord that feels like the home base. The progression starts and ends with C#, so maybe the key center is C#. But I should check the chords in detail.

Let me list out all the chords mentioned: C#, C#, A#m/C#, A#m/C#, C#, C#, Fm/C, D#m/C#, C#, C#, A#m/C#, A#m/C#, C#, C#, G#7/C, C#.

Wait, the notation includes slash chords. For example, A#m/C# means an A# minor chord with C# in the bass. Similarly, Fm/C is F minor with C in the bass? Wait, but the bass note is specified after the slash. Let's parse each chord:

- C#: This is a C# major chord? Or is it just C# as in root note? But in chord notation, usually "C#" alone means C# major, unless specified otherwise. But sometimes people might just write the root note, but in context, it's probably chords.

Wait, let's see: A#m/C# - that's A# minor triad with C# as the bass note. Since A# minor is A# C# E#, so putting C# in bass makes it a first inversion chord.

Similarly, Fm/C: F minor with C in bass. But F minor is F Ab C, so with C in bass, it's a third inversion?

D#m/C#: D# minor is D# F# A#, so with C# in bass? Wait, D#m/C# would be D# minor triad over C# bass. But D#m triad is D# F# A#, so the notes are D#, F#, A#, and adding C# would make it D#m7 or something? Wait, no. Slash chord notation: the note after the slash is the bass note. So D#m/C# means a D# minor chord with C# in the bass. So the chord is D# F# A# with C# as the lowest note. So the actual notes would be C#, D#, F#, A#? Because bass is C# followed by D#, F#, A#.

Wait, but in the progression, there's also Fm/C. F minor chord is F Ab C, so with C in bass, so the notes are C, F, Ab. But wait, if the bass is C, then Fm/C would be F minor in first inversion? Wait, no: Fm/C means the chord is F minor, but the bass note is C. So the chord includes F, Ab, C, but the lowest note is C. So it's Fm in second inversion (since the fifth is in the bass). Because Fm's notes are F Ab C, so C is the fifth. So yes, second inversion of Fm.

But back to the key. Let's see the chords:

All the chords when written out: let's list all the unique chord types and root notes.

First, looking at the progression:

- C# (major chord? or just root? Probably C# major chord)

But in the progression: "C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#"

So each chord is listed as:

C# (probably C# major)

Another C#

A#m/C# (A# minor with C# bass)

A#m/C#

C#

C#

Fm/C (F minor with C bass)

D#m/C# (D# minor with C# bass)

C#

C#

A#m/C#

A#m/C#

C#

C#

G#7/C (G#7 with C bass)

C#

Wait, but the bass notes here might be important for determining the key. Let's check the bass line. Because slash chords indicate a specific bass note. So perhaps the bass notes are key to determining the key.

Let's list the bass notes for each chord:

- C# (since it's "C#" alone, then bass note is C#)

Another C# (bass C#)

A#m/C# → bass C#

A#m/C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

Fm/C → bass C

D#m/C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

A#m/C# → bass C#

A#m/C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

G#7/C → bass C

C# → bass C#

Wait a second, so let's see the bass note sequence:

C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#

Wait, but maybe not. Let's parse it step by step.

The entire progression written out:

C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#

So each token separated by space is a chord. So:

1. C# → bass note C#

2. C# → bass C#

3. A#m/C# → bass C#

4. A#m/C# → bass C#

5. C# → bass C#

6. C# → bass C#

7. Fm/C → bass C (since the slash says C)

8. D#m/C# → bass C#

9. C# → bass C#

10. C# → bass C#

11. A#m/C# → bass C#

12. A#m/C# → bass C#

13. C# → bass C#

14. C# → bass C#

15. G#7/C → bass C (since slash says C)

16. C# → bass C#

So the bass notes for each chord are:

C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#

Hmm. So the bass line has mostly C#s, but some Cs (specifically chords 7, 15 are C bass, and chord 7 is Fm/C which bass is C, chord 15 is G#7/C which is C bass). Wait, but chord 7: Fm/C means chord is F minor, bass C. Chord 15: G#7/C means G#7 chord with C bass.

But considering the bass notes: most are C#, but a few Cs. Also, the chord Fm/C and G#7/C both have C in the bass.

Wait, but Fm/C is a F minor triad with C in the bass. That chord's notes are F, Ab, C, with C as the lowest note. So the chord includes F, Ab, C. Similarly, G#7/C: G#7 chord is G# B# D# F# (but wait, standard G#7 would be G# B# D# F#? Wait, no: G# is G# B# D# F#? Let's see, major 7th chord would be G# B# D# F#? But G#7 is a dominant 7th chord. So G# root, major third (B#), perfect fifth (D#), minor seventh (F#). But B# is enharmonically C, F# is F#.

But G#7/C would be the chord G#7 with C in the bass. So notes would be C, G#, B#, D#, F#. But that seems a bit dissonant. Alternatively, maybe the slash is indicating the bass note, so regardless of the chord type, the bass note is specified.

But perhaps focusing on the actual chords without considering the slash part yet. Let's see:

In the chord progression, the main chords are C# major, A#m (with various bass notes), Fm, D#m, G#7.

Wait, but the slash chords might affect the harmonic function. Let's consider the actual harmony.

Looking at the chord symbols: the key is determined by the chord root and the tonal center. Let's list all the unique chord symbols as written:

- C# (which is likely C# major)

- A#m (since A#m/C# is A# minor over C# bass, so the chord is A#m)

- Fm

- D#m

- G#7

So the actual chords (ignoring bass for a moment) would be: C#, A#m, Fm, D#m, G#7.

But perhaps the key can be determined by the root notes of the chords.

Wait, but chord roots:

C# (root C#)

A#m (root A#)

Fm (root F)

D#m (root D#)

G#7 (root G#)

So the root notes present are C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

But A# is same as B flat (Bb), but let's stay in sharps. A# minor. Wait, A# minor is a valid chord, but it's the same as Bb minor, but in key of C# might be relevant.

Wait, let's look at the key of C#. If the key is C# major, what chords belong to that key?

C# major scale: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B# (C# D# E# F# G# A# B#). Wait, but in reality, the enharmonic equivalent might be Db major. But let's use sharps.

C# major key has chords:

I: C# major

II: D# minor

III: E# major (which is F major, but in key of C# it's written as E# major)

IV: F# major

V: G# major

VI: A# minor

VII: B# diminished

So the diatonic chords for C# major would be:

I: C# Maj

II: D# min

III: E# Maj (F Major)

IV: F# Maj

V: G# Maj

VI: A# min

VII: B# dim

So in the given chord progression, we have:

C# Maj (I)

A#m (VI)

D#m (II)

Fm? Wait, F minor. But in C# major, the IV chord is F# major, not F minor. F minor is not in the key of C# major. Hmm. So that might be a clue that this isn't in C# major.

Wait, but Fm is F minor. But in C# major scale, the fourth note is F#, so chord IV is F# major. But here's an F minor chord. So that's not diatonic to C# major.

Similarly, G#7 is G# dominant seventh. In C# major, V chord is G# major. So G#7 would be a V7 chord, which is common.

Wait, if the key is C# major, then V7 is G#7 (G# B# D# F#), yes. And VI is A# minor. II is D# minor. But where does Fm come from? F minor is not diatonic here.

Hmm. So maybe Fm is a borrowed chord? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is A minor? But the bass notes seem to be centered on C#. Let's consider other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: the bass note seems to be mostly C#, with some Cs. But in the chord progression, the slash chords often have C# in bass. Let's see:

The chords:

- C# (so likely a major chord based on C#)

- A#m/C# means: even though the chord is A#m, the bass note is C#. So the notes of A#m chord are A# C# E#, but with C# in the bass, so C# as lowest note, then A# and E#. So the actual harmony when played would be C# (bass), then A#, E# (which is F). So the chord would be C# A# E#. Which notes are those: C# (root), A# (minor sixth), E# (major third? Wait A# is the major sixth of C#? Let's see.

Wait, C# root, A# would be the minor sixth (since A# to C# is a minor third). Wait, scale degrees: C# major scale intervals.

C# root: 1

D# 2

E# 3

F# 4

G# 5

A# 6

B# 7

So A# is the 6th degree, so a minor sixth above C# is A natural? Wait, no. Wait, in C# major, 6th is A#. So A# is the major sixth. So a minor sixth would be A natural. But in this chord: C# in bass, then A# note. So the chord notes are C#, A#, E#. So C# (root), A# (6th), E# (3rd). So that's a C# major chord in first inversion? Wait, E# is the third. Wait, but in A#m/C# chord, the chord is A# minor triad (A#, C#, E#), with C# in bass. So the notes are C# (bass), then A#, E#. So the notes present are C#, A#, E#. Which is a C# major chord with the third in the bass? Wait, no: C# major chord is C# E# G#. But here the notes are C# (bass), A#, E#. So that's C#, A#, E#. If we look at it as a chord, the root could be... Let's see: intervals between C# and A# is a minor sixth (C# to A# is 9 semitones, which is minor sixth interval), and A# to E# is a major third (A# to E# is 7 semitones: A#, B#, C#, D#, E#... wait, A# to B#=1, B# to C#=2, C# to D#=3, D# to E#=4? Wait, no. A# to B is the same as Bb, but in this context, A# to E# is E# is F natural? No, E# is the same as F. Wait, but in enharmonic terms: E# is F. But A# to C# is minor third, C# to E# is major third. Hmm, perhaps another way: A#m/C# is a chord with notes C# (bass), A#, E#.

So the chord includes A#, C#, E#. So A# minor triad: A#, C#, E# (yes), but with bass on C#. So as a chord, it's spelled C# A# E#, which would be C# minor? No, because A# is flat? Wait, no. A# is the root. Wait, confusion here.

A# minor triad: A# as root, minor third is C# (since A# to C# is 3 semitones: A# to B=1, B to C=2, C to C#=3), so yes, C# is the minor third. Then fifth is E# (C# to E# is 4 semitones: C# to D#=1, D# to E#=2? Wait, A# to E# is a perfect fifth: A# to B#=1, B# to C#=2, C# to D#=3, D# to E#=4 semitones? Maybe better to count steps.

From A# up to E#: A# to B is 1 semitone, but in the context of A#m chord: the notes are A# (root), C# (minor third), E# (perfect fifth). Because A# to C# is minor third (3 semitones: A# to B=1, B to C=2, C to C#=3), and C# to E# is major third (but A# to E# is perfect fifth: A# (root), B# (M2), C# (m3), D# (P4), E# (P5)). Yes. So A#m is A#, C#, E#. So the chord A#m/C# has bass C#, so the notes are C#, A#, E#. So the chord is C# (bass), A#, E#. When you stack these from the bass note: C# is the root, then A# and E#. So above C#, E# is a major third (C# to E# is 4 semitones), and A# is a minor sixth (C# to A# is 9 semitones, which is a minor sixth). Alternatively, in terms of chord structure, with C# as root, the notes present are C#, E#, A#. That would be a C# major chord with an added sixth? Because C# major chord is C#, E#, G#. So in this case, replacing G# with A#? So C#maj6? Wait, yes. Because maj6 is root, 3, 5, 6. So C#maj6 would be C# E# G# A#. But here we have C#, E#, A#. No G#. So wait, it's missing the G#. So perhaps it's not a standard chord. Alternatively, with bass C#, the chord is C# root, then A# and E#. So interval between C# and A# is minor 6th, C# to E# is major third. So the chord would be C#maj7? No, because maj7 adds B# (C# to B# is major seventh), which is same as C natural. Hmm. This might be getting complicated.

Maybe better to consider the actual chord function in context.

Alternatively, let's ignore the slash chords for a moment and look at the main chord roots. But with the slashes, the bass notes may be emphasizing certain notes.

Another approach: the progression mostly has C# in bass, but there's a G#7/C and Fm/C, which suggest that when there's C in bass, the chords are Fm and G#7. Let's see: Fm/C is F minor chord with C bass, which is Fm in second inversion (C is the fifth of Fm). Similarly, G#7/C: the chord G#7 has notes G# B# D# F#, so with C in the bass, the chord would include C, G#, B#, D#, F#. That's sort of a complex chord. But perhaps this is a case of modulation or borrowing.

Wait, but the Fm/C chord. F minor with C in bass. So the bass note is C. So the chord includes C, F, Ab (since F minor is F Ab C). So chord notes: C, F, Ab. Now, what key could that fit into? Let's see.

If we consider the key of C minor. But the main chords have C# throughout. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think of the C in the bass (from Fm/C and G#7/C) as part of the chord progression. When the bass is C, then the chords are F minor and G#7. Wait, G#7 is B# D# F#. But with C bass, it's C, G#, B#, D#, F#. That seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the slash chords are indicating a different harmony.

Wait another thought: sometimes slash chords indicate an inverted chord or a chord with a specific bass note. So for example, A#m/C# is likely just a way to denote that the chord is A# minor but with C# in the bass. Similarly, Fm/C is F minor with C in bass. But perhaps looking at the key of the melody or the root of the progression. But the user didn't provide melody, just the chords.

Let's think of the chords as written. The chord progression has many C# chords, and some A#m, D#m, Fm, G#7.

Let's list all chords:

- C# major (assuming "C#" is C# major)

- A#m/C# (which is A# minor triad with C# bass)

- Fm/C (F minor triad with C bass)

- D#m/C# (D# minor with C# bass)

- G#7/C (G#7 with C bass)

So maybe the actual chord roots are:

C#, A#, F, D#, G#

But with bass notes specified.

But in terms of key, let's look at the tonic. If there's a consistent root note that the progression resolves to, which seems to be C#, since the progression starts and ends on C#.

But the issue is the Fm chord. F minor is not in C# major. Let's see: what's the distance between C# and F? C# to F is a diminished fourth (or augmented third). Wait, in terms of semitones: C# to C is 1, C to Db is 2, but wait C# to D=2 semitones, D to D#=3, D# to E=4, E to F=5. So C# to F is 6 semitones (since C# to D=2, D to D#=1? Wait no: from C# to C is 1, C to Db is 2? No. Better to count directly:

C# → D: 2 semitones

C# to D#: 3

C# to E: 4

C# to F: 5 semitones?

Wait, semitones between notes:

C# to D: 1 semitone

D to D#: 2

No, better to count from root:

C# (0), C## (enharmonic to D), but let's count properly:

C# (0)

D (1 semitone above C#)

D# (2)

E (3)

F (4)

So C# to F is 4 semitones? Wait, from C# to D is 1 (C#-D), D to D# is +1, but C# to D# is 2 semitones.

Wait, starting at C#:

- C# (0)

- D (1)

- D# (2)

- E (3)

- F (4)

- F# (5)

- G (6)

etc. So yes, from C# to F is 4 semitones. So major third interval? No, a major third is 4 semitones. C# to E# (F) is major third. So F is enharmonic to E#, yes. Because E# is F.

Wait, this is important. In music theory, the note F is also called E#. In the key of C# major, the fourth scale degree is F#. But wait, if we think of F as E#, then in C# major scale:

C# D# E# F# G# A# B# C#

So the third note is E# which is equivalent to F natural. So the E#/F note is the third degree.

But in C# major scale, chord IV is F# major (F# A# C#). So F natural (or E#) would be the third of the scale, not part of the IV chord.

So back to Fm chord. F minor is F Ab C. If we're in the key of C# major, then F natural is the E# in the scale, which is a note used in the chord (for example, E# is third degree). But F minor chord would be F Ab C. Now, F in context of C# major is E#, so Ab would be G## (double sharp?), which is very enharmonic. This seems messy. Maybe using flats instead.

Alternatively, perhaps the song is in A minor. Let's check. But the bass notes are mostly C#.

Wait, another angle: the slash chords with C# in bass. If the chord root is A#m/C#, that means A#m but bass C#. So as mentioned before, A# minor chord, notes A#, C#, E#. With C# bass, it's C#, A#, E#. If we consider the key of A# minor, but that's the same as Bb minor. Not sure.

Wait, maybe looking at the chords without slash: the progression has A#m, D#m, G#7. Let's see: G#7 would be dominant chord, perhaps leading to C#. So V7 to I. So G#7 to C# major. That suggests that the key might be C# major.

But where does Fm fit in? F minor. In C# major scale, what's F note? It's the 4th degree but F natural is enharmonic to E#. The 4th scale degree is F#.

So Fm chord has F, Ab, C. In C# major, F# is the fourth, F natural is a half step lower. So F minor would be a chromatic chord.

But maybe it's a borrowed chord from another mode. Alternatively, the key might be something else.

Another thought: if the chord Fm/C is present (F minor with C bass), then the notes C, F, Ab. So Ab is the flat 6th? If in context of C major or C minor.

Wait, if we think of the key as C minor. C minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So in C minor, the chords would be:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

bIII: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

bVI: Ab

bVII: Bb

So chords in C minor include Cm, Fm, Ab, etc. But here we have Fm/C which would fit into C minor. But the progression has a lot of C#s, which is a different note from C. So C# vs C are different.

Wait, maybe the song is in a key where C#/Db is tonic. But Fm is not in that key.

Alternative idea: perhaps the key is E minor. Let's see.

E minor natural: E F# G A B C D.

Chords: Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D.

No Fm there. Not matching.

Wait, but we have Fm chord. In what keys is F minor a diatonic chord? Like F major scale: F major has F, Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, Edim. No. In C minor, as above. In Ab minor: Ab Bbb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the Fm/C is actually part of a different chord. For example, "Fm/C" could mean an F minor chord with C bass, which is Fm in second inversion. But in a key where C is the fifth degree? Like F major. In F major, the chords include F, Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, Edim. So C is the V chord (C major), but Fm isn't in F major.

Hmm.

Another approach: look at the bass movement. The bass notes mostly stay on C#, but occasionally C. So if the tonic note is C#, but there's a C natural used, which is a half step below. That might suggest a modal mixture, or perhaps the key is actually C# minor.

Let's check C# minor harmonic or natural.

C# natural minor scale: C# D# E F# G# A B.

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

bIII: E

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A

VII: B

But in this case, we have chord A#m. In C# minor scale, VI is A major. But A# minor would be a different chord. Hmm.

Wait, but in C# minor, the sixth degree is A, so chord VI is A major. But the chord A# minor would be outside the scale.

Alternatively, C# melodic minor? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the song is in E major? Let's see: E major has chords E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim. Not matching.

Alternatively, the key could be C# major but with some chromatic chords.

But let's think of the chords. The presence of G#7 suggests it's a dominant chord that resolves to C#. So C# major is likely the tonic.

Then why is there an Fm chord? In C# major, F is enharmonic to E# (the third scale degree), but F natural would be a chromatic note. So Fm chord (F Ab C) would have notes that include Ab, which is G# in C# major. So Ab is G# enharmonic. But in C# major scale, the notes are C# D# E# F# G# A# B#. So G# is the fifth degree. An Ab is equivalent to G#, but written differently. Wait, Ab is same as G#. So Fm chord: F Ab C. But if Ab is G#, then F G# C. Hmm, that might not correspond directly.

Alternatively, F minor chord as F Ab C is the same as E# G# C, but that seems odd.

Wait, maybe the Fm/C chord is actually a different chord. Let's see. If you write Fm/C, that's F minor with bass C. So the notes C, F, Ab. In terms of key of C# major, C natural. But C# is the tonic. So C natural is the minor seventh. So in C# major scale, the minor seventh would be B#. Wait, C# to B# is major seventh. Wait, B natural is minor seventh of C#.

In C# major scale:

C# D# E# F# G# A# B#.

So the seventh degree is B#. So a B natural would be a flattened seventh (Bbb? No, B natural is enharmonic to Cb, but in key of C# major, leading tone is B#. So a B natural would be a chromatic note.

So in C# major scale, the notes are all sharps. A natural note would be outside the key.

So Fm/C chord: notes C (natural), F (natural), Ab (natural). So this is a major triad on C? No, Fm is F minor. So F Ab C.

So these notes: C, F, Ab. How do they fit into a key with C#?

Hmm. Not obviously. Maybe the key is A minor natural. In A minor, chords are Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G.

But then the chord progression has a lot of C#s. In A minor, C# is not in the scale. A natural minor has A B C D E F G. No C#.

So that doesn't work.

Another idea: maybe the chord progression uses C# as tonic, and some chords are borrowed from parallel minor? But C# major vs C# minor.

C# major has C# D# E# F# G# A# B#.

C# minor has C# D# E F# G# A B.

So F# major in major, but in minor it's still F#? No, C# minor: fourth degree is F#, yes.

But the chord Fm... F minor. In C# minor, the fourth chord is F#m. So not Fm.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the slash notation. Maybe some of these slash chords are not indicating bass notes for the chord but rather different interpretations. For example, sometimes "A#m/C#" might be used to mean that the chord is C# with A#m, but that's not standard. Normally, slash chord means chord on left, bass on right.

So A#m/C# = A# minor chord, bass note C#.

But another possibility: maybe the chord "C#" is a power chord, which is just root and fifth, but usually denoted as C#5. But in common practice, single note for chords implies major.

Alternatively, perhaps the whole progression is in the key of C# minor. Let's see what chords would be diatonic there.

C# natural minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

bIII: E major

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A major

VII: B major

But in the chord progression, we have C#, A#m, Fm, etc. A# minor isn't present here. So no.

C# harmonic minor: C# D# E F# G# A B#

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

bIII+: E aug

iv: F#m

V: G# major (or G7)

VI: A major?

Wait, harmonic minor raises the seventh, so B# here. So chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III+: E augmented

iv: F#m

V: G#(7) major with B# note

bVI: A major

VII: B# dim

Not sure if that helps. Fm chord still doesn't fit.

Wait, the chord Fm in this scenario: F natural. In C# harmonic minor, is F natural present? C# harmonic minor scale: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#, C#.

So F# is present, not F natural. So F natural isn't in scale. So Fm chord would be borrowed.

Hmm.

Let's consider another angle. Let's list all the notes across all chords.

Take each chord in progression and list all notes:

1. C# major (C#, E#, G#)

2. C# major

3. A#m/C#: A#m triad with bass C#, so notes C#, A#, E# (which is F)

4. A#m/C#: same as above

5. C# major

6. C# major

7. Fm/C: F minor triad with C bass. Notes: C, F, Ab

8. D#m/C#: D#m triad with bass C#. Notes: C#, D#, F#

9. C# major

10. C# major

11. A#m/C#

12. A#m/C#

13. C# major

14. C# major

15. G#7/C: G#7 chord with C bass. G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#. With C bass, notes: C, G#, B#, D#, F#

16. C# major

Now, let's collect all the notes present:

- C, F, Ab (from chord 7)

- C#, E#, G# (from C# major)

- A#, E# (from A#m/C#)

- D#, F# (from D#m/C#)

- B#, D#, F# (from G#7/C)

Wait, this is getting complex. Let's list all unique notes.

From chord 7: C, F, Ab

Chord 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,16: C#, E#, G#

Chord 3,4,11,12: A#, C#, E#

Chord 8: C#, D#, F#

Chord 15: C, G#, B#, D#, F#

So all notes:

C, C#, Db (but usually written as C#), D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, B#

Wait, Ab is the same as G#.

Let's see:

Ab = G# (enharmonically)

So chord 7 has Ab which is G#.

So chord 7: C, F, G# (since Ab = G#)

Chord 15 has notes C, G#, B#, D#, F#

But B# is C natural. So B# = C.

Wait a second. So in chord 15: G#7 with C bass. G#7 is G# B# D# F#. B# is enharmonic to C, so G#7 chord could also be spelled G# C D# F#.

Similarly, chord 7: Fm/C has Ab which is G#, but also F and C.

So considering enharmonic equivalents:

- Ab = G#

- B# = C

- E# = F

So let's rewrite the chords in practical terms:

Chord 3: A#m/C# → A# minor is Bb minor. And E# is F. So A#m/C# → Bb minor with C# bass, notes C#, Bb, F.

Chord 7: Fm/C → F minor with C bass → C F Ab

But Ab is G#, so C F G#

Chord 8: D#m/C# → D# minor, which is Eb minor. Bass C# → notes C#, D# (Eb), F#.

Chord 15: G#7/C → G#7 with C bass. G# B# D# F# → C (from B#), G#, D#, F#. So notes C, G#, D#, F#.

Now all chords expressed in practical tones:

Chord 1: C# major: C#, E#, G# → C#, F, G# (since E# = F)

Ah! Here's a key point. E# in music is enharmonically equivalent to F. So when you see E#, it's the same note as F. Similarly, B# is C.

So if we rewrite all chords using flats or natural sharps where possible:

- C# major = C# E# G# → but E# = F, so this chord is spelled C# F G#. Which is an F major chord with C# in bass? Wait no: C# major chord consists of C#, E#, G#. But E# is the same pitch as F natural. So physically, the notes are C#, F, and G#.

Similarly, G# major chord: G#, B#, D# → G#, C, D#.

Because B# is C natural.

So let's re-interpret the chords by substituting E# with F, B# with C, etc.

So chord progression:

C# (major) → C#, F, G#

C# → same

A#m/C# → A#m is Bbm, which is Bb, Db, F. With C# bass. So bass C#, then Bb, Db, F? Wait, A# minor triad: A#, C#, E#. E# = F. So A# C# F. But with bass C#, so C#, A#, F. Which is same as C#, Bb (since A# is Bb), F. So C# Bb F.

But Bb and C# are different notes. Bb is A# enharmonic. So the chord is C# Bb F.

Similarly, Fm/C is Fm with C bass. F Ab C. But F Ab C → notes F, Ab, C. Which is equivalent to F, G#, C.

D#m/C#: D#m is Ebm, which is Eb, Gb, Bb. With bass C#. So C#, Eb, Gb (F#), Bb. Wait, D#m triad: D#, F#, A#. So D# F# A#. With bass C#. So C#, D# (Eb), F#, A# (Bb).

So notes: C#, Eb, F#, Bb.

G#7/C: G#7 with bass C. G# B# D# F# = G#, C, D#, F#. So bass C, then G#, D#, F#.

So now all the chords in natural or flat terms (to simplify):

Let's list every chord's notes in standard notation:

1. C# major: C#, F (E#), G# → so pitch classes: C#, F, G#.

But wait, C# to F is an augmented fourth, which is also a tritone. But maybe not useful.

Alternative: Let's consider a key of Db major. Because C# is enharmonic with Db. So if the key is Db major, then chords would be Dbs (Db, Ebb, Fb...), but this seems messy.

But perhaps this is the key. Let's see:

Db major: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C

Chords in Db major:

I: Db

II: Ebm

III: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

VI: Bbm

VII: Cdim

But the progression seems to have many chords that could fit. For example:

If key of Db major:

- C# major would be B# major? No. Wait, this might not help.

Alternative idea: given the many C# and G# chords, maybe the tonic is G#. Let's check G# major.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F# (but note B#=C, E#=F).

Chords would be:

I: G#

II: A#m

III: B# (C)

IV: C#m

V: D#m

VI: E# (F) → E# would be F? No, G# major third is B#, which is C natural.

Wait, this is getting too messy. Perhaps better to use practical notes.

Another angle: if we consider the bass note sequence.

Bass notes:

C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#

So bass line moves from mostly C# to C, then back to C#. This could suggest a move from C# to C, but that's a semitone apart. Which might indicate modulation or use of a chromatic chord.

But maybe the chord Fm/C and G#7/C use C as bass note for a subdominant or something. For example, in C major key: Fm is iv chord, but here it's Fm/C which would be ii chord if in Db major or something. Not sure.

Wait, the chord G#7/C. If the bass is C, and the chord is G#7, then in terms of root, it's a G#7 chord with bass C, which is called G#7/C. But the G#7 chord includes B# which is C. So the note C is part of the chord anyway. So G#7/C is basically a G#7 chord where C is the third (B#=C). Wait, G#7 is G# B# D# F#. B# is C, so G# C D# F#. So if C is the bass note, then the chord is C, G#, D#, F#, which is a Cmaj7#5? Or it could be interpreted as G#7 in third inversion? Because G#7's notes are G#, B#, D#, F#. If you put C (B#) in bass, then the bass note is B#, the root of G#7 is G#. So the inversion would be second inversion? Wait, no. Inversions:

Root position: G# (root), B# (3rd), D# (5th), F# (7th)

First inversion: B# G# D# F#

Second inversion: D# B# G# F#

Third inversion: F# D# B# G#

But here, chord is G#7/C, so bass C (B#). So the bass note is B# (C), so it would be first inversion of G#7.

But regardless, in the key of C# major, G#7 is the V7 chord, so dominant of tonic. But when used as G#7/C, it's like a V7 in third inversion or something.

But still, the Fm chord is problematic.

Wait, another thought: maybe the Fm/C is actually a Neapolitan chord. In C# major, the Neapolitan chord is a Db major chord in first inversion, but that might be similar. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is A minor. Let's see. A minor has notes A B C D E F G.

But our chords include C#, which is not in A minor. So unlikely.

Wait, the chord progression has C# and A#m, which if A# is Bb minor chord. Let's consider key of G major. G major has Bb? No: G major scale G A B C D E F#. So Bb isn't present.

Alternatively, Bb major. Bb major: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab.

Chords: Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F, Gm, Adim.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps key of C minor. C minor has C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords: Cm, Dim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb.

So Fm chord is iv in C minor.

But the progression has a lot of C#s. In C minor, C# would be the seventh degree (which is B natural), but C# isn't in the scale. So maybe not.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the song is using a mode of C# minor or something.

Another idea: when the bass note is C# throughout, and the chord Fm/C has bass C, which is a chromatic note. Maybe the tonic is C#, and the Fm is a borrowed chord from another mode.

Let's consider the key of C# harmonic major or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the chords are written with slash chords indicating actual chord roots. For example, "A#m/C#" might be intended as C# with A#m, but that's not standard. Usually slash chords are chord followed by bass.

Wait, perhaps the slash doesn't mean bass note, but something else. Unlikely. Standard notation is chord/slash.

Let's try to see if all these chords function in a particular key.

Looking at G#7 followed by C#. That's V7 to I, very common. So if G#7 to C#, then key is C# major.

In that case, the dominant chord is G#7, tonic C# major.

The Fm chord: in C# major, what is Fm? F natural. In C# scale, F is the fourth degree if we think of it as E#.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the chord notation. If G#7/C is actually an E major chord, since G#7 in some contexts could be related. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's ignore the slash for a moment and consider all chords as written:

- C# (I)

- A#m (VI)

- Fm (but not in key)

- D#m (II)

- G#7 (V7)

So if we take V7 → I (G#7 → C#), that suggests C# major is tonic.

But where does Fm come in? Let's say in C# major, but Fm is not diatonic. Maybe it's borrowed from C# Phrygian mode. The natural minor is Aeolian. Phrygian mode: C# D E F# G# A# B# → no. Phrygian would be starting on C# with intervals different.

C# Phrygian would be C# D E F# G# A# B# → no, that's the same as C# major. No, modes of major scale:

For C# major scale, the modes are:

Ionian: C# major

Dorian: D# Dorian

Phrygian: E# Phrygian (F natural)

Mixolydian: F# Mixolydian

Aeolian: G# Aeolian

Locrian: A# Locrian

Wait, no. Let's list properly.

The major scale's modes:

1. Ionian

2. Dorian

3. Phrygian

4. Lydian

5. Mixolydian

6. Aeolian

7. Locrian

So for C# major scale (tonic C#), the modes:

- C# Ionian (same as C# major)

- D# Dorian (D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, C#)

- E# Phrygian (E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, C#, D#)

- F# Lydian (F#, G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#)

- G# Mixolydian (G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#)

- A# Aeolian (A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#)

- B# Locrian (B#, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#)

So in A# Aeolian mode (which is the 6th mode of C# major), the scale is A# B# C# D# E# F# G#.

Chords in A# Aeolian:

i: A#m

ii°: B#dim

bIII: C#maj

iv: D#m

v: E#m (Fm)

VI: F#maj

VII: G#

Ah! Interesting. So in the A# Aeolian scale (which is the sixth mode of C# major), the chords include A# minor (i), D# minor (iv), and E# minor which is F minor because E# is enharmonic with F.

So E# minor = F minor. And VI chord would be F# major.

In this context, if the key is C# major, but the progression is using A# Aeolian as the key center.

But usually, the key is defined by the tonic note. If the progression centers on A# minor, then it's in A# Aeolian mode, which is the natural minor mode of C# major. But typically, we'd say it's in C# minor. Wait, no: C# natural minor scale is C# D# E F# G# A B.

Wait, the relationship between modes: the sixth mode of C# major is A# Aeolian. But the diatonic scale for A# Aeolian is A# B# C# D# E# F# G#.

Which is equivalent to Bb minor scale. Because A# is Bb, B# is C, etc.

A# Aeolian scale: A# B# C# D# E# F# G# → which is equivalent to Bb minor scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab.

Yes! Because A#=Bb, B#=C, C#=Db, D#=Eb, E#=F, F#=Gb, G#=Ab.

So this might be the case. So if the song is in Bb minor (which is A# minor), then the key signature would be Bb minor.

But then the tonic chord is Bbm. However, the bass note of the progression is mostly C# which would be Db in this key.

Wait, in Bb minor scale:

Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

bIII: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

Wait, but if we look at this: chords including Fm (v chord), which matches the Fm present in progression.

But the chord names in this context:

- A#m/C# would be Bbm/D? Wait, no. If A# minor is the tonic of the mode, but C# in the bass...

This is getting confusing. Maybe better to list all chords in Bb minor scale.

Bb minor (natural minor):

Notes: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

bIII: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

So if the song is in Bb minor, then:

The progression would be:

Fm chord is v chord.

C# as bass... C# isn't even in the Bb minor scale. Unless we're in a different key.

Wait, this is not working. Let's try again.

Alternative idea: let's look at the chord roots. If we have G#7, which in standard practice is dominant chord for C# major. So G# is V in C#. The fact that we have a G#7 resolving to C# suggests C# major is the key.

Even though Fm is outside the key, but perhaps it's a borrowed chord or chromatic passagework.

In C# major, possible other chords: Fm could be the ii chord of Db major (which is C# major's relative minor scale? Not sure).

Alternatively, F minor could be a flat six chord in C# major. Let's see: in major key, the flat six chord is Ab major normally for C# major. But not sure.

Or maybe it's a Neapolitan chord. Neapolitan is usually a flattened second degree chord. In C# major, the Neapolitan would be Db major.

But Fm isn't Db. So no.

Another angle: perhaps the chord "Fm/C" is actually a chord that can be part of a progression in C# major if we consider the Fm as a chromatic mediant or something. But it's still unclear.

Wait, let's see the overall chord progression:

C# ... C#... Fm/C... D#m/C#... G#7/C... then C#.

If we think of Fm/C as part of progression: maybe it's leading to something.

Fm/C → D#m/C# → G#7/C.

C in bass, then C# bass.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the slash chords indicate the bass note, and the key has C# as root but the chords are built with the bass note being the main note. But the tonic is C#.

But the presence of chords like Fm/C and G#7/C which use C as bass note: C is a half step below C#, so it's like a chromatic bass movement. It's common in some progressions to have a bass moving chromatically down from C# to C and back up.

For example, C# to C to C#.

But what key has that?

Wait, perhaps it's in E major? Let's see. No.

Another idea: the key could be C# major, and the chord Fm/C is a borrowed chord from C# minor parallel scale. In C# minor, the chords are:

C# D# E F# G# A B

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III: E

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A

VII: B

Not sure where Fm fits. But if there's a flattened sixth, in natural minor, it's A major. Not Fm.

If harmonic minor: vii° would be B#dim.

But F minor isn't there.

Wait, but in C# Phrygian mode. C# Phrygian is the third mode of A major. Wait:

A major scale: A B C# D E F# G#

Third mode: C# D E F# G# A B → no, wait. Mode of A major third would be:

Root C#, intervals: minor second, minor third, fourth, fifth, minor sixth, minor seventh.

So C# D E F# G# A B C#.

Wait, the scale is C# D E F# G# A B.

In that scale, the diatonic chords would be:

i: C#m

bII: D dim

bIII: E major?

Not sure.

This might not help.

Let's try to list the actual notes of the chords again:

From the progression:

- Most chords have C# as bass and include C#, F (E#), G#.

- Fm/C has F Ab C (but Ab = G#), so C, F, G#.

- G#7/C has G# C D# F#.

So if we look at the actual pitches used:

C, C#, F, G#, D#, A, B#? Let's see.

Wait, this is too vague. Let's try to write the chords as if they were in a key and see which key fits best.

Suppose the progression has chords: C#, D#m, Fm, G#7. If the key is C# major, then D#m is ii, G#7 V7, but Fm not diatonic. But if the key is F major: F major has F, Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, Edim. No. Not matching.

Wait Fm in F major would be iv chord. So if key is F major, then Fm as iv. But chords like G#7 don't fit.

Wait, G#7 as C major, but not sure.

Another Idea: Consider the tonic as F. If the progression is in F major. Let's see:

F major: F Gm A Bb C Dm Edim.

C# major chord would be outside scale.

No.

How about Eb major? No.

Wait, maybe C minor. C minor has C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb.

If the progression has Cm as tonic, but our chords include C# which is not in C minor.

But wait, "C#" as a chord would be outside. Unless in C minor, but it's a chromatic chord.

Not likely.

Alternative approach: Let's consider if the bass note is always C# except when it's C.

So the bass line is C# mostly, but dips to C for some chords. So perhaps the tonic note is C# with chromatic passing tones.

The presence of G#7 (which is dominant of C#) suggests C# major as tonic.

So the key would be C# major, and the Fm chord is a chromatic chord used temporarily. Maybe as part of a modulation or passing chord.

The question is "determine key and mode". So if the tonic is C# major, then the mode is Ionian.

But why is there an Fm chord?

Wait, E# is equivalent to F. In C# major, the fourth degree is F#. So the IV chord is F# major. But F major (or Fm) isn't in scale. So Fm would be a chromatic chord.

But in some contexts, it might be part of a secondary dominant or something.

Alternatively, maybe the chord "Fm/C" is actually a different chord. Let's see: If you have a C bass, and Fm chord with Fm/C, the chord F minor with C bass is C-F-Ab. Another way: this could be spelled as C-F-Ab, which is a C minor add #11 chord? Not sure. Or it could be a Ab major in first inversion.

But Ab major is Ab C Eb. But here we have C-F-Ab. So C-F-Ab is Ab major with C in bass.

So Fm/C could be an Ab major chord with C in the bass. Which is Ab major in first inversion.

Ab is the flattened sixth of C# major. So Ab major chord in C# major would be considered borrowed from the minor key perhaps.

In C# major, the flattened sixth chord would be Ab major. So if the progression has Ab as chord, that could be a borrowed chord from C# minor.

C# minor scale: C# D# E F# G# A B.

Sixth degree is A natural, so A major chord is VI.

Ab would be enharmonic to G#.

This isn't working.

Another Idea: Maybe the key is Db major. Db major has Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C.

Chords in Db major:

I: Db

II: Ebm

III: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

VI: Bbm

VII: Cdim

Ah! Now this seems possible.

If the key is Db major, then:

- C# major chord would be the VII chord (Cdim is part of it, but C# is different... wait, in Db major scale, the notes are Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C.

So Bb is the seventh degree. C is the seventh scale degree of Db major.

Wait, the seventh tone is C. So C is part of Db major.

But C# would be a sharp of C, which is not in the key. Hmm.

But chord Fm in Db major is III chord. Yes: Db major has Fm as iii chord.

Wait: Diatonic chords for Db major:

I: Db major

II: Eb minor

III: F minor

IV: Gb major

V: Ab major

VI: Bb minor

VII: C diminished

So yes, Fm is the iii chord.

But wait, how about G#7? In Db major scale, the V chord is Ab major. So G#7 would be enharmonic to Ab7, which could be considered a dominant seventh in Db.

Because Ab7 would be Ab Cb Eb Gb? Wait, G#7 is G# B# D# F# which is enharmonic to Ab C D# F#?

But Ab7 would be Ab Cb Eb Gb.

This is confusing. But perhaps in context of Db major, the chord G#7 is actually Ab7 written as G#7, but usually it's Ab7.

Similarly, C# as chord would be the VII chord, which is usually C diminished. But C# major chord would be outside the key.

This also seems messy.

Wait, let's try again.

If key is G minor (enharmonic to F# minor). Wait, perhaps G minor:

G minor natural: G A Bb C D Eb F

Chords: Gm, A°, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F.

Not matching.

Another Idea: Let's look at all the root notes of the chords:

The chords listed (ignoring slashes) are:

C#, A#m, Fm, D#m, G#7.

If we consider these root notes: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

In a key where these are all diatonic.

But C# and G# are in keys like C# major, but A# would be fourth degree? No.

Wait, key of A minor: but no.

Wait, key of F minor: F minor scale F Gb Ab Bbb Cb Db Eb. No.

This is tough. Maybe using the concept of the tonic note.

Given that the chord progression starts and ends on C#, and the dominant chord G#7 resolves to C#, it's safe to say tonic is C# major.

Then the Fm chord might be a borrowed chord from the parallel minor or a chromatic chord.

So key is C# major, mode is Ionian.

But the slash chords like Fm/C might just be F minor chord with C in bass, which could be used as a passing chord or part of a chromatic bassline.

For example, in C# major, moving bass from C# down to C natural for the Fm/C chord, then up to C# again. It's a common chromatic bass movement.

So in that case, key would be C# major, mode Ionian.

But let's check the chord D#m/C#. D# minor in C# major is ii chord. Yes.

So:

C# (I), C#, A#m (VI), Fm/C (borrowed?), D#m (ii), G#7 (V7).

This fits if Fm is a chord borrowed from outside. Maybe from the key of C# Phrygian or something.

But in standard analysis, if the progression revolves around C# tonic with V-I movement, then key is C# major/Ionian.

Even with some borrowed chords.

So the answer would be C# major, Ionian mode.

But wait, the Fm chord. In C# major, using F major chord (or minor) is chromatic. But perhaps in this context, it's still considered C# major.

Alternatively, if you think of the key as A# minor, but that's equivalent to Bb minor. Let's see:

Bb minor scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab.

Chords in Bb minor:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

So Fm is v chord here.

But the chord progression has "C#" as the tonic. But in Bb minor scale, the note C# doesn't exist. Because Bb minor's scale is Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab.

C# would be enharmonic to Db. So if the chord C# is actually Db, then it could be the iii chord or something.

But if the tonic is Bb minor, then chords would include:

- Bbm (i)

- Fm (v)

- D#m? In Bb minor, the D# note would be Ebb.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that the tonic is C#, and it's C# major, despite the Fm chord.

Because the dominant chord G#7 resolves to C#. That's the strongest indication of key.

So likely key is C# major, mode Ionian.

Therefore, the answer should be C# major (Ionian).

But how to confirm. Let's see:

In C# major:

- I: C# major

- ii: D# minor

- iii: E# major (F)

- IV: F# major

- V: G# major or G#7

- vi: A# minor

- viio: B# diminished

Yes! So A#m is the vi chord. So the A#m/C# is vi chord with C# in bass.

G#7 would be V7 for tonic.

D#m is ii chord.

Fm... which is not diatonic. But wait, what's the E# note? E# is F natural. So the iii chord in C# major is E# major, which is F major. So if the chord was F major, that would be iii chord. But the given chord is Fm/C.

So F minor chord. But iii chord is major. So Fm would be a minor chord, which would be a chromatic alteration of the iii chord.

In the context of this progression, perhaps they're using F minor as a chromatic chord.

So the chords mostly fit C# major except for the Fm.

So key is C# major.

Therefore, the key is C# major, mode Ionian.

But to double-check: if you have C# major:

I: C#

vi: A#m

ii: D#m

V7: G#7

And the iii chord should be E# major, which is F major. If they're using F minor (Fm) instead of F, that's a minor iii chord. In some contexts, yes, but it's not diatonic.

But perhaps the progression has a Fm which is a common chromatic chord. Like using the flat six chord or something.

But regardless, the strongest indication is the G#7 → C# resolution.

So the analysis would be C# major.

But to confirm: the mode is Ionian when the tonic is based on the major scale.

So yes.

Therefore, the key is C# major and mode is Ionian.

However, sometimes key names can be written as Db major. Because sometimes the key of C# major is less common due to many sharps, so people might use Db major instead. But the actual notation here uses sharps, so probably C# major.

So final answer:

Key: C# Major

Mode: Ionian

But the presence of the Fm chord is a bit odd. Maybe it's a mistake in the chord progression.

Alternatively, the slash chord "Fm/C" could be misinterpreted. Let's check the slash again.

If "Fm/C" means F minor chord with C bass, but in C# major, C is the seventh degree (B#), but C natural would be a chromatic note.

Alternatively, maybe the slash is miswritten. If it was "Fm/C#", then it would be F minor with C# bass. Which would make sense as part of the progression. If the chord was Fm/C#, that would be F minor triad (F Ab C) with bass C#.

The chord would have notes C# F Ab C. But Ab and C# are notes.

But the user wrote "Fm/C", not "Fm/C#".

Alternatively, maybe the slash is a typo. But given the information, I have to go with what's written.

Another possibility: if "Fm/C" is actually "F/C", meaning F major with C bass. But user wrote Fm/C.

Hmm.

Wait, C# major with vi chord A#m, ii D#m, V7 G#7. The Fm might be functioning as the vii° chord or something, but no.

I think the most logical conclusion is that the key is C# major/Ionian, and the Fm is a chromatic chord for color. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the chord progression.

Alternatively, what if the key is A# minor? A# minor is enharmonic to Bb minor.

A# minor natural scale: A# B# C# D# E# F# G#.

Which is same as Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab.

But if we look at the chords:

A#m is i chord.

D#m would be iv chord.

But the chord "C#" here would be III (C# major), which is in Bb minor, the third degree is Db, but if written as C#, it's Db enharmonic. Not sure.

G#7 chord in A# minor: the V chord should be E# major (F major), but it's a dominant 7th. Not sure.

This is not adding up.

At this point, given the dominant seventh chord (G#7) resolving to C#, the tonic is C#. So I think the key is C# major, modal Ionian.

So final answer: Key is C# major, mode is Ionian.

But to double-check, let's see the chord progression spelled out in terms of scale degrees in C# major:

C# (I) → I

A#m/C# → VI (since A#m is vi chord in C# major)

Fm/C → This could be a chromatic chord. If in key of C# major, Fm would be a minor chord containing F (which is E#), but it's minor so it's not diatonic. But it could be a borrowed chord from C# minor where the sixth is A, but F minor isn't there. Not sure.

D#m/C# → ii chord

G#7/C → V7 chord with bass C (but G#7's notes include C natural as B#)

Yes! Because G#7 is G# B# D# F# = G# C D# F#. So the bass note in G#7/C is C, which is the third of the G#7 chord.

So G#7/C is just G#7 in first inversion.

Then the overall progression fits C# major.

So even though Fm/C doesn't exactly fit, the rest of the progression does. Maybe Fm is a chromatic passing chord.

Thus, the key is C# major, mode Ionian.


The chord progression provided is:  
**C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#**

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

#### **1. Identify the Tonic (Key Center)**
- The progression **starts and ends on C#**, which strongly suggests **C# as the tonic**.
- The dominant chord **G#7** resolves to **C#**, a classical V–I cadence that is definitive of a major key.
  - In **C# Major**, **G#7** is the **V7 chord**, which naturally resolves to the **I (C# Major)**.
- This is a strong harmonic indicator of **C# Major** as the key.

#### **2. Check Diatonic Chords in C# Major**
The **C# Major scale** is:
> **C# D# E# F# G# A# B#**

Diatonic chords in **C# Major**:
| Scale Degree | Chord Type | Chord |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| I            | Major      | C#    |
| ii           | Minor      | D#m   |
| iii          | Major      | E# (F) |
| IV           | Major      | F#    |
| V            | Major      | G#    |
| vi           | Minor      | A#m   |
| vii°         | Diminished | B#dim |

- **A#m/C#** → A#m is the **vi chord** (diatonic in C# Major).
- **D#m/C#** → D#m is the **ii chord** (diatonic).
- **G#7/C** → G#7 is the **V7 chord** (diatonic, even though the bass is C, which is part of the G#7 chord: G#=B#=C, D#, F#).
- **Fm/C** → This is the **only non-diatonic chord** in the progression.

#### **3. Interpreting the "Odd" Chord (Fm/C)**
- **Fm** (F–Ab–C) includes **F natural**, which is **not in C# Major** (which has **E# = F** as a major third, not minor).
- However, **Fm** can be interpreted as a **borrowed chord** from the **parallel minor (C# Minor)** or **chromatic passing chord**.
- In many musical contexts, especially in pop, rock, or classical progressions, **chromatic alterations** (like using a minor iii chord instead of a major iii) are common for color or tension.
- Alternatively, the **Fm/C** could be misinterpreted as a **C minor chord with F in bass**, but in C# Major, this would be a **non-diatonic chord** used for expressive purposes.

#### **4. Mode Confirmation**
- The **Ionian mode** is the **major scale** itself. Since all other chords fit within **C# Major** (with the exception of Fm/C), and the progression resolves to **C#** as the tonic, the **mode is Ionian**.
- There are no modal alterations (e.g., Dorian, Phrygian, etc.) that align with the chord structure. All chords align with the **C# Major scale** except for the Fm/C, which is a chromatic deviation.

---

### **Key and Mode**
- **Key: C# Major**  
  (Note: While **Db Major** is the enharmonic equivalent, the progression is written in **sharps**, so **C# Major** is the more accurate and practical name.)
- **Mode: Ionian**  
  (Standard major mode, with the tonic on C#.)

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **C# Minor** would use a different set of chords (e.g., C#m, D#dim, E major, etc.), but the progression includes **C# major**, not C#m.
- **Other keys** (e.g., A minor, G# minor) don't align with the **V7→I resolution** or the note content of the progression.
- **Fm/C** is the only chromatic exception, which is not uncommon in functional harmony and does not invalidate the overall tonal center.

---

### **Summary**
- The progression centers around **C#** as the tonic.
- The **V7–I cadence (G#7 → C#)** confirms the key.
- All other chords (A#m, D#m) are diatonic to **C# Major**.
- The **Fm/C** is a chromatic passing chord used for color, but does not change the tonal center.

> ✅ **Final Answer: Key = C# Major, Mode = Ionian**
