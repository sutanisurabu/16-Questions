Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**

```
C#  C#  A#m/C#  A#m/C#  
C#  C#  Fm/C   D#m/C#  
C#  C#  A#m/C#  A#m/C#  
C#  C#  G#7/C  C#
```

We can simplify this by focusing on the **chord roots** and their function, ignoring the slash bass notes for now (like `/C#`), since they may just indicate inversions or pedal tones.

So stripping out just the **main chords**, we have:

```
C#   - C#
A#m  - A#m
C#   - C#
Fm   - D#m
C#   - C#
A#m  - A#m
C#   - C#
G#7  - C#
```

Wait — **Fm** and **D#m** are enharmonic (same pitch, different name). But in the context of **C#**, we should use **enharmonic consistency**.

Let’s write all chords in proper **C# key context**.

---

### Step 1: Enharmonic Spelling

The key of **C# major** has 7 sharps:  
**C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#** — very messy.

Alternatively, **D♭ major** (5 flats) is the enharmonic equivalent and much easier to work with.

But your chords use **C#**, so we’ll stick with **C#**.

Let’s rewrite some chords with enharmonic equivalents for clarity:

- **Fm** — F is not in C# major. F natural is a flat 5 (♭5) in C#.
  - F = E# enharmonically? No — E# is **C#’s major 7th**, but F natural is actually **E# lowered** → that’s **F**, which is **♭5** of C#.
- So **Fm** = **♭V** in C# — this is very unusual in a diatonic context.

But wait — **F minor** has notes: **F, Ab, C**
- In C# context:
  - F = **♭5**
  - Ab = C#’s **♭♭7** (or **6th below**) → very chromatic
  - Could be borrowed? Possible, but suspicious.

Likewise:
- **D#m** = D#, F#, C# → that’s **ii chord in C# major**
  - Yes! D# minor is the **supertonic** in C# major.

Wait — so earlier chord was written as **Fm/C**, but maybe it's meant to be **D#m/C#** as written later?

Looking back:

Sequence:  
`C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C#`  
`C# C# Fm/C D#m/C#`

Ah — two different chords: **Fm/C** and **D#m/C#**

But:
- **Fm** = F, Ab, C
- **D#m** = D#, F#, A#
- These are **different chords**

But are they **enharmonically similar**?
- F ≈ E#
- Ab ≈ G#
- C ≈ C

But **F ≠ D#** — D# is **E♭**, and **F** is a half step above.

So **Fm** and **D#m** are **not the same** — they are a half-step apart.

So either:
- Typo? Or
- Intentional chromaticism?

Also: **G#7** — that's G#, B#, D#, F# — which is the **dominant (V7)** of **C# major**:
- G# is the 5th of C#, so G#7 = **V7 chord** in C# → resolves to C# tonic.

That’s a strong clue.

Now: **A#m** — A# is the **vi chord** in C# major:
- C# major: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#
- vi = A# minor — yes, that’s diatonic.

So:
- C# = **I**
- A#m = **vi**
- D#m = **ii**
- G#7 = **V7**

These are all **diatonic to C# major**.

But then we have **Fm/C** — that's problematic.

**Fm/C**:
- F = ♭5 of C#
- Ab = ♭♭7 → very chromatic
- C = ♮5? No — C natural is **♭7** of C#, not in key.

But C# major uses **B#**, not C.

Wait — **C natural** is **♭7** of C# — that’s from **mixolydian mode**, or blues.

But Fm with C in bass — could this be a **bVII** chord?

Hold on — is it possible the **Fm/C** is a typo and meant to be **E#m/C#** or **F#m/C#**?

Alternatively, perhaps **Fm** is meant to be **E#dim**?

No — F minor isn't E# anything.

Wait — another idea: could **Fm** actually be intended as **F#m**?

Because:
- F# minor = F#, A, C#
- Notes in key of C# major? Yes:
  - F# = **IV**
  - A = enharmonic of G##? No — A is **major 6th**, and **A natural** is **♭6** in C# — C# major has **A#**, not A.

So A natural is **♭6**, not in key.

So **F#m** would be **IVm**, not diatonic — could be borrowed from **C# minor**.

But wait: D#m is **ii**, which is in C# major.

Then we have **G#7** — which confirms **C#** as tonic, because V7 → I movement is strong.

And we end on **C#**, with G#7 going to C#.

So:
- **Tonic**: C#
- V7: G#7 → C#
- vi: A#m
- ii: D#m

That’s all **C# major**.

Now only problem: **Fm/C**

Possibility: typo — did you mean **F#m/C#**?

Because:
- F#m/C# = F#, A, C# over C# bass → C# F# A C# → that’s C# minor 7th flat 5? No — C# F# A = C#m6 or something.

Wait — F#m chord: F#, A, C#
- C# + F# + A = **C# m(add b6)**? Not standard.

Alternatively: **B chord**? IV chord is F# major in C# major.

Wait — **F# major** is IV chord in C# major:
- F#, A#, C#
- All in key.

But you wrote **Fm**, which is **F#, Ab, C** — Ab = G#, which is **enharmonic to A♭**, not A#.

So **Fm** = F, Ab, C → not in key.

But if it were **F#m**, that’s still not diatonic.

Unless it's **F# major** — that would make sense.

But written as **Fm**.

Another idea: perhaps **Fm** is meant to be **Em?** No.

Wait — let’s look at the bass note: **Fm/C**

So bass is **C**, not **C#**.

C natural?

But earlier chords have **C#** in bass (A#m/C#, etc.)

So this is a **C natural** bass under **F minor**.

Fm/C = C, F, Ab — **C minor 6th?** Or **Fm in first inversion**.

But what is this chord doing in C#?

C natural = **♭7 of C#** — that’s **7th degree of C# mixolydian mode**

And F = **♭3 of D#**, but maybe not helpful.

Alternatively — could this progression be in **C# mixolydian**?

C# mixolydian has: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B
- So **♭7** = B natural, not C.

Wait — C natural is **♭♭7** — not in any major mode.

Wait — this is confusing.

Let’s re-evaluate the entire progression with enharmonic equivalents.

---

### Enharmonic Rewrite: Use D♭ instead of C#

C# = D♭  
D# = E♭  
E# = F  
F# = G♭  
G# = A♭  
A# = B♭  
B# = C

So rewrite chords:

- C# → D♭
- A#m → B♭m
- D#m → E♭m
- G#7 → A♭7
- Fm → Fm (same)

Now progression:

```
D♭  D♭  B♭m/Db  B♭m/Db  
D♭  D♭  Fm/Db  Ebm/Db  
D♭  D♭  B♭m/Db  B♭m/Db  
D♭  D♭  Ab7/Db  D♭
```

Now check:
- D♭ major key: D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C

So:
- D♭ = I
- B♭m = vi
- E♭m = ii
- A♭7 = V7 (since A♭ is V of D♭)
- Fm = F, Ab, Cb? No — Fm is F, Ab, C

But in D♭, **F natural** is **major 3rd**, not minor.

F minor has **Ab**, which is ♭3 — okay, but **F** is **III**, but F minor is not diatonic.

D♭ major has **F major**, not F minor.

So Fm = **bIII** in D♭ — could be a **borrowed chord from D♭ minor**.

Ah! That’s possible.

So in **D♭ major**, borrowing **Fm** (which is **III** in D♭ minor), this is a **modal interchange** chord.

So:
- D♭ (I)
- B♭m (vi)
- E♭m (ii)
- A♭7 (V7)
- Fm → **♭III** borrowed from **D♭ minor**

This is common in jazz or pop — using **♭III** major (though this is minor — F minor, not F major)

Wait — Fm is **F Ab C**

But **F natural** is the **mediant** in D♭ major — so **F minor** is chromatically altering the **III** from major to minor — but III is already **F major** in D♭, so making it **minor** is not standard.

But:
- Fm = iv chord in **C minor**? Not helpful.

Alternatively — perhaps the chord is not Fm but **Ebm**?

Wait, in the original, after Fm/C, you have **D#m/C#**

D#m = D#, F#, A#

In C# context, that’s **ii chord** — perfectly diatonic.

And Fm is **not**.

Possibility: **typo** — did you mean **F#m/C#**?

F#m = F#, A, C#
- A is **♭6** in C# major — not diatonic.

Or **G#m?** G#m = G#, B, D# — B is not in C# major (C is), so no.

Wait — back to **Fm/C**: could this be **Gb minor / Db**?

Same thing.

But here’s a better idea:

In **C# major**, the **iv chord** would be **F# minor**, but you have **Fm**, which is **enharmonic to E# diminished?** No.

Wait — perhaps the **F** is a typo for **F#**.

That would make sense: **F#m/C#** = common chord in C# major? No — F#m is **iv**, not diatonic, but could be borrowed.

Wait — in **C# major**, natural diatonic chord on IV is **F# major**, not minor.

So **F#m = iv** — borrowed from **C# minor** — very common.

So if the chord is meant to be **F#m/C#**, that fits as a **borrowed iv** chord from parallel minor.

But you wrote **Fm/C**

Is **Fm** a misprint for **F#m**?

Because:
- Fm and F#m are very close in letter.
- C and C# in bass — maybe typo on bass too.

Otherwise, **Fm/C** in C# key is very chromatic.

Alternatively, could this be a **Neapolitan chord**?

In C# major, the Neapolitan is **D# major**, not F.

No.

Another possibility: **Tritone substitution**?

G#7 is V7.

Its tritone sub is D7 (since G#7 = G#, B#, D#, F#), tritone = B#, F# → sub would be D7 = D, F#, A, C

But you have Fm — not related.

No.

Let’s look at the **bass line**:

From the slash notation:
- A#m/C# → bass C#
- Fm/C → bass C natural
- D#m/C# → bass C#
- G#7/C → bass C natural

So bass alternates: C#, C, C#, C, ...

So a **pedal tone of C/C#**? Or chromatic movement?

C natural to C# is a half-step.

But in key of C#, C natural = ♭7, C# = 1.

Could be **bluesy**.

But let’s suppose the **Fm/C** is intentional.

Fm/C = C, F, Ab

C = ♭7 of C#
F = ♭3 of D, but in C# — F = ♭5
Ab = C#’s **♭♭7** = enharmonic to G#, which is **7th degree**? No — G# is leading tone.

Ab = G#, which is **B# enharmonic?** No.

G# is **leading tone of C#**, so **Ab = G#** = **major 7th of A**, but here not helpful.

F = **♭5**, Ab = **♭♭7**, C = **♭7**

So Fm/C = C F Ab — that’s **C half-diminished?** C Eb Gb Bb — no, this has **Ab**, not Eb.

Fm = F, Ab, C — so Fm/C = C, F, Ab → **C minor 6th**? C Eb G A — no, we have F and Ab.

C F Ab — intervals:
- C to F = P4
- C to Ab = m6
- F to Ab = m3

So it’s a **sus4 add6**? Not functional.

Alternatively, an **inversion of Fm**: Fm/C = **first inversion**, Fm6?

Fm6 = F, Ab, C, D — but only three notes.

So likely just **F minor in first inversion**.

But in key of **C#**, this is very chromatic.

Best guess: **the chord is meant to be D#m/C#**, and "Fm/C" is a typo.

Because:
- The second chord in that line is **D#m/C#**
- Maybe both are D#m/C#? But you wrote Fm/C and D#m/C#

But let’s count:
Line: C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C#
Then: C# C# Fm/C D#m/C#

So after two C# chords, then Fm/C, then D#m/C#

If you meant **D#m/C#** twice, why write Fm?

Alternatively, perhaps the chord is **Em?** No.

Wait — another idea: **F#m** typed as **Fm** — missing the #.

That’s common.

So **F#m/C#** instead of **Fm/C**

F#m = F#, A, C#
- In C# major, A natural is ♭6 (A# is natural), so chromatic.

But **iv chord** borrowed from **C# minor** — very common in pop, rock, jazz.

So progression would be:

- C# (I)
- A#m (vi)
- F#m (iv, borrowed)
- D#m (ii)
- G#7 (V7)
- C# (I)

This makes perfect sense.

**Chord progression: I - vi - IVm - ii - V7 - I**

Very common variation.

The **iv** (minor subdominant) is a classic borrowing from minor.

So likely, **Fm** is a typo for **F#m/C#**

And **G#7/C** — C natural? Should be C#? Or bass just chromatically walking?

But you wrote **C**, not **C#**

**G#7/C** = C, G#, B#, D#, F#

C = ♭7 of C#, so it’s a **G#7 with flat 7 in bass** — possible, but unstable.

More likely meant to be **G#7/C#** — root position or third inversion.

So probably typo.

---

### Final Analysis

Best interpretation:

- Key: **C# major**
- Mode: **Ionian (major)**
- Chords:
  - C# = I
  - A#m = vi
  - F#m = iv (borrowed from C# minor)
  - D#m = ii
  - G#7 = V7
  - C# = I

Progression: **I - vi - iv - ii - V7 - I**  
Very common in contemporary music.

The **Fm/C** is likely a typo for **F#m/C#**, and **G#7/C** likely meant to be **G#7/C#** or just G#7.

---

### ✅ Verdict:

- **Key**: C# major  
- **Mode**: Major (Ionian)  
- Notes: This assumes "Fm" was intended to be **F#m** — otherwise, it's highly chromatic and suggests a different tonal center or mode. But given the rest of the progression, C# major is clear.

If **Fm** is intentional, key might be **C# mixolydian** or **blues**, but Fm doesn't fit. More likely typo.

**Final Answer**:  
👉 **Key: C# major**  
👉 **Mode: Ionian**
