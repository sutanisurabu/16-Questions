This is an interesting request because the sequence of chords suggests a key and then immediately introduces a stylistic choice that complicates the strict traditional mode determination.

Here is the analysis:

### Chord Sequence Analysis

The chord sequence provided is:
**C# | C# | A#m/C# | A#m/C# | C# | C# | Fm/C | D#m/C# | C# | C# | A#m/C# | A#m/C# | C# | C# | G#7/C | C#**

#### 1. The Tonic and Primary Chords (The Key Center)

*   The sequence begins and ends heavily on **C# Major**. This strongly establishes **C#** as the tonic (I).
*   The second most frequent chord is **A# minor (A#m)**, which is the relative minor (vi) of C# Major.

#### 2. Functional Harmony (Deduction of the Major Key)

The major key of C# has the following diatonic chords:

| Degree | Chord Type | Chord Name |
| :----: | :--------: | :--------: |
| **I**  | Major      | **C#**     |
| II     | minor      | D#m        |
| III    | minor      | Fm         |
| **IV** | Major      | F#         |
| **V**  | Major      | **G#**     |
| **VI** | minor      | **A#m**    |
| VII    | Diminished | B#dim      |

The chords used in the sequence are:
*   **C#** (I)
*   **A#m** (vi)
*   **D#m** (ii)
*   **G#7** (V7)

The presence of the **I, vi, ii, and V7** chords is the cornerstone of standard **C# Major** harmony. This unambiguously establishes the **key center as C# Major**.

### Analysis of Non-Diatonic/Deviant Chords (Mode/Style Determination)

The chord sequence contains two highly unusual chords for the key of C# Major:

1.  **F minor (Fm):** The diatonic iii chord in C# Major is **E# minor** (which is enharmonically F minor, *Fm*). However, the spelling here is crucial. If we assume the natural minor (Aeolian) scale, the iii chord is indeed **F minor**. If we follow C# Major (Ionian), the iii chord is E#m. In classical theory, Fm (III) would often imply a shift toward the relative minor (A#m) or be heard as a modal interchange chord from the parallel C# minor. *In common practice, Fm is generally interchangeable with E#m when hearing the harmony.*
2.  **Harmonic Context of the Slash Chords:** The use of **A#m/C#**, **D#m/C#**, **Fm/C**, and **G#7/C** reveals a specific compositional technique: keeping the bass note constant (C# or sometimes C) while the harmony changes above it (a pedal point or inverted voicing). This is a common characteristic of Gospel, Neo-Soul, and contemporary pop music where the bass line serves a smooth, continuous path while the chords provide color.

#### The Modes: Ionian vs. Aeolian

Since we have a strong tonic of C# and frequently use chords like D#m (ii) and G#7 (V7), we are firmly rooted in the Major tonality.

*   **Key:** **C# Major**
*   **Mode:** **Ionian** (The fundamental major scale mode).

### Conclusion

The piece is in the **Key of C# Major**.

The mode is **Ionian**, but the harmonic choices (the specific slash chords and the passing use of Fm/C) utilize aspects of **modal harmony and suspensions**, characteristic of contemporary styles, rather than a strictly simple C# Major/Ionian progression.

**Final Answer:**

*   **Key:** **C# Major**
*   **Mode:** **Ionian**
