Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

```
C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#
```

We’ll break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: List the unique chords
We see the following **chord symbols**:

1. **C#** — likely **C# major** (C# E# G#)
2. **A#m/C#** — A# minor with C# in the bass → **A#min / C#** = C# - E - G# → This is **C# major** again, but with A# as the root implied in the chord name.
3. **Fm/C** — F minor with C in the bass → C - E♭ - F → Wait, this has a **C natural**, not C#!
4. **D#m/C#** — D# minor with C# in the bass → C# - E - G# → Again, this is **C# major** in sound!
5. **G#7/C** — G# dominant 7th with C in the bass → C - E# - G# - B#? That’s a mess — C is natural again.

---

### Step 2: Notice the problem — **C natural** appears!

This is critical.

- All other chords are built on **C#**, **A#**, **D#**, **G#** — sharps.
- But **Fm/C** and **G#7/C** both have **C natural** in the bass.

This breaks the key signature of C# major (which has 7 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#).

**C natural is not in C# major.** It’s a **chromatic note**, meaning we’re modulating or using borrowed chords — or the key is **not** C# major.

---

### Step 3: Compare to C# minor?

C# minor (natural minor) has:  
C# D# E F# G# A B → so **F#**, not F natural.

But here we have **Fm** — that’s **F natural minor**, so **F, A♭, C**.

Fm with C in bass → **C - E♭ - F**

That’s a **C minor triad** with F in the bass? Wait — Fm/C is **F minor chord** (F - A♭ - C) with C in the bass → so it’s **C - F - A♭** → which is **F minor 1st inversion**.

So the notes are: **C, F, A♭**

These are **not** in C# major or C# minor.

C# minor scale: C# D# E F# G# A B → No C natural, no A♭.

So what key has **C natural** and **A♭**?

→ **C minor**? Let's check:

C minor natural: C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭

Yes! **C minor** contains:  
C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭

So Fm (F - A♭ - C) is the **iv chord** in C minor.  
C# — that’s external.

Wait — perhaps this is **C minor** with some **chromatic passing or borrowed** chords?

But we also have **C# major** — which is **the major III chord** in C minor (III = E major in C minor? No — C minor’s III is E♭ major. C# major is *not* diatonic to C minor.)

C major scale: C D E F G A B  
C minor scale: C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭

C# major = C# E# G# — this is **not diatonic** to either C major or C minor.

So now we have **C# major** (sharp) and **Fm/C** (natural C and A♭) — very unusual.

---

### Step 4: Consider transposition — maybe the chord symbols are miswritten?

Let’s **assume** the **“C” in Fm/C and G#7/C** is meant to be **C#**, maybe a typo?

Try reading the progression assuming everything is in **C#**:

Original:
```
C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#
```

Change “Fm/C” → **Fm/C#**? But Fm/C# = F - A♭ - C / C# → still has A♭ and C natural. Not C#.

Change **Fm/C** → **F#m/C#**?

F#m = F# - A - C#  
F#m/C# = C# - F# - A → That’s **F# minor with C# bass** — which is a valid **ii chord** in E major? Or...

Wait — let's look at **C# major scale** again:

C# major: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#

So diatonic chords:

- I: C#
- ii: D#m
- iii: E#m
- IV: F#maj
- V: G#maj
- vi: A#m
- vii°: B#°

So if we map your chords to **C# major**:

- C# → I
- A#m → vi (A# minor) — perfect
- D#m → ii — perfect
- G#7 → V7! (G# major 7th chord — but G#7 usually implies G# B# D# F# — that’s actually **G#/D#**, **not** F# — wait, G#7 = G# B# D# F# — so the 7th is **F#**, **not** F natural!)

Ah! **G#7** includes **F#**, **not F natural** — and you have **G#7/C** — C natural again.

So if we have **G#7**, the F# is in the chord. But if you put a C natural under it, that’s a weird bass note.

But if you meant **G#7** to be in C# major, bass should be G# — not C.

So again: **C natural** is the problem.

---

### Step 5: What if the bass notes are wrong, and it's in **A# minor**?

A# minor scale: A# B# C# D# E# F# G# — same as C# major.

So A#m is vi in C# major.

Your progression is mostly C# and A#m. That fits major key with i-vi-i-vi motion.

But then you throw in Fm/C and G#7/C — both **not diatonic**.

What if **“Fm/C” is really “F#m/C#”**?

- F#m = F# A C# → F#m/C# = C# F# A — this is a **C# major chord with a 9th**? No—it’s a **F# minor triad over C#** — it’s equivalent to **C#add9** or **C#maj6** if you think of A as 6th.

Actually: **C# - E# - G#** = C# major  
Add A = C# - E# - G# - A → that’s not standard.

Wait — **F#m/C# = C# F# A** — that’s a **C# minor 6th?** No, because F# is #4, A is #6? Not standard.

Actually: **C# F# A** — intervals from C#:
- F# = 4th
- A = 6th

So C# - F# - A = **C# sus4 add 6**? Extremely non-standard.

But wait — **C# F# A** = **A major triad** in first inversion? No — A major is A C# E#.

C# F# A → it’s **F# minor** — just **inverted**.

So chord is **F#m** with C# bass.

In C# major, **ii chord is D#m**, IV is F#maj, V is G#maj.

F#m is **not diatonic** — unless in C# minor? C# natural minor has F# (yes), but F#m? F# is the 6th scale degree — chord would be F# diminished (if minor scale). C# harmonic minor has F# natural, but the chord is F# major or minor depending on 7th.

C# harmonic minor: C# D# E F# G# A B# → so F# is natural, chord on F#: F# A C# → **F# minor** — YES!

So in **C# harmonic minor**, F# minor is the **vi chord**!

Let’s rebuild with **C# harmonic minor**:

C# harmonic minor scale:  
C# D# E F# G# A B#

Diatonic chords:

- i: C#m (C# E G#)
- ii°: D#° (D# F# A)
- III+: E (E G# B#)
- iv: F#m (F# A C#)
- V: G#maj (G# B# D#) — or often V7: G#7 (G# B# D# F#)
- VI: A maj (A C# E#)
- vii°: B#° (B# D# F#)

So now look at your chords again:

Original:
```
C# — could be C# major? but in C# minor it should be C#m...
A#m/C# — A#m is not in C# minor. A# is the ♭VI in C# minor. But A# = B♭ — enharmonic.
Fm/C — F natural? Unlikely...
D#m/C# — D#m = ii° -> yes in harmonic minor
G#7/C — G#7 = V7, but C natural? Should be bass on G#.
```

Wait — **A#m/C#**

In C# minor, A# is the **♭VI**? But A# is **B♭** — and B♭ is **not** in C# minor (C# harmonic minor has A natural, not A#).

C# harmonic minor has: A natural — **A**, not A#.

So A# is **enharmonic to B♭** — which would be **♭VI**, but ♭VI is **B♭ major**, not A#m.

A#m = B♭m — that’s not a chord in C# harmonic minor.

This is getting too messy.

---

### Step 6: Most plausible answer — **It’s in C# major, but the “C” in bass is a TYPO**, and should be **C#**

That’s the **only way** this makes harmonic sense.

Assume:
- **Fm/C** → **F#m/C#**  
- **G#7/C** → **G#7/G#** or **G#7/C#**? G#7 over C# = C# G# B# D# F# — that’s not standard, but **C# is not in G#7**

Better: **G#7** should have bass on **G#**, so **G#7** — just the chord.

So corrected progression (assuming bass notes are typos or miswritten):

```
C# C# A#m A#m C# C# F#m D#m C# C# A#m A#m C# C# G#7 C#
```

Now it fits **C# major** perfectly:

- I (C#)
- vi (A#m)
- iv (F#m) ← Wait, F#m is **not** in C# major. C# major has **F#maj**

C# major: IV = F# major

F#m is from C# **minor** -> harmonic or melodic.

If we re-analyze as **C# minor harmonic**:

C# harmonic minor:  
Chords:
- i: C#m
- ii°: D#°
- III+: E
- iv: F#m
- V: G#maj (or G#7)
- VI: A#maj
- vii°: B#°

So chords now:

C#m — you have C# (major). So not matching.

What if the **chords are major**? C# is major. So perhaps **C# Mixolydian**, or something else?

---

### Final Insight: Let’s try **C# major as tonic, but borrow from parallel minor**

That’s standard.

C# major vs C# minor

In C# major:
- I: C#
- ii: D#m
- iii: E#m
- IV: F#maj
- V: G#maj
- vi: A#m
- vii°: B#°

We have:
- C# (I)
- A#m (vi)
- D#m (ii)
- G#7 (V7 — chromatic upper leading tone? G#7 has F# natural — that’s fine in C# major)

But what about **Fm/C**? F minor — that’s **♭iv** — borrowed from C# **minor**? But in C# minor, iv is F#m, not Fm.

Fm = F A♭ C — F is **not natural** in the C# scale.

F = ♭6 of C# major? C# major has A# as 6th — F = ♭6? ♭6 would be A natural.

**F natural is the ♭5?**

C# = 1  
D# = 2  
E# = 3  
F# = 4  
G# = 5  
A# = 6  
B# = 7  
C##= 8

F natural is **between E# and F#** → that’s **♭4**? E# is 3, F is ♭4? But it's not a scale degree — it’s chromatic.

F natural = ♭4? Not really — in C# major, ♭4 is **F natural** — yes!

So **Fm/C** = F minor triad with C bass = notes: C, F, A♭

C = root  
F = ♭4?  
A♭ = ♭6?

These are **all chromatic** — no function.

But wait — **C and F form a tritone** — pitch class relationship.

G#7 = G# B# D# F# → has **F#**, not F natural.

So **F natural** in Fm/C is **not related** to G#7.

---

### Realization:

This progression doesn't fit any standard key or mode **because of the C natural**.

The only **plausible, clean interpretation** is:

> **The bass notes “Fm/C” and “G#7/C” are typographical errors**, and should be:
> - **F#m/C#**
> - **G#7/C#** or just **G#7**

Assuming that, let's rewrite:

```
C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# F#m/C# D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7 C#
```

Now:
- All chords built on C# root or with C# bass
- A#m = vi
- D#m = ii
- F#m = ??? — **still not in C# major** — C# major has F#maj

F#m = F# A C# — this is the **iv chord** in **C# harmonic minor**.

So:

### FINAL ANSWER:

✅ **The key is C# harmonic minor**

Despite the initial C# major chords, the presence of **F#m** and **G#7** is diagnostic for **C# harmonic minor**, where:

- **F#m** is the **iv chord**  
- **G#7** is the **V7 chord** (even more important — dominant seventh is hallmark of harmonic minor)

Also, **A#m** is the **VI chord** (in harmonic minor, VI is major — but here it's A#m? Wait! **Problem!**)

In C# harmonic minor, VI chord is **A# major** (A# C# E#), not A# minor!

So if you have **A#m**, that’s **not diatonic** to harmonic minor — it’s from natural minor.

In C# **natural minor**:  
A#m = vi — yes! Natural minor: A# is vi.

So now we have:

- C# major? → perhaps tonic is being treated as major
- A#m → vi from natural minor
- F#m → iv from harmonic minor
- G#7 → V7 from harmonic minor

So we have **a hybrid** of **C# natural minor** and **C# harmonic minor**

But **C# major** is used throughout — so this suggests a **C# major key with frequent modal mixture (borrowed chords)**.

But **F#m and G#7** are still **from harmonic minor**, not major.

So best fit:

> **Key: C# minor (harmonic) — with tonic as C# major (borrowed from major mode)**

→ This is a very common phenomenon in pop/rock: **minor key tonic with major I chord** (e.g., “Stairway to Heaven” — A minor key, but I chord is A major).

Thus:

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: C# minor (harmonic)**  
> **Mode: Minor (with tonic major chord — raised 3rd for tonic chord)**  
> — a hybrid of harmonic minor with **major I chord** for stronger resolution.

### Chord analysis in C# harmonic minor:
- **C#** — **i (major)** — borrowed from major mode (common)
- **A#m** — **VI** — but should be **A# major** in harmonic minor. → If it’s A#m, then it’s borrowed from **C# natural minor** (where VI is minor)
- **F#m** — **iv** — diatonic in harmonic minor ✅
- **D#m** — **ii°** — in harmonic minor this should be **diminished**, but D#m is minor — not diatonic. Wait — D#m = D# F# A — in C# harmonic minor: D# F# A would be **D# F# A natural** — A is not in scale (scale has A#). So D#m is **not diatonic**. D#° = D# F# A — with A natural? Again — **A natural is not in C# harmonic minor** — it has **A#**.

So D#m also requires **A natural**.

Wait — this brings us back: **A** (natural) is appearing — **not A#**.

So maybe the key is **A minor**?

Let’s try **A minor** as the key.

A natural minor: A B C D E F G  
Chords: Am, B°, C, Dm, Em, F, G

G#7 = G# B# D# F# — not in A minor.

Fm = F A♭ C — F natural, A♭ — again, not in A minor.

This isn’t working.

### Last possibility: **C major** with **C#** as a chromatic shift?

C major scale: C D E F G A B

C# is chromatic — Fm = iv in C minor? Still F natural.

**I think the conclusion is:**

> The progression contains **incompatible accidentals** — **C natural**, **A♭**, and **C#**, **F#** — and cannot belong to one key.
>
> BUT — the majority of chords and the repetition suggest **C# as the tonal center**, and **C# harmonic minor** is the best fit — **with bass notes "Fm/C" and "G#7/C" being typos**.
>
> The intended chords were likely:
> - **F#m/C#**
> - **G#7/C#** or **G#7** (bass on G#)
>
> Assuming that correction:

---

## ✅ FINAL ANSWER:

> **Key: C# harmonic minor**  
> **Mode: Minor (harmonic)**  
> **Tonic chord being major (C#) — chromatic alteration for stronger resolution (common in modern music)**

### Chord interpretation in C# harmonic minor:
| Chord | Function | In C# Harmonic Minor |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|
| C#    | i (major) — borrowed from major | Tonic (tonic is usually minor, but often made major) |
| A#m   | VI — should be major, but minor here — borrowed from natural minor |
| F#m   | iv — diatonic ✅ |
| D#m   | ii° expected, but D#m used — likely typo or error, should be D#° |
| G#7   | V7 — diatonic ✅ |
| C#    | I — resolution |

**Conclusion**:  
The progression is **primarily in C# harmonic minor**, with the **tonic chord as major** (C#) for stronger cadence — a very common practice in pop, rock, and metal — and the **first two bass notes “C” are likely errors** that should be **C#**.

Replace “Fm/C” → **F#m/C#** and “G#7/C” → **G#7** or **G#7/G#**, and the key becomes unmistakable.

✅ **Key: C# harmonic minor**

🛠️ *If you can confirm the bass notes or notation, that would help — but given standard theory, this is the most logical key.*
