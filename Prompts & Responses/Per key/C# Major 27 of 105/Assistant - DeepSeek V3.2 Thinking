**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, the user has given a sequence of chords: C#, A#m/C#, A#m/C#, C#, C#, Fm/C, D#m/C#, C#, C#, A#m/C#, A#m/C#, C#, C#, G#7/C, C#.

I need to determine the key and mode. Key refers to the tonic or home note, and mode could be major or minor, or something else.

These chords are written with slashes, which often indicate bass notes or inversions. For example, "A#m/C#" means an A# minor chord with a C# in the bass. Similarly, "Fm/C" means F minor with C in the bass, and "G#7/C" means G# dominant 7th with C in the bass.

To find the key, I should look at the chords and see which notes are emphasized, especially the tonic chord.

List out the chords without the bass notes to simplify:

- C# (could be C# major or minor? Typically written as C# means major, and C#m would be minor. But here, C# is listed, and others have m for minor, so C# is probably C# major.

Chords:

- C# (assume C# major)

- A#m/C# (A# minor with C# bass)

- A#m/C# (same)

- C# (major)

- C# (major)

- Fm/C (F minor with C bass)

- D#m/C# (D# minor with C# bass)

- C# (major)

- C# (major)

- A#m/C# (A# minor with C# bass)

- A#m/C# (same)

- C# (major)

- C# (major)

- G#7/C (G# dominant 7th with C bass)

- C# (major)

Now, let's list the root chords without inversions:

- C# major appears many times.

- A# minor appears several times.

- F minor appears once.

- D# minor appears once.

- G#7 (dominant 7th) appears once.

The bass notes are C# in many cases, which might emphasize C# as a tonic.

Now, to determine the key, I need to see which key these chords fit into.

First, let's think about the notes involved.

C# major chord: C#, E#, G# (since E# is F, but in music theory, it's E# in C# major scale).

Standard keys:

- C# major scale: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, C# (all sharps, equivalent to Db major but enharmonic).

But A# minor is the relative minor of C# major? Relative minor is the sixth degree.

In major scale, chords:

I - C# major

ii - D# minor

iii - E# minor (which is F minor? E# is F, so E# minor would be F minor, but F minor has Ab, not A#. Messy.

Perhaps it's better to think in terms of sharps and flats.

C# major has 7 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#.

Chords in C# major:

I - C# major

ii - D# minor

iii - E# minor (F minor enharmonic? But F minor is not typically written as E# minor; it's messy.)

E# minor would be E#, G#, B#, but E# is F, G# is Ab? No, in equal temperament, but in notation, it's inconsistent.

Perhaps this is in a key with fewer sharps or flats.

Let's list the chords and see their roots:

- C# major

- A# minor

- F minor

- D# minor

- G#7

Now, A# minor: A#, C#, E# (which is F)

F minor: F, Ab, C

D# minor: D#, F#, A#

G#7: G#, B#, D#, F# (B# is C)

C# major: C#, E#, G# (E# is F)

Notice that many chords have C# in them or as bass.

Also, G#7 is a dominant 7th chord, which typically resolves to the tonic.

In this sequence, G#7/C to C#, so G#7 to C#. G#7 to C# is a V7 to I in C# major? V7 of C# major would be G#7, and I is C# major. Yes!

G#7 is G# dominant 7th, which is the V7 chord in C# major.

In C# major, V is G# major, V7 is G#7.

And it resolves to C# major.

Now, other chords: A# minor. In C# major, vi chord is A# minor? Let's see the scale degrees.

C# major scale: C# (1), D# (2), E# (3), F# (4), G# (5), A# (6), B# (7)

So chords:

I - C# major

ii - D# minor

iii - E# minor (but E# is F, so often written as F minor? No, in C# major, iii is E# minor, which is enharmonic to F minor, but F minor has Ab, whereas E# minor has E# and B#, which are F and C, so it's the same pitches but different spelling.

In standard music theory, in C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, but it's rarely used because of the double sharps, so often pieces are written in Db major instead for simplicity.

But here, the chords are written with sharps, so likely C# major.

A# minor is the vi chord in C# major.

D# minor is the ii chord in C# major.

F minor: F minor is not in C# major. In C# major, the IV chord is F# major, not F minor.

F minor has F, Ab, C. In C# major, the note F is not present; it's E# or F#.

C# major has E# (F) and F#, so F natural is not in the scale.

F minor chord: F, Ab, C.

In C# major, the notes are C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#. So F natural (which is E#) is actually in the scale as the third degree, but F minor chord has F, Ab, C.

Ab is not in C# major; C# major has A# which is Bb enharmonic, but A# is not Ab.

A# is A sharp, which is B flat, and Ab is G sharp? Let's clarify.

A# is the same as Bb.

Ab is the same as G#.

In C# major, A# is the sixth degree, which is A sharp, equivalent to B flat.

But Ab is A flat, which is G sharp, and in C# major, G# is the fifth degree.

F minor chord: F, Ab, C.

F: in C# major, is it E#? E# is F, so yes, F is E# in C# major.

Ab: in C# major, is there Ab? No, C# major has G# and A#, no Ab. Ab would be the flattened sixth or something.

In C# major, the notes are C#, D#, E# (F), F#, G#, A# (Bb), B# (C). So no Ab; Ab is not in the scale.

Similarly, for F minor, Ab is not in C# major.

But in the chord sequence, there is Fm/C, which is F minor with C bass.

C is in C# major? C# major has B# which is C, so C is the seventh degree, but it's B# in the scale.

B# is C, so C is present as the leading tone.

But F minor has F and Ab. F is E# in C# major, so it's the third degree, but Ab is not in the scale; Ab would be the flattened sixth if we think modally.

Perhaps this is not purely in C# major; there might be borrowed chords or modulation.

Let's list all the chords with their roots and qualities:

- C# major (I)

- A# minor (vi)

- A# minor (vi)

- C# major (I)

- C# major (I)

- F minor (?) not in key

- D# minor (ii)

- C# major (I)

- C# major (I)

- A# minor (vi)

- A# minor (vi)

- C# major (I)

- C# major (I)

- G#7 (V7)

- C# major (I)

So, most chords are I, vi, ii, V7 in C# major, but F minor is odd.

F minor: what is F minor in relation to C# major?

C# major is the tonic. F minor could be a borrowed chord from parallel minor or something.

C# major parallel minor is C# minor.

C# minor scale: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B, C# (natural minor) or harmonic minor with B#.

Chords in C# minor:

i - C# minor

ii° - D# diminished

III - E major

iv - F# minor

v - G# minor

VI - A major

VII - B major

But here we have F minor, not F# minor.

F minor is F, Ab, C.

In C# minor, the iv chord is F# minor, which is F#, A, C#.

F minor is different.

Perhaps it's a different key.

Maybe the key is C# minor? But the chords include C# major, not minor. The C# chords are written as C#, which is major, and A#m is minor, but A# minor is not in C# minor.

C# minor has A major as VI chord, not A# minor.

A# minor would be in a key with more sharps.

Let's think about the bass notes. Many chords have C# in the bass, like A#m/C#, D#m/C#, which means the bass is C#, so C# is emphasized as a pedal point or tonic.

Similarly, G#7/C has C in the bass, which is unusual.

G#7/C means G#7 chord with C in the bass, so the notes are G#, B#, D#, F# with C in bass. B# is C, so it's G#, C, D#, F#? G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#, and with C bass, it's C, G#, B#, D#, F#, but B# is C, so it's C, G#, C, D#, F#, which has double C, so it's like a C major with added notes, but G#7 is dominant.

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant or something.

Another way: perhaps the key is C# major, and F minor is a borrowed chord from C# phrygian or something.

C# phrygian would be C#, D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#? Phrygian has flattened second.

Not sure.

Let's list the scale degrees based on C# as tonic.

Assume C# is tonic.

Then chords:

- I: C# major

- vi: A# minor? In C# major, vi is A# minor, yes.

- ii: D# minor, yes.

- V7: G#7, yes.

- But F minor: what degree is F minor? F is the fourth degree? In C# major, IV is F# major, not F minor.

F is the lowered fourth? ♭IV?

In major keys, ♭IV is sometimes used, like in the "backdoor cadence" or borrowed from parallel minor.

In C# major, parallel minor is C# minor, which has iv as F# minor, not F minor.

F minor would be even flatter.

Perhaps it's a neapolitan chord or something.

Another thought: maybe the key is not C# major, but something else.

Let's look at the first few chords: C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# so I vi vi I I

Then Fm/C D#m/C# so IV? but Fm is not IV.

Fm/C: F minor with C bass. C is the dominant of F? Not sure.

D#m/C# is ii with tonic bass.

Then back to I vi I I V7 I.

G#7/C to C#, so V7 with something in bass to I.

G#7/C: G#7 is V7, with C in bass. C is the seventh of G#7? G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#, so the seventh is F#, not C. With C bass, it's adding a C, which is not in the chord.

In C# major, C is B#, the leading tone, so it's the major seventh, but in G#7, it's dominant, so seventh is F#, which is the fourth of C#.

G#7 has F# as seventh, which is the fourth of C#.

With C in bass, C is B# in C# major, so it's like having the tonic note in bass before resolving.

But in terms of chord, G#7/C is essentially a G#7 chord with C in the bass, so the overall sound might be like a C# major with added tension.

Perhaps it's a passing chord.

But let's focus on the key.

Another idea: perhaps the mode is minor, but the tonic is C#.

If C# is tonic, and chords include C# major, so it's major mode? But A# minor is vi, which is common in major keys.

But F minor doesn't fit.

Let's list all root notes: C#, A#, A#, C#, C#, F, D#, C#, C#, A#, A#, C#, C#, G#, C#

Bass notes: for A#m/C#, bass is C#, for D#m/C#, bass is C#, for Fm/C, bass is C, for G#7/C, bass is C, and others have implied bass same as root for C#.

So bass is mostly C#, but sometimes C.

C is the leading tone in C# major.

In the sequence, when bass is C, it's on Fm and G#7.

Fm/C and G#7/C.

Fm/C: F minor with C bass, so notes F, Ab, C with C bass, so emphasis on C.

G#7/C: G#7 with C bass, notes G#, B#, D#, F# with C bass, so C, G#, B#, D#, F#, but B# is C, so it's C, G#, C, D#, F#, which is like a C major 7 #5 or something, but G#7 is V7, so with C bass, it might be functioning as a dominant with added note.

In jazz, sometimes chords have altered bass.

But for key determination, the recurring tonic is C# major, as it starts and ends with C#, and V7 resolves to it.

The odd chord is Fm.

Fm could be a borrowed chord from the parallel minor or from another mode.

In C# major, the ♭VI chord would be A major, not F minor.

♭VI is A major in C# major? C# major, ♭VI would be lowering the sixth, so A natural instead of A#, so A major.

But here it's F minor, which is not A.

F minor has root F.

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant or something.

F minor to what? Fm/C to D#m/C#, so Fm to D#m.

D#m is ii in C# major.

F minor could be the v of ii? ii is D# minor, so v of D# minor would be A# minor? D# minor key, v is A# minor? D# minor scale: D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B, C#? Let's not complicate.

Perhaps Fm is a passing chord or a chromaticism.

But let's see the overall.

Another thought: perhaps the key is C# minor, but the chords include C# major, which is the parallel major? But in minor keys, the i chord is minor, but here C# is major, so it's not minor.

Unless it's modal mixture.

But let's list the chords in order: C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#

So the progression is: I - vi - vi - I - I - ? - ii - I - I - vi - vi - I - I - V7 - I

The ? is Fm/C.

Fm/C could be seen as a iv chord in some context? But in C# major, iv would be F# minor, not F minor.

F minor is a half step lower than F# minor.

In C# major, if we borrow from C# phrygian, phrygian has ♭2, but here it's ♭4? F instead of F#.

C# phrygian would be C#, D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#? Still F#.

C# locrian? C#, D, E, F, G, A, B, C#? But locrian has diminished fifth, not minor.

F minor has perfect fifth.

Perhaps it's a neapolitan chord. Neapolitan chord is ♭II, which in C# would be D major, not F minor.

♭II is D major in C# key.

F minor is ♭IV? In C# major, ♭IV would be F major, not minor.

♭IV major is sometimes used, but here it's minor.

F minor is iii? In C# major, iii is E# minor, which is F minor enharmonic? E# minor is E#, G#, B#, which is F, G#, C, so F, G#, C? G# is Ab? No, G# is G sharp, so E# minor is F, G#, C? F, G#, C is not a standard minor chord; minor chord is root, minor third, perfect fifth.

E# minor: root E#, minor third G#, perfect fifth B#.

E# is F, G# is Ab? No, G# is G sharp, which is A flat, but in terms of pitch, E# minor chord has pitches F, G#, C? B# is C, so yes, F, G#, C.

But G# is not Ab; G# and Ab are enharmonic, but in spelling, G# is used in sharp keys.

In C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, which is spelled E#, G#, B#, and sounds like F, G#, C.

But F, G#, C is an augmented second? F to G# is augmented second, but in equal temperament, it's a minor third? F to G# is a minor third? F to G is major second, F to G# is augmented second, which is enharmonic to minor third, so yes, it's a minor chord.

E# minor is enharmonic to F minor? E# minor has E#, G#, B# which is F, G#, C, and F minor has F, Ab, C, and G# and Ab are the same pitch, so yes, E# minor is enharmonic to F minor!

In C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, which is exactly F minor in terms of pitch, but spelled differently.

In music theory, in C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, and it's rarely used because of the spelling, but in practice, it's the same as F minor.

Similarly, in other keys with many sharps, chords can be enharmonic.

So, in C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, which is F minor enharmonic.

In the chord sequence, it's written as Fm, which is common to use the enharmonic equivalent for readability.

Similarly, A# minor is vi, D# minor is ii, G#7 is V7, all fit in C# major.

And the bass notes: A#m/C# means A# minor with C# bass, so it's the first inversion of vi chord.

Similarly, D#m/C# is first inversion of ii chord.

Fm/C: F minor with C bass, so in C# major, iii chord is E# minor, with C bass? C is B# in C# major, so E# minor with B# in bass? E# minor chord is E#, G#, B#, so with B# in bass, it's first inversion? Root position E# minor is E#, G#, B#, so first inversion is G#, B#, E#, which is G#, C, F? G#, C, F.

But in the sequence, it's Fm/C, which is F, Ab, C with C bass, so if F is E#, Ab is G#, C is B#, so it's E#, G#, B# with B# in bass, so yes, first inversion of iii chord.

Similarly, G#7/C: G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#, with C bass, C is B#, so it's G#7 with B# in bass, which is not standard, but might be a way to emphasize the leading tone.

In root position, G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#, so with B# in bass, it's first inversion? First inversion of G#7 would be B#, D#, F#, G#, which is C, D#, F#, G#.

But in the sequence, it's G#7/C, so notes C, G#, B#, D#, F#, which is the same as first inversion G#7? First inversion G#7 is B#, D#, F#, G#, so yes, with C (B#) in bass, it's first inversion.

In standard notation, first inversion of G#7 would be written as G#7/B# or something, but here it's G#7/C, and C is B#, so it's enharmonic.

Similarly, for other chords, the bass is often C#, which is tonic, so it's like pedal point or emphasizing tonic.

So, all chords fit in C# major:

- C#: I

- A#m/C#: vi6 (first inversion)

- Similarly, A#m/C#: vi6

- C#: I

- C#: I

- Fm/C: iii6 (first inversion of iii)

- D#m/C#: ii6 (first inversion of ii)

- C#: I

- C#: I

- A#m/C#: vi6

- A#m/C#: vi6

- C#: I

- C#: I

- G#7/C: V6/5? First inversion of V7? V7 first inversion is V6/5, which is the third in bass.

G#7 first inversion: B#, D#, F#, G#, so bass B# (C), and it's often written as G#7/B# or enharmonic.

Here it's G#7/C, so yes.

- C#: I

So the progression is: I - vi6 - vi6 - I - I - iii6 - ii6 - I - I - vi6 - vi6 - I - I - V6/5 - I

All in C# major.

The mode is major, since the tonic chord is major.

Key: C# major

Mode: major

But in the sequence, it's written with chords like Fm, which is enharmonic for E#m, but in practice, it's fine.

Similarly, A#m is correct for vi.

So, key is C# major.

To confirm, the V7 resolves to I, and it starts and ends with I.

Also, the frequent use of C# in bass reinforces the tonic.

So, I think key is C# major, mode is major.

Now, for the response, I should state the key and mode.

The user said "Determine key and mode", so probably key is C# major, mode is major.

In music, mode often refers to major or minor, but in this case, it's major.

Sometimes mode could be ionian, but typically we say major.

So, key: C# major

Mode: major

But to be precise, since it's C# major, the mode is ionian, but commonly we say major.

In the context, I think "major" is fine.

Now, for the response, I should explain briefly.

Since the user might not need a detailed theory lesson, but since it's a question, I should justify.

But the instruction is to respond as DeepSeek, so keep it helpful.

Also, format with backticks for terms.

So, in response, I can say:

The key is C# major, and the mode is major.

Perhaps mention that the chords are mostly in C# major with some first inversions.

But I think it's straightforward.

Based on the chord progression provided:

- `C#` (I)
- `A#m/C#` (vi⁶, first inversion)
- `A#m/C#` (vi⁶)
- `C#` (I)
- `C#` (I)
- `Fm/C` (iii⁶, first inversion of E♯m, enharmonic to Fm in C♯ major)
- `D#m/C#` (ii⁶, first inversion)
- `C#` (I)
- `C#` (I)
- `A#m/C#` (vi⁶)
- `A#m/C#` (vi⁶)
- `C#` (I)
- `C#` (I)
- `G#7/C` (V⁶⁄₅, first inversion of V⁷)
- `C#` (I)

The progression consistently centers around `C#` as the tonic, with dominant `G#7` resolving to `C#`, and all chords fit within the C♯ major scale (C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯). The use of first inversions (e.g., `A#m/C#`, `D#m/C#`) emphasizes `C#` in the bass, reinforcing the tonic.

**Key:** `C# major`  
**Mode:** `Major` (Ionian)
