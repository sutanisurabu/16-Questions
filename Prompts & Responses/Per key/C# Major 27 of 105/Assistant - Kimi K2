Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: List the chords and their notes
We need to determine the notes in each chord. The chords are:

1. **C#** (C# major)  
   Notes: C#, E#, G#

2. **A#m/C#** (A# minor with C# in the bass)  
   This is just an A# minor chord (A#, C#, E#) with C# in the bass, so the notes are the same: A#, C#, E#.

3. **Fm/C** (F minor with C in the bass)  
   F minor is F, Ab, C. The bass note is C, so the notes are F, Ab, C.

4. **D#m/C#** (D# minor with C# in the bass)  
   D# minor is D#, F#, A#. The bass note is C#, so the notes are D#, F#, A#, C#.

5. **G#7/C** (G# dominant 7th with C in the bass)  
   G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#. The bass note is C (which is enharmonic to B#), so this is G#7 in third inversion. The notes are G#, B# (C), D#, F#.

### Step 2: Collect all unique notes
From all the chords, the unique notes are:
- C#, D#, E#, F, F#, G#, A#, C, Ab

Now, let's reorder these enharmonically to make sense of them (using flats for easier reading where possible):
- C, Db, D#, E (E#), F, F#, G#, A#, B# (C)

This is messy because of the enharmonic equivalents and the mixing of sharps and flats. Let's instead think in terms of the key.

### Step 3: Look for the tonic
The progression starts and ends on C#, and C# is the most frequent chord. This suggests C# is the tonic.

### Step 4: Check the mode
Now, let's see what the other chords imply about the mode. We'll assume C# is the tonic and see what scale fits.

The chords imply these scale degrees (relative to C#):
1. C# (I)
2. A#m (vi) - A# is the 6th degree of C# major scale.
3. Fm (iv) - F is the 3rd degree of C# major scale, but Fm is not diatonic to C# major (F# is the diatonic 3rd). This is a borrowed chord.
4. D#m (iii) - D# is the 3rd degree of C# major scale, but D#m is diatonic (C# major has an E# which is the 3rd of C#, but D# is the 2nd, and D#m is the ii chord in C# major... wait, no: D# is the major 2nd, so D#m is ii, but in C# major the ii chord is D#m, which is correct. But here D#m is over C#, which is the 7th (C# is the root, so this is D#m with a major 7th in the bass, which is odd).
5. G#7 (V7) - G# is the 5th degree of C# major scale, and G#7 is the dominant V7 chord, which is diatonic.

The presence of Fm (which contains an A-natural, not A#) is a clue that we're borrowing from parallel minor. In C# major, the diatonic chords are:
- I: C#
- ii: D#m
- iii: E#m (F minor enharmonically, but E#m is rare)
- IV: F#
- V: G#
- vi: A#m
- viiÂ°: B#dim

But we have Fm, which is the parallel minor's iv chord (C# minor's iv is F#m, but C# major's parallel minor is C# minor, which has F#m as iv, not Fm). Wait, no: Fm is not diatonic to C# minor either (C# minor has F#m as iv). 

This suggests we're in C# major but borrowing Fm from the parallel minor (C# minor), which is a common modal mixture. The A-natural in Fm is the b6 of C# major, which is a characteristic of the parallel minor.

### Step 5: Confirm the key and mode
The progression is:
C# (I) - A#m (vi) - Fm (borrowed iv from parallel minor) - D#m (ii) - G#7 (V7) - C# (I)

This is firmly in C# major, with a borrowed Fm from the parallel minor (C# minor). The mode is thus **C# major** (Ionian), with modal mixture.

### Final answer:
The key is **C# major** (Ionian mode), with a borrowed Fm chord from the parallel minor (C# minor).
