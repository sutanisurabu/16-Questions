### Reasoning

**Determining key and mode**

I need to analyze the chord progression sequence. It looks like "A#m/C#" indicates A# minor with C# in the bass, so I'm considering slash chords. The overall tonality seems to lean towards C# major. If I look at the C# major scale and its diatonic chords, I can confirm that I have C# major (I), D#m (ii), and A#m (vi). The other chords fit within this context too, including G#7 as the dominant.**Analyzing chord relationships**

I'm looking at the chords and determining their relationships in C# major. For instance, A#m with C# in the bass suggests it's in first inversion since A#m consists of A#, C#, and E#. But then there’s Fm, which is not diatonic to C# major—it's usually spelled with flats. I’m realizing there might be a tonal center shift here. What if the key were C# minor instead? That could change things significantly in our chords' roles, especially for Fm.**Exploring chord diatonicity**

I'm reviewing the C# natural minor scale and its diatonic chords, but the provided chords indicate C# major. So, I'm pondering if C# Mixolydian fits better. The chords might include A#m and Fm, but I notice A#m doesn't match that scale. I should check F minor, as it features Fm and chords that would connect in this context. C# major often appears in Ab major or F minor, adding layers to my exploration.**Examining Ab major chords**

I'm analyzing the Ab major scale and its diatonic chords, which are Ab, Bbm, Cm, Db, Eb7, Fm, and Gdim. The chords I've seen include C# (Db) major and A#m (Bbm), both of which fit nicely. However, I'm realizing that while G#7 could act as a dominant, it’s actually not the V chord for this key—it's Eb7. The repeated C# chords seem to suggest that C# (or Db) could be the tonic center, leading me to consider Db major as a possible key.**Finalizing key and mode analysis**

I’m concluding that the key is C# major (which is the enharmonic equivalent of Db major). The affirming chords include C#, A#m/C# (which is vi6), Fm/C (iii6), and D#m/C# (ii6) along with G#7/C (V7/6/5). The progression centers on C#, and I see a predominance of diatonic chords reinforcing this. So, I can present my findings succinctly: Key: C# major (enharmonic Db major), Mode: Ionian (major). The chords function well, leading naturally to the tonic.

Key: C# major (enharmonic to Db major)
Mode: Ionian (major)

Reason: The progression centers on C# and uses diatonic functions: A#m/C# = vi6, Fm/C = iii6, D#m/C# = ii6, and G#7/C (Ab7/C) = V6/5 resolving to I (C#).

### Reasoning

**Interpreting chord progressions**

I'm looking at a chord progression with slash chords and trying to determine the key and mode. The repeating bass note of C# might indicate a C# pedal bass, and many chords are over that bass.

The sequence includes C#, A#m/C#, Fm/C, etc. So, starting with C#, which likely indicates a major triad. A#m/C# suggests an A# minor chord with C# in the bass, which can also be seen as a Bbm/Db in first inversion. This could orient the piece in C# major.**Analyzing chord functions**

Alright, I've got Fm/C, which indicates F minor with C in the bass. This is important because the bass note is C natural, not C#. If we're looking at Db major, we remember that its scale has C natural. Fm/C acts as the v minor chord over C, fitting in Db major.

In this key, the diatonic chords include F minor as the iii chord. The second inversion of this chord places C in the bass. So, Fm/C is indeed the second inversion of the iii chord in this context!**Interpreting more chords**

Now, I see that Fm/C correctly fits in Db major because C natural is part of that key.

Moving on to D#m/C#: this indicates D# minor over a C# bass. When I consider enhancements, D# translates to Eb, meaning it’s really Ebm/Db, which is the second inversion of the ii chord. So, that checks out!

Lastly, G#7/C means G#7 over a C natural bass. Since this is enharmonically Ab7, it fits as the first inversion of the V7 chord in Db major. Nice!**Analyzing chord progression**

The progression has a mix of chords over bass notes of C# and C natural. Most slash chords sit over C#, except for Fm/C and G#7/C, which feature C natural. The D#m/C# and A#m/C# use C# bass as well. The repeating "C# C#" suggests a root position for the C# major chord. Overall, this fits within the key of Db major, where I see Db as the I chord and Bbm/Db as the vi chord in first inversion, while Ebm/Db serves as ii with Db in the bass.**Examining chord structure**

I see the Ebm chord has notes Eb, Gb, and Bb. In second inversion, Bb would be the bass tone, which leads me to consider Ebm/Db. Since Db isn't a chord tone of Ebm, it might be a polychord rather than an inversion.

For D#m/C#, this correlates with Ebm/Db. The C# acts as a pedal, while many chords toggle between C# and C. Fm/C uses C as the fifth of F minor, and G#7/C reveals the third of Ab7 in first inversion. It seems the overarching structure maintains consistency in C# major, with the bass alternating between C# and C as a tonic pedal across various chords.**Determining key and mode**

The sequence begins with the C# major chord, followed by A#m/C#, then another C#, Fm/C, D#m/C#, and ends with G#7/C. This supports the key of C# major (or enharmonically Db major) and indicates an Ionian mode, which is major.

Given the chord spellings predominantly use sharps, I would confidently choose C# major. However, it's reasonable to mention both C# major and Db major since they are enharmonically equivalent. So, I'll structure my answer like this: 

- Key: C# major (enharmonically Db major). 
- Mode: Major (Ionian). 
- Reason: The chords fit the major scale.

Key: C# major (enharmonic to Db major)
Mode: Ionian (major)

Reason: The chords outline I (C#), vi (A#m/C#), iii (Fm/C), ii (D#m/C#), and V7 (G#7/C) resolving to I, with frequent C#/C bass pedal tones.

### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequence**

I’m trying to determine the key and mode from a specific chord sequence. It appears like there's a bass pedal on C#. The chords include both C# major and A# minor over a C# bass, which makes me think we're in the key of C# major. A#m/C# functions as the vi chord in first inversion. Then there’s Fm/C, which is an F minor triad with its root notes matching the bass. This analysis helps clarify the overall harmonic structure!**Exploring key context**

So, I'm looking at the chord Fm/C over a C natural bass, which feels a bit off in a C# major context since C natural clashes with C#. I wonder if this could suggest a Roman numeral in Eb major? Then there's the D#m/C# chord, which is the ii chord in C# major. As for the G#7/C chord over C natural, it presents clashing notes, particularly the B# instead of a C. Overall, it raises questions about the harmonic context!**Clarifying chord relationships**

I'm analyzing the chords I've seen: C# major (C# E# G#), A# minor (A# C# E#), D# minor (D# F# A#), and G#7 (G# B# D# F#). Those correspond nicely to the Roman numerals I, vi, ii, and V7 in C# major. However, the presence of Fm/C creates some confusion since F minor isn't diatonic to C# major. I wonder if they may have meant E# minor/C#, which would fit better as the iii chord when adjusted for enharmonics.**Investigating bass and chords**

I'm diving into the specifics of the E# minor in first and second inversions, noting that E#m/C# seems non-standard since it has G# or B# in the bass instead. I wonder if Fm/C might actually represent Fm/C# but just missed the sharp. However, the usage of C natural in other chords makes me question if they were using it as shorthand. This is a bit puzzling, as I usually see C# being used. I should also evaluate the possibility of a different key context!**Determining key and mode**

I'm working to figure out the key and mode based on the chords in the sequence, which primarily centers around C# major. The bass alternates between C# and C natural, implying a neighbor tone approach. The chords establish a strong relationship with C# major, including the diatonic vi (A# minor), ii (D# minor), and V7 (G#7). While there could be some argument for Db major due to enharmonics, I'll conclude confidently that the key is C# major in the Ionian mode. Key: C# major (Ionian).

C# major (Ionian).

### Key and Mode Analysis

- **Key**: C# major  
- **Mode**: Ionian (major mode)  

#### Explanation
This chord progression is diatonic to the C# major scale (C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#). Here's a breakdown:

- **Chords and Roman Numerals** (ignoring bass notes for core harmony, but slashes indicate pedal-like bass on C# for color):
  - C# = I (tonic)
  - A#m/C# = vi (A# minor over C# bass)
  - Fm/C = iii (F minor over C# bass; enharmonically E# minor in C# major)
  - D#m/C# = ii (D# minor over C# bass)
  - G#7/C = V7 (G# dominant 7th over C# bass)

- **Why C# major?**
  - All root chords (C#, A#m, Fm, D#m, G#7) fit perfectly as I, ii, iii, vi, and V7 in C# major.
  - No accidentals or borrowed chords from parallel modes (e.g., no flats suggesting C# minor or other keys like A# minor).
  - The frequent C# bass creates a pedal point on the tonic, common in major-key contexts for resolution and stability.
  - This structure resembles jazz standards or pop ballads (e.g., pedal-tonic variations), reinforcing the major tonality.

- **Why Ionian mode?**
  - Ionian is the "natural" major scale mode, matching the diatonic harmony here (full major scale without modal alterations like Dorian's ♭3 or Mixolydian's ♭7 beyond the V7, which is standard).

If this is from a specific song or you have more context (e.g., melody), it could refine the analysis further!

### Key and Mode Analysis

#### Overall Key: **C# Major**
- This progression strongly centers on **C# major** as the tonal center. The repeated C# major chords act as a tonic pedal (all chords share a C# bass note, creating a "pedal point" effect that reinforces C# as home base).
- The harmony resolves repeatedly to C#, and there's no strong pull toward another root. The presence of G#7/C# at the end functions as a V7 chord (dominant) leading back to the tonic C#, which is a classic cadence in major keys.

#### Mode: **Ionian (Major)**
- The mode is **major (Ionian)**, based on the diatonic framework of the C# major scale: **C# D# E# F# G# A# B#**.
  - Most chords fit diatonically:
    - **C# major**: I (tonic).
    - **A#m**: vi (submediant, common in major keys for color).
    - **D#m**: ii (supertonic).
    - **G#7**: V7 (dominant seventh, resolving to I).
  - The progression has a bright, resolved feel typical of major mode, without the darker or more ambiguous tensions of minor modes (e.g., no prominent b3, b6, or b7 scale degrees driving the harmony downward).
- **Fm** is the outlier—it's not fully diatonic to C# major (F major would be IV, but Fm lowers the root to F natural). This is likely a **borrowed chord** (modal mixture) from the parallel minor (C# minor) or C# Mixolydian, adding brief tension or color. It doesn't shift the overall mode or key, as the progression quickly returns to major harmony.

#### Functional Breakdown
Here's the progression with Roman numeral analysis (in C# major, ignoring the /C# bass for function but noting its stabilizing pedal effect):

- C# C# | A#m/C# A#m/C# | C# C# | Fm/C D#m/C# | C# C# | A#m/C# A#m/C# | C# C# | G#7/C C#
  - I I | vi/vi vi/vi | I I | (borrowed iv?)/I ii/I | I I | vi/vi vi/vi | I I | V7/I I

This creates a looping, vamp-like structure (common in pop/rock/jazz), building tension with vi and V7 before resolving to I. The constant C# bass keeps it grounded in major tonality.

If this is from a specific song or genre, more context could refine this (e.g., melody notes might confirm), but based on harmony alone, C# major/Ionian fits best. If you have the melody or more details, I can reassess!

### Reasoning

**Examining Chord Relationships**

I'm currently focused on the initial inventory, cataloging the distinct chords within the progression. Identifying the specific harmonic components is the primary step, allowing for a structured analysis. So far, C# and A#m/C# have been isolated; further examination is required to determine the remaining components.


**Confirming Tonic and Key**

I've confirmed the C# major tonality, as the initial tonic and frequency of the C# chord make it apparent. I've begun to cross-reference the other chords present with the key of C# major. I'm now looking at building a scale to map the corresponding diatonic chords, with emphasis on the relationship between them.


**Decoding Diatonic Functions**

I'm presently translating the chords into the Db major key to establish their function within the scale. The C# chord converts neatly to Db (I). I'm carefully evaluating the Bbm (vi), and Fm chords in relation to the Db major key, making note of their relationships to establish their specific roles in the progression.


**Synthesizing Findings and Analysis**

I've successfully translated the chord progression into Db major, confirming the key signature. All chords align perfectly, functioning diatonically, with no modulations or alterations found. The V7-I cadence is the most effective confirmation of the tonality. Further analysis will concentrate on the role of the slash chords in bass movement and the overall progression's harmonic narrative.


**Investigating Harmonic Framework**

I am now focusing on the harmonic functions of the slash chords. Examining the role of the C and C# bass notes, I'm analyzing the tension and release they create. Specifically, the relationship of each slash chord to the tonic in C# major and how the inversions add to the overall narrative.


**Concluding Analysis and Synthesis**

I'm synthesizing the entire process now. I'm articulating the progression as C# major, with its enharmonic key of Db major as a practical consideration. The chords function diatonically. Analyzing the functions of the slash chords in bass movement confirms the stability and tension-release the progression leverages, particularly the V7-I cadence. My final answer is almost ready.




Based on the analysis of the chord progression, the key and mode are:

*   **Key:** **C#**
*   **Mode:** **Major**

---

### **Analysis and Explanation**

1.  **Tonic Center (The "Home" Chord):** The progression begins and ends on **C# Major**. It also returns to C# frequently throughout the sequence. This strong presence establishes C# as the tonic, or the tonal center of the music.

2.  **Chord Functions (Roman Numeral Analysis):** When we analyze the chords in the context of the C# Major scale (C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#), they all fit perfectly.

Let's break down each chord:

*   **C#** (Notes: C#-F-G#) is the **I** chord, the tonic.
*   **A#m** (Notes: A#-C#-F) is the **vi** chord. It is the relative minor of C# Major.
*   **Fm**: This one is slightly tricky. In the key of C# Major, the third degree is E#. F is a half-step higher. However, looking at the notes (F-G#-C), it functions as the **iii** chord (E#m) with one altered note. *Alternatively, and more likely*, this progression is thought of in its simpler enharmonic key, **Db Major**.
*   **D#m** (Notes: D#-F#-A#) is the **ii** chord.
*   **G#7** (Notes: G#-C-D#-F#) is the **V7** chord, the dominant seventh. The most important function of the V7 chord is to create strong tension that resolves back to the I chord. The final `G#7/C -> C#` is a classic dominant-to-tonic cadence, which powerfully confirms C# as the key.

3.  **Analysis in the Enharmonic Key (Db Major):**
    For ease of reading (5 flats vs. 7 sharps), musicians often think of C# Major as Db Major. The analysis is identical:

    *   **Db Major Scale:** Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C
    *   **C#** becomes **Db** (the **I** chord)
    *   **A#m** becomes **Bbm** (the **vi** chord)
    *   **Fm** is the **iii** chord
    *   **D#m** becomes **Ebm** (the **ii** chord)
    *   **G#7** becomes **Ab7** (the **V7** or dominant chord)

4.  **The Role of the Slash Chords (Inversions):**
    *   **A#m/C#** and **D#m/C#**: These chords place the tonic note C# in the bass while the harmony changes above it. This is a common technique called a "tonic pedal," which reinforces the feeling of C# being the root of the key.
    *   **Fm/C** and **G#7/C**: These chords place the note **C** in the bass. In the key of C# Major, the note C is the leading tone (B#). Placing the leading tone in the bass, especially under the V7 chord, creates an even stronger pull towards the tonic (C#).

In summary, every chord has a clear diatonic function within the key of C# Major, and the progression uses the strongest harmonic devices (like the V7-I cadence and tonic pedal) to firmly establish it.

### Reasoning

Okay, I need to figure out the key and mode for this chord progression in C#: C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#. Let me start by writing out all the chords clearly. The progression repeats sections, so I'll list them in order:

C# | C# | A#m/C# | A#m/C# | C# | C# | Fm/C | D#m/C# | C# | C# | A#m/C# | A#m/C# | C# | C# | G#7/C | C#.

Hmm, the notation uses some slash chords like A#m/C# and Fm/C. That means the bass note is specified. For example, A#m/C# is an A# minor chord with C# in the bass. Similarly, Fm/C is an F minor chord with C as the bass note. And D#m/C# is D# minor with C# bass. G#7/C is G# dominant seventh with C bass.

First, I should convert all these chords to their root notes to understand the harmonic foundation. Let's see:

- C# is just C# major (root: C#)
- A#m/C#: chord is A# minor, but bass is C#. So the chord is A#m (A#, C#, E#) but played with C# as the lowest note. Since C# is the third of A#m (because A# to C# is a minor third), this is a first inversion chord. But the harmonic function still relates to A# minor.
- Fm/C: F minor chord (F, Ab, Cb) with C bass. Wait, F minor is F, Ab, C (since minor triad is root, minor third, perfect fifth; Ab is the minor third, and C is the fifth). But in the key of C# major, which has many sharps, maybe it's better to think in terms of enharmonic equivalents. Wait, C# major scale has C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#. Wait, E# is F natural, B# is C natural? No, wait: C# major scale: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, C#. Wait no, standard major scale: 1 C#, 2 D#, 3 E#, 4 F#, 5 G#, 6 A#, 7 B#. So yes, E# is F natural, B# is C natural. But sometimes in chord symbols, they use flats for minor chords. Let me check the chords again.

A#m is A# (root), C# (minor third), E# (fifth, which is F natural). So A#m/C# is A# minor in first inversion.

Fm/C: F minor chord. F minor is F, Ab, C. But wait, in the context of C# major, which has G# and A# and so on, F# is in the key, but F natural would be a lowered fourth? Wait, maybe this key isn't C# major. Let's see.

But the progression starts and ends on C#, so maybe C# is the tonic. But let's list all the roots considering the slash chords:

Wait, slash chords indicate the bass note, but the chord itself is named after the root. So A#m/C# is an A# minor chord (root A#) with C# in the bass. So the chord root is A#, but the bass is C#. Similarly, Fm/C is F minor chord (root F) with C bass. D#m/C# is D# minor (root D#) with C# bass. G#7/C is G# dominant seventh (root G#) with C bass.

So let's list all chord roots ignoring the bass for a moment:

Original progression chords with roots:

C#, C#, A#m, A#m, C#, C#, Fm, D#m, C#, C#, A#m, A#m, C#, C#, G#7, C#.

Now, let's list the roots: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

Wait, F here is F natural, since Fm is F minor. Similarly, D#m is D# minor (D#, F#, A#), G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#.

But let's note all the roots: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

Now, considering the key, we need to see which key these chords fit into. Since many chords are in the sharp keys, but F natural is a problem because C# major has F# (fourth degree), not F natural. So maybe the key is B major? Wait, C# is the second degree of B major. Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Wait, listing all the roots: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

Let me convert these to enharmonic equivalents to see if that helps:

A# is same as Bb, but in a sharp key context, maybe better to keep as A#.

F is F natural.

D# is enharmonic to Eb.

G# is enharmonic to Ab.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the key is C# minor? Because minor keys often have more flats or lowered notes.

Wait, C# natural minor scale is C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B. So notes: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B.

Check the roots:

C# is tonic.

A# (which would be the major VII in C# minor? Wait, natural minor has diatonic chords: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII.

Wait, C# natural minor: i = C#m, ii° = D#°, III = E, iv = F#m, v = G#m, VI = A, VII = B.

But in our progression, the chords are major C#, A#m, Fm, D#m, G#7.

Hmm, C# is major here, which is not the i chord in natural minor—it's minor. So if the tonic chord is C# major, then it's a major key.

Wait, but in the progression, the first chord is C# (major), so likely C# is the I chord. Let's see what key has C# as the I.

C# major scale: C# D# E# F# G# A# B# C#

But E# is F natural, B# is C natural.

So diatonic chords in C# major:

I: C# major (C#, E#, G#)

ii: D# minor (D#, F#, A#)

iii: E# minor (E#, G#, B#) which is F minor? Wait, E# is F, B# is C. So E# minor chord would be E#, G#, B# → F, A, C. Which is F major? Wait, no: minor chord is root, minor third, fifth. E# minor: E# to G# is minor third (E#-F-F#-G, so minor third is 3 semitones: E# to G# is D# to F#? Wait, better to count semitones.

E# is F. Minor third up from F is Ab (F, F#, G, Ab). So minor chord would be F, Ab, C. Which is F minor. Hmm, getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of chord roots and see which key they belong to.

Our chord roots are: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

Let's list the notes in C# major:

C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B# → which is C#, D#, F, F#, G#, A#, C.

Wait, E# is F natural, B# is C natural.

So in C# major, the diatonic chords would have roots: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#.

But our progression uses A# (which is diatonic as the sixth degree), F natural (which is E# in C# major, so same note), D# (second degree), G# (fifth degree). Wait, F natural is E#, which is the third degree in C# major. So Fm here would be a chord built on the third degree but as minor? Wait, in major keys, the iii chord is minor.

Wait, in C# major:

I: C# (C#, E#, G#)

ii: D#m (D#, F#, A#)

iii: E#m (E#, G#, B#) → which is F minor (F, A, C)? Wait, no:

E# is F, G# is G#, B# is C.

So E# minor chord: root E# (F), minor third would be G (since minor third is 3 semitones: F → F#, G, Ab? Wait, minor third from F is Ab. So minor triad on F is F-Ab-C. So chord on E# (F) as minor would be F-Ab-C, which is F minor. Therefore, E#m is enharmonically equivalent to F minor. So iii chord in C# major is E# minor, which is written as F minor for simplicity? Maybe, but typically in C# major they would use E#.

But in our progression, we have Fm, which would correspond to the iii chord in C# major, but as a minor chord—which it is, since iii is minor in major keys.

Wait, so in C# major:

- I: C# major

- ii: D# minor

- iii: E# minor (F minor)

- IV: F# major

- V: G# major

- vi: A# minor

- vii°: B# diminished

So our progression has C# (I), A#m (vi), Fm (iii), D#m (ii), G#7 (V7).

Yes! G#7 is the dominant seventh in C# major, since V is G# major, so V7 would be G# dominant seventh (G#, B#, D#, F#).

Wait, G#7 chord is G#, B#, D#, F#. Which matches.

Similarly:

- A#m is vi in C# major.

- Fm is iii (since E#m = Fm)

- D#m is ii

- G#7 is V7

Perfect! So all the chords are diatonic to C# major, except... wait, Fm is iii, which is diatonic minor chord. Yes, in major keys, iii is minor.

Wait, but in the progression, we have Fm/C. So F minor chord with C bass. The root is F, which is the iii, so chord is iii.

Similarly, D#m/C# is D# minor (ii) with C# bass (which is the tonic note), so first inversion ii.

A#m/C# is vi with C# bass (tonic), so first inversion vi.

G#7/C is G# dominant seventh (V7) with C bass (the leading tone B# is C natural, so C is the seventh of the G#7 chord? Wait, G#7: G#, B#, D#, F#. The notes are G#, A## (B#), C## (D#), E#. Wait, no: dominant seventh chord is major triad plus minor seventh. So G# major triad (G#, B#, D#) plus minor seventh which is F#. Wait, minor seventh above G# is F#. Yes. So G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#.

Wait, but G# to F#: G# to F## is major seventh (since G# to F# is major seventh down, but up it's minor seventh). Wait, semitones: G# to A#=1, B=2, C=3, C#=4, D=5, D#=6, E=7, F=8, F#=9. Wait, no:

From G#:

G# to A: 1 semitone

A to A#: 2

A# to B: 3

B to C: 4

C to C#:5

C# to D:6

D to D#:7

D# to E:8

E to F:9

F to F#:10

Wait, actually, the minor seventh interval is 10 semitones. G# + 10 semitones: G# → A (1), A# (2), B (3), C (4), C# (5), D (6), D# (7), E (8), F (9), F# (10). Yes, so minor seventh above G# is F#. Therefore, G#7 chord is G#, B#, D#, F#.

But in the slash chord G#7/C, the bass note is C. So the note C natural (which is B#) would be the third of G#7 chord. Wait, B# is the major third of G# (since G# to B# is a major third: 4 semitones: G#-A-A#-B-B#, yes). So G#7 has notes G#, B#, D#, F#. So C natural is B# enharmonically. So in the key of C# major, B# is the leading tone.

So G#7/C means G# dominant seventh with C (B#) in the bass. That would be the third of the chord, so first inversion? Wait, G#7 in root position is G# bass. First inversion would be B# bass. But here it's C bass, which is B#, so yes, it's first inversion G#7.

But regardless of inversion, the chord is V7.

So compiling this:

Chord roots corresponding to C# major scale degrees:

- C# : I

- A#m : vi

- Fm (E#m) : iii

- D#m : ii

- G#7 : V7

All diatonic chords in C# major. So the key should be C# major.

Wait, but let's confirm:

In C# major:

I = C# (C#, E#, G#)

ii = D#m (D#, F#, A#)

iii = E#m (E#, G#, B#) → which is Fm (F, A, C) enharmonically. Since E#=F, G#=G#, B#=C.

So E# minor chord is E#, G#, B# → F, A, C → F minor. Yes, exactly. So Fm is the iii chord.

Similarly, A#m is the vi chord.

D#m is ii.

G#7 is V7 (with F# as the minor seventh).

So all chords fit perfectly in C# major.

Now, checking the progression:

C# (I) repeated twice,

A#m (vi) twice,

C# (I) twice,

Fm (iii) once [but chord is Fm/C],

D#m (ii) once [D#m/C#],

C# (I) repeated twice,

A#m (vi) twice,

C# (I) twice,

G#7 (V7) [G#7/C] once,

C# (I) to end.

Yes, so the progression uses I, vi, I, iii, ii, I, vi, I, V7, I.

This is a very common chord progression in pop music, often called the "pop-punk progression" or variation of I-V-vi-IV but here it's I-vi-I-iii-ii-I-vi-I-V-I.

Wait, but the specific sequence here seems like it's grouping: I, I, vi, vi, I, I, iii, ii, I, I, vi, vi, I, I, V7, I.

So repeating sections.

Given that all chords fit C# major, and the tonic chord C# is the home base, starting and ending there, the key should be C# major.

Now, about the mode. Since it's a major key, the mode is Ionian (which is the same as major scale). Unless there's some modal mixture, but given all chords are diatonic to C# major, it's straightforward major key.

Wait, but let's double-check if it could be another mode. For example, if the progression centers on A#m, but no, it starts and ends on C# and has V7 (G#7) which strongly points to C# as tonic.

The V7-I is a strong authentic cadence, so G#7 resolving to C# confirms C# as tonic.

Therefore, the key is C# major, mode is Ionian (which is the default major mode).

Wait, but let's check the chord Fm/C. Fm is iii chord. In the progression, after two C# chords, it goes to Fm/C. So iii. Then D#m/C# which is ii. Then back to C#. So iii-ii-I, which is a common cadence.

Similarly, vi-IV-iii etc., but in this case, it's fitting C# major.

Another check: the leading tone in C# major is B#, which is C natural. The G#7 chord contains B# (as the third), which resolves to C#. But since the progression ends with G#7/C resolving to C#, yes, that's a V7-I cadence. Even though the bass is C (B#), the chord is still functioning as V7.

Therefore, all evidence points to C# major.

Just to make sure there isn't a minor key here. If it were C# minor, the chords would be different. C# harmonic minor would have E natural (instead of E#), and the V chord would be G# major (since in harmonic minor, the 5th is raised). But here, we have Fm which would be the iv chord in C# minor natural? Wait:

C# natural minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B.

So chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#°

III: E

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A

VII: B

But in our progression, we have C# major (not minor), so it's not C# natural minor.

C# harmonic minor: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#

Chords would have V as G# major (since B# is leading tone), but still the chords present don't match as well. Our progression has a major I chord, which in minor keys is not the case unless it's a Picardy third, but here the entire progression is in major.

So definitely the key is C# major.

Thus, Key: C# major, Mode: Ionian.


The chord progression you provided consists of the following chords (simplified by chord root, ignoring inversions):

**C# | C# | A#m | A#m | C# | C# | Fm | D#m | C# | C# | A#m | A#m | C# | C# | G#7 | C#**

---

### **Step 1: Identify Chord Roots**
- **C#** — I (tonic)  
- **A#m** — vi  
- **Fm** — iii (enharmonically equivalent to E#m in C# major)  
- **D#m** — ii  
- **G#7** — V7  

All these chords align perfectly with the **diatonic harmony of C# major**, as follows:

| Scale Degree | Chord Type | Notes in C# Major | Enharmonic Equivalent |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| I            | C# major   | C#, E#, G#         | —                      |
| ii           | D# minor   | D#, F#, A#         | —                      |
| iii          | E# minor   | E#, G#, B#         | Fm (F, A, C)           |
| V7           | G#7        | G#, B#, D#, F#     | —                      |
| vi           | A# minor   | A#, C#, E#         | —                      |

---

### **Step 2: Confirm Tonic and Key**
- The progression **starts and ends on C#**, reinforcing it as the tonic.
- The **G#7 chord (V7)** resolves strongly to C# (I), forming a classic **authentic cadence**, which is definitive of a major key.
- All chords are **diatonic to C# major**, with no chromatic alterations or borrowed chords.

---

### **Step 3: Determine Mode**
- Since the progression uses the **standard major scale harmonization** (I, ii, iii, V7, vi), the mode is **Ionian** (the major scale mode).
- There is no evidence of modal mixture (e.g., borrowing chords from parallel minor), as all chords are native to C# major.

---

### **Final Determination**
- **Key**: **C# major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (the natural major scale)  

This progression is harmonically grounded in **C# Ionian**, with all chords functioning as expected in a major key context, including a strong V7-I cadence confirming C# as the tonic. 🎶

**Assistant - Qwen3 235B 2507**

Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

**Chords:**

```
C#  C#  A#m/C#  A#m/C#  
C#  C#  Fm/C   D#m/C#  
C#  C#  A#m/C#  A#m/C#  
C#  C#  G#7/C  C#
```

We can simplify this by focusing on the **chord roots** and their function, ignoring the slash bass notes for now (like `/C#`), since they may just indicate inversions or pedal tones.

So stripping out just the **main chords**, we have:

```
C#   - C#
A#m  - A#m
C#   - C#
Fm   - D#m
C#   - C#
A#m  - A#m
C#   - C#
G#7  - C#
```

Wait — **Fm** and **D#m** are enharmonic (same pitch, different name). But in the context of **C#**, we should use **enharmonic consistency**.

Let’s write all chords in proper **C# key context**.

---

### Step 1: Enharmonic Spelling

The key of **C# major** has 7 sharps:  
**C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#** — very messy.

Alternatively, **D♭ major** (5 flats) is the enharmonic equivalent and much easier to work with.

But your chords use **C#**, so we’ll stick with **C#**.

Let’s rewrite some chords with enharmonic equivalents for clarity:

- **Fm** — F is not in C# major. F natural is a flat 5 (♭5) in C#.
  - F = E# enharmonically? No — E# is **C#’s major 7th**, but F natural is actually **E# lowered** → that’s **F**, which is **♭5** of C#.
- So **Fm** = **♭V** in C# — this is very unusual in a diatonic context.

But wait — **F minor** has notes: **F, Ab, C**
- In C# context:
  - F = **♭5**
  - Ab = C#’s **♭♭7** (or **6th below**) → very chromatic
  - Could be borrowed? Possible, but suspicious.

Likewise:
- **D#m** = D#, F#, C# → that’s **ii chord in C# major**
  - Yes! D# minor is the **supertonic** in C# major.

Wait — so earlier chord was written as **Fm/C**, but maybe it's meant to be **D#m/C#** as written later?

Looking back:

Sequence:  
`C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C#`  
`C# C# Fm/C D#m/C#`

Ah — two different chords: **Fm/C** and **D#m/C#**

But:
- **Fm** = F, Ab, C
- **D#m** = D#, F#, A#
- These are **different chords**

But are they **enharmonically similar**?
- F ≈ E#
- Ab ≈ G#
- C ≈ C

But **F ≠ D#** — D# is **E♭**, and **F** is a half step above.

So **Fm** and **D#m** are **not the same** — they are a half-step apart.

So either:
- Typo? Or
- Intentional chromaticism?

Also: **G#7** — that's G#, B#, D#, F# — which is the **dominant (V7)** of **C# major**:
- G# is the 5th of C#, so G#7 = **V7 chord** in C# → resolves to C# tonic.

That’s a strong clue.

Now: **A#m** — A# is the **vi chord** in C# major:
- C# major: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#
- vi = A# minor — yes, that’s diatonic.

So:
- C# = **I**
- A#m = **vi**
- D#m = **ii**
- G#7 = **V7**

These are all **diatonic to C# major**.

But then we have **Fm/C** — that's problematic.

**Fm/C**:
- F = ♭5 of C#
- Ab = ♭♭7 → very chromatic
- C = ♮5? No — C natural is **♭7** of C#, not in key.

But C# major uses **B#**, not C.

Wait — **C natural** is **♭7** of C# — that’s from **mixolydian mode**, or blues.

But Fm with C in bass — could this be a **bVII** chord?

Hold on — is it possible the **Fm/C** is a typo and meant to be **E#m/C#** or **F#m/C#**?

Alternatively, perhaps **Fm** is meant to be **E#dim**?

No — F minor isn't E# anything.

Wait — another idea: could **Fm** actually be intended as **F#m**?

Because:
- F# minor = F#, A, C#
- Notes in key of C# major? Yes:
  - F# = **IV**
  - A = enharmonic of G##? No — A is **major 6th**, and **A natural** is **♭6** in C# — C# major has **A#**, not A.

So A natural is **♭6**, not in key.

So **F#m** would be **IVm**, not diatonic — could be borrowed from **C# minor**.

But wait: D#m is **ii**, which is in C# major.

Then we have **G#7** — which confirms **C#** as tonic, because V7 → I movement is strong.

And we end on **C#**, with G#7 going to C#.

So:
- **Tonic**: C#
- V7: G#7 → C#
- vi: A#m
- ii: D#m

That’s all **C# major**.

Now only problem: **Fm/C**

Possibility: typo — did you mean **F#m/C#**?

Because:
- F#m/C# = F#, A, C# over C# bass → C# F# A C# → that’s C# minor 7th flat 5? No — C# F# A = C#m6 or something.

Wait — F#m chord: F#, A, C#
- C# + F# + A = **C# m(add b6)**? Not standard.

Alternatively: **B chord**? IV chord is F# major in C# major.

Wait — **F# major** is IV chord in C# major:
- F#, A#, C#
- All in key.

But you wrote **Fm**, which is **F#, Ab, C** — Ab = G#, which is **enharmonic to A♭**, not A#.

So **Fm** = F, Ab, C → not in key.

But if it were **F#m**, that’s still not diatonic.

Unless it's **F# major** — that would make sense.

But written as **Fm**.

Another idea: perhaps **Fm** is meant to be **Em?** No.

Wait — let’s look at the bass note: **Fm/C**

So bass is **C**, not **C#**.

C natural?

But earlier chords have **C#** in bass (A#m/C#, etc.)

So this is a **C natural** bass under **F minor**.

Fm/C = C, F, Ab — **C minor 6th?** Or **Fm in first inversion**.

But what is this chord doing in C#?

C natural = **♭7 of C#** — that’s **7th degree of C# mixolydian mode**

And F = **♭3 of D#**, but maybe not helpful.

Alternatively — could this progression be in **C# mixolydian**?

C# mixolydian has: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B
- So **♭7** = B natural, not C.

Wait — C natural is **♭♭7** — not in any major mode.

Wait — this is confusing.

Let’s re-evaluate the entire progression with enharmonic equivalents.

---

### Enharmonic Rewrite: Use D♭ instead of C#

C# = D♭  
D# = E♭  
E# = F  
F# = G♭  
G# = A♭  
A# = B♭  
B# = C

So rewrite chords:

- C# → D♭
- A#m → B♭m
- D#m → E♭m
- G#7 → A♭7
- Fm → Fm (same)

Now progression:

```
D♭  D♭  B♭m/Db  B♭m/Db  
D♭  D♭  Fm/Db  Ebm/Db  
D♭  D♭  B♭m/Db  B♭m/Db  
D♭  D♭  Ab7/Db  D♭
```

Now check:
- D♭ major key: D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C

So:
- D♭ = I
- B♭m = vi
- E♭m = ii
- A♭7 = V7 (since A♭ is V of D♭)
- Fm = F, Ab, Cb? No — Fm is F, Ab, C

But in D♭, **F natural** is **major 3rd**, not minor.

F minor has **Ab**, which is ♭3 — okay, but **F** is **III**, but F minor is not diatonic.

D♭ major has **F major**, not F minor.

So Fm = **bIII** in D♭ — could be a **borrowed chord from D♭ minor**.

Ah! That’s possible.

So in **D♭ major**, borrowing **Fm** (which is **III** in D♭ minor), this is a **modal interchange** chord.

So:
- D♭ (I)
- B♭m (vi)
- E♭m (ii)
- A♭7 (V7)
- Fm → **♭III** borrowed from **D♭ minor**

This is common in jazz or pop — using **♭III** major (though this is minor — F minor, not F major)

Wait — Fm is **F Ab C**

But **F natural** is the **mediant** in D♭ major — so **F minor** is chromatically altering the **III** from major to minor — but III is already **F major** in D♭, so making it **minor** is not standard.

But:
- Fm = iv chord in **C minor**? Not helpful.

Alternatively — perhaps the chord is not Fm but **Ebm**?

Wait, in the original, after Fm/C, you have **D#m/C#**

D#m = D#, F#, A#

In C# context, that’s **ii chord** — perfectly diatonic.

And Fm is **not**.

Possibility: **typo** — did you mean **F#m/C#**?

F#m = F#, A, C#
- A is **♭6** in C# major — not diatonic.

Or **G#m?** G#m = G#, B, D# — B is not in C# major (C is), so no.

Wait — back to **Fm/C**: could this be **Gb minor / Db**?

Same thing.

But here’s a better idea:

In **C# major**, the **iv chord** would be **F# minor**, but you have **Fm**, which is **enharmonic to E# diminished?** No.

Wait — perhaps the **F** is a typo for **F#**.

That would make sense: **F#m/C#** = common chord in C# major? No — F#m is **iv**, not diatonic, but could be borrowed.

Wait — in **C# major**, natural diatonic chord on IV is **F# major**, not minor.

So **F#m = iv** — borrowed from **C# minor** — very common.

So if the chord is meant to be **F#m/C#**, that fits as a **borrowed iv** chord from parallel minor.

But you wrote **Fm/C**

Is **Fm** a misprint for **F#m**?

Because:
- Fm and F#m are very close in letter.
- C and C# in bass — maybe typo on bass too.

Otherwise, **Fm/C** in C# key is very chromatic.

Alternatively, could this be a **Neapolitan chord**?

In C# major, the Neapolitan is **D# major**, not F.

No.

Another possibility: **Tritone substitution**?

G#7 is V7.

Its tritone sub is D7 (since G#7 = G#, B#, D#, F#), tritone = B#, F# → sub would be D7 = D, F#, A, C

But you have Fm — not related.

No.

Let’s look at the **bass line**:

From the slash notation:
- A#m/C# → bass C#
- Fm/C → bass C natural
- D#m/C# → bass C#
- G#7/C → bass C natural

So bass alternates: C#, C, C#, C, ...

So a **pedal tone of C/C#**? Or chromatic movement?

C natural to C# is a half-step.

But in key of C#, C natural = ♭7, C# = 1.

Could be **bluesy**.

But let’s suppose the **Fm/C** is intentional.

Fm/C = C, F, Ab

C = ♭7 of C#
F = ♭3 of D, but in C# — F = ♭5
Ab = C#’s **♭♭7** = enharmonic to G#, which is **7th degree**? No — G# is leading tone.

Ab = G#, which is **B# enharmonic?** No.

G# is **leading tone of C#**, so **Ab = G#** = **major 7th of A**, but here not helpful.

F = **♭5**, Ab = **♭♭7**, C = **♭7**

So Fm/C = C F Ab — that’s **C half-diminished?** C Eb Gb Bb — no, this has **Ab**, not Eb.

Fm = F, Ab, C — so Fm/C = C, F, Ab → **C minor 6th**? C Eb G A — no, we have F and Ab.

C F Ab — intervals:
- C to F = P4
- C to Ab = m6
- F to Ab = m3

So it’s a **sus4 add6**? Not functional.

Alternatively, an **inversion of Fm**: Fm/C = **first inversion**, Fm6?

Fm6 = F, Ab, C, D — but only three notes.

So likely just **F minor in first inversion**.

But in key of **C#**, this is very chromatic.

Best guess: **the chord is meant to be D#m/C#**, and "Fm/C" is a typo.

Because:
- The second chord in that line is **D#m/C#**
- Maybe both are D#m/C#? But you wrote Fm/C and D#m/C#

But let’s count:
Line: C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C#
Then: C# C# Fm/C D#m/C#

So after two C# chords, then Fm/C, then D#m/C#

If you meant **D#m/C#** twice, why write Fm?

Alternatively, perhaps the chord is **Em?** No.

Wait — another idea: **F#m** typed as **Fm** — missing the #.

That’s common.

So **F#m/C#** instead of **Fm/C**

F#m = F#, A, C#
- In C# major, A natural is ♭6 (A# is natural), so chromatic.

But **iv chord** borrowed from **C# minor** — very common in pop, rock, jazz.

So progression would be:

- C# (I)
- A#m (vi)
- F#m (iv, borrowed)
- D#m (ii)
- G#7 (V7)
- C# (I)

This makes perfect sense.

**Chord progression: I - vi - IVm - ii - V7 - I**

Very common variation.

The **iv** (minor subdominant) is a classic borrowing from minor.

So likely, **Fm** is a typo for **F#m/C#**

And **G#7/C** — C natural? Should be C#? Or bass just chromatically walking?

But you wrote **C**, not **C#**

**G#7/C** = C, G#, B#, D#, F#

C = ♭7 of C#, so it’s a **G#7 with flat 7 in bass** — possible, but unstable.

More likely meant to be **G#7/C#** — root position or third inversion.

So probably typo.

---

### Final Analysis

Best interpretation:

- Key: **C# major**
- Mode: **Ionian (major)**
- Chords:
  - C# = I
  - A#m = vi
  - F#m = iv (borrowed from C# minor)
  - D#m = ii
  - G#7 = V7
  - C# = I

Progression: **I - vi - iv - ii - V7 - I**  
Very common in contemporary music.

The **Fm/C** is likely a typo for **F#m/C#**, and **G#7/C** likely meant to be **G#7/C#** or just G#7.

---

### ✅ Verdict:

- **Key**: C# major  
- **Mode**: Major (Ionian)  
- Notes: This assumes "Fm" was intended to be **F#m** — otherwise, it's highly chromatic and suggests a different tonal center or mode. But given the rest of the progression, C# major is clear.

If **Fm** is intentional, key might be **C# mixolydian** or **blues**, but Fm doesn't fit. More likely typo.

**Final Answer**:  
👉 **Key: C# major**  
👉 **Mode: Ionian**

### Reasoning

Okay, the user provided a chord progression: C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#. They want me to determine the key and mode. Let me figure this out step by step.

First, I need to look at the chords and see if there's a pattern or a tonic chord that feels like the home base. The progression starts and ends with C#, so maybe the key center is C#. But I should check the chords in detail.

Let me list out all the chords mentioned: C#, C#, A#m/C#, A#m/C#, C#, C#, Fm/C, D#m/C#, C#, C#, A#m/C#, A#m/C#, C#, C#, G#7/C, C#.

Wait, the notation includes slash chords. For example, A#m/C# means an A# minor chord with C# in the bass. Similarly, Fm/C is F minor with C in the bass? Wait, but the bass note is specified after the slash. Let's parse each chord:

- C#: This is a C# major chord? Or is it just C# as in root note? But in chord notation, usually "C#" alone means C# major, unless specified otherwise. But sometimes people might just write the root note, but in context, it's probably chords.

Wait, let's see: A#m/C# - that's A# minor triad with C# as the bass note. Since A# minor is A# C# E#, so putting C# in bass makes it a first inversion chord.

Similarly, Fm/C: F minor with C in bass. But F minor is F Ab C, so with C in bass, it's a third inversion?

D#m/C#: D# minor is D# F# A#, so with C# in bass? Wait, D#m/C# would be D# minor triad over C# bass. But D#m triad is D# F# A#, so the notes are D#, F#, A#, and adding C# would make it D#m7 or something? Wait, no. Slash chord notation: the note after the slash is the bass note. So D#m/C# means a D# minor chord with C# in the bass. So the chord is D# F# A# with C# as the lowest note. So the actual notes would be C#, D#, F#, A#? Because bass is C# followed by D#, F#, A#.

Wait, but in the progression, there's also Fm/C. F minor chord is F Ab C, so with C in bass, so the notes are C, F, Ab. But wait, if the bass is C, then Fm/C would be F minor in first inversion? Wait, no: Fm/C means the chord is F minor, but the bass note is C. So the chord includes F, Ab, C, but the lowest note is C. So it's Fm in second inversion (since the fifth is in the bass). Because Fm's notes are F Ab C, so C is the fifth. So yes, second inversion of Fm.

But back to the key. Let's see the chords:

All the chords when written out: let's list all the unique chord types and root notes.

First, looking at the progression:

- C# (major chord? or just root? Probably C# major chord)

But in the progression: "C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#"

So each chord is listed as:

C# (probably C# major)

Another C#

A#m/C# (A# minor with C# bass)

A#m/C#

C#

C#

Fm/C (F minor with C bass)

D#m/C# (D# minor with C# bass)

C#

C#

A#m/C#

A#m/C#

C#

C#

G#7/C (G#7 with C bass)

C#

Wait, but the bass notes here might be important for determining the key. Let's check the bass line. Because slash chords indicate a specific bass note. So perhaps the bass notes are key to determining the key.

Let's list the bass notes for each chord:

- C# (since it's "C#" alone, then bass note is C#)

Another C# (bass C#)

A#m/C# → bass C#

A#m/C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

Fm/C → bass C

D#m/C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

A#m/C# → bass C#

A#m/C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

C# → bass C#

G#7/C → bass C

C# → bass C#

Wait a second, so let's see the bass note sequence:

C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#

Wait, but maybe not. Let's parse it step by step.

The entire progression written out:

C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#

So each token separated by space is a chord. So:

1. C# → bass note C#

2. C# → bass C#

3. A#m/C# → bass C#

4. A#m/C# → bass C#

5. C# → bass C#

6. C# → bass C#

7. Fm/C → bass C (since the slash says C)

8. D#m/C# → bass C#

9. C# → bass C#

10. C# → bass C#

11. A#m/C# → bass C#

12. A#m/C# → bass C#

13. C# → bass C#

14. C# → bass C#

15. G#7/C → bass C (since slash says C)

16. C# → bass C#

So the bass notes for each chord are:

C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#

Hmm. So the bass line has mostly C#s, but some Cs (specifically chords 7, 15 are C bass, and chord 7 is Fm/C which bass is C, chord 15 is G#7/C which is C bass). Wait, but chord 7: Fm/C means chord is F minor, bass C. Chord 15: G#7/C means G#7 chord with C bass.

But considering the bass notes: most are C#, but a few Cs. Also, the chord Fm/C and G#7/C both have C in the bass.

Wait, but Fm/C is a F minor triad with C in the bass. That chord's notes are F, Ab, C, with C as the lowest note. So the chord includes F, Ab, C. Similarly, G#7/C: G#7 chord is G# B# D# F# (but wait, standard G#7 would be G# B# D# F#? Wait, no: G# is G# B# D# F#? Let's see, major 7th chord would be G# B# D# F#? But G#7 is a dominant 7th chord. So G# root, major third (B#), perfect fifth (D#), minor seventh (F#). But B# is enharmonically C, F# is F#.

But G#7/C would be the chord G#7 with C in the bass. So notes would be C, G#, B#, D#, F#. But that seems a bit dissonant. Alternatively, maybe the slash is indicating the bass note, so regardless of the chord type, the bass note is specified.

But perhaps focusing on the actual chords without considering the slash part yet. Let's see:

In the chord progression, the main chords are C# major, A#m (with various bass notes), Fm, D#m, G#7.

Wait, but the slash chords might affect the harmonic function. Let's consider the actual harmony.

Looking at the chord symbols: the key is determined by the chord root and the tonal center. Let's list all the unique chord symbols as written:

- C# (which is likely C# major)

- A#m (since A#m/C# is A# minor over C# bass, so the chord is A#m)

- Fm

- D#m

- G#7

So the actual chords (ignoring bass for a moment) would be: C#, A#m, Fm, D#m, G#7.

But perhaps the key can be determined by the root notes of the chords.

Wait, but chord roots:

C# (root C#)

A#m (root A#)

Fm (root F)

D#m (root D#)

G#7 (root G#)

So the root notes present are C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

But A# is same as B flat (Bb), but let's stay in sharps. A# minor. Wait, A# minor is a valid chord, but it's the same as Bb minor, but in key of C# might be relevant.

Wait, let's look at the key of C#. If the key is C# major, what chords belong to that key?

C# major scale: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B# (C# D# E# F# G# A# B#). Wait, but in reality, the enharmonic equivalent might be Db major. But let's use sharps.

C# major key has chords:

I: C# major

II: D# minor

III: E# major (which is F major, but in key of C# it's written as E# major)

IV: F# major

V: G# major

VI: A# minor

VII: B# diminished

So the diatonic chords for C# major would be:

I: C# Maj

II: D# min

III: E# Maj (F Major)

IV: F# Maj

V: G# Maj

VI: A# min

VII: B# dim

So in the given chord progression, we have:

C# Maj (I)

A#m (VI)

D#m (II)

Fm? Wait, F minor. But in C# major, the IV chord is F# major, not F minor. F minor is not in the key of C# major. Hmm. So that might be a clue that this isn't in C# major.

Wait, but Fm is F minor. But in C# major scale, the fourth note is F#, so chord IV is F# major. But here's an F minor chord. So that's not diatonic to C# major.

Similarly, G#7 is G# dominant seventh. In C# major, V chord is G# major. So G#7 would be a V7 chord, which is common.

Wait, if the key is C# major, then V7 is G#7 (G# B# D# F#), yes. And VI is A# minor. II is D# minor. But where does Fm come from? F minor is not diatonic here.

Hmm. So maybe Fm is a borrowed chord? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is A minor? But the bass notes seem to be centered on C#. Let's consider other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: the bass note seems to be mostly C#, with some Cs. But in the chord progression, the slash chords often have C# in bass. Let's see:

The chords:

- C# (so likely a major chord based on C#)

- A#m/C# means: even though the chord is A#m, the bass note is C#. So the notes of A#m chord are A# C# E#, but with C# in the bass, so C# as lowest note, then A# and E#. So the actual harmony when played would be C# (bass), then A#, E# (which is F). So the chord would be C# A# E#. Which notes are those: C# (root), A# (minor sixth), E# (major third? Wait A# is the major sixth of C#? Let's see.

Wait, C# root, A# would be the minor sixth (since A# to C# is a minor third). Wait, scale degrees: C# major scale intervals.

C# root: 1

D# 2

E# 3

F# 4

G# 5

A# 6

B# 7

So A# is the 6th degree, so a minor sixth above C# is A natural? Wait, no. Wait, in C# major, 6th is A#. So A# is the major sixth. So a minor sixth would be A natural. But in this chord: C# in bass, then A# note. So the chord notes are C#, A#, E#. So C# (root), A# (6th), E# (3rd). So that's a C# major chord in first inversion? Wait, E# is the third. Wait, but in A#m/C# chord, the chord is A# minor triad (A#, C#, E#), with C# in bass. So the notes are C# (bass), then A#, E#. So the notes present are C#, A#, E#. Which is a C# major chord with the third in the bass? Wait, no: C# major chord is C# E# G#. But here the notes are C# (bass), A#, E#. So that's C#, A#, E#. If we look at it as a chord, the root could be... Let's see: intervals between C# and A# is a minor sixth (C# to A# is 9 semitones, which is minor sixth interval), and A# to E# is a major third (A# to E# is 7 semitones: A#, B#, C#, D#, E#... wait, A# to B#=1, B# to C#=2, C# to D#=3, D# to E#=4? Wait, no. A# to B is the same as Bb, but in this context, A# to E# is E# is F natural? No, E# is the same as F. Wait, but in enharmonic terms: E# is F. But A# to C# is minor third, C# to E# is major third. Hmm, perhaps another way: A#m/C# is a chord with notes C# (bass), A#, E#.

So the chord includes A#, C#, E#. So A# minor triad: A#, C#, E# (yes), but with bass on C#. So as a chord, it's spelled C# A# E#, which would be C# minor? No, because A# is flat? Wait, no. A# is the root. Wait, confusion here.

A# minor triad: A# as root, minor third is C# (since A# to C# is 3 semitones: A# to B=1, B to C=2, C to C#=3), so yes, C# is the minor third. Then fifth is E# (C# to E# is 4 semitones: C# to D#=1, D# to E#=2? Wait, A# to E# is a perfect fifth: A# to B#=1, B# to C#=2, C# to D#=3, D# to E#=4 semitones? Maybe better to count steps.

From A# up to E#: A# to B is 1 semitone, but in the context of A#m chord: the notes are A# (root), C# (minor third), E# (perfect fifth). Because A# to C# is minor third (3 semitones: A# to B=1, B to C=2, C to C#=3), and C# to E# is major third (but A# to E# is perfect fifth: A# (root), B# (M2), C# (m3), D# (P4), E# (P5)). Yes. So A#m is A#, C#, E#. So the chord A#m/C# has bass C#, so the notes are C#, A#, E#. So the chord is C# (bass), A#, E#. When you stack these from the bass note: C# is the root, then A# and E#. So above C#, E# is a major third (C# to E# is 4 semitones), and A# is a minor sixth (C# to A# is 9 semitones, which is a minor sixth). Alternatively, in terms of chord structure, with C# as root, the notes present are C#, E#, A#. That would be a C# major chord with an added sixth? Because C# major chord is C#, E#, G#. So in this case, replacing G# with A#? So C#maj6? Wait, yes. Because maj6 is root, 3, 5, 6. So C#maj6 would be C# E# G# A#. But here we have C#, E#, A#. No G#. So wait, it's missing the G#. So perhaps it's not a standard chord. Alternatively, with bass C#, the chord is C# root, then A# and E#. So interval between C# and A# is minor 6th, C# to E# is major third. So the chord would be C#maj7? No, because maj7 adds B# (C# to B# is major seventh), which is same as C natural. Hmm. This might be getting complicated.

Maybe better to consider the actual chord function in context.

Alternatively, let's ignore the slash chords for a moment and look at the main chord roots. But with the slashes, the bass notes may be emphasizing certain notes.

Another approach: the progression mostly has C# in bass, but there's a G#7/C and Fm/C, which suggest that when there's C in bass, the chords are Fm and G#7. Let's see: Fm/C is F minor chord with C bass, which is Fm in second inversion (C is the fifth of Fm). Similarly, G#7/C: the chord G#7 has notes G# B# D# F#, so with C in the bass, the chord would include C, G#, B#, D#, F#. That's sort of a complex chord. But perhaps this is a case of modulation or borrowing.

Wait, but the Fm/C chord. F minor with C in bass. So the bass note is C. So the chord includes C, F, Ab (since F minor is F Ab C). So chord notes: C, F, Ab. Now, what key could that fit into? Let's see.

If we consider the key of C minor. But the main chords have C# throughout. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think of the C in the bass (from Fm/C and G#7/C) as part of the chord progression. When the bass is C, then the chords are F minor and G#7. Wait, G#7 is B# D# F#. But with C bass, it's C, G#, B#, D#, F#. That seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the slash chords are indicating a different harmony.

Wait another thought: sometimes slash chords indicate an inverted chord or a chord with a specific bass note. So for example, A#m/C# is likely just a way to denote that the chord is A# minor but with C# in the bass. Similarly, Fm/C is F minor with C in bass. But perhaps looking at the key of the melody or the root of the progression. But the user didn't provide melody, just the chords.

Let's think of the chords as written. The chord progression has many C# chords, and some A#m, D#m, Fm, G#7.

Let's list all chords:

- C# major (assuming "C#" is C# major)

- A#m/C# (which is A# minor triad with C# bass)

- Fm/C (F minor triad with C bass)

- D#m/C# (D# minor with C# bass)

- G#7/C (G#7 with C bass)

So maybe the actual chord roots are:

C#, A#, F, D#, G#

But with bass notes specified.

But in terms of key, let's look at the tonic. If there's a consistent root note that the progression resolves to, which seems to be C#, since the progression starts and ends on C#.

But the issue is the Fm chord. F minor is not in C# major. Let's see: what's the distance between C# and F? C# to F is a diminished fourth (or augmented third). Wait, in terms of semitones: C# to C is 1, C to Db is 2, but wait C# to D=2 semitones, D to D#=3, D# to E=4, E to F=5. So C# to F is 6 semitones (since C# to D=2, D to D#=1? Wait no: from C# to C is 1, C to Db is 2? No. Better to count directly:

C# → D: 2 semitones

C# to D#: 3

C# to E: 4

C# to F: 5 semitones?

Wait, semitones between notes:

C# to D: 1 semitone

D to D#: 2

No, better to count from root:

C# (0), C## (enharmonic to D), but let's count properly:

C# (0)

D (1 semitone above C#)

D# (2)

E (3)

F (4)

So C# to F is 4 semitones? Wait, from C# to D is 1 (C#-D), D to D# is +1, but C# to D# is 2 semitones.

Wait, starting at C#:

- C# (0)

- D (1)

- D# (2)

- E (3)

- F (4)

- F# (5)

- G (6)

etc. So yes, from C# to F is 4 semitones. So major third interval? No, a major third is 4 semitones. C# to E# (F) is major third. So F is enharmonic to E#, yes. Because E# is F.

Wait, this is important. In music theory, the note F is also called E#. In the key of C# major, the fourth scale degree is F#. But wait, if we think of F as E#, then in C# major scale:

C# D# E# F# G# A# B# C#

So the third note is E# which is equivalent to F natural. So the E#/F note is the third degree.

But in C# major scale, chord IV is F# major (F# A# C#). So F natural (or E#) would be the third of the scale, not part of the IV chord.

So back to Fm chord. F minor is F Ab C. If we're in the key of C# major, then F natural is the E# in the scale, which is a note used in the chord (for example, E# is third degree). But F minor chord would be F Ab C. Now, F in context of C# major is E#, so Ab would be G## (double sharp?), which is very enharmonic. This seems messy. Maybe using flats instead.

Alternatively, perhaps the song is in A minor. Let's check. But the bass notes are mostly C#.

Wait, another angle: the slash chords with C# in bass. If the chord root is A#m/C#, that means A#m but bass C#. So as mentioned before, A# minor chord, notes A#, C#, E#. With C# bass, it's C#, A#, E#. If we consider the key of A# minor, but that's the same as Bb minor. Not sure.

Wait, maybe looking at the chords without slash: the progression has A#m, D#m, G#7. Let's see: G#7 would be dominant chord, perhaps leading to C#. So V7 to I. So G#7 to C# major. That suggests that the key might be C# major.

But where does Fm fit in? F minor. In C# major scale, what's F note? It's the 4th degree but F natural is enharmonic to E#. The 4th scale degree is F#.

So Fm chord has F, Ab, C. In C# major, F# is the fourth, F natural is a half step lower. So F minor would be a chromatic chord.

But maybe it's a borrowed chord from another mode. Alternatively, the key might be something else.

Another thought: if the chord Fm/C is present (F minor with C bass), then the notes C, F, Ab. So Ab is the flat 6th? If in context of C major or C minor.

Wait, if we think of the key as C minor. C minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb. So in C minor, the chords would be:

i: Cm

ii°: Ddim

bIII: Eb

iv: Fm

v: Gm

bVI: Ab

bVII: Bb

So chords in C minor include Cm, Fm, Ab, etc. But here we have Fm/C which would fit into C minor. But the progression has a lot of C#s, which is a different note from C. So C# vs C are different.

Wait, maybe the song is in a key where C#/Db is tonic. But Fm is not in that key.

Alternative idea: perhaps the key is E minor. Let's see.

E minor natural: E F# G A B C D.

Chords: Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D.

No Fm there. Not matching.

Wait, but we have Fm chord. In what keys is F minor a diatonic chord? Like F major scale: F major has F, Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, Edim. No. In C minor, as above. In Ab minor: Ab Bbb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the Fm/C is actually part of a different chord. For example, "Fm/C" could mean an F minor chord with C bass, which is Fm in second inversion. But in a key where C is the fifth degree? Like F major. In F major, the chords include F, Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, Edim. So C is the V chord (C major), but Fm isn't in F major.

Hmm.

Another approach: look at the bass movement. The bass notes mostly stay on C#, but occasionally C. So if the tonic note is C#, but there's a C natural used, which is a half step below. That might suggest a modal mixture, or perhaps the key is actually C# minor.

Let's check C# minor harmonic or natural.

C# natural minor scale: C# D# E F# G# A B.

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

bIII: E

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A

VII: B

But in this case, we have chord A#m. In C# minor scale, VI is A major. But A# minor would be a different chord. Hmm.

Wait, but in C# minor, the sixth degree is A, so chord VI is A major. But the chord A# minor would be outside the scale.

Alternatively, C# melodic minor? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the song is in E major? Let's see: E major has chords E, F#m, G#m, A, B, C#m, D#dim. Not matching.

Alternatively, the key could be C# major but with some chromatic chords.

But let's think of the chords. The presence of G#7 suggests it's a dominant chord that resolves to C#. So C# major is likely the tonic.

Then why is there an Fm chord? In C# major, F is enharmonic to E# (the third scale degree), but F natural would be a chromatic note. So Fm chord (F Ab C) would have notes that include Ab, which is G# in C# major. So Ab is G# enharmonic. But in C# major scale, the notes are C# D# E# F# G# A# B#. So G# is the fifth degree. An Ab is equivalent to G#, but written differently. Wait, Ab is same as G#. So Fm chord: F Ab C. But if Ab is G#, then F G# C. Hmm, that might not correspond directly.

Alternatively, F minor chord as F Ab C is the same as E# G# C, but that seems odd.

Wait, maybe the Fm/C chord is actually a different chord. Let's see. If you write Fm/C, that's F minor with bass C. So the notes C, F, Ab. In terms of key of C# major, C natural. But C# is the tonic. So C natural is the minor seventh. So in C# major scale, the minor seventh would be B#. Wait, C# to B# is major seventh. Wait, B natural is minor seventh of C#.

In C# major scale:

C# D# E# F# G# A# B#.

So the seventh degree is B#. So a B natural would be a flattened seventh (Bbb? No, B natural is enharmonic to Cb, but in key of C# major, leading tone is B#. So a B natural would be a chromatic note.

So in C# major scale, the notes are all sharps. A natural note would be outside the key.

So Fm/C chord: notes C (natural), F (natural), Ab (natural). So this is a major triad on C? No, Fm is F minor. So F Ab C.

So these notes: C, F, Ab. How do they fit into a key with C#?

Hmm. Not obviously. Maybe the key is A minor natural. In A minor, chords are Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G.

But then the chord progression has a lot of C#s. In A minor, C# is not in the scale. A natural minor has A B C D E F G. No C#.

So that doesn't work.

Another idea: maybe the chord progression uses C# as tonic, and some chords are borrowed from parallel minor? But C# major vs C# minor.

C# major has C# D# E# F# G# A# B#.

C# minor has C# D# E F# G# A B.

So F# major in major, but in minor it's still F#? No, C# minor: fourth degree is F#, yes.

But the chord Fm... F minor. In C# minor, the fourth chord is F#m. So not Fm.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the slash notation. Maybe some of these slash chords are not indicating bass notes for the chord but rather different interpretations. For example, sometimes "A#m/C#" might be used to mean that the chord is C# with A#m, but that's not standard. Normally, slash chord means chord on left, bass on right.

So A#m/C# = A# minor chord, bass note C#.

But another possibility: maybe the chord "C#" is a power chord, which is just root and fifth, but usually denoted as C#5. But in common practice, single note for chords implies major.

Alternatively, perhaps the whole progression is in the key of C# minor. Let's see what chords would be diatonic there.

C# natural minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

bIII: E major

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A major

VII: B major

But in the chord progression, we have C#, A#m, Fm, etc. A# minor isn't present here. So no.

C# harmonic minor: C# D# E F# G# A B#

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

bIII+: E aug

iv: F#m

V: G# major (or G7)

VI: A major?

Wait, harmonic minor raises the seventh, so B# here. So chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III+: E augmented

iv: F#m

V: G#(7) major with B# note

bVI: A major

VII: B# dim

Not sure if that helps. Fm chord still doesn't fit.

Wait, the chord Fm in this scenario: F natural. In C# harmonic minor, is F natural present? C# harmonic minor scale: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B#, C#.

So F# is present, not F natural. So F natural isn't in scale. So Fm chord would be borrowed.

Hmm.

Let's consider another angle. Let's list all the notes across all chords.

Take each chord in progression and list all notes:

1. C# major (C#, E#, G#)

2. C# major

3. A#m/C#: A#m triad with bass C#, so notes C#, A#, E# (which is F)

4. A#m/C#: same as above

5. C# major

6. C# major

7. Fm/C: F minor triad with C bass. Notes: C, F, Ab

8. D#m/C#: D#m triad with bass C#. Notes: C#, D#, F#

9. C# major

10. C# major

11. A#m/C#

12. A#m/C#

13. C# major

14. C# major

15. G#7/C: G#7 chord with C bass. G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#. With C bass, notes: C, G#, B#, D#, F#

16. C# major

Now, let's collect all the notes present:

- C, F, Ab (from chord 7)

- C#, E#, G# (from C# major)

- A#, E# (from A#m/C#)

- D#, F# (from D#m/C#)

- B#, D#, F# (from G#7/C)

Wait, this is getting complex. Let's list all unique notes.

From chord 7: C, F, Ab

Chord 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,16: C#, E#, G#

Chord 3,4,11,12: A#, C#, E#

Chord 8: C#, D#, F#

Chord 15: C, G#, B#, D#, F#

So all notes:

C, C#, Db (but usually written as C#), D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, B#

Wait, Ab is the same as G#.

Let's see:

Ab = G# (enharmonically)

So chord 7 has Ab which is G#.

So chord 7: C, F, G# (since Ab = G#)

Chord 15 has notes C, G#, B#, D#, F#

But B# is C natural. So B# = C.

Wait a second. So in chord 15: G#7 with C bass. G#7 is G# B# D# F#. B# is enharmonic to C, so G#7 chord could also be spelled G# C D# F#.

Similarly, chord 7: Fm/C has Ab which is G#, but also F and C.

So considering enharmonic equivalents:

- Ab = G#

- B# = C

- E# = F

So let's rewrite the chords in practical terms:

Chord 3: A#m/C# → A# minor is Bb minor. And E# is F. So A#m/C# → Bb minor with C# bass, notes C#, Bb, F.

Chord 7: Fm/C → F minor with C bass → C F Ab

But Ab is G#, so C F G#

Chord 8: D#m/C# → D# minor, which is Eb minor. Bass C# → notes C#, D# (Eb), F#.

Chord 15: G#7/C → G#7 with C bass. G# B# D# F# → C (from B#), G#, D#, F#. So notes C, G#, D#, F#.

Now all chords expressed in practical tones:

Chord 1: C# major: C#, E#, G# → C#, F, G# (since E# = F)

Ah! Here's a key point. E# in music is enharmonically equivalent to F. So when you see E#, it's the same note as F. Similarly, B# is C.

So if we rewrite all chords using flats or natural sharps where possible:

- C# major = C# E# G# → but E# = F, so this chord is spelled C# F G#. Which is an F major chord with C# in bass? Wait no: C# major chord consists of C#, E#, G#. But E# is the same pitch as F natural. So physically, the notes are C#, F, and G#.

Similarly, G# major chord: G#, B#, D# → G#, C, D#.

Because B# is C natural.

So let's re-interpret the chords by substituting E# with F, B# with C, etc.

So chord progression:

C# (major) → C#, F, G#

C# → same

A#m/C# → A#m is Bbm, which is Bb, Db, F. With C# bass. So bass C#, then Bb, Db, F? Wait, A# minor triad: A#, C#, E#. E# = F. So A# C# F. But with bass C#, so C#, A#, F. Which is same as C#, Bb (since A# is Bb), F. So C# Bb F.

But Bb and C# are different notes. Bb is A# enharmonic. So the chord is C# Bb F.

Similarly, Fm/C is Fm with C bass. F Ab C. But F Ab C → notes F, Ab, C. Which is equivalent to F, G#, C.

D#m/C#: D#m is Ebm, which is Eb, Gb, Bb. With bass C#. So C#, Eb, Gb (F#), Bb. Wait, D#m triad: D#, F#, A#. So D# F# A#. With bass C#. So C#, D# (Eb), F#, A# (Bb).

So notes: C#, Eb, F#, Bb.

G#7/C: G#7 with bass C. G# B# D# F# = G#, C, D#, F#. So bass C, then G#, D#, F#.

So now all the chords in natural or flat terms (to simplify):

Let's list every chord's notes in standard notation:

1. C# major: C#, F (E#), G# → so pitch classes: C#, F, G#.

But wait, C# to F is an augmented fourth, which is also a tritone. But maybe not useful.

Alternative: Let's consider a key of Db major. Because C# is enharmonic with Db. So if the key is Db major, then chords would be Dbs (Db, Ebb, Fb...), but this seems messy.

But perhaps this is the key. Let's see:

Db major: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C

Chords in Db major:

I: Db

II: Ebm

III: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

VI: Bbm

VII: Cdim

But the progression seems to have many chords that could fit. For example:

If key of Db major:

- C# major would be B# major? No. Wait, this might not help.

Alternative idea: given the many C# and G# chords, maybe the tonic is G#. Let's check G# major.

G# major scale: G# A# B# C# D# E# F# (but note B#=C, E#=F).

Chords would be:

I: G#

II: A#m

III: B# (C)

IV: C#m

V: D#m

VI: E# (F) → E# would be F? No, G# major third is B#, which is C natural.

Wait, this is getting too messy. Perhaps better to use practical notes.

Another angle: if we consider the bass note sequence.

Bass notes:

C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C, C#

So bass line moves from mostly C# to C, then back to C#. This could suggest a move from C# to C, but that's a semitone apart. Which might indicate modulation or use of a chromatic chord.

But maybe the chord Fm/C and G#7/C use C as bass note for a subdominant or something. For example, in C major key: Fm is iv chord, but here it's Fm/C which would be ii chord if in Db major or something. Not sure.

Wait, the chord G#7/C. If the bass is C, and the chord is G#7, then in terms of root, it's a G#7 chord with bass C, which is called G#7/C. But the G#7 chord includes B# which is C. So the note C is part of the chord anyway. So G#7/C is basically a G#7 chord where C is the third (B#=C). Wait, G#7 is G# B# D# F#. B# is C, so G# C D# F#. So if C is the bass note, then the chord is C, G#, D#, F#, which is a Cmaj7#5? Or it could be interpreted as G#7 in third inversion? Because G#7's notes are G#, B#, D#, F#. If you put C (B#) in bass, then the bass note is B#, the root of G#7 is G#. So the inversion would be second inversion? Wait, no. Inversions:

Root position: G# (root), B# (3rd), D# (5th), F# (7th)

First inversion: B# G# D# F#

Second inversion: D# B# G# F#

Third inversion: F# D# B# G#

But here, chord is G#7/C, so bass C (B#). So the bass note is B# (C), so it would be first inversion of G#7.

But regardless, in the key of C# major, G#7 is the V7 chord, so dominant of tonic. But when used as G#7/C, it's like a V7 in third inversion or something.

But still, the Fm chord is problematic.

Wait, another thought: maybe the Fm/C is actually a Neapolitan chord. In C# major, the Neapolitan chord is a Db major chord in first inversion, but that might be similar. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is A minor. Let's see. A minor has notes A B C D E F G.

But our chords include C#, which is not in A minor. So unlikely.

Wait, the chord progression has C# and A#m, which if A# is Bb minor chord. Let's consider key of G major. G major has Bb? No: G major scale G A B C D E F#. So Bb isn't present.

Alternatively, Bb major. Bb major: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab.

Chords: Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F, Gm, Adim.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps key of C minor. C minor has C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords: Cm, Dim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb.

So Fm chord is iv in C minor.

But the progression has a lot of C#s. In C minor, C# would be the seventh degree (which is B natural), but C# isn't in the scale. So maybe not.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the song is using a mode of C# minor or something.

Another idea: when the bass note is C# throughout, and the chord Fm/C has bass C, which is a chromatic note. Maybe the tonic is C#, and the Fm is a borrowed chord from another mode.

Let's consider the key of C# harmonic major or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the chords are written with slash chords indicating actual chord roots. For example, "A#m/C#" might be intended as C# with A#m, but that's not standard. Usually slash chords are chord followed by bass.

Wait, perhaps the slash doesn't mean bass note, but something else. Unlikely. Standard notation is chord/slash.

Let's try to see if all these chords function in a particular key.

Looking at G#7 followed by C#. That's V7 to I, very common. So if G#7 to C#, then key is C# major.

In that case, the dominant chord is G#7, tonic C# major.

The Fm chord: in C# major, what is Fm? F natural. In C# scale, F is the fourth degree if we think of it as E#.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the chord notation. If G#7/C is actually an E major chord, since G#7 in some contexts could be related. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's ignore the slash for a moment and consider all chords as written:

- C# (I)

- A#m (VI)

- Fm (but not in key)

- D#m (II)

- G#7 (V7)

So if we take V7 → I (G#7 → C#), that suggests C# major is tonic.

But where does Fm come in? Let's say in C# major, but Fm is not diatonic. Maybe it's borrowed from C# Phrygian mode. The natural minor is Aeolian. Phrygian mode: C# D E F# G# A# B# → no. Phrygian would be starting on C# with intervals different.

C# Phrygian would be C# D E F# G# A# B# → no, that's the same as C# major. No, modes of major scale:

For C# major scale, the modes are:

Ionian: C# major

Dorian: D# Dorian

Phrygian: E# Phrygian (F natural)

Mixolydian: F# Mixolydian

Aeolian: G# Aeolian

Locrian: A# Locrian

Wait, no. Let's list properly.

The major scale's modes:

1. Ionian

2. Dorian

3. Phrygian

4. Lydian

5. Mixolydian

6. Aeolian

7. Locrian

So for C# major scale (tonic C#), the modes:

- C# Ionian (same as C# major)

- D# Dorian (D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, C#)

- E# Phrygian (E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, C#, D#)

- F# Lydian (F#, G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#)

- G# Mixolydian (G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#)

- A# Aeolian (A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#)

- B# Locrian (B#, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#)

So in A# Aeolian mode (which is the 6th mode of C# major), the scale is A# B# C# D# E# F# G#.

Chords in A# Aeolian:

i: A#m

ii°: B#dim

bIII: C#maj

iv: D#m

v: E#m (Fm)

VI: F#maj

VII: G#

Ah! Interesting. So in the A# Aeolian scale (which is the sixth mode of C# major), the chords include A# minor (i), D# minor (iv), and E# minor which is F minor because E# is enharmonic with F.

So E# minor = F minor. And VI chord would be F# major.

In this context, if the key is C# major, but the progression is using A# Aeolian as the key center.

But usually, the key is defined by the tonic note. If the progression centers on A# minor, then it's in A# Aeolian mode, which is the natural minor mode of C# major. But typically, we'd say it's in C# minor. Wait, no: C# natural minor scale is C# D# E F# G# A B.

Wait, the relationship between modes: the sixth mode of C# major is A# Aeolian. But the diatonic scale for A# Aeolian is A# B# C# D# E# F# G#.

Which is equivalent to Bb minor scale. Because A# is Bb, B# is C, etc.

A# Aeolian scale: A# B# C# D# E# F# G# → which is equivalent to Bb minor scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab.

Yes! Because A#=Bb, B#=C, C#=Db, D#=Eb, E#=F, F#=Gb, G#=Ab.

So this might be the case. So if the song is in Bb minor (which is A# minor), then the key signature would be Bb minor.

But then the tonic chord is Bbm. However, the bass note of the progression is mostly C# which would be Db in this key.

Wait, in Bb minor scale:

Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

bIII: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

Wait, but if we look at this: chords including Fm (v chord), which matches the Fm present in progression.

But the chord names in this context:

- A#m/C# would be Bbm/D? Wait, no. If A# minor is the tonic of the mode, but C# in the bass...

This is getting confusing. Maybe better to list all chords in Bb minor scale.

Bb minor (natural minor):

Notes: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab

Chords:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

bIII: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

So if the song is in Bb minor, then:

The progression would be:

Fm chord is v chord.

C# as bass... C# isn't even in the Bb minor scale. Unless we're in a different key.

Wait, this is not working. Let's try again.

Alternative idea: let's look at the chord roots. If we have G#7, which in standard practice is dominant chord for C# major. So G# is V in C#. The fact that we have a G#7 resolving to C# suggests C# major is the key.

Even though Fm is outside the key, but perhaps it's a borrowed chord or chromatic passagework.

In C# major, possible other chords: Fm could be the ii chord of Db major (which is C# major's relative minor scale? Not sure).

Alternatively, F minor could be a flat six chord in C# major. Let's see: in major key, the flat six chord is Ab major normally for C# major. But not sure.

Or maybe it's a Neapolitan chord. Neapolitan is usually a flattened second degree chord. In C# major, the Neapolitan would be Db major.

But Fm isn't Db. So no.

Another angle: perhaps the chord "Fm/C" is actually a chord that can be part of a progression in C# major if we consider the Fm as a chromatic mediant or something. But it's still unclear.

Wait, let's see the overall chord progression:

C# ... C#... Fm/C... D#m/C#... G#7/C... then C#.

If we think of Fm/C as part of progression: maybe it's leading to something.

Fm/C → D#m/C# → G#7/C.

C in bass, then C# bass.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the slash chords indicate the bass note, and the key has C# as root but the chords are built with the bass note being the main note. But the tonic is C#.

But the presence of chords like Fm/C and G#7/C which use C as bass note: C is a half step below C#, so it's like a chromatic bass movement. It's common in some progressions to have a bass moving chromatically down from C# to C and back up.

For example, C# to C to C#.

But what key has that?

Wait, perhaps it's in E major? Let's see. No.

Another idea: the key could be C# major, and the chord Fm/C is a borrowed chord from C# minor parallel scale. In C# minor, the chords are:

C# D# E F# G# A B

Chords:

i: C#m

ii°: D#dim

III: E

iv: F#m

v: G#m

VI: A

VII: B

Not sure where Fm fits. But if there's a flattened sixth, in natural minor, it's A major. Not Fm.

If harmonic minor: vii° would be B#dim.

But F minor isn't there.

Wait, but in C# Phrygian mode. C# Phrygian is the third mode of A major. Wait:

A major scale: A B C# D E F# G#

Third mode: C# D E F# G# A B → no, wait. Mode of A major third would be:

Root C#, intervals: minor second, minor third, fourth, fifth, minor sixth, minor seventh.

So C# D E F# G# A B C#.

Wait, the scale is C# D E F# G# A B.

In that scale, the diatonic chords would be:

i: C#m

bII: D dim

bIII: E major?

Not sure.

This might not help.

Let's try to list the actual notes of the chords again:

From the progression:

- Most chords have C# as bass and include C#, F (E#), G#.

- Fm/C has F Ab C (but Ab = G#), so C, F, G#.

- G#7/C has G# C D# F#.

So if we look at the actual pitches used:

C, C#, F, G#, D#, A, B#? Let's see.

Wait, this is too vague. Let's try to write the chords as if they were in a key and see which key fits best.

Suppose the progression has chords: C#, D#m, Fm, G#7. If the key is C# major, then D#m is ii, G#7 V7, but Fm not diatonic. But if the key is F major: F major has F, Gm, Am, Bb, C, Dm, Edim. No. Not matching.

Wait Fm in F major would be iv chord. So if key is F major, then Fm as iv. But chords like G#7 don't fit.

Wait, G#7 as C major, but not sure.

Another Idea: Consider the tonic as F. If the progression is in F major. Let's see:

F major: F Gm A Bb C Dm Edim.

C# major chord would be outside scale.

No.

How about Eb major? No.

Wait, maybe C minor. C minor has C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.

Chords: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb.

If the progression has Cm as tonic, but our chords include C# which is not in C minor.

But wait, "C#" as a chord would be outside. Unless in C minor, but it's a chromatic chord.

Not likely.

Alternative approach: Let's consider if the bass note is always C# except when it's C.

So the bass line is C# mostly, but dips to C for some chords. So perhaps the tonic note is C# with chromatic passing tones.

The presence of G#7 (which is dominant of C#) suggests C# major as tonic.

So the key would be C# major, and the Fm chord is a chromatic chord used temporarily. Maybe as part of a modulation or passing chord.

The question is "determine key and mode". So if the tonic is C# major, then the mode is Ionian.

But why is there an Fm chord?

Wait, E# is equivalent to F. In C# major, the fourth degree is F#. So the IV chord is F# major. But F major (or Fm) isn't in scale. So Fm would be a chromatic chord.

But in some contexts, it might be part of a secondary dominant or something.

Alternatively, maybe the chord "Fm/C" is actually a different chord. Let's see: If you have a C bass, and Fm chord with Fm/C, the chord F minor with C bass is C-F-Ab. Another way: this could be spelled as C-F-Ab, which is a C minor add #11 chord? Not sure. Or it could be a Ab major in first inversion.

But Ab major is Ab C Eb. But here we have C-F-Ab. So C-F-Ab is Ab major with C in bass.

So Fm/C could be an Ab major chord with C in the bass. Which is Ab major in first inversion.

Ab is the flattened sixth of C# major. So Ab major chord in C# major would be considered borrowed from the minor key perhaps.

In C# major, the flattened sixth chord would be Ab major. So if the progression has Ab as chord, that could be a borrowed chord from C# minor.

C# minor scale: C# D# E F# G# A B.

Sixth degree is A natural, so A major chord is VI.

Ab would be enharmonic to G#.

This isn't working.

Another Idea: Maybe the key is Db major. Db major has Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C.

Chords in Db major:

I: Db

II: Ebm

III: Fm

IV: Gb

V: Ab

VI: Bbm

VII: Cdim

Ah! Now this seems possible.

If the key is Db major, then:

- C# major chord would be the VII chord (Cdim is part of it, but C# is different... wait, in Db major scale, the notes are Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C.

So Bb is the seventh degree. C is the seventh scale degree of Db major.

Wait, the seventh tone is C. So C is part of Db major.

But C# would be a sharp of C, which is not in the key. Hmm.

But chord Fm in Db major is III chord. Yes: Db major has Fm as iii chord.

Wait: Diatonic chords for Db major:

I: Db major

II: Eb minor

III: F minor

IV: Gb major

V: Ab major

VI: Bb minor

VII: C diminished

So yes, Fm is the iii chord.

But wait, how about G#7? In Db major scale, the V chord is Ab major. So G#7 would be enharmonic to Ab7, which could be considered a dominant seventh in Db.

Because Ab7 would be Ab Cb Eb Gb? Wait, G#7 is G# B# D# F# which is enharmonic to Ab C D# F#?

But Ab7 would be Ab Cb Eb Gb.

This is confusing. But perhaps in context of Db major, the chord G#7 is actually Ab7 written as G#7, but usually it's Ab7.

Similarly, C# as chord would be the VII chord, which is usually C diminished. But C# major chord would be outside the key.

This also seems messy.

Wait, let's try again.

If key is G minor (enharmonic to F# minor). Wait, perhaps G minor:

G minor natural: G A Bb C D Eb F

Chords: Gm, A°, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F.

Not matching.

Another Idea: Let's look at all the root notes of the chords:

The chords listed (ignoring slashes) are:

C#, A#m, Fm, D#m, G#7.

If we consider these root notes: C#, A#, F, D#, G#.

In a key where these are all diatonic.

But C# and G# are in keys like C# major, but A# would be fourth degree? No.

Wait, key of A minor: but no.

Wait, key of F minor: F minor scale F Gb Ab Bbb Cb Db Eb. No.

This is tough. Maybe using the concept of the tonic note.

Given that the chord progression starts and ends on C#, and the dominant chord G#7 resolves to C#, it's safe to say tonic is C# major.

Then the Fm chord might be a borrowed chord from the parallel minor or a chromatic chord.

So key is C# major, mode is Ionian.

But the slash chords like Fm/C might just be F minor chord with C in bass, which could be used as a passing chord or part of a chromatic bassline.

For example, in C# major, moving bass from C# down to C natural for the Fm/C chord, then up to C# again. It's a common chromatic bass movement.

So in that case, key would be C# major, mode Ionian.

But let's check the chord D#m/C#. D# minor in C# major is ii chord. Yes.

So:

C# (I), C#, A#m (VI), Fm/C (borrowed?), D#m (ii), G#7 (V7).

This fits if Fm is a chord borrowed from outside. Maybe from the key of C# Phrygian or something.

But in standard analysis, if the progression revolves around C# tonic with V-I movement, then key is C# major/Ionian.

Even with some borrowed chords.

So the answer would be C# major, Ionian mode.

But wait, the Fm chord. In C# major, using F major chord (or minor) is chromatic. But perhaps in this context, it's still considered C# major.

Alternatively, if you think of the key as A# minor, but that's equivalent to Bb minor. Let's see:

Bb minor scale: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab.

Chords in Bb minor:

i: Bbm

ii°: Cdim

III: Db

iv: Ebm

v: Fm

VI: Gb

VII: Ab

So Fm is v chord here.

But the chord progression has "C#" as the tonic. But in Bb minor scale, the note C# doesn't exist. Because Bb minor's scale is Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab.

C# would be enharmonic to Db. So if the chord C# is actually Db, then it could be the iii chord or something.

But if the tonic is Bb minor, then chords would include:

- Bbm (i)

- Fm (v)

- D#m? In Bb minor, the D# note would be Ebb.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that the tonic is C#, and it's C# major, despite the Fm chord.

Because the dominant chord G#7 resolves to C#. That's the strongest indication of key.

So likely key is C# major, mode Ionian.

Therefore, the answer should be C# major (Ionian).

But how to confirm. Let's see:

In C# major:

- I: C# major

- ii: D# minor

- iii: E# major (F)

- IV: F# major

- V: G# major or G#7

- vi: A# minor

- viio: B# diminished

Yes! So A#m is the vi chord. So the A#m/C# is vi chord with C# in bass.

G#7 would be V7 for tonic.

D#m is ii chord.

Fm... which is not diatonic. But wait, what's the E# note? E# is F natural. So the iii chord in C# major is E# major, which is F major. So if the chord was F major, that would be iii chord. But the given chord is Fm/C.

So F minor chord. But iii chord is major. So Fm would be a minor chord, which would be a chromatic alteration of the iii chord.

In the context of this progression, perhaps they're using F minor as a chromatic chord.

So the chords mostly fit C# major except for the Fm.

So key is C# major.

Therefore, the key is C# major, mode Ionian.

But to double-check: if you have C# major:

I: C#

vi: A#m

ii: D#m

V7: G#7

And the iii chord should be E# major, which is F major. If they're using F minor (Fm) instead of F, that's a minor iii chord. In some contexts, yes, but it's not diatonic.

But perhaps the progression has a Fm which is a common chromatic chord. Like using the flat six chord or something.

But regardless, the strongest indication is the G#7 → C# resolution.

So the analysis would be C# major.

But to confirm: the mode is Ionian when the tonic is based on the major scale.

So yes.

Therefore, the key is C# major and mode is Ionian.

However, sometimes key names can be written as Db major. Because sometimes the key of C# major is less common due to many sharps, so people might use Db major instead. But the actual notation here uses sharps, so probably C# major.

So final answer:

Key: C# Major

Mode: Ionian

But the presence of the Fm chord is a bit odd. Maybe it's a mistake in the chord progression.

Alternatively, the slash chord "Fm/C" could be misinterpreted. Let's check the slash again.

If "Fm/C" means F minor chord with C bass, but in C# major, C is the seventh degree (B#), but C natural would be a chromatic note.

Alternatively, maybe the slash is miswritten. If it was "Fm/C#", then it would be F minor with C# bass. Which would make sense as part of the progression. If the chord was Fm/C#, that would be F minor triad (F Ab C) with bass C#.

The chord would have notes C# F Ab C. But Ab and C# are notes.

But the user wrote "Fm/C", not "Fm/C#".

Alternatively, maybe the slash is a typo. But given the information, I have to go with what's written.

Another possibility: if "Fm/C" is actually "F/C", meaning F major with C bass. But user wrote Fm/C.

Hmm.

Wait, C# major with vi chord A#m, ii D#m, V7 G#7. The Fm might be functioning as the vii° chord or something, but no.

I think the most logical conclusion is that the key is C# major/Ionian, and the Fm is a chromatic chord for color. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the chord progression.

Alternatively, what if the key is A# minor? A# minor is enharmonic to Bb minor.

A# minor natural scale: A# B# C# D# E# F# G#.

Which is same as Bb natural minor: Bb C Db Eb F Gb Ab.

But if we look at the chords:

A#m is i chord.

D#m would be iv chord.

But the chord "C#" here would be III (C# major), which is in Bb minor, the third degree is Db, but if written as C#, it's Db enharmonic. Not sure.

G#7 chord in A# minor: the V chord should be E# major (F major), but it's a dominant 7th. Not sure.

This is not adding up.

At this point, given the dominant seventh chord (G#7) resolving to C#, the tonic is C#. So I think the key is C# major, modal Ionian.

So final answer: Key is C# major, mode is Ionian.

But to double-check, let's see the chord progression spelled out in terms of scale degrees in C# major:

C# (I) → I

A#m/C# → VI (since A#m is vi chord in C# major)

Fm/C → This could be a chromatic chord. If in key of C# major, Fm would be a minor chord containing F (which is E#), but it's minor so it's not diatonic. But it could be a borrowed chord from C# minor where the sixth is A, but F minor isn't there. Not sure.

D#m/C# → ii chord

G#7/C → V7 chord with bass C (but G#7's notes include C natural as B#)

Yes! Because G#7 is G# B# D# F# = G# C D# F#. So the bass note in G#7/C is C, which is the third of the G#7 chord.

So G#7/C is just G#7 in first inversion.

Then the overall progression fits C# major.

So even though Fm/C doesn't exactly fit, the rest of the progression does. Maybe Fm is a chromatic passing chord.

Thus, the key is C# major, mode Ionian.


The chord progression provided is:  
**C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#**

---

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

#### **1. Identify the Tonic (Key Center)**
- The progression **starts and ends on C#**, which strongly suggests **C# as the tonic**.
- The dominant chord **G#7** resolves to **C#**, a classical V–I cadence that is definitive of a major key.
  - In **C# Major**, **G#7** is the **V7 chord**, which naturally resolves to the **I (C# Major)**.
- This is a strong harmonic indicator of **C# Major** as the key.

#### **2. Check Diatonic Chords in C# Major**
The **C# Major scale** is:
> **C# D# E# F# G# A# B#**

Diatonic chords in **C# Major**:
| Scale Degree | Chord Type | Chord |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| I            | Major      | C#    |
| ii           | Minor      | D#m   |
| iii          | Major      | E# (F) |
| IV           | Major      | F#    |
| V            | Major      | G#    |
| vi           | Minor      | A#m   |
| vii°         | Diminished | B#dim |

- **A#m/C#** → A#m is the **vi chord** (diatonic in C# Major).
- **D#m/C#** → D#m is the **ii chord** (diatonic).
- **G#7/C** → G#7 is the **V7 chord** (diatonic, even though the bass is C, which is part of the G#7 chord: G#=B#=C, D#, F#).
- **Fm/C** → This is the **only non-diatonic chord** in the progression.

#### **3. Interpreting the "Odd" Chord (Fm/C)**
- **Fm** (F–Ab–C) includes **F natural**, which is **not in C# Major** (which has **E# = F** as a major third, not minor).
- However, **Fm** can be interpreted as a **borrowed chord** from the **parallel minor (C# Minor)** or **chromatic passing chord**.
- In many musical contexts, especially in pop, rock, or classical progressions, **chromatic alterations** (like using a minor iii chord instead of a major iii) are common for color or tension.
- Alternatively, the **Fm/C** could be misinterpreted as a **C minor chord with F in bass**, but in C# Major, this would be a **non-diatonic chord** used for expressive purposes.

#### **4. Mode Confirmation**
- The **Ionian mode** is the **major scale** itself. Since all other chords fit within **C# Major** (with the exception of Fm/C), and the progression resolves to **C#** as the tonic, the **mode is Ionian**.
- There are no modal alterations (e.g., Dorian, Phrygian, etc.) that align with the chord structure. All chords align with the **C# Major scale** except for the Fm/C, which is a chromatic deviation.

---

### **Key and Mode**
- **Key: C# Major**  
  (Note: While **Db Major** is the enharmonic equivalent, the progression is written in **sharps**, so **C# Major** is the more accurate and practical name.)
- **Mode: Ionian**  
  (Standard major mode, with the tonic on C#.)

---

### **Why Not Other Keys?**
- **C# Minor** would use a different set of chords (e.g., C#m, D#dim, E major, etc.), but the progression includes **C# major**, not C#m.
- **Other keys** (e.g., A minor, G# minor) don't align with the **V7→I resolution** or the note content of the progression.
- **Fm/C** is the only chromatic exception, which is not uncommon in functional harmony and does not invalidate the overall tonal center.

---

### **Summary**
- The progression centers around **C#** as the tonic.
- The **V7–I cadence (G#7 → C#)** confirms the key.
- All other chords (A#m, D#m) are diatonic to **C# Major**.
- The **Fm/C** is a chromatic passing chord used for color, but does not change the tonal center.

> ✅ **Final Answer: Key = C# Major, Mode = Ionian**

**Assistant - Qwen3 Next 80B**

Let's analyze the chord progression you've provided:

```
C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#
```

We’ll break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: List the unique chords
We see the following **chord symbols**:

1. **C#** — likely **C# major** (C# E# G#)
2. **A#m/C#** — A# minor with C# in the bass → **A#min / C#** = C# - E - G# → This is **C# major** again, but with A# as the root implied in the chord name.
3. **Fm/C** — F minor with C in the bass → C - E♭ - F → Wait, this has a **C natural**, not C#!
4. **D#m/C#** — D# minor with C# in the bass → C# - E - G# → Again, this is **C# major** in sound!
5. **G#7/C** — G# dominant 7th with C in the bass → C - E# - G# - B#? That’s a mess — C is natural again.

---

### Step 2: Notice the problem — **C natural** appears!

This is critical.

- All other chords are built on **C#**, **A#**, **D#**, **G#** — sharps.
- But **Fm/C** and **G#7/C** both have **C natural** in the bass.

This breaks the key signature of C# major (which has 7 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#).

**C natural is not in C# major.** It’s a **chromatic note**, meaning we’re modulating or using borrowed chords — or the key is **not** C# major.

---

### Step 3: Compare to C# minor?

C# minor (natural minor) has:  
C# D# E F# G# A B → so **F#**, not F natural.

But here we have **Fm** — that’s **F natural minor**, so **F, A♭, C**.

Fm with C in bass → **C - E♭ - F**

That’s a **C minor triad** with F in the bass? Wait — Fm/C is **F minor chord** (F - A♭ - C) with C in the bass → so it’s **C - F - A♭** → which is **F minor 1st inversion**.

So the notes are: **C, F, A♭**

These are **not** in C# major or C# minor.

C# minor scale: C# D# E F# G# A B → No C natural, no A♭.

So what key has **C natural** and **A♭**?

→ **C minor**? Let's check:

C minor natural: C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭

Yes! **C minor** contains:  
C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭

So Fm (F - A♭ - C) is the **iv chord** in C minor.  
C# — that’s external.

Wait — perhaps this is **C minor** with some **chromatic passing or borrowed** chords?

But we also have **C# major** — which is **the major III chord** in C minor (III = E major in C minor? No — C minor’s III is E♭ major. C# major is *not* diatonic to C minor.)

C major scale: C D E F G A B  
C minor scale: C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭

C# major = C# E# G# — this is **not diatonic** to either C major or C minor.

So now we have **C# major** (sharp) and **Fm/C** (natural C and A♭) — very unusual.

---

### Step 4: Consider transposition — maybe the chord symbols are miswritten?

Let’s **assume** the **“C” in Fm/C and G#7/C** is meant to be **C#**, maybe a typo?

Try reading the progression assuming everything is in **C#**:

Original:
```
C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#
```

Change “Fm/C” → **Fm/C#**? But Fm/C# = F - A♭ - C / C# → still has A♭ and C natural. Not C#.

Change **Fm/C** → **F#m/C#**?

F#m = F# - A - C#  
F#m/C# = C# - F# - A → That’s **F# minor with C# bass** — which is a valid **ii chord** in E major? Or...

Wait — let's look at **C# major scale** again:

C# major: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#

So diatonic chords:

- I: C#
- ii: D#m
- iii: E#m
- IV: F#maj
- V: G#maj
- vi: A#m
- vii°: B#°

So if we map your chords to **C# major**:

- C# → I
- A#m → vi (A# minor) — perfect
- D#m → ii — perfect
- G#7 → V7! (G# major 7th chord — but G#7 usually implies G# B# D# F# — that’s actually **G#/D#**, **not** F# — wait, G#7 = G# B# D# F# — so the 7th is **F#**, **not** F natural!)

Ah! **G#7** includes **F#**, **not F natural** — and you have **G#7/C** — C natural again.

So if we have **G#7**, the F# is in the chord. But if you put a C natural under it, that’s a weird bass note.

But if you meant **G#7** to be in C# major, bass should be G# — not C.

So again: **C natural** is the problem.

---

### Step 5: What if the bass notes are wrong, and it's in **A# minor**?

A# minor scale: A# B# C# D# E# F# G# — same as C# major.

So A#m is vi in C# major.

Your progression is mostly C# and A#m. That fits major key with i-vi-i-vi motion.

But then you throw in Fm/C and G#7/C — both **not diatonic**.

What if **“Fm/C” is really “F#m/C#”**?

- F#m = F# A C# → F#m/C# = C# F# A — this is a **C# major chord with a 9th**? No—it’s a **F# minor triad over C#** — it’s equivalent to **C#add9** or **C#maj6** if you think of A as 6th.

Actually: **C# - E# - G#** = C# major  
Add A = C# - E# - G# - A → that’s not standard.

Wait — **F#m/C# = C# F# A** — that’s a **C# minor 6th?** No, because F# is #4, A is #6? Not standard.

Actually: **C# F# A** — intervals from C#:
- F# = 4th
- A = 6th

So C# - F# - A = **C# sus4 add 6**? Extremely non-standard.

But wait — **C# F# A** = **A major triad** in first inversion? No — A major is A C# E#.

C# F# A → it’s **F# minor** — just **inverted**.

So chord is **F#m** with C# bass.

In C# major, **ii chord is D#m**, IV is F#maj, V is G#maj.

F#m is **not diatonic** — unless in C# minor? C# natural minor has F# (yes), but F#m? F# is the 6th scale degree — chord would be F# diminished (if minor scale). C# harmonic minor has F# natural, but the chord is F# major or minor depending on 7th.

C# harmonic minor: C# D# E F# G# A B# → so F# is natural, chord on F#: F# A C# → **F# minor** — YES!

So in **C# harmonic minor**, F# minor is the **vi chord**!

Let’s rebuild with **C# harmonic minor**:

C# harmonic minor scale:  
C# D# E F# G# A B#

Diatonic chords:

- i: C#m (C# E G#)
- ii°: D#° (D# F# A)
- III+: E (E G# B#)
- iv: F#m (F# A C#)
- V: G#maj (G# B# D#) — or often V7: G#7 (G# B# D# F#)
- VI: A maj (A C# E#)
- vii°: B#° (B# D# F#)

So now look at your chords again:

Original:
```
C# — could be C# major? but in C# minor it should be C#m...
A#m/C# — A#m is not in C# minor. A# is the ♭VI in C# minor. But A# = B♭ — enharmonic.
Fm/C — F natural? Unlikely...
D#m/C# — D#m = ii° -> yes in harmonic minor
G#7/C — G#7 = V7, but C natural? Should be bass on G#.
```

Wait — **A#m/C#**

In C# minor, A# is the **♭VI**? But A# is **B♭** — and B♭ is **not** in C# minor (C# harmonic minor has A natural, not A#).

C# harmonic minor has: A natural — **A**, not A#.

So A# is **enharmonic to B♭** — which would be **♭VI**, but ♭VI is **B♭ major**, not A#m.

A#m = B♭m — that’s not a chord in C# harmonic minor.

This is getting too messy.

---

### Step 6: Most plausible answer — **It’s in C# major, but the “C” in bass is a TYPO**, and should be **C#**

That’s the **only way** this makes harmonic sense.

Assume:
- **Fm/C** → **F#m/C#**  
- **G#7/C** → **G#7/G#** or **G#7/C#**? G#7 over C# = C# G# B# D# F# — that’s not standard, but **C# is not in G#7**

Better: **G#7** should have bass on **G#**, so **G#7** — just the chord.

So corrected progression (assuming bass notes are typos or miswritten):

```
C# C# A#m A#m C# C# F#m D#m C# C# A#m A#m C# C# G#7 C#
```

Now it fits **C# major** perfectly:

- I (C#)
- vi (A#m)
- iv (F#m) ← Wait, F#m is **not** in C# major. C# major has **F#maj**

C# major: IV = F# major

F#m is from C# **minor** -> harmonic or melodic.

If we re-analyze as **C# minor harmonic**:

C# harmonic minor:  
Chords:
- i: C#m
- ii°: D#°
- III+: E
- iv: F#m
- V: G#maj (or G#7)
- VI: A#maj
- vii°: B#°

So chords now:

C#m — you have C# (major). So not matching.

What if the **chords are major**? C# is major. So perhaps **C# Mixolydian**, or something else?

---

### Final Insight: Let’s try **C# major as tonic, but borrow from parallel minor**

That’s standard.

C# major vs C# minor

In C# major:
- I: C#
- ii: D#m
- iii: E#m
- IV: F#maj
- V: G#maj
- vi: A#m
- vii°: B#°

We have:
- C# (I)
- A#m (vi)
- D#m (ii)
- G#7 (V7 — chromatic upper leading tone? G#7 has F# natural — that’s fine in C# major)

But what about **Fm/C**? F minor — that’s **♭iv** — borrowed from C# **minor**? But in C# minor, iv is F#m, not Fm.

Fm = F A♭ C — F is **not natural** in the C# scale.

F = ♭6 of C# major? C# major has A# as 6th — F = ♭6? ♭6 would be A natural.

**F natural is the ♭5?**

C# = 1  
D# = 2  
E# = 3  
F# = 4  
G# = 5  
A# = 6  
B# = 7  
C##= 8

F natural is **between E# and F#** → that’s **♭4**? E# is 3, F is ♭4? But it's not a scale degree — it’s chromatic.

F natural = ♭4? Not really — in C# major, ♭4 is **F natural** — yes!

So **Fm/C** = F minor triad with C bass = notes: C, F, A♭

C = root  
F = ♭4?  
A♭ = ♭6?

These are **all chromatic** — no function.

But wait — **C and F form a tritone** — pitch class relationship.

G#7 = G# B# D# F# → has **F#**, not F natural.

So **F natural** in Fm/C is **not related** to G#7.

---

### Realization:

This progression doesn't fit any standard key or mode **because of the C natural**.

The only **plausible, clean interpretation** is:

> **The bass notes “Fm/C” and “G#7/C” are typographical errors**, and should be:
> - **F#m/C#**
> - **G#7/C#** or just **G#7**

Assuming that, let's rewrite:

```
C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# F#m/C# D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7 C#
```

Now:
- All chords built on C# root or with C# bass
- A#m = vi
- D#m = ii
- F#m = ??? — **still not in C# major** — C# major has F#maj

F#m = F# A C# — this is the **iv chord** in **C# harmonic minor**.

So:

### FINAL ANSWER:

✅ **The key is C# harmonic minor**

Despite the initial C# major chords, the presence of **F#m** and **G#7** is diagnostic for **C# harmonic minor**, where:

- **F#m** is the **iv chord**  
- **G#7** is the **V7 chord** (even more important — dominant seventh is hallmark of harmonic minor)

Also, **A#m** is the **VI chord** (in harmonic minor, VI is major — but here it's A#m? Wait! **Problem!**)

In C# harmonic minor, VI chord is **A# major** (A# C# E#), not A# minor!

So if you have **A#m**, that’s **not diatonic** to harmonic minor — it’s from natural minor.

In C# **natural minor**:  
A#m = vi — yes! Natural minor: A# is vi.

So now we have:

- C# major? → perhaps tonic is being treated as major
- A#m → vi from natural minor
- F#m → iv from harmonic minor
- G#7 → V7 from harmonic minor

So we have **a hybrid** of **C# natural minor** and **C# harmonic minor**

But **C# major** is used throughout — so this suggests a **C# major key with frequent modal mixture (borrowed chords)**.

But **F#m and G#7** are still **from harmonic minor**, not major.

So best fit:

> **Key: C# minor (harmonic) — with tonic as C# major (borrowed from major mode)**

→ This is a very common phenomenon in pop/rock: **minor key tonic with major I chord** (e.g., “Stairway to Heaven” — A minor key, but I chord is A major).

Thus:

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> **Key: C# minor (harmonic)**  
> **Mode: Minor (with tonic major chord — raised 3rd for tonic chord)**  
> — a hybrid of harmonic minor with **major I chord** for stronger resolution.

### Chord analysis in C# harmonic minor:
- **C#** — **i (major)** — borrowed from major mode (common)
- **A#m** — **VI** — but should be **A# major** in harmonic minor. → If it’s A#m, then it’s borrowed from **C# natural minor** (where VI is minor)
- **F#m** — **iv** — diatonic in harmonic minor ✅
- **D#m** — **ii°** — in harmonic minor this should be **diminished**, but D#m is minor — not diatonic. Wait — D#m = D# F# A — in C# harmonic minor: D# F# A would be **D# F# A natural** — A is not in scale (scale has A#). So D#m is **not diatonic**. D#° = D# F# A — with A natural? Again — **A natural is not in C# harmonic minor** — it has **A#**.

So D#m also requires **A natural**.

Wait — this brings us back: **A** (natural) is appearing — **not A#**.

So maybe the key is **A minor**?

Let’s try **A minor** as the key.

A natural minor: A B C D E F G  
Chords: Am, B°, C, Dm, Em, F, G

G#7 = G# B# D# F# — not in A minor.

Fm = F A♭ C — F natural, A♭ — again, not in A minor.

This isn’t working.

### Last possibility: **C major** with **C#** as a chromatic shift?

C major scale: C D E F G A B

C# is chromatic — Fm = iv in C minor? Still F natural.

**I think the conclusion is:**

> The progression contains **incompatible accidentals** — **C natural**, **A♭**, and **C#**, **F#** — and cannot belong to one key.
>
> BUT — the majority of chords and the repetition suggest **C# as the tonal center**, and **C# harmonic minor** is the best fit — **with bass notes "Fm/C" and "G#7/C" being typos**.
>
> The intended chords were likely:
> - **F#m/C#**
> - **G#7/C#** or **G#7** (bass on G#)
>
> Assuming that correction:

---

## ✅ FINAL ANSWER:

> **Key: C# harmonic minor**  
> **Mode: Minor (harmonic)**  
> **Tonic chord being major (C#) — chromatic alteration for stronger resolution (common in modern music)**

### Chord interpretation in C# harmonic minor:
| Chord | Function | In C# Harmonic Minor |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|
| C#    | i (major) — borrowed from major | Tonic (tonic is usually minor, but often made major) |
| A#m   | VI — should be major, but minor here — borrowed from natural minor |
| F#m   | iv — diatonic ✅ |
| D#m   | ii° expected, but D#m used — likely typo or error, should be D#° |
| G#7   | V7 — diatonic ✅ |
| C#    | I — resolution |

**Conclusion**:  
The progression is **primarily in C# harmonic minor**, with the **tonic chord as major** (C#) for stronger cadence — a very common practice in pop, rock, and metal — and the **first two bass notes “C” are likely errors** that should be **C#**.

Replace “Fm/C” → **F#m/C#** and “G#7/C” → **G#7** or **G#7/G#**, and the key becomes unmistakable.

✅ **Key: C# harmonic minor**

🛠️ *If you can confirm the bass notes or notation, that would help — but given standard theory, this is the most logical key.*

**Assistant - Qwen3 Max**

To determine the key and mode of the given chord progression:

**Chords:**
C# – A#m/C# – A#m/C# – C# – C# – Fm/C – D#m/C# – C# – C# – A#m/C# – A#m/C# – C# – C# – G#7/C – C#

---

### Step 1: Analyze the chords and identify possible key centers

First, notice that **C# major** appears very frequently (as a tonic chord). This suggests **C#** may be the **tonic** (home key).

Now look at the other chords:

- **A#m** (A# minor)  
- **Fm** (F minor)  
- **D#m** (D# minor)  
- **G#7** (G# dominant 7)

All of these can be analyzed relative to **C# major** or **C# minor**.

---

### Step 2: Consider C# major scale

C# major scale:  
**C# – D# – E# – F# – G# – A# – B#**

Chords diatonic to C# major:
- I: C#  
- ii: D#m  
- iii: E#m  
- IV: F#  
- V: G#  
- vi: A#m  
- vii°: B#°

So in C# major:
- **C#** = I ✔️  
- **A#m** = vi ✔️  
- **D#m** = ii ✔️  
- **G#7** = V7 ✔️

But what about **Fm** (F minor)?  
F natural is **not in C# major** (C# major has F#).  
F natural = **♭5** relative to C# → This is **outside** the key.

However, **Fm/C** appears only once. Could it be a chromatic passing chord or borrowed?

---

### Step 3: Consider C# minor

C# natural minor: C# – D# – E – F# – G# – A – B  
Harmonic minor raises B → B# (enharmonic to C)  
Melodic minor raises A and B ascending.

In C# minor:
- i: C#m → but we have **C# major**, not minor.  
So C# **major** chord is not diatonic to C# minor → suggests **not minor key**.

Thus, **C# major** is more likely.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Fm and G#7/C

- **Fm/C**: F–A♭–C, with C in bass.  
  Enharmonically, F = **E#**, A♭ = **G#**, so Fm = **E# minor**? But that’s unusual.

Better: Treat F as **♭VI** in C# major?  
In C# major, VI = A#, so ♭VI = A natural → not F.

Alternative: Think **modally** or as **borrowed chords**.

But note: **Fm** contains **A♭**, which is **G#** enharmonically, and **C** (which is B# in C# major). So:

- F = **F natural** → not in C# major  
- But **Fm/C** = C in bass, with F–A♭–C → intervals from C: F (perfect 4th), A♭ (minor 6th)

Wait—perhaps reinterpret the key enharmonically.

---

### Step 5: Enharmonic reinterpretation

C# is enharmonic to **D♭**. Sometimes analyzing in **D♭ major** is easier.

D♭ major scale: D♭ – E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭ – C

Chords in D♭:
- I: D♭  
- ii: E♭m  
- iii: Fm  
- IV: G♭  
- V: A♭  
- vi: B♭m  
- vii°: C°

Now, map your chords:

- C# = D♭ → I ✔️  
- A#m = B♭m → vi ✔️  
- D#m = E♭m → ii ✔️  
- G#7 = A♭7 → V7 ✔️  
- **Fm** = iii ✔️

**Aha!** All chords now make sense in **D♭ major**:

- D♭ (I)  
- B♭m (vi)  
- Fm (iii)  
- E♭m (ii)  
- A♭7 (V7)

And the bass notes:
- A#m/C# → B♭m/D♭ → first inversion of vi  
- Fm/C → Fm over C = C is **7th scale degree (C)** in D♭ → this is **iii/7** or just a slash chord with leading tone in bass  
- D#m/C# → E♭m/D♭ → ii/I  
- G#7/C → A♭7/C → V7 with third (C) in bass → common voicing

So all chords are **diatonic to D♭ major**, which is enharmonic to **C# major**.

---

### Step 6: Final determination

- **Key**: C# major (or D♭ major — same pitch class, but C# is used in notation)  
- **Mode**: **Ionian** (i.e., major)

Despite the use of slash chords and one seemingly odd Fm, **Fm is the iii chord in C# major** if we treat F as **E#**? Wait—no: in C# major, the iii chord is **E#m**, not Fm.

But **E# = F**, and **E#m = E#–G#–B#**, whereas **Fm = F–A♭–C**.

Are these enharmonically the same?

- E# = F  
- G# = A♭  
- B# = C

So **E#m = F–A♭–C** = **Fm**

✅ Yes! **E# minor is enharmonically F minor**.

Therefore, **Fm = iii chord in C# major**, just spelled enharmonically for ease.

Similarly:
- A#m = A#–C#–E# = vi chord  
- D#m = D#–F#–A# = ii chord  
- G#7 = G#–B#–D#–F# = V7 chord

All fit **C# major**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

- **Key**: **C# major**  
- **Mode**: **Ionian (Major)**

The progression is firmly in **C# major**, using diatonic chords (I–vi–iii–ii–V7), with inversions (slash chords) for voice leading.

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking**

### Reasoning

**Determining Chord Identity**

The chord progression's structure is now parsed. I'm focusing on the repeated root notes and the altered bass notes to identify potential key centers and modulations. The recurring C# suggests it might be the tonic, but the frequent A#m and Fm chords hint at a minor key or modal borrowing. Currently evaluating the harmonic function of each chord within the progression.


**Pinpointing Key and Mode**

My assessment now hinges on identifying the key signature by matching chords against potential major/minor scales. Notably, the progression's opening and closing on C# strongly indicate C# major as a likely key. I'm cross-referencing the chords to find tonal matches, which, despite the presence of minor chords, seem to be aligning with the C# major scale.


**Deciphering the Harmonic Function**

I've dissected each chord, aligning them with a potential C# major key signature, and their functions within it. The presence of minor chords suggests possible modal interchange, but the repeated C# and G#7 firmly anchor the progression in a C# major tonality. Focusing now on the bass notes to clarify the harmonic movement.


**Evaluating Harmonic Stability**

I'm now zeroing in on the bass notes' influence, as they reshape the chord's function. The bass line underscores a strong pull toward C# with frequent tonic pedal points and chromatic movements. The inclusion of G#7/C further stabilizes the sense of C# major. I now believe the repeated tonic and dominant functions are very strong.


**Finalizing the Tonal Analysis**

I've rigorously analyzed the chord functions and bass movements, confirming that the minor chords are diatonic through enharmonic equivalents. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the key of C# major with a clear Ionian mode. The final step involves a decisive judgment on the tonal center, based on the harmonic implications.




This chord progression exhibits a strong functional harmony structure, typical of Western classical and pop music.

## Harmonic Analysis:

1.  **Tonic Identification:** The progression begins and ends on $C\#$ Major, overwhelmingly suggesting $C\#$ is the tonic (I). The $C\#$ is also often sustained as a pedal tone in the bass (e.g., $A\#m/C\#$, $D\#m/C\#$).
    *   **I:** $C\#$ Major

2.  **Diatonic Chords in $C\#$ Major:** The $C\#$ Major scale contains the following notes: $C\#, D\#, E\#, F\#, G\#, A\#, B\#$.
    *   **vi:** $A\#$ minor ($A\#m$) - This functions as the relative minor/tonic substitute. (Fits)
    *   **ii:** $D\#$ minor ($D\#m$) - This functions as a strong predominant chord. (Fits)
    *   **V:** $G\#$ Major / $G\#7$ - The dominant chord, which creates tension resolving to $C\#$. (Fits)
    *   **iii:** $E\#$ minor ($E\#m$) - This chord must be present to account for $Fm$. In keys with many sharps, minor chords built on $E\#$ are often written enharmonically as $Fm$ for readability. Assuming $Fm$ is an enharmonic representation of $E\#m$. (Fits)

3.  **Chord Function and Movement:**
    The progression follows a classic I - vi - ii - V functional pattern (with some passing/substitute chords like Fm):
    $C\#$ (I) $\to$ $A\#m$ (vi) $\to$ $Fm$ (iii enharm.) $\to$ $D\#m$ (ii) $\to$ $G\#7$ (V7) $\to$ $C\#$ (I).

4.  **Role of Bass Line:** The specific voicings heavily underline the $C\#$ tonal center, particularly the **pedal point** effect of having $C\#$ in the bass under $A\#m$ and $D\#m$. The $G\#7/C$ is particularly strong; the note $C$ is the enharmonic spelling of $B\#$, the leading tone of $C\#$, creating maximum pull back to the tonic.

## Conclusion

**Key:** $C\#$ Major

**Mode:** Major (Ionian Mode)

*(Note: The harmony is entirely diatonic to $C\#$ Major, confirming the Major mode established by the I and V7 chords.)*

**Assistant - Gemini 2.5 Flash**

This is an interesting request because the sequence of chords suggests a key and then immediately introduces a stylistic choice that complicates the strict traditional mode determination.

Here is the analysis:

### Chord Sequence Analysis

The chord sequence provided is:
**C# | C# | A#m/C# | A#m/C# | C# | C# | Fm/C | D#m/C# | C# | C# | A#m/C# | A#m/C# | C# | C# | G#7/C | C#**

#### 1. The Tonic and Primary Chords (The Key Center)

*   The sequence begins and ends heavily on **C# Major**. This strongly establishes **C#** as the tonic (I).
*   The second most frequent chord is **A# minor (A#m)**, which is the relative minor (vi) of C# Major.

#### 2. Functional Harmony (Deduction of the Major Key)

The major key of C# has the following diatonic chords:

| Degree | Chord Type | Chord Name |
| :----: | :--------: | :--------: |
| **I**  | Major      | **C#**     |
| II     | minor      | D#m        |
| III    | minor      | Fm         |
| **IV** | Major      | F#         |
| **V**  | Major      | **G#**     |
| **VI** | minor      | **A#m**    |
| VII    | Diminished | B#dim      |

The chords used in the sequence are:
*   **C#** (I)
*   **A#m** (vi)
*   **D#m** (ii)
*   **G#7** (V7)

The presence of the **I, vi, ii, and V7** chords is the cornerstone of standard **C# Major** harmony. This unambiguously establishes the **key center as C# Major**.

---

### Analysis of Non-Diatonic/Deviant Chords (Mode/Style Determination)

The chord sequence contains two highly unusual chords for the key of C# Major:

1.  **F minor (Fm):** The diatonic iii chord in C# Major is **E# minor** (which is enharmonically F minor, *Fm*). However, the spelling here is crucial. If we assume the natural minor (Aeolian) scale, the iii chord is indeed **F minor**. If we follow C# Major (Ionian), the iii chord is E#m. In classical theory, Fm (III) would often imply a shift toward the relative minor (A#m) or be heard as a modal interchange chord from the parallel C# minor. *In common practice, Fm is generally interchangeable with E#m when hearing the harmony.*
2.  **Harmonic Context of the Slash Chords:** The use of **A#m/C#**, **D#m/C#**, **Fm/C**, and **G#7/C** reveals a specific compositional technique: keeping the bass note constant (C# or sometimes C) while the harmony changes above it (a pedal point or inverted voicing). This is a common characteristic of Gospel, Neo-Soul, and contemporary pop music where the bass line serves a smooth, continuous path while the chords provide color.

#### The Modes: Ionian vs. Aeolian

Since we have a strong tonic of C# and frequently use chords like D#m (ii) and G#7 (V7), we are firmly rooted in the Major tonality.

*   **Key:** **C# Major**
*   **Mode:** **Ionian** (The fundamental major scale mode).

---

### Conclusion

The piece is in the **Key of C# Major**.

The mode is **Ionian**, but the harmonic choices (the specific slash chords and the passing use of Fm/C) utilize aspects of **modal harmony and suspensions**, characteristic of contemporary styles, rather than a strictly simple C# Major/Ionian progression.

**Final Answer:**

*   **Key:** **C# Major**
*   **Mode:** **Ionian**

**Assistant - Kimi K2**

Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: List the chords and their notes
We need to determine the notes in each chord. The chords are:

1. **C#** (C# major)  
   Notes: C#, E#, G#

2. **A#m/C#** (A# minor with C# in the bass)  
   This is just an A# minor chord (A#, C#, E#) with C# in the bass, so the notes are the same: A#, C#, E#.

3. **Fm/C** (F minor with C in the bass)  
   F minor is F, Ab, C. The bass note is C, so the notes are F, Ab, C.

4. **D#m/C#** (D# minor with C# in the bass)  
   D# minor is D#, F#, A#. The bass note is C#, so the notes are D#, F#, A#, C#.

5. **G#7/C** (G# dominant 7th with C in the bass)  
   G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#. The bass note is C (which is enharmonic to B#), so this is G#7 in third inversion. The notes are G#, B# (C), D#, F#.

### Step 2: Collect all unique notes
From all the chords, the unique notes are:
- C#, D#, E#, F, F#, G#, A#, C, Ab

Now, let's reorder these enharmonically to make sense of them (using flats for easier reading where possible):
- C, Db, D#, E (E#), F, F#, G#, A#, B# (C)

This is messy because of the enharmonic equivalents and the mixing of sharps and flats. Let's instead think in terms of the key.

### Step 3: Look for the tonic
The progression starts and ends on C#, and C# is the most frequent chord. This suggests C# is the tonic.

### Step 4: Check the mode
Now, let's see what the other chords imply about the mode. We'll assume C# is the tonic and see what scale fits.

The chords imply these scale degrees (relative to C#):
1. C# (I)
2. A#m (vi) - A# is the 6th degree of C# major scale.
3. Fm (iv) - F is the 3rd degree of C# major scale, but Fm is not diatonic to C# major (F# is the diatonic 3rd). This is a borrowed chord.
4. D#m (iii) - D# is the 3rd degree of C# major scale, but D#m is diatonic (C# major has an E# which is the 3rd of C#, but D# is the 2nd, and D#m is the ii chord in C# major... wait, no: D# is the major 2nd, so D#m is ii, but in C# major the ii chord is D#m, which is correct. But here D#m is over C#, which is the 7th (C# is the root, so this is D#m with a major 7th in the bass, which is odd).
5. G#7 (V7) - G# is the 5th degree of C# major scale, and G#7 is the dominant V7 chord, which is diatonic.

The presence of Fm (which contains an A-natural, not A#) is a clue that we're borrowing from parallel minor. In C# major, the diatonic chords are:
- I: C#
- ii: D#m
- iii: E#m (F minor enharmonically, but E#m is rare)
- IV: F#
- V: G#
- vi: A#m
- vii°: B#dim

But we have Fm, which is the parallel minor's iv chord (C# minor's iv is F#m, but C# major's parallel minor is C# minor, which has F#m as iv, not Fm). Wait, no: Fm is not diatonic to C# minor either (C# minor has F#m as iv). 

This suggests we're in C# major but borrowing Fm from the parallel minor (C# minor), which is a common modal mixture. The A-natural in Fm is the b6 of C# major, which is a characteristic of the parallel minor.

### Step 5: Confirm the key and mode
The progression is:
C# (I) - A#m (vi) - Fm (borrowed iv from parallel minor) - D#m (ii) - G#7 (V7) - C# (I)

This is firmly in C# major, with a borrowed Fm from the parallel minor (C# minor). The mode is thus **C# major** (Ionian), with modal mixture.

### Final answer:
The key is **C# major** (Ionian mode), with a borrowed Fm chord from the parallel minor (C# minor).

**Assistant - GPT 5 Chat**

Let's analyze the given chord sequence:  

```
C#   C#   A#m/C#   A#m/C#   
C#   C#   Fm/C     D#m/C#  
C#   C#   A#m/C#   A#m/C#   
C#   C#   G#7/C    C#
```

### Step 1. Identify pitch content
We have the following chord roots:  
- **C# major**
- **A#m (A# minor)**
- **Fm (F minor)**
- **D#m (D# minor)**
- **G#7 (G# dominant seventh)**  

And most chords are **over a C# bass**.

### Step 2. Look at possible parent keys
These chords all fit neatly in **C# major** (or its relative **A# minor**):

| Degree | In C# major | Chord shown |
|:-------|:-------------|:-------------|
| I      | C# major     | C#           |
| ii     | D#m          | D#m/C#       |
| iii    | E#m (Fm enharmonic) | Fm/C     |
| vi     | A#m          | A#m/C#       |
| V7     | G#7          | G#7/C        |

### Step 3. Bass and function
The bass stays mostly on **C#**, reinforcing **C#** as the tonic center rather than A# minor (which would sound like a vi mode).  
The progression ends and often returns to C#, and G#7 (the dominant) resolves naturally to C#, sealing the sense of **C# major**.

### ✅ Conclusion:
**Key:** C♯ major  
**Mode:** Ionian (major)

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking**

### Reasoning

First, the user has given a sequence of chords: C#, A#m/C#, A#m/C#, C#, C#, Fm/C, D#m/C#, C#, C#, A#m/C#, A#m/C#, C#, C#, G#7/C, C#.

I need to determine the key and mode. Key refers to the tonic or home note, and mode could be major or minor, or something else.

These chords are written with slashes, which often indicate bass notes or inversions. For example, "A#m/C#" means an A# minor chord with a C# in the bass. Similarly, "Fm/C" means F minor with C in the bass, and "G#7/C" means G# dominant 7th with C in the bass.

To find the key, I should look at the chords and see which notes are emphasized, especially the tonic chord.

List out the chords without the bass notes to simplify:

- C# (could be C# major or minor? Typically written as C# means major, and C#m would be minor. But here, C# is listed, and others have m for minor, so C# is probably C# major.

Chords:

- C# (assume C# major)

- A#m/C# (A# minor with C# bass)

- A#m/C# (same)

- C# (major)

- C# (major)

- Fm/C (F minor with C bass)

- D#m/C# (D# minor with C# bass)

- C# (major)

- C# (major)

- A#m/C# (A# minor with C# bass)

- A#m/C# (same)

- C# (major)

- C# (major)

- G#7/C (G# dominant 7th with C bass)

- C# (major)

Now, let's list the root chords without inversions:

- C# major appears many times.

- A# minor appears several times.

- F minor appears once.

- D# minor appears once.

- G#7 (dominant 7th) appears once.

The bass notes are C# in many cases, which might emphasize C# as a tonic.

Now, to determine the key, I need to see which key these chords fit into.

First, let's think about the notes involved.

C# major chord: C#, E#, G# (since E# is F, but in music theory, it's E# in C# major scale).

Standard keys:

- C# major scale: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, C# (all sharps, equivalent to Db major but enharmonic).

But A# minor is the relative minor of C# major? Relative minor is the sixth degree.

In major scale, chords:

I - C# major

ii - D# minor

iii - E# minor (which is F minor? E# is F, so E# minor would be F minor, but F minor has Ab, not A#. Messy.

Perhaps it's better to think in terms of sharps and flats.

C# major has 7 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#.

Chords in C# major:

I - C# major

ii - D# minor

iii - E# minor (F minor enharmonic? But F minor is not typically written as E# minor; it's messy.)

E# minor would be E#, G#, B#, but E# is F, G# is Ab? No, in equal temperament, but in notation, it's inconsistent.

Perhaps this is in a key with fewer sharps or flats.

Let's list the chords and see their roots:

- C# major

- A# minor

- F minor

- D# minor

- G#7

Now, A# minor: A#, C#, E# (which is F)

F minor: F, Ab, C

D# minor: D#, F#, A#

G#7: G#, B#, D#, F# (B# is C)

C# major: C#, E#, G# (E# is F)

Notice that many chords have C# in them or as bass.

Also, G#7 is a dominant 7th chord, which typically resolves to the tonic.

In this sequence, G#7/C to C#, so G#7 to C#. G#7 to C# is a V7 to I in C# major? V7 of C# major would be G#7, and I is C# major. Yes!

G#7 is G# dominant 7th, which is the V7 chord in C# major.

In C# major, V is G# major, V7 is G#7.

And it resolves to C# major.

Now, other chords: A# minor. In C# major, vi chord is A# minor? Let's see the scale degrees.

C# major scale: C# (1), D# (2), E# (3), F# (4), G# (5), A# (6), B# (7)

So chords:

I - C# major

ii - D# minor

iii - E# minor (but E# is F, so often written as F minor? No, in C# major, iii is E# minor, which is enharmonic to F minor, but F minor has Ab, whereas E# minor has E# and B#, which are F and C, so it's the same pitches but different spelling.

In standard music theory, in C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, but it's rarely used because of the double sharps, so often pieces are written in Db major instead for simplicity.

But here, the chords are written with sharps, so likely C# major.

A# minor is the vi chord in C# major.

D# minor is the ii chord in C# major.

F minor: F minor is not in C# major. In C# major, the IV chord is F# major, not F minor.

F minor has F, Ab, C. In C# major, the note F is not present; it's E# or F#.

C# major has E# (F) and F#, so F natural is not in the scale.

F minor chord: F, Ab, C.

In C# major, the notes are C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#. So F natural (which is E#) is actually in the scale as the third degree, but F minor chord has F, Ab, C.

Ab is not in C# major; C# major has A# which is Bb enharmonic, but A# is not Ab.

A# is A sharp, which is B flat, and Ab is G sharp? Let's clarify.

A# is the same as Bb.

Ab is the same as G#.

In C# major, A# is the sixth degree, which is A sharp, equivalent to B flat.

But Ab is A flat, which is G sharp, and in C# major, G# is the fifth degree.

F minor chord: F, Ab, C.

F: in C# major, is it E#? E# is F, so yes, F is E# in C# major.

Ab: in C# major, is there Ab? No, C# major has G# and A#, no Ab. Ab would be the flattened sixth or something.

In C# major, the notes are C#, D#, E# (F), F#, G#, A# (Bb), B# (C). So no Ab; Ab is not in the scale.

Similarly, for F minor, Ab is not in C# major.

But in the chord sequence, there is Fm/C, which is F minor with C bass.

C is in C# major? C# major has B# which is C, so C is the seventh degree, but it's B# in the scale.

B# is C, so C is present as the leading tone.

But F minor has F and Ab. F is E# in C# major, so it's the third degree, but Ab is not in the scale; Ab would be the flattened sixth if we think modally.

Perhaps this is not purely in C# major; there might be borrowed chords or modulation.

Let's list all the chords with their roots and qualities:

- C# major (I)

- A# minor (vi)

- A# minor (vi)

- C# major (I)

- C# major (I)

- F minor (?) not in key

- D# minor (ii)

- C# major (I)

- C# major (I)

- A# minor (vi)

- A# minor (vi)

- C# major (I)

- C# major (I)

- G#7 (V7)

- C# major (I)

So, most chords are I, vi, ii, V7 in C# major, but F minor is odd.

F minor: what is F minor in relation to C# major?

C# major is the tonic. F minor could be a borrowed chord from parallel minor or something.

C# major parallel minor is C# minor.

C# minor scale: C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B, C# (natural minor) or harmonic minor with B#.

Chords in C# minor:

i - C# minor

ii° - D# diminished

III - E major

iv - F# minor

v - G# minor

VI - A major

VII - B major

But here we have F minor, not F# minor.

F minor is F, Ab, C.

In C# minor, the iv chord is F# minor, which is F#, A, C#.

F minor is different.

Perhaps it's a different key.

Maybe the key is C# minor? But the chords include C# major, not minor. The C# chords are written as C#, which is major, and A#m is minor, but A# minor is not in C# minor.

C# minor has A major as VI chord, not A# minor.

A# minor would be in a key with more sharps.

Let's think about the bass notes. Many chords have C# in the bass, like A#m/C#, D#m/C#, which means the bass is C#, so C# is emphasized as a pedal point or tonic.

Similarly, G#7/C has C in the bass, which is unusual.

G#7/C means G#7 chord with C in the bass, so the notes are G#, B#, D#, F# with C in bass. B# is C, so it's G#, C, D#, F#? G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#, and with C bass, it's C, G#, B#, D#, F#, but B# is C, so it's C, G#, C, D#, F#, which has double C, so it's like a C major with added notes, but G#7 is dominant.

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant or something.

Another way: perhaps the key is C# major, and F minor is a borrowed chord from C# phrygian or something.

C# phrygian would be C#, D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#? Phrygian has flattened second.

Not sure.

Let's list the scale degrees based on C# as tonic.

Assume C# is tonic.

Then chords:

- I: C# major

- vi: A# minor? In C# major, vi is A# minor, yes.

- ii: D# minor, yes.

- V7: G#7, yes.

- But F minor: what degree is F minor? F is the fourth degree? In C# major, IV is F# major, not F minor.

F is the lowered fourth? ♭IV?

In major keys, ♭IV is sometimes used, like in the "backdoor cadence" or borrowed from parallel minor.

In C# major, parallel minor is C# minor, which has iv as F# minor, not F minor.

F minor would be even flatter.

Perhaps it's a neapolitan chord or something.

Another thought: maybe the key is not C# major, but something else.

Let's look at the first few chords: C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# so I vi vi I I

Then Fm/C D#m/C# so IV? but Fm is not IV.

Fm/C: F minor with C bass. C is the dominant of F? Not sure.

D#m/C# is ii with tonic bass.

Then back to I vi I I V7 I.

G#7/C to C#, so V7 with something in bass to I.

G#7/C: G#7 is V7, with C in bass. C is the seventh of G#7? G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#, so the seventh is F#, not C. With C bass, it's adding a C, which is not in the chord.

In C# major, C is B#, the leading tone, so it's the major seventh, but in G#7, it's dominant, so seventh is F#, which is the fourth of C#.

G#7 has F# as seventh, which is the fourth of C#.

With C in bass, C is B# in C# major, so it's like having the tonic note in bass before resolving.

But in terms of chord, G#7/C is essentially a G#7 chord with C in the bass, so the overall sound might be like a C# major with added tension.

Perhaps it's a passing chord.

But let's focus on the key.

Another idea: perhaps the mode is minor, but the tonic is C#.

If C# is tonic, and chords include C# major, so it's major mode? But A# minor is vi, which is common in major keys.

But F minor doesn't fit.

Let's list all root notes: C#, A#, A#, C#, C#, F, D#, C#, C#, A#, A#, C#, C#, G#, C#

Bass notes: for A#m/C#, bass is C#, for D#m/C#, bass is C#, for Fm/C, bass is C, for G#7/C, bass is C, and others have implied bass same as root for C#.

So bass is mostly C#, but sometimes C.

C is the leading tone in C# major.

In the sequence, when bass is C, it's on Fm and G#7.

Fm/C and G#7/C.

Fm/C: F minor with C bass, so notes F, Ab, C with C bass, so emphasis on C.

G#7/C: G#7 with C bass, notes G#, B#, D#, F# with C bass, so C, G#, B#, D#, F#, but B# is C, so it's C, G#, C, D#, F#, which is like a C major 7 #5 or something, but G#7 is V7, so with C bass, it might be functioning as a dominant with added note.

In jazz, sometimes chords have altered bass.

But for key determination, the recurring tonic is C# major, as it starts and ends with C#, and V7 resolves to it.

The odd chord is Fm.

Fm could be a borrowed chord from the parallel minor or from another mode.

In C# major, the ♭VI chord would be A major, not F minor.

♭VI is A major in C# major? C# major, ♭VI would be lowering the sixth, so A natural instead of A#, so A major.

But here it's F minor, which is not A.

F minor has root F.

Perhaps it's a secondary dominant or something.

F minor to what? Fm/C to D#m/C#, so Fm to D#m.

D#m is ii in C# major.

F minor could be the v of ii? ii is D# minor, so v of D# minor would be A# minor? D# minor key, v is A# minor? D# minor scale: D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B, C#? Let's not complicate.

Perhaps Fm is a passing chord or a chromaticism.

But let's see the overall.

Another thought: perhaps the key is C# minor, but the chords include C# major, which is the parallel major? But in minor keys, the i chord is minor, but here C# is major, so it's not minor.

Unless it's modal mixture.

But let's list the chords in order: C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#

So the progression is: I - vi - vi - I - I - ? - ii - I - I - vi - vi - I - I - V7 - I

The ? is Fm/C.

Fm/C could be seen as a iv chord in some context? But in C# major, iv would be F# minor, not F minor.

F minor is a half step lower than F# minor.

In C# major, if we borrow from C# phrygian, phrygian has ♭2, but here it's ♭4? F instead of F#.

C# phrygian would be C#, D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#? Still F#.

C# locrian? C#, D, E, F, G, A, B, C#? But locrian has diminished fifth, not minor.

F minor has perfect fifth.

Perhaps it's a neapolitan chord. Neapolitan chord is ♭II, which in C# would be D major, not F minor.

♭II is D major in C# key.

F minor is ♭IV? In C# major, ♭IV would be F major, not minor.

♭IV major is sometimes used, but here it's minor.

F minor is iii? In C# major, iii is E# minor, which is F minor enharmonic? E# minor is E#, G#, B#, which is F, G#, C, so F, G#, C? G# is Ab? No, G# is G sharp, so E# minor is F, G#, C? F, G#, C is not a standard minor chord; minor chord is root, minor third, perfect fifth.

E# minor: root E#, minor third G#, perfect fifth B#.

E# is F, G# is Ab? No, G# is G sharp, which is A flat, but in terms of pitch, E# minor chord has pitches F, G#, C? B# is C, so yes, F, G#, C.

But G# is not Ab; G# and Ab are enharmonic, but in spelling, G# is used in sharp keys.

In C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, which is spelled E#, G#, B#, and sounds like F, G#, C.

But F, G#, C is an augmented second? F to G# is augmented second, but in equal temperament, it's a minor third? F to G# is a minor third? F to G is major second, F to G# is augmented second, which is enharmonic to minor third, so yes, it's a minor chord.

E# minor is enharmonic to F minor? E# minor has E#, G#, B# which is F, G#, C, and F minor has F, Ab, C, and G# and Ab are the same pitch, so yes, E# minor is enharmonic to F minor!

In C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, which is exactly F minor in terms of pitch, but spelled differently.

In music theory, in C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, and it's rarely used because of the spelling, but in practice, it's the same as F minor.

Similarly, in other keys with many sharps, chords can be enharmonic.

So, in C# major, the iii chord is E# minor, which is F minor enharmonic.

In the chord sequence, it's written as Fm, which is common to use the enharmonic equivalent for readability.

Similarly, A# minor is vi, D# minor is ii, G#7 is V7, all fit in C# major.

And the bass notes: A#m/C# means A# minor with C# bass, so it's the first inversion of vi chord.

Similarly, D#m/C# is first inversion of ii chord.

Fm/C: F minor with C bass, so in C# major, iii chord is E# minor, with C bass? C is B# in C# major, so E# minor with B# in bass? E# minor chord is E#, G#, B#, so with B# in bass, it's first inversion? Root position E# minor is E#, G#, B#, so first inversion is G#, B#, E#, which is G#, C, F? G#, C, F.

But in the sequence, it's Fm/C, which is F, Ab, C with C bass, so if F is E#, Ab is G#, C is B#, so it's E#, G#, B# with B# in bass, so yes, first inversion of iii chord.

Similarly, G#7/C: G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#, with C bass, C is B#, so it's G#7 with B# in bass, which is not standard, but might be a way to emphasize the leading tone.

In root position, G#7 is G#, B#, D#, F#, so with B# in bass, it's first inversion? First inversion of G#7 would be B#, D#, F#, G#, which is C, D#, F#, G#.

But in the sequence, it's G#7/C, so notes C, G#, B#, D#, F#, which is the same as first inversion G#7? First inversion G#7 is B#, D#, F#, G#, so yes, with C (B#) in bass, it's first inversion.

In standard notation, first inversion of G#7 would be written as G#7/B# or something, but here it's G#7/C, and C is B#, so it's enharmonic.

Similarly, for other chords, the bass is often C#, which is tonic, so it's like pedal point or emphasizing tonic.

So, all chords fit in C# major:

- C#: I

- A#m/C#: vi6 (first inversion)

- Similarly, A#m/C#: vi6

- C#: I

- C#: I

- Fm/C: iii6 (first inversion of iii)

- D#m/C#: ii6 (first inversion of ii)

- C#: I

- C#: I

- A#m/C#: vi6

- A#m/C#: vi6

- C#: I

- C#: I

- G#7/C: V6/5? First inversion of V7? V7 first inversion is V6/5, which is the third in bass.

G#7 first inversion: B#, D#, F#, G#, so bass B# (C), and it's often written as G#7/B# or enharmonic.

Here it's G#7/C, so yes.

- C#: I

So the progression is: I - vi6 - vi6 - I - I - iii6 - ii6 - I - I - vi6 - vi6 - I - I - V6/5 - I

All in C# major.

The mode is major, since the tonic chord is major.

Key: C# major

Mode: major

But in the sequence, it's written with chords like Fm, which is enharmonic for E#m, but in practice, it's fine.

Similarly, A#m is correct for vi.

So, key is C# major.

To confirm, the V7 resolves to I, and it starts and ends with I.

Also, the frequent use of C# in bass reinforces the tonic.

So, I think key is C# major, mode is major.

Now, for the response, I should state the key and mode.

The user said "Determine key and mode", so probably key is C# major, mode is major.

In music, mode often refers to major or minor, but in this case, it's major.

Sometimes mode could be ionian, but typically we say major.

So, key: C# major

Mode: major

But to be precise, since it's C# major, the mode is ionian, but commonly we say major.

In the context, I think "major" is fine.

Now, for the response, I should explain briefly.

Since the user might not need a detailed theory lesson, but since it's a question, I should justify.

But the instruction is to respond as DeepSeek, so keep it helpful.

Also, format with backticks for terms.

So, in response, I can say:

The key is C# major, and the mode is major.

Perhaps mention that the chords are mostly in C# major with some first inversions.

But I think it's straightforward.

Based on the chord progression provided:

- `C#` (I)
- `A#m/C#` (vi⁶, first inversion)
- `A#m/C#` (vi⁶)
- `C#` (I)
- `C#` (I)
- `Fm/C` (iii⁶, first inversion of E♯m, enharmonic to Fm in C♯ major)
- `D#m/C#` (ii⁶, first inversion)
- `C#` (I)
- `C#` (I)
- `A#m/C#` (vi⁶)
- `A#m/C#` (vi⁶)
- `C#` (I)
- `C#` (I)
- `G#7/C` (V⁶⁄₅, first inversion of V⁷)
- `C#` (I)

The progression consistently centers around `C#` as the tonic, with dominant `G#7` resolving to `C#`, and all chords fit within the C♯ major scale (C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯). The use of first inversions (e.g., `A#m/C#`, `D#m/C#`) emphasizes `C#` in the bass, reinforcing the tonic.

**Key:** `C# major`  
**Mode:** `Major` (Ionian)

**Assistant - DeepSeek V3.2**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. List the chords and note their roots**

The progression is:

C#  A#m/C#  A#m/C#  C#  C#  Fm/C  D#m/C#  C#  C#  A#m/C#  A#m/C#  C#  C#  G#7/C  C#

The slash chords are mostly just inversions or bass notes, so let’s identify the actual chord names:

- C# = C# major
- A#m/C# = A# minor with C# bass → still A#m chord
- Fm/C = F minor with C bass → still Fm chord
- D#m/C# = D# minor with C# bass → still D#m chord
- G#7/C = G#7 with C bass → still G#7 chord

So the chord roots are: C#, A#m, A#m, C#, C#, Fm, D#m, C#, C#, A#m, A#m, C#, C#, G#7, C#

---

**2. Identify the scale degrees**

Let’s test the key of **C# major** first:

C# major scale: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#

- C# = I
- A#m = vi
- Fm = ? F minor = F Ab C → in C# major, F is F♮, not F# → not diatonic
- D#m = ii (D# F# A#) → yes, D#m is ii in C# major
- G#7 = V7 (G# B# D# F#) → yes, V7 in C# major

So Fm is the odd one: Fm = F Ab C. In C# major, the F is F# and the A is A#, so F Ab C is F–Ab–C = F minor, which is **bIII** from C# major? No, bIII in C# major would be E major (E G# B). Let’s check: Fm = F Ab C. Relative to C# major: F = F♮ (not in scale), Ab = G# (in scale), C = B# (in scale). Actually, F and C are both lowered a half step from F# and B#. So Fm is F–Ab–C = F–G#–B# enharmonically? No, B# = C, so F–G#–C is not a minor triad. Wait, Fm = F Ab C. Ab = G#, C = B#. So F–G#–B# is F augmented, not F minor. So Fm is F–Ab–C, Ab is G# in C# major, but C is not B# (B# is C natural? No, B# is C on piano but in equal temperament yes, but in notation B# ≠ C? Actually B# = C natural in 12-TET, but in C# major scale, the 7th note is B# (sounds like C), so C natural is not in the scale. So Fm contains C natural, which is not in C# major (B# is the leading tone). So Fm is foreign to C# major.

So maybe the key is **C# minor**?

C# natural minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

- C# major? In minor key, i = C#m, but here C# is major → could be C# major as tonic in a minor key? That’s rare. Usually in minor keys, i is minor, but sometimes pieces end on major tonic (Picardy third). But starting and having many C# major chords suggests maybe not C# minor.

Let’s check C# harmonic minor: C# D# E F# G# A B#

Chords:
- C# major in C# harmonic minor? No, C# major = C# E# G#; in C# harmonic minor, the third is E natural, so C# major would need E# (F natural) which is not in harmonic minor except as part of V/iv etc. So C# major is not in C# minor scales.

So C# major as tonic means key is C# major, but Fm is borrowed.

---

**3. Borrowed chord analysis**

In C# major, Fm = iv from C# minor (parallel minor borrowing). Yes: C# minor has F#m; wait, C# minor’s iv = F#m, not Fm. Fm would be F–Ab–C = in C# minor, that’s bVI? Let’s map C# minor natural: C# D# E F# G# A B. Fm: F Ab C = F–G#–B#? No, Ab = G#, C = B#? No, B# is C, so F–G#–C is F augmented. I’m confusing myself.

Let’s use enharmonic equivalence: C# major = Db major for easier reading.

Db major scale: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C

Chords in Db major:
- Db = I
- Bbm = vi (Bb Db F)
- Gb = IV (Gb Bb Db)
- Ebm = ii (Eb Gb Bb)
- Ab7 = V7 (Ab C Eb Gb)

Now Fm in Db major: Fm = F Ab C. In Db major, F is the major III? No, III in Db major is F major (F A C). F minor (F Ab C) has Ab from scale but C natural? In Db major, C is natural (C). Yes! Db major has C natural. So F–Ab–C = F Ab C = F minor. Is Fm in Db major? Let’s check: F is the 3rd degree of Db major (F major chord diatonically). F minor would be F Ab C: Ab is in Db major, C is in Db major, F is in Db major. So F–Ab–C = F minor = iii chord in Db major? Wait, iii in Db major is Fm (F Ab C) indeed! Yes! So Fm is the diatonic iii chord in Db major.

So in Db major:
- Db = I
- Bbm = vi
- Ebm = ii
- Ab7 = V7
- Fm = iii

Everything fits diatonically in Db major.

---

**4. Check the progression in Db major**

Original in C# = Db:

Progression:  
I – vi – vi – I – I – iii – ii – I – I – vi – vi – I – I – V7 – I

That’s a very standard diatonic progression in **Db major**.

---

**5. Conclusion**

The key is **Db major** (enharmonic to C# major), and the mode is **major**.

---

**Final answer:**  
**Key: Db major (or C# major)**  
**Mode: Major**

**Assistant - GLM 4.6 Thinking**

### Reasoning

1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user has provided a chord progression and wants to know the key and mode. The progression is: `C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# Fm/C D#m/C# C# C# A#m/C# A#m/C# C# C# G#7/C C#`.

2.  **Initial Simplification:** The first thing I notice is the recurring bass note `/C#` and `/C`. This is a strong clue. Let's simplify the chords by looking at the basic triads, ignoring the bass notes for a moment, but keeping them in mind as they are very important.

    *   `C#` -> C# major
    *   `A#m` -> A# minor
    *   `Fm` -> F minor
    *   `D#m` -> D# minor
    *   `G#7` -> G# dominant 7th

3.  **Identify Potential Keys:** I need to find a key that contains most of these chords. Let's list the notes in some likely keys.

    *   **Key of C# Major:**
        *   Scale: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#
        *   Diatonic Chords:
            *   I: C# major (Present)
            *   ii: D# minor (Present)
            *   iii: E# minor (Not present, but enharmonically F minor)
            *   IV: F# major (Not present)
            *   V: G# major (Present as G#7, which is the V7 chord)
            *   vi: A# minor (Present)
            *   vii°: B# diminished (Not present)

    *   **Key of A# Minor (natural):**
        *   Scale: A# B# C# D# E# F# G#
        *   Diatonic Chords:
            *   i: A# minor (Present)
            *   ii°: B# diminished (Not present)
            *   III: C# major (Present)
            *   iv: D# minor (Present)
            *   v: E# minor (Not present, enharmonically F minor)
            *   VI: F# major (Not present)
            *   VII: G# major (Present as G#7)

    *   **Key of F# Minor:**
        *   Scale: F# G# A# B C# D# E#
        *   Diatonic Chords:
            *   i: F# minor (Not present)
            *   ii°: G# diminished (Not present)
            *   III: A# major (Not present)
            *   iv: B minor (Not present)
            *   v: C# minor (Not present)
            *   VI: D# major (Not present)
            *   VII: E# major (Not present)
        *   This key is a poor fit.

4.  **Evaluate the Candidates (C# Major vs. A# Minor):**

    *   **C# Major:** The chords C# (I), D#m (ii), A#m (vi), and G#7 (V7) are all diatonic or functionally diatonic to C# major. The Fm is the odd one out. Fm is not diatonic to C# major. The diatonic chord is F# major (IV). Fm is a *borrowed chord* from the parallel minor key, C# minor. In C# minor, the iv chord is F#m, but the *minor subdominant* is often expressed as Fm, borrowing from the *phrygian dominant* or just as a chromaticism. Let's re-examine Fm. The notes are F, Ab, C. In C# major, these are F (bb4), G# (b5), C#. It's a tritone substitution for G#7 (V7). The notes of G#7 are G#, B#, D#, F#. The notes of Fm are F, Ab, C. The relationship isn't a direct tritone sub. Let's look at it another way. Fm is the iv chord of C# minor. So it's a borrowed chord (iv from C# minor) in the key of C# major. This is a very common device ("modal interchange").

    *   **A# Minor:** The chords C# (III), A#m (i), D#m (iv), and G# (VII) are all diatonic to A# minor. The G#7 is also very common in a minor key, as the V7 chord that leads back to the tonic (A#m). The C# chord feels very strong and repetitive, though.

5.  **Focus on the Bass Notes and Phrasing:** This is the crucial step. The user didn't just give `C#`, they gave `C#`, `A#m/C#`, `Fm/C`, `D#m/C#`, `G#7/C`.

    *   The bass note is almost constantly C or C#.
    *   `C#` chord with C# in the bass is a solid root position chord.
    *   `A#m/C#` is an A# minor triad (A#, C#, E#) over a C# bass. This is the first inversion of A#m, or more simply, it functions as a C# major 7th chord with a flat 9th and a natural 9th (A# = Bb, E# = F). Let's spell it out: C# (root), E# (major 3rd), G# (perfect 5th), A# (minor 7th), B# (major 9th). Wait, that's not right. The chord is A#-C#-E#. Over C#. The notes are C# (root), E# (major 3rd), and A# (minor 6th). This is `C#m6b5` or a very tense sound. Let's reconsider. Maybe it's simpler.
    *   A#m/C# is just the first inversion of A#m. In the context of a C# tonal center, it creates a strong pull. It feels like `vi/I` in the key of C# major. The bass is static on the tonic (C#), which strongly reinforces C# as the key center.
    *   `Fm/C`: The notes are F-Ab-C over a C bass. This is a simple F minor chord in first inversion. But the C bass makes it feel like a `C` something. The notes are C (root), F (perfect 4th), Ab (minor 6th). This is a `Csus4b6` or `Fm/C`. It's a chord built on the 4th degree of C# major (F#), but it's minor and chromatic.
    *   `D#m/C#`: The notes are D#-F#-A# over a C# bass. This is a D# minor chord in first inversion. But over the C# bass, it sounds like a `C#maj7#9` or `C#maj7addb9`. Let's analyze: C# (root), F# (perfect 5th), A# (major 7th), D# (major 3rd). Wait, D# is the major 3rd of B. Let's re-spell. The notes are C# (root), D# (major 2nd/9th), F# (perfect 5th), A# (major 7th). So it's a `C#maj9` chord with no 3rd. `C#(9)`. Or `C# Lydian` sound (`C# F#`).
    *   `G#7/C`: The notes are G#-B#-D#-F over a C bass. This is a G#7 chord with a C in the bass. This is a very strong `V7/I` relationship in the key of C# major. The C in the bass is a `b13` or `#5` alteration on the G#7 chord, making it a `G#7b13/C`. This is a classic, jazzy way to approach the I chord (C#). The `b13` (C) resolves down by a half step to the B# (the 3rd of the C# chord).

6.  **Synthesize the Findings:**

    *   **Tonal Center:** The overwhelming evidence points to C# as the tonal center. The progression starts and ends on C#, and the bass line is heavily centered on C and C#.
    *   **Key:** The chords C# (I), D#m (ii), A#m (vi), and G#7 (V7) are all primary diatonic chords in the key of C# major.
    *   **Mode/Analysis:**
        *   The progression is built on a static pedal point (C# or its enharmonic equivalent, Db). This is a modern, pop, or film scoring technique.
        *   The chords `A#m/C#`, `Fm/C`, and `D#m/C#` are complex "slash chords" that create rich harmonic textures over the static bass.
        *   `A#m/C#` functions as a `vi/I` progression, but with the bass held. It creates a `C#m6b5` sound, which is very tense and wants to resolve.
        *   `Fm/C` is the most telling chord for the mode. It's a `iv` chord borrowed from the parallel minor key (C# minor) into the context of C# major. This technique is called **modal interchange** or **borrowed chords**. It gives the major key a melancholic, dramatic, or "minor-ish" flavor without actually changing the tonal center.
        *   `D#m/C#` functions like a `C#maj9` (no 3rd), reinforcing the major tonality.
        *   `G#7/C` is a `V7` chord with a `b13` alteration (`C`), which resolves beautifully to the tonic C#.

7.  **Final Conclusion:**

    *   **Key:** C# Major.
    *   **Mode:** It's not strictly a traditional church mode (like Dorian, Phrygian, etc.). It's best described as **C# Major using modal interchange**. The use of the borrowed `Fm` (iv from C# minor) is the defining characteristic. One could argue it has a "C# Major with a minor iv feel" or a "C# Lydian" feel due to the D#m/C# chord (`C# F#`), but the dominant function of G#7 resolving to C# firmly establishes it as being in the major key system, not Lydian (which would have a `Vmajor` chord, `G#maj7`, not a dominant `G#7`).
    *   Therefore, the most accurate description is **C# Major**, noting the prominent use of a borrowed minor subdominant chord (`Fm`) and slash chords over a C# pedal point. This is a common sound in modern pop, R&B, and film music.

8.  **Structure the Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear, direct answer: The key is C# Major.
    *   Explain the evidence: The tonic (C#), the dominant (G#7), and other diatonic chords (A#m, D#m).
    *   Address the "mode" part. Explain that it's not a traditional mode, but C# Major with specific harmonic techniques.
    *   Break down the interesting chords (`Fm/C`, `A#m/C#`, etc.) and explain their function. Introduce the term "modal interchange" for the `Fm` chord.
    *   Explain the role of the static C# bass note (pedal point).
    *   Provide a summary of the harmonic journey and the overall "feel" (dramatic, melancholic, modern).
    *   Offer a simpler, more concise summary at the end.


Based on the chord progression provided, the key is **C# Major**.

While the progression uses some sophisticated and colorful chords, the fundamental structure points strongly to C# Major as the tonal center. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:

### 1. The Tonal Center is C#

*   **Starts and Ends on C#:** The progression begins and concludes with a C# chord, which strongly establishes it as the "home" chord or tonic.
*   **Static Bass Note:** The bass note is almost constantly C or its enharmonic equivalent, C#. This creates a **pedal point**, a technique that powerfully reinforces C# as the tonal foundation, even as the harmonies change above it.

### 2. Diatonic Chords of C# Major

Let's look at the core chords in the key of C# Major (C# - D# - E# - F# - G# - A# - B#):

*   **C# (I chord):** The tonic. This is our home base.
*   **A#m (vi chord):** The submediant. This is a standard diatonic chord.
*   **D#m (ii chord):** The supertonic. Also a standard diatonic chord.
*   **G#7 (V7 chord):** The dominant seventh. This is the most crucial chord for establishing the key. The `G#7` chord creates a powerful tension that has a strong tendency to resolve back to the `C#` tonic chord. Its presence solidifies C# Major as the key.

### 3. The "Mode" and Non-Diatonic Chords

The progression isn't a simple diatonic one. Its character comes from the use of borrowed chords and slash chords. This is where the "mode" question is answered.

The most important non-diatonic chord is **Fm/C**.

*   In the key of C# Major, the subdominant chord is F# Major (IV).
*   The progression uses **F minor**. This chord is "borrowed" from the parallel minor key, **C# minor** (where F minor is the iv chord).

This technique is called **Modal Interchange** (or borrowed chords). It's a very common way to introduce the melancholic or dramatic color of the minor key into a major key progression without actually changing the key.

### Analysis of the Slash Chords

The slash chords (e.g., `A#m/C#`) are what create the rich, modern texture. They are all built over the C# bass pedal.

*   **A#m/C#:** This is an A# minor chord with a C# in the bass. It functions as the `vi` chord, but the static bass makes the harmony feel suspended and tense, pulling towards the resolution on C#.
*   **D#m/C#:** This is a D# minor chord with a C# in the bass. The notes (C#-D#-F#-A#) create the sound of a **C#maj9** chord (minus the 3rd, E#), reinforcing the major tonality.
*   **G#7/C:** This is the dominant chord with a C in the bass. The note C is a flat 13th (`b13`) alteration of the G#7 chord, which is a classic, jazzy sound that adds tension and resolves smoothly to the C# tonic.

---

### Conclusion

**Key:** **C# Major**

**Mode/Style:** The progression is best described as **C# Major using modal interchange**.

It has a modern, dramatic, and slightly melancholic feel, characteristic of pop, R&B, or film score music. The foundation is clearly major (due to the C# tonic and G#7 dominant), but the borrowed **Fm** chord adds significant color and emotional depth.
