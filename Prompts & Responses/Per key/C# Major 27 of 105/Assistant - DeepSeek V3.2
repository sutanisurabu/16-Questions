Let’s break this down step by step.

---

**1. List the chords and note their roots**

The progression is:

C#  A#m/C#  A#m/C#  C#  C#  Fm/C  D#m/C#  C#  C#  A#m/C#  A#m/C#  C#  C#  G#7/C  C#

The slash chords are mostly just inversions or bass notes, so let’s identify the actual chord names:

- C# = C# major
- A#m/C# = A# minor with C# bass → still A#m chord
- Fm/C = F minor with C bass → still Fm chord
- D#m/C# = D# minor with C# bass → still D#m chord
- G#7/C = G#7 with C bass → still G#7 chord

So the chord roots are: C#, A#m, A#m, C#, C#, Fm, D#m, C#, C#, A#m, A#m, C#, C#, G#7, C#

**2. Identify the scale degrees**

Let’s test the key of **C# major** first:

C# major scale: C# D# E# F# G# A# B#

- C# = I
- A#m = vi
- Fm = ? F minor = F Ab C → in C# major, F is F♮, not F# → not diatonic
- D#m = ii (D# F# A#) → yes, D#m is ii in C# major
- G#7 = V7 (G# B# D# F#) → yes, V7 in C# major

So Fm is the odd one: Fm = F Ab C. In C# major, the F is F# and the A is A#, so F Ab C is F–Ab–C = F minor, which is **bIII** from C# major? No, bIII in C# major would be E major (E G# B). Let’s check: Fm = F Ab C. Relative to C# major: F = F♮ (not in scale), Ab = G# (in scale), C = B# (in scale). Actually, F and C are both lowered a half step from F# and B#. So Fm is F–Ab–C = F–G#–B# enharmonically? No, B# = C, so F–G#–C is not a minor triad. Wait, Fm = F Ab C. Ab = G#, C = B#. So F–G#–B# is F augmented, not F minor. So Fm is F–Ab–C, Ab is G# in C# major, but C is not B# (B# is C natural? No, B# is C on piano but in equal temperament yes, but in notation B# ≠ C? Actually B# = C natural in 12-TET, but in C# major scale, the 7th note is B# (sounds like C), so C natural is not in the scale. So Fm contains C natural, which is not in C# major (B# is the leading tone). So Fm is foreign to C# major.

So maybe the key is **C# minor**?

C# natural minor: C# D# E F# G# A B

- C# major? In minor key, i = C#m, but here C# is major → could be C# major as tonic in a minor key? That’s rare. Usually in minor keys, i is minor, but sometimes pieces end on major tonic (Picardy third). But starting and having many C# major chords suggests maybe not C# minor.

Let’s check C# harmonic minor: C# D# E F# G# A B#

Chords:
- C# major in C# harmonic minor? No, C# major = C# E# G#; in C# harmonic minor, the third is E natural, so C# major would need E# (F natural) which is not in harmonic minor except as part of V/iv etc. So C# major is not in C# minor scales.

So C# major as tonic means key is C# major, but Fm is borrowed.

**3. Borrowed chord analysis**

In C# major, Fm = iv from C# minor (parallel minor borrowing). Yes: C# minor has F#m; wait, C# minor’s iv = F#m, not Fm. Fm would be F–Ab–C = in C# minor, that’s bVI? Let’s map C# minor natural: C# D# E F# G# A B. Fm: F Ab C = F–G#–B#? No, Ab = G#, C = B#? No, B# is C, so F–G#–C is F augmented. I’m confusing myself.

Let’s use enharmonic equivalence: C# major = Db major for easier reading.

Db major scale: Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C

Chords in Db major:
- Db = I
- Bbm = vi (Bb Db F)
- Gb = IV (Gb Bb Db)
- Ebm = ii (Eb Gb Bb)
- Ab7 = V7 (Ab C Eb Gb)

Now Fm in Db major: Fm = F Ab C. In Db major, F is the major III? No, III in Db major is F major (F A C). F minor (F Ab C) has Ab from scale but C natural? In Db major, C is natural (C). Yes! Db major has C natural. So F–Ab–C = F Ab C = F minor. Is Fm in Db major? Let’s check: F is the 3rd degree of Db major (F major chord diatonically). F minor would be F Ab C: Ab is in Db major, C is in Db major, F is in Db major. So F–Ab–C = F minor = iii chord in Db major? Wait, iii in Db major is Fm (F Ab C) indeed! Yes! So Fm is the diatonic iii chord in Db major.

So in Db major:
- Db = I
- Bbm = vi
- Ebm = ii
- Ab7 = V7
- Fm = iii

Everything fits diatonically in Db major.

**4. Check the progression in Db major**

Original in C# = Db:

Progression:  
I – vi – vi – I – I – iii – ii – I – I – vi – vi – I – I – V7 – I

That’s a very standard diatonic progression in **Db major**.

---

**5. Conclusion**

The key is **Db major** (enharmonic to C# major), and the mode is **major**.

**Final answer:**  
**Key: Db major (or C# major)**  
**Mode: Major**
