### Key and Mode Analysis

- **Key**: C# major  
- **Mode**: Ionian (major mode)  

#### Explanation
This chord progression is diatonic to the C# major scale (C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#). Here's a breakdown:

- **Chords and Roman Numerals** (ignoring bass notes for core harmony, but slashes indicate pedal-like bass on C# for color):
  - C# = I (tonic)
  - A#m/C# = vi (A# minor over C# bass)
  - Fm/C = iii (F minor over C# bass; enharmonically E# minor in C# major)
  - D#m/C# = ii (D# minor over C# bass)
  - G#7/C = V7 (G# dominant 7th over C# bass)

- **Why C# major?**
  - All root chords (C#, A#m, Fm, D#m, G#7) fit perfectly as I, ii, iii, vi, and V7 in C# major.
  - No accidentals or borrowed chords from parallel modes (e.g., no flats suggesting C# minor or other keys like A# minor).
  - The frequent C# bass creates a pedal point on the tonic, common in major-key contexts for resolution and stability.
  - This structure resembles jazz standards or pop ballads (e.g., pedal-tonic variations), reinforcing the major tonality.

- **Why Ionian mode?**
  - Ionian is the "natural" major scale mode, matching the diatonic harmony here (full major scale without modal alterations like Dorian's ♭3 or Mixolydian's ♭7 beyond the V7, which is standard).

If this is from a specific song or you have more context (e.g., melody), it could refine the analysis further!
