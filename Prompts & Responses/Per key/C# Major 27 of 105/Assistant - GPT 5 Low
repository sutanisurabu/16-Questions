### Reasoning

**Analyzing chord sequence**

I’m trying to determine the key and mode from a specific chord sequence. It appears like there's a bass pedal on C#. The chords include both C# major and A# minor over a C# bass, which makes me think we're in the key of C# major. A#m/C# functions as the vi chord in first inversion. Then there’s Fm/C, which is an F minor triad with its root notes matching the bass. This analysis helps clarify the overall harmonic structure!**Exploring key context**

So, I'm looking at the chord Fm/C over a C natural bass, which feels a bit off in a C# major context since C natural clashes with C#. I wonder if this could suggest a Roman numeral in Eb major? Then there's the D#m/C# chord, which is the ii chord in C# major. As for the G#7/C chord over C natural, it presents clashing notes, particularly the B# instead of a C. Overall, it raises questions about the harmonic context!**Clarifying chord relationships**

I'm analyzing the chords I've seen: C# major (C# E# G#), A# minor (A# C# E#), D# minor (D# F# A#), and G#7 (G# B# D# F#). Those correspond nicely to the Roman numerals I, vi, ii, and V7 in C# major. However, the presence of Fm/C creates some confusion since F minor isn't diatonic to C# major. I wonder if they may have meant E# minor/C#, which would fit better as the iii chord when adjusted for enharmonics.**Investigating bass and chords**

I'm diving into the specifics of the E# minor in first and second inversions, noting that E#m/C# seems non-standard since it has G# or B# in the bass instead. I wonder if Fm/C might actually represent Fm/C# but just missed the sharp. However, the usage of C natural in other chords makes me question if they were using it as shorthand. This is a bit puzzling, as I usually see C# being used. I should also evaluate the possibility of a different key context!**Determining key and mode**

I'm working to figure out the key and mode based on the chords in the sequence, which primarily centers around C# major. The bass alternates between C# and C natural, implying a neighbor tone approach. The chords establish a strong relationship with C# major, including the diatonic vi (A# minor), ii (D# minor), and V7 (G#7). While there could be some argument for Db major due to enharmonics, I'll conclude confidently that the key is C# major in the Ionian mode. Key: C# major (Ionian).

C# major (Ionian).
